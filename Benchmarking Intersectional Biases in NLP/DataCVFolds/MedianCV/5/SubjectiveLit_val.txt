Good health is a high priority.
-1	"I am a relatively intelligent person so I'm confident in my ability to process information in general. The problem arises when medical terminology is used and not explained. This is particularly true of lab tests where I may be told ""X is high"", but not told why that is or what that means for my overall health. I have a chronic health condition that I had to read the medical literature on myself because doctors never explained things. "
1	I feel that to a great extent I can mage everything in order to understand health info. I ask necessary questions, and pay close attention to any information either written or stated. I have no issues at all.

-1	I have the capacity to understand what is told to me, though i usually need some things explained a little better, like definitions of some terms used.

Makes you not want to ask the question because ohh this person doesnt know what ""dnkfnepehdnlopidkodnghineocian"" means. Why are you wasting my time if you dont know that. If I cant pronounce or read the word then I am not going to ask about it at the office."

-1	I know I have the capacity to understand and retain most information fed to me by doctors and nurses.  I do ask the questions I need to ask but sometimes they don't have the time to answer them.  If I need more answers, I go look up the questions I have and write down items for my next visit.

-1	Well, I'm not mentally disabled. I therefore *can* do it. I don't sometimes understand medical terminology, which for some reason medical personnel seem wont to use when speaking to non-medical personnel, and often I can't be bothered to have a conversation about it.

I put my trust in them that they have my health and well being in their best interest but sometimes I wonder, especially with the billing they are going to send to my health insurance career, it might be a time where they want to add some dollars in their pocket.

1	"I have no problem understanding health information that is given to me.  The problem is when doctors are more concerned with a ""treat and street"" philosophy merely going through the motions to check off boxes for insurance companies than actually LISTENING to patients and taking the time to ask the questions that need to be answered in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.  Patients often do not know that a symptom is just that so when a doctor fails to asks the right questions there will likely not be an accurate diagnosis.  Another issue is when a doctor blatantly ignores my questions.  How many ways to I have to ask the most basic question of what does this diagnosis mean?  More often than not it's just easier to go home and search webmd or the Mayo Clinic website.  Problem with that is I generally end up with even more unanswered questions.  Ultimately I am quite capable of understanding information when it is provided and if my questions are answered with more than a couple of words.  (The correct answer to ""what does the thyroid do?"" is NOT ""Pep"" and after a look of disbelief ""You know, energy"")"
1	I believe I have the full capacity. I've never had problems before.

1	I can almost always understand and remember what a doctor or nurse tells me. I understand all basic medical terminology as well as some more advanced terms.
-1	I think that in general I am able to get the help that I need in understanding health information and services. At the hospitals that I go to, quite often the information that the doctor conveys is backed up by written reading material. My main trouble comes with pharmacy medications. It is not always clear how to go about taking it - for example, suppose I want to switch from taking something in the evening to taking it in the morning, can I do that? Additionally,  suppose I suspect something is a side effect of pill X, then i hate going online to figure it out because its just not the same as seeing a doctor. 
-1	I really do not, it's usually above my head.  Sometimes, the doctors explanation is clear while other times is over my head. Alot of times u am just trying to get it off the office so I disregard a lot of the information they are telling me. Other times when it's very serious, I try to get all the information that i can or that is available. At those times it is important to get all the info I can.

-1	Yes I feel I understand what the doctor's tell me enough to get by. If not I look up the information on the internet and read about it.

1	there is nothing wrong with my brain. I can read, listen and understand as good as ever. if I have a question I ask it.
-1	I feel like I have a fairly average capacity to process and understand basic health information as long as it doesn't get too technical about the medicinal or diagnostic aspect of it. I do feel fairly confident in my ability to make decisions based on this information. I feel more hesitant about my ability to obtain such information, as due to anxiety I find it difficult to ask relevant questions in real time. 
-1	I think I can easily fill out the health forms but it's difficult finding a doctor that is covered by insurance and affordable to get the answers needed, so I always feel like I am doing the bare minimum to maintain rather than actually getting help.
-1	I feel that I have the capacity almost entirely. Everythime I have gone to the Doctor I have left feeling confident that I understood what was going on.
1	I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services given to me by a health physician because I listen and I ask questions about things I don't understand so that I can understand them.

1	I can understand mostly everything and am capable of making my own health decisions. I have a good grasp of the English language and good communication skills.
-1	i have to ask the doctors a few questions. the service that i normally get it always great services. my nurse that i go to also help me with all the questions that i have for them. they would tell me what i need to eat right and drink.

-1	I feel absolutely competent in understanding and processing basic health information to make decisions about my health. However, finding or obtaining information that will truly be helpful to my health is difficult. Intense research is often necessary for basic information.

-1	I feel that I have the ability to make most of the basic common health information and services that I may need. Outside of that, I think depending on the issue it would be much more difficult to obtain what I needed by myself. 
-1	Confident. I feel confident in making my health decisions. I'm still fairly young and healthy. I know yo ask questions when something is important. I forget information, but I know what to do and say to function and survive. 
1	I have been in and out of the hospital since my 20s. I have had cancer twice and other problems that has made me aware of many things in the medical field. 
-1	Not well enough. Need better information. More visitations and help. More written easy steps for adults and children....
1	I think that for the most part i understand what the doctor tells me concerning information about my health, sometimes if something is written down it could be hard to understand because of the hand writing and then i would ask  to explain to me what is written.  
-1	well i fell as i know myself better than others so that why i could fill out medicail papers with no problem
-1	I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions based on my own health curiosity and a detailed family tree of health issues. 
1	I feel pretty confident, but mostly because I have done my own research. Honestly doctors seem to fly through visits any more. Over scheduled and over worked. I don't blame them, I know it is but a clog in the system. 
-1	I feel like I do.  I just don't understand some of the terms the doctors/nurses use.  I understand most of what they are saying. It when you are at the doctor you're (at least I am) a little scared so your brain doesn't process like normal. 
1	I believe I can acquire all available information about making a health decision, and then evaluate and understand  that information in a way that leads to the best possible decision.
-1	I believe I have the willingness to learn all that I need to about my health and any appropriate measures that I could take to address any health issue I have. I'm willing to dig into details and be thorough about it.
1	Yes I think I could do that with out help and I have been doing it in the past I never had any problem before.

-1	Being in the medical system can be difficult and confusing. There are quite a lot of forms to fill out and its difficult when you are sick. I feel like i need more resources and information in order to make the appropriate decisions with my healthcare. The standards of care vary and some medical professionals recommend things that others do not.
-1	I feel I have a pretty good capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I would say I am confident in this area about 85% of the time. Sometimes I need some assistance from other health care workers or more information before making a decision. Usually, in these cases, I am able to get the help I need.
1	im young and i have the patience and the knowledge to be able to deal with anything medical related 
1	I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information which is explained by my doctor or in basic medical reports.  I am unable to understand test results that have shorthand, acronyms etc. that are specific to the medical field.  I do, however ask my doctor to explain any test results or language that I do not undferstand.
-1	I have a strong capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health info. I am well read, and 9 times out of 10 can understand fairly complex ideas.

-1	I think I can understand the information well enough to get by but there are times I don't understand what doctors verbally explain to me. I'm not great at asking for clarification either.

1	I have full capacity to understand and make appropriate decisions about health information and services
-1	I feel like I have an above average understanding of medical terms and technology, although I'm not in med school or anything.  I feel that a lot of the information available assumes that we are doctors and isn't really put into terms that the typical person can understand.  Some information is missing too, like how nasal steroids can cause dependence and shouldn't be used for more than a week or two.  These spurts of missing information can lead to very misinformed decisions.  I feel like the medical community could provide better resources.

1	I ask a lot of questions when I visit my doctor and have follow up questions if I don't understand his answer.
-1	While I am reasonably confident in my abilities to understand, there are times when doctors and health care professionals speak with too much complicated jargon. It is helpful to have someone with me to ask the questions that I don't even know I should be asking.
1	I am a person who constantly reads and wants to learn things that I do not already know. I do not have a problem with asking someone to explain something I do not know so I can understand.

-1	I feel I know just as much as the regular ordiry person does in regard to medical questions, and paperwork. I know sometimes questions aren't asked due to worrying about feeling dumb about something.

1	I feel that I do have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health info and services that are needed for the right health decisions. I do feel that some of the answers given to me by doctors is very ambiguous and vague. I feel it's becoming more and more difficult to get a definitive answer and treatment plan by many doctors. In this way, I do find it difficult, because there seems to be a lack of concern in what I'm asking about in certain situations. I often have to rely on doing a lot of research myself, which can be difficult when trying to discern certain medical journals.

1	In general I feel that I can understand everything the doctors tells me about my health. At times when it comes to my husband's health conditions it is more complicated so I do ask my son to accompany us to the doctor to make sure that I do not miss anything that I need to know. I think as I get older sometimes doctors treat us differently like they do not have faith in us understanding them and that gives me doubt at times even though I do everything I need to do in my life without any problems. But as far as basic health instructions and decisions I feel very confident at this point with regards to my health. My husband on the other hand hates going to the doctor and turns his doctor off without listening to anything he says because he does not want to hear and doesn't believe most of it.

However, If I have any doubts, and certainly before I make any major decisions such as possible surgery, I always consult my oldest daughter, and if necessary, my other children as well. 
1	I am only 58 years old and not senile. I ran my own business for 10 years so I am not uneducated. I understand medical terminology quite well and have been a caregiver for my disabled husband for 25 years so I am familiar with all kinds of medical jargon. If I do not understand something, I ask the dr. I go online to look up things if I feel the need to. Regardless of what any doctor says, I know my own body so I often know what is best for it.

Then, if there is some question specific to only my situation, I can ask my doctor and receive a suitable response in a timely fashion.  
-1	I believe in understanding documents and filling out forms I find it easy to process and understand.

1	Because of my extensive experience in the field of medical transcription and the need to understand what I am typing makes sense, as well as conversations with my doctor and my children's doctor, I feel very capable of obtaining, process, and understand the health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	Absolutely confident I can get information needed to do so.  Online resources and people will serve as primary go-tos.
1	I am able to go online to my physcians's portal and read my chart. I can ask for refills for my prescriptions and have them call it in. I can see all my Lab tests and what the doctor  and I talked about.
1	I feel that between asking questions and finding someone to help me understand information, I have the ability to make appropriate health decisions. If I am not sure about something I will ask my doctor or nurse and search for all the information needed to make a good decision.
-1	I am of sound body and mind right now so I don't need help supplying basic health information.  There are periods that sometimes my mind draw a blank and I might need just a little push in the right direction.
1	I believe I am completely capable of doing everything necessary in understanding health information and making decisions based on that information.  Any questions I've had for medical providers has been easily answered and explained.
-1	I think I can process health information well because I listen to my doctor or nurse. I have the knowledge to look up and remember what I should do in certain medical situations.
-1	I feel that I do to a high degree with the help of a doctor and a parent. I would trust the advice of my doctor over my own opinions or beliefs since they are trained to help us medically.
-1	I am able to fully understand everything.  Don't need help to understand medical information.  I pretty much understand these things.
-1	I feel like I can understand the information given to my by healthcare professionals, however, I still find it nerve-wrecking to ask all the questions that I need.  Sometimes I feel like the physician is in a rush to get to the next patient and thus, I feel like I'm being a burden by asking too many questions.  The physician seems unwilling to truly find out the source of my issues.
1	I do not have any problems at all in regards to understanding any health concerns, or anything that goes along with it. I have worked as an LPN for almost 25 years and am quite knowledgeable about health care.,
1	I feel very confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	"I am about 95% proficient at processing the information needed. This is in part due to ... sorry ... being intelligent, my family history to see trends and what happens when you don't treat illnesses, and knowing that ""if you don't understand, ask, instead of walking out."" "
-1	Most of the time I feel like doctors and nurses are too rushed and I don't want to bother them with things that they seem to think I should already know. Many test results are too complicated to understand anyway and I feel like I could just look them up later instead of wasting their time. 
1	I feel I understand everything I'm asked when i'm  talking to my doctor. When my doctor ask questions i fully understand with I'm asked. 
-1	I think I have the the capacity to understand basic health information, but sometimes I don't think of the right questions to ask until I'm home and I realize I should have asked more questions while I was there.  Then it's too late and I search the web for information which is maybe not as good as getting information specific to my needs from my doctor.
1	As long as they don't use technobable only understandable by nurses and doctors I don't have problems understanding what is told to me (or read about it). The problem is (for me) to get them to give me the information (that seems to be something they don't want to give).
1	I have the knowledge to understand things that medically going on with me or around me and if it's something I do not understand I have the knowledge to ask questions
-1	I received an Associates degree in Pre Nursing, so I have an above average understanding of medical terms. Also I read a lot of medical magazines mainly my moms as she is a nurse and receives many scholarly nursing magazines. Another reason is because the medical field is my biggest interest and I love to learn about it whether it be medical conditions or any other related content.  
1	I feel pretty confident in my ability to perform these tasks. If I have any doubts, I always make sure I get the information straight before I leave the office. 
-1	I think I have the capacity to understand things when they are explained to me.  Knowing the relevant information is another thing altogether.  Sometimes I don't know which questions to ask.  I put my faith in the professiols and hope for the best, although I wish I had more control/knowledge of the situation.  
-1	I understand the disease I am diagnosed with and I make the doctor explain it the I will understand so that I don't get confused.
-1	I feel like as long I knew the definition of basic medical terminology than I would be able to understand somewhat. It would provide a good foundation of comprehension.
-1	I have general familiarity of general, basic medical terms, however, I don't feel great about filling out forms. I tend to overthink them and am always concerned that I'm going to fill something out wrong, and have it negatively impact me in the future. 
1	I am knowledgeable in the terms and words used so I can answer and understand what they ask or am able to comprehend the material. The doctors and nurses usually let me know of the situation in an easy to understand fashion so I am not confused. 
1	Because of a disease I was diagnosed with over 20 years ago, I've learned a lot of terminology related to medical health.  I'm not afraid to ask my doctors questions or for thorough explations if necessary.  It's been my experience that doctors are always very willing to take the time to explain. My husband has EMT training and his knowledge helps sometimes.
-1	For the most part I feel that I do have that capacity, but it honestly depends on the doctor or nurse that I am dealing with. I feel that many doctors and nurses are so strapped for time that they are not as willing to listen to whatever questions I have, and therefore many things end up getting lost through the cracks. 
1	I have rarely, if ever, had trouble understanding medical info given to me, either in writing or verbally from my medical doctors and their staff. If I ever do have questions, or am unsure about a certain part of the information, I have always been sure to ask questions until I fully understood and felt comfortable.
-1	I am of sound mind and I can understand what I being told or what I am reading. If i don't understand what I'm being told I will ask the right questions if I don't get the answers I need I will get a second opinion.
1	I am able to understand exactly what doctors explain to me enough to make informed decisions. I am able to assist doctors in the regards to all my health issues.

-1	I am very confident to understand basic health information and services. I have a lot of experience at hospitals and doctor's offices. 
-1	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions. I also know that it's not always easy or something you can accomplish in a timely manner. Health centers and hospitals differ, as do health professionals. I have a primary care doctor who is unfortunately overworked and somewhat difficult to speak with to the extent that I need to. On the other hand, when I had a fracture almost two years ago, all the specialists I saw after I left the hospital were very forthcoming with help and information, and they listened well. Their assistants were superb. However, my experience in the ER was terrible. Really terrible, especially while being in the midst of trauma. So I feel that my capacity to obtain what I need has been very uneven.
1	I am quite confident in my capacity to obtain, process and understand this information, I am far less confident that medical professionals will give me the correct information or that they even possess the correct information in the first place.
-1	I have my daughter to help me. If I don't understand something she helps me to figure it out.  She also goes to my doctor appointments with me so I don't forget any question I needed to ask the doctor at my appointment. 
-1	When I do visit a doctor, I do feel like I understand paperwork and conversations fairly well.  However, I tend to avoid going to the doctor due to cost, and even I do visit, I may not completely follow up on certain concerns because of the potential cost involved.  This is the only regard in which I feel that I do not have the capacity to obtain health services.
-1	I feel like I am able to adequately obtain, process and understand basic health information.   Often I need to research these things but I am good at using things like the internet to research and filter the good information from the bad so even if I need to look at mutiple sources I am usually able to find a source that makes things easy to understand.
-1	I am fairly confident that I understand basic health information. I ask questions if I am not clear about something.
-1	sometimes is very diffucalt to understand about illness need to have additional infformation so go to website or google to find additional information sometimes need to have second opinion
-1	I am confident that i will understand all medical information.  I sometimes will need help in knowing what needs to happen with anything that may occur.

1	Extremely confident.  I have a basis in A&P/medical in high school/college so i understand most things.  If i don't, my doctor or nurse is always willing to further explain to me.
1	I am very capable of making my own decisions, reading and understanding information as well as obtaining and researching information pertaining to my health.
-1	I feel like I can understand a lot of things and that I have gotten better at asking questions. However, I am bad at asking questions when they are about a new topic. For example, if I made an appointment to talk about issue A, but I also have issue B, I will only talk about issue A. I also do not understand health insurance information well.
-1	"I have a curious mind so anything I may not understand I will be sure to ask my doctor to explain. I have the capacity to understand much of what I'm told. My only barrier to understanding health information is anxiety which leads me to have a tendency toward ""burring my head in the sand."""
1	I feel that I have 100% capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I am fully able to make to make the appropriate health decisions, based on any information from my doctor.

-1	More then most people. I've been doing it for years. I've been helping my dad fill out the forms for himself and my husband too
-1	I feel the for the most part I have the capacity and understanding to fully grasp what is going on. Still, there are many medical terms that I just don't understand and it's very difficult for me to know 100% what's going on.
1	I understand the health Decisions very well and they questions are very understandable ands agreeable 
-1	I have been able to make good choices so far in life.  I expect that I will continue to make good choices.  If I doubt myself, that's typically when I ask for someone else's opinion.  If I do not understand something, I typically would call my doctor for advice, or use the internet to expand my knowledge on certain subjects.
-1	I feel I am well equipped to understand my own health and information.  I feel I am better suited to tell a doctor about me than he is to tell me about myself.
1	I can do some things on my own, some others I need help with. It's not always that I could understand medical terms and instructions but I try my best. I access websites, contact my doctor, ask my family, and I just try to be patient when dealing with information.
-1	the only time i have a problem understanding what the doctor is talking about is when they diagnose me with something i've never heard of, can't pronounce, or spell, which leads me to not believe what they are saying
-1	extremely well....My doctor is a wonderful man and is a great aid in helping me to understand my health conditions
1	I have never had any difficulty reading and understanding any forms or medical situations.I research any new conditions as they arrise.
1	Most official forms are developed for the comprehension of a 9-grader and only require limited clarification related to terminology or language used that's specific to the medical community.  That said, I do not have any concerns or require assistance when processing documentation or speaking with clinicians.
-1	I mostly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services in an independent way. The only times I have difficulty with this are when I have questions about procedures, terminology, and timelines regarding certain conditions, procedures, etc. The ability to make appropriate health decisions is very important for me to be able to do. If I do have difficulty obtaining, process, or understanding any health information, I make sure to ask lots of questions and get my concerns addressed.
1	I understand basic health information very well. I also have enough intelligence to do further research if I need to/
1	I am a retired RN so I have no trouble understanding what is being said to me by my physician and I have enough background knowledge to know what questions to ask to fully understand
-1	I would say that for the most part I do have all the information, tools available to myself when I need them or need an explation of something. My current doctor is very caring and explains things well! He even tells me to ask questions at all times if I have them. When it comes to filling out a form and I do not have confidence I can always ask him or the staff for help.
-1	I have the capacity to process basic health information when it is provided. But recent experience indicates I seldom get all information such as consequences and other options, nor repercussions of all options. 
-1	I am a person that tends to read a lot about health issues. Not only do I talk to octors but I also o my own research that way I can understand at least the basics when it comes to meical terms. That way I can make better decisions.

-1	I can understand health information very confidently. I know what a lot medical terms mean 
1	English is my tive language so I understand the forms I'm filling out and the conversations I'm having with my doctors.  I'm also relatively young, and do not have dimentia or other type of mental processing blocks.

-1	Everything I Say but if anybody have a problem with me or how I do things they can find another way of doing ti
1	"I have had to learn to advocate for myself with all healthcare people and specialists. About a fourth of those people are apathetic, overworked, inattentive, abusive and/or neglectful. I realized a long time ago that they mostly guess ""conditions"" without proper testing. I have been given ""band-aid"" medicine for decades and much of that medication has caused me further harm. I will no longer take anything without further testing and more proof that it will actually improve my quality of life. "
-1	I can easily see that I am able to obtain health information from my doctor. I would be able to process the information that I was given and if I'm not able to understand it all, then I can ask the doctor to explain it more simpler.
-1	I feel as if I generally do understand everything that Is being said to me. At times though some things do get confusing and having anxiety I am sometimes scared to ask questions if I don't always understand what is being said. I feel I am very capable to make decisions without any help though. 
-1	I feel like for the most part I am able to make the appropriate decisions . If there is something that I do not understand I make sure to ask questions to fully understand it . If it is a bigger decision I take all the information I can from the doctor . I then go home and google and read as much as I can about the problem . I also talk to any and everyone who has went through the same thing . If I am still lost on what is going on I go back and talk with the doctor . If something doesn't click for me I keep asking till I fully understand it all .

1	I can comprehend and understand information for the most part, but I would ask questions for things just for clarification.
-1	Well it is all so complicated, not even just the medical information but the information needed to navigate the bureaucracy so that one can begin to have medical coverage and have things set up the right way to afford coverage. Then you have to do not only what is medical best for you based on what the doctors tell you but what works out with your work schedule and is covered by your insurance but often to find these out it is a waiting game. So you might pick one option in the hopes that you are covered but then find out later that you are not. Plus you might have to go out of work depending on what choice you pick and then you don't have a job and that makes future medical even harder. Plus I worry too about changing insurance standards because everyone seems to think that healthcare should be about making money instead of taking care of people.

-1	I am under the care of 2 to 3 doctors at any given time. At times I feel like I am being rushed and things aren't explained to me the way I need. I can fill out forms, but it seems they aren't read by the doctor. When given a diagnosis, I have to do the research to find out exactly what it means. I can say that my PCP does a better job than my other doctors in taking time to listen to me. I recently had a very bad experience with a surgeon and staff at a prominent hospital/medical facility all over forms. No one would really help me. They just passed me around to different people. I felt discarded.
-1	I have plenty of it Very cool ok yeah I like it a lot fun in the game of the house pink on the ear plain on the tail Oreo cookies
-1	Health information can be very confusing. They do not always write the information so that an average person can understand it. Many times, I have to ask what the long medical terms mean, then I feel stupid. It can get scary, causing even more questions that are hard to understand. Having the internet so handy now does help with searching, but then you find other information that is really scary. 
1	I feel fairly confident that I am able to navigate most healthcare situations in order to get the information I need.  I have rarely had any sort of complications when going to a doctor's office, pharmacy, clinic, or hospital on the occasions I have had to go.  If there is a question I have, I tend to almost always ask when I am at the doctor's.
-1	I feel like I can fill out most medical forms, with a help of some questions so I can understand exactly what they are asking, and I do not answer the wrong question the wrong way.
-1	I can get alot more information on my own.  I just struggle sometimes really knowing what is relevant in my situation there is so much info on the internet, its hard to know.  Doctors always seem in a rush and I try my best to ask all the questions in a visit but sometimes forget or think of things later
1	I have no problem asking a health professiol any questions to clarify anything I don't understand. Some Drs speak in medical terms and I often have to ask them to explain in layman's terms. My current Dr is extremely good about explaining everything and is more than willing to answer any and all questions.

1	I feel that I have good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services, and to make appropriate health decisions.  I do not have trouble processing medical information or asking questions or clarification.
-1	I lack confidence when trying to process information related to health and wellness. I find that the words and techniques are in a language that only people in the medical field can understand fully. There is a lot of technical jargon contained in the materials that average people usually cannot understand. I usually have to rely on speaking directly to my doctor or nurse to make sure that I understand what is being said. There are only a few websites that are dedicated to explaining medical terminology and even these can be complicated to understand.
1	My father was a doctor and my mother a therapist. I grew up around the medical community and I am a very intelligent person, so I feel very comfortable with this type of information. I have no difficulties with processing the information and knowing where to go to get it.
1	I completely feel that I have the knowledge needed to comprehend the information provided to me by my doctors.  The information is broken down into basic terms that can be understood by anyone who may be unfamiliar with medical terminology.
-1	When the doctor is talking to me and it's important some of the information just goes over my head for some reason. I guess because it's a lot of information to take in all at once. I am trying hard to understand everything and create a mental image. When I am processing the information I am thinking about the important things that are said. When it comes to understanding basic health information I retain the more important information and forget about the less important information causing me to ask what was said by having them repeating the less important information when I ask a question.
1	I feel confident that I will understand basic health information, and ask questions to obtain clarification or additional information.  I have had a serious health scare 8 years ago (cancer) and very much trusted my doctors and nurses to provide me with the needed information.  I felt comfortable asking questions and sharing information.  This in turn has helped me for any future health adventures I might face.

-1	I believe that often times, I am able to read and assess the situation that is provided to me in terms of my basic health information. The difficulty occurs when, if I have a health issue, and I wish to obtain further information, I don't always have the best understanding of what is then told to me. This is perhaps due to the fact that past a point, my knowledge regarding treatment and medications is lacking, and doctors do not often have the time to explain in detail exactly what certain things do. Even when they do, they do not specify side effects of treatments. As such, I am often worried about what will happen. 
1	I believe I can understand all of my health info.  I can make my own decisions with the help of my doctor by him prescribing me with the meds that I need and have to take.  My doctor and I are able to make these decisions when he lets me know symptoms that I have .

1	I am extremely confident that I can understand basic health information. I am a very open person and I have no issues with asking questions about what I don't understand.

-1	l asked the doctor to help me understand what l do not know. his will help me understand the problem
1	I have dementia but am still fairly high functioning.  I can think things through but have problems remembering so I try to go to appointments with notes that I type up in advance to make sure things don't fall through the cracks.   I can then make handwritten notes as the doctor or nurse answers the pre-typed questions.   The times I run into trouble is when I don't bring / take notes as I can easily forget some of what was said if I count on memory alone.  That is why I prefer to get written information that I can review slowly and refer back to as needed.
-1	I feel that I am very able to obtain, process, and understand health information. If I do not have pamphlets or instruction papers that come with the service or product I am receiving, I will generally easily call my doctor or perform a web search about whatever it is that I need to know.

1	I feel I have a strong capacity to understand what I am being told and the information I am given. If I do not quite understand something I will make sure I get more information from the health professional. It is my health and I don't want to be unsure about these things. I always like to ask about best courses to take, or alternate methods of treatments available. I would not want to engage in anything I don't fully understand.

-1	I do not think I have enough knowledge, confidence, or resources to understand most.
1	I believe that I have somewhat full capacity to make appointments, ask necessary questions, process basic health info, and make appropriate health decisions for myself

1	I feel that I am more than capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
-1	"Yes, because there is this thing called Google.com. Google.com is a search engine that allows anybody to have the world's knowledge at the tip of their finger. You can search for ""How to walk your dog?"" to ""How to implement brain surgery?""."

I know what to ask, where to go and how to figure out what I need to. My mom showed me how to fill out paperwork when I was younger when she would take me to the doctor and I feel quite confident relying on myself to take charge of health matters.
-1	For the most part, I feel like I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions based on the given information and external resources; however, the glut of resources available (between internet resources, studies, constant barrage of news, etc.) can make decisions more difficult. I feel this is further compounded by the general distrust of healthcare providers as of late due to news coverage, dealing with cost of services and insurance coverage, and the volume of patients versus the number of healthcare professionals to allow adequate time to get the information that one needs. These details increase the skepticism I have for specific diagnoses and treatments as it can be hard to tell if a course of action is necessary or if it is just a profit center for the doctor/hospital prescribing the treatments or diagnostics.
-1	It was a very good thing to do,I have fun do it.i do not have much to send. Well I have a good day and God bless you
1	I believe I have a well developed capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information, and to take advantage of services, where applicable, to make appropriate health decisions.  The problem for me is not one of being able to understand materials, issues, and choices, it is about making the best choice with the available information, which is sometimes lacking, ambiguous, disjointed, incomplete, or even biased and perhaps incorrect.   I frequently consult with other health professiols when forming judgments about health decisions, and almost always benefit in the long term from doing so.
1	I have the ability to read, research, ask questions and do anything else I need to understand the basic health information and services I need to satisfy my doctor and my insurance. I am not afraid to ask question. I feel I can obtain, process and understand everything I need or find a way to understand it.
-1	When it comes to processing and understanding all the health information that pertains to my own well-being, I believe I am confident in my ability to understand most of the jargon.

-1	I feel sometimes i do not ask questions and wish I had. Normally I understand the information I am told by doctors and nurses.
1	I am fully capable of gathering the necessary information for my health concerns. That being said it is very difficult to obtain this information in today from doctors and nurses.
-1	I feel I can get most of the information I need if they're brought up. I worry that I may, or the staff may forget to check or mention something that will help my health. I also worry that some of the information is too complicated to understand and the meds prescribed have side effects that are glossed over.
1	I understand info given or have the ability to ask the right questions about anything I don't understand.

-1	I feel I have the capacity to understand written and oral information from hospitals/nurses/doctors, but when they start using big word medical conditions I do ask for an explation.  I feel comfortable asking questions and I will even write down what they say so I can look it up later or make sure I have it right.
1	I feel competent when it comes to obtaining, processing, and understanding health information and I feel competent to make the appropriate decisions for me. I am quite well informed on a multitude of health information, and I spend time online doing my own research. General Practitioners are very useful, but I feel responsible for understanding my own health problems and researching them as much as I can. I have disagreed with a prognosis before and ended up being right. It pays to be vigilant.

1	I am fairly educated and can grasp a large amount of information relatively easily however some medical information is provided in such a way that A medical professional is needed to translate into layman terms.

1	Whenever I've visited any health professional in regards to my health I've always had the option to seek out any health information that's necessary. Almost every single time they have always given out a few sheets of paper with a brief explanation of everything as well as always constantly asking me questions if I have any. They always have constantly made me feel as if I have the opportunity to understand and obtain the information with relative ease. 
-1	Sometimes I feel that I do not have a sufficient understanding of medical terminology to express to a doctor the concerns or problems I am having in a way that will help them to focus their treatment. I feel that often doctors are using a trial and error method of prescribing treatment and think that much of it could be because I am not communicating to them effectively.
1	I feel that I have the background to understand what they are telling me. I have a bachelor's degree in science, I grew up surrounded by scientific people, I read medical and science-oriented articles on a regular basis.

I am young, I have no major medical issues, and my vision/ hearing is fine.

I would say to an average degree for someone my age I can obtain, process, and understand health information/ services.

1	I feel that I have a high capacity to make appropriate health decisions based on the information I receive.  I always make sure to ask any questions I have no matter how small they seem.  I make sure I understand what I need to before I leave the office as I want to make sure I get better and don't do anything to make my condition worse.  I try not to use things like webMD or other things on the computer and just listen to my doctor.  I don't want to get any false information or confuse myself.  I trust my primary health physician as he has been right in the past and has helped me get over a few things with no complications and fairly quickly in all instances as well.  He goes over any documents or directions with me before I leave so I can ask questions and so he knows I understand everything.

1	I have no problem understanding what is said by my doctor or on written forms.

-1	I think I have a good grasp, but sometimes the physicians differ in their abilities to convey information in a way that is useful to me as a patient. I find medical forms a challenge as I am dyslexic and also an immigrant. I usually have my husband read them over or fill them out for me.
-1	I don't have a problem dealing with medical stuffs because I had a sister who is a nurse by profession. I usually call her specially if I need some help with the information. It's pretty useful to have her in my back.

-1	There are plenty of ways thourgh the internet to get information or direct contact from the nurse or doctor while its asked. 
1	I feel I can handle basic health information between me and my caregiver or doctor.  What can be confusing is dealing with actual health insurance forms and questions.  Dealing with the health insurance companies can be a real pain sometimes as things are not always in clear cut, understandable terms.  Between me and my doctor, if I don't understand something, I always ask for clarifications.
1	I really feel that most people have to rely on the information that their doctors present to them.  That is something that can lead to unfortunate circumstances when you consider that doctors are humans and some humans tend to take advantage of others.  
-1	I feel that many doctors and physicians use very technical terms, and do not want to spend the time to explain everything.

1	I am a former medical school faculty in biochemistry. I helped teach and train doctors. I can listen to, converse, and understand medical jargon.

1	I'm already a nurse practicer and usually, I don't need the help of anyone to understand basic health information and services
1	I've never felt like it's been a problem. I haven't had a lot of issues filling out paperwork for various things, but I haven't needed to all that often (knock on wood). When I did, it was pretty straightforward. I'd leave things blank if I had to.

-1	sometimes I have some particular difficulties to understand what it is written on the doctor's diagnosis. In some situations, i have some difficulties to better understand medical terms used by my doctors so I often  ask them to explain them to me
-1	My capacity to obtain basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is very high. The doctors and nurses try to give me as much information about my condition as possible and answers many questions I ask them. My capacity to process basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is kind of slow. I have to visually see what the doctors and nurses are saying to comprehend it. Just listening is not enough to register my condition. My capacity to understand is that I usually donât understand what is happening unless I am given time to process the information because I need time for the information to sink in and ask questions.

-1	If I am interested in a not very serious illness then I look for information in the internet, but I always seek advice from the doctor is the condition is somewhat more serious.
1	I understand what is said and can fill out the forms and read any booklets given to me.  I do have to sometimes come home though and look up my diagnosis on the internet.
1	I am intelligent enough to ask for what I want - it is the doctor I do not trust to keep communication open, answer my questions thoroughly or allow my input in treatment options.
-1	I do pretty well understand since I sick at a very young age. My doctor ask my was it ok to have understand why it was important to not miss my meds. Because they help me to say out the hospital or from having a bad Ashman .
-1	I have a difficult time asking the doctor to clarify when I donât understand.  Sometimes I am intimidates or feel rushed.  It is hard to reach the office one I leave.  This has led to me discontinuing care and leaving the practice.  I can research basic information online, but when dealing with a complicated matter itâs not as easy. 
-1	I feel like I have enough knowledge about basic health situations to understand what my doctor is telling me. If I look confused when my doctor tells me something they will often explain what I need to know. I do not feel like I would understand things that are more uncommon like serious diseases or complicated insurance limitations.
1	I think I have the understanding to complete forms and ask question if I don't understand. I have completed three years of college, and I am capable of read with comprehension.  I give the nurse or medical personnel all information on how I am feeling the symptoms I am experienced and the length of time I endured any symptoms

-1	I think I have a moderate capacity to do this. I think that they use a lot of difficult terms, and that is where the misunderstanding come from.
-1	If I don't understand what the doctors are saying I ask them to explain more in-depth. The only way your going to understand is by asking questions. They're doctors they probably have seen it all.
1	I am confident that my perception and comprehension of basic health matters is beyond adequate to understand what I'm told by any health care provider. I regularly keep up with my health and I believe in questioning anyone that's involved with my health care.
-1	I can understand most basic health information, I might have an issue once in a while not understanding some concept. I try to ask questions to doctors and nurses but most of the time I think of additiol questions when it is too late because I already left the doctor's office. 
-1	I have the ability to understand basic health concerns, but just as any human being I feel uncomfortable and nervous when displayed with major or serious concerns. I often clam up and don't hear what is being said to me
1	I am fully confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand health information about any condition I have in order to make appropriate health decisions. When I visit my doctor, I always make sure to mention any health problems I'm experiencing.

-1	I have the ability to understand all the information given to me by doctors and nurses.

1	i have a great ability to understand it all.  just worry that if i get bad news, i will shut down.  in that case, i would have my son or his wife help me.  hasn't happened yet, though
-1	I am a pretty intelligent individual, so I think I have a higher comprehension than most. With that being said, I know when I go over my insurance plan and that sort of paperwork, I have a hard time understanding what all of it means. I never took any sort of secondary schooling in the medical field, so some of the terminology is beyond me.
-1	i have a high capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. i have been visiting medical professiols for decades and have always asked questions whenever the initial explations needed more clarifications. i have no issues in doing so until i can understand what is going on.

-1	I feel that I have the knowledge and experience to obtain the medical jargon and maintain for further reference.  I have a basic understating to the medical information presented to me.
-1	I don't always feel confident.  Drs don't tend to explain things in layman's terms and I don't know what questions to ask.  Its difficult if you're not sure if the questions you're asking are the right ones and if the dr is telling you all you need to know.
1	I believe that I understand documents that are given to me concerning my health. If I do have a question, I feel comfortable enough to ask my healthcare provider to explain it to me.

1	I consider myself to be intelligent, inquisitive and self-aware.  I always did well in science and was in advanced placement classes in biology in high school.  I research any and all health conditions that I've had, as well as those health issues my family and friends have experienced. Once, a medical professional commented to me that he thought I worked in the health field.
-1	I think I can understand basic health information if it is presented in an understandable manner.  I think a lot of this depends on the presentation itself.
-1	I feel like I do, but I get nervous when I talk to a doctor or nurse. When that happens, especially if they tell me that something is wrong, I get flustered and forget to ask what it is and all the questions. Then when i call I cant get them or they wont answer questions becuase they are too busy.
1	I am very capable of handling my own medical affairs. The medical professionals I see do an excellent job of explaining medical issues and procedures and answering any questions I have about my health. I am also very good at finding and understanding information on my own regarding my medical health and conditions. 
-1	I believe that I am able to moderately understand the things presented to me
1	I feel as though I have to be competent in this area in order to be my own health advocate.  Experience has taught me that not every health professional cares, so it's important to read, research, and ask questions

Typically, my family prefers me to be there with them during medical visits because of my better understanding of medical terminology.  
1	i fully understand the questions. i do not have any problems talking to my doctor about any issues. i am my own best advocate
-1	I feel I can effectively obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself.
1	"I feel that I can do all of the above on my own very well. Usually, I would just ask for ""help"" or advice from someone if I have been diagnosed with something they have previously had if I had any questions about it. I was also responsible for my grandma's health decisions and went to all of her appointments with her."
1	I think I have an analytical mind that frequently leads me to research health information. As a biology major, I have a relatively good understanding of health concepts and mechanisms.
1	I make sure to ask questins of anything that is not clear, and I don't stop until I am satisfied with the clarification.  I also will obtain more information on my own to confirm that what I've been told is true.  If there is any discrepancy, and if it is important enough to me, I have not reservations about seeking second opinion.
-1	I feel I'm intelligent enough to understand most information provided to me by my doctor. If I have a hard time understanding information, I'll rephrase my question or simply tell him I don't understand what he means. I sometimes think of additional questions after my appointment. If so, I'll usually look on the internet for answers. If I'm not confident in the information I find online, I'll call my doctor's office and ask to speak with him over the phone.
-1	its easy for me to understand and i know it help.i think its important to know all you info and for you to keep it all on you
-1	To make the appropriate health decisions  and understand basic health information  I feel like I'm pretty confident I could handle it by myself.  Sometimes if I do need help I will just find somebody and have them explain it to me.   I would say 75% of the time I could figure it out.  However I never sign anything that I do not fully understand. Because me and my wife work separate shifts  I have no choice to go to the doctors myself and fill everything else as well as take my 2 children to the doctors and fill their information out.   Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%. Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%
1	The only thing I struggle with is understanding information from and about insurance companies. As far as actual health information, I feel I know and understand at least as much as the average person, probably more.

-1	Some things don't understand they are confusing to understand what they are saying to you about what's going on with your body
1	If I ever need help understanding anything at the pharmacy, they always are willing to take the time to explain any side effects or questions I have about specific medications.  When I see my doctor, it can sometimes be a little more rushed because he has so many patients during the day he has to see and he runs a very tight schedule.  However, I never felt like he answered any of my questions inadequately.  I usually do research on my own (online), before I go in for an appointment, so that I am better prepared to ask relevant questions regarding my potential diagnosis or ailments.  Therefore I know what to ask and usually have a good understanding of the health information presented to me.
1	I have the capacity to understand basic info but it gets a little confusing once it starts getting into the more detailed stuff that you cant even understand what the words mean
-1	"I feel like it is very stressful and takes a long time to get someone to explain certain simple medical things/information to me, just for instance at my endocrinologists office (I am pre-diabetic), the nurse doesn't even know basic diabetic information such as what level your A1C should be to not be pre-diabetic or diabetic, she states she only draws the blood - but my doctors assistant is the same way, they do not know basic info for that field when I believe they should to save time for the doctor and also be able to explain it to you. My doctors sometimes do not use ""layman"" terms - they use long huge medical terms and don't really dissect it for you to understand, which leaves you to google which can be a severe panic attack in the making to do your own research."
1	I have a PhD in public health, so I am generally pretty knowledgeable about health related issues. When I am uncertain about particular health conditions or my family history of disease I usually ask my mother, a nurse, for help.
1	"Yes, I have the capacity to understand basic health information. I'm not sure what else to add?	I see a nurse practitioner, we have a good relationship and are able to communicate effectively. I'm very open with her and trust her advice. She spends an appropriate amount of time with me and answers any questions I may have."""

-1	I worked in a medical related field. Usually, i understand the terminology used by doctors or nurse. If i don't understand then i don't hesitate to ask them. Its my body i have to take care of it. If i still don't understand then i ask my closed friends or relatives. Most of them are in the medical field. For whatever reason i still need more explanation then i search on web and read about it, understand it and then make educated decison. Sometimes it does happend that i can't read doctors handwriting then i call their office and clarify it with their nursing staff, usually they are very helpful.

-1	I feel like once I listen to what my doctor or nurse tells me, I need a few minutes to process it and by that point, they have left and I have been pushed out of the room and I now have a million questions I wanted to ask. On my last doctor's visit I left feeling confused and I realized in the parking lot I had no idea what I was supposed to do after my blood work results were going to be messaged to me. I then contacted my doctor, she was uble to respond to me, so I talked to a nurse who read the results and scared me to death thinking I had a disease and then hours later my doctor messaged me saying it's no big deal. 
1	At age 67, my experience comes in handy.  I feel fully capable to make health decisions.

Using all this information, I feel really good about the questions I need to ask my doctor or areas where I need further explation and information. All of this also makes me feel confident about any decisions I need to make about treatment options.

1	I don't think that I would have any problems obtaining, processing, or understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.

I have had a triple bi-pass back in 2004 that I have obtained quite a lot of knowledge pertaining to this disease. Also, years of experience taking care of my daughter's issues with mental illness and learning some much needed understanding of both circumstances. Making sure we both get plenty of exercise and to try to eat as healthy a diet as we can so we can both obtain a relatively productive lifestyle. Learning on what medications that can keep us  in good condition and the side effects that might occur. Keeping in close contact with our doctors and nurses.
-1	For the most part I think I have the full capacity. If its something that is really in depth I probably miss things and need someone to kinda help walk me thru it.

1	!00 percent i understand most medical terms and conditions that relate to me and whatever problem i have at that time of service, if i dont i make sure to ask.
-1	Reading health information is scary and understanding the services offered is so confusing because for one symptom or one health condition different doctors take a different approach so since it not universal we get confused. So I always go on trustable sites and view the health condition in detail.  I also consult my family doctors whom I can trust to ankle appropriate health decisions.
-1	I feel that I have the same level of understanding of the medical system as the average person. A lot of things that are written or said by doctors are in their own language, and they sometimes forget that they need to put things in normal terms for people to understand them. Forms can be confusing, mostly it is just the way some questions are worded and you have to get clarification on what they are exactly wanting from you.
1	I am well read about my medical conditions and aggressive in finding options for treatment.  As an example several diagnostic tests were order, the cost for these tests would have been over 1,200.00 but I found a the same tests offered by a non-profit through a local hospital for 168.00.
-1	I believe I am capable of understanding basic medical concepts.  I do get confused when medical professiols use jargon that I am not familiar with.

-1	My mom was an RN, so I feel pretty confident about understanding the vocabulary and concepts, and I have a lot of books at home I can consult. But if I don't already know where to find the extra information I need, I end up just Googling it, which is a terrible way to get medical information. At the end of one of those sessions, I'm still pretty confused, and also a lot more worried.

-1	I feel I have the capacity to obtain and understand basic health information given the wealth of information available. I however feel most doctors are uninterested in being thorough and want to get patients in and out so they don't provide or unwilling to provide good medical care and just want to order some tests and prescribe something to treats the symptoms of whatever ails someone based on some robotic intepretation of test results.

I also have the internet of course including some resources there that my doctor has recommended. Overall I have had very few problems and when I do my questions are usually answered satisfactorily.

-1	I feel that I sometimes understand basic health information. There are times when I am reading my online medical chart after I get a result in that I will need to call the doctor to understand what it is saying. Most of the time I will make an appointment after getting a result back, just so I have that one on one conversation with my doctor. It feel I understand better when they explain to me face to face. That is when I feel I process the information very well. Especially when they show me different examples of what is going on in my body. It helps when the doctor doesn't seemed rushed.

1	I feel I have good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Generally medical professionals are helpful in that regard, as if you ever have any questions, most are willing to explain it in detail. Also the age we live in, any questions about medical stuff are only a google search away. From the google search you can find actual medical documents explaining certain things, or just find other people like yourself suffering from the same thing who will share their experiences. Also not trying to brag but I've also been a smart person, so I find understanding things like this, isn't that tough. Generally though, I just try to make sure my Doctor and/or Nurses are fully informed of what is going on with me, and make sure to ask any questions I have.
