I think this shows my knowledge about health and nutrition and how to take care of yourself.  My children's good health reflects my knowledge.
1	My father fell from our roof a few years ago, and so all of the medical information that he had given me came into play since he was incapacitated. Just knowing which questions to ask, the terms the doctors were using, and what I should expect was extremely helpful.

1	I'm not sure if I really have a knowledge of health or medical issues. A few years ago, I started eating a lot better because my dad had a massive heart attack, and started learning more about how sugars and bad fats were affecting my life experience, as well as the sty little nicotine habit I'd picked up.

Doctors are humans and normal folk, I am ok talking and questioning them. I think this is most important, even beyond knowing what to do or how to treat. I knew what questions to ask: follow up plans, treatment pathways, altertive options, long term side effects. And I was able to get enough information to plan. 
1	When dealing with my pregncy I was able to understand all of my test results and any actions that needed to be taken or followed up on. A specific example is when I had to have my fasting glucose level tested. I received my results and determined that I was in the normal range, which was then confirmed by the doctor at my next appointment.
1	A friend of mine reported feeling extremely tired no matter how much she slept while she was on her period. I suggested that he iron might be low during that time.
1	I have been through childbirth twice and had a daughter born with a kidney issue which later resolved.  Therefore, I learned to read and understand medical information.
1	I used to believe I had a health condition so I would extensively look up symptoms online. This made me think I had knowledge of medical issues but really just made me more anxious and upset. 
-1	I was told that I had a thyroid issue. I changed my diet and vitamins and I was able to improve my health. 
1	I have followed a high fiber diet for many years.  A few years ago, I began to experience a lot of bloating.  I consistently adjusted my diet and my use of fiber supplements until I found what was causing the problem.  It took several months to do that, but I was successful in reducing my discomfort.
1	I realized that I was suffering dehydration one day and that I needed water and electrolytes to get my body re-hydrated.
1	I was able to provide CPR to a child that was drowning in a community pool. I was CPR certified while training to become a lifeguard.
1	I know a lot a about medications and what they are taken for. Someone asked me what a statin drug was and I explained it was for cholesterol.
1	That a ketogenic diet has been shown to reduce risks and seizures associated with epilepsy, conversion of glucose to ketosis results in a more stable and less likely chance of seizure.  
1	My daughter had very serious health problems while she was growing all the way from birth to her 20's. It was necessary for me to learn as much about her health care as possible in order for me to take care of her and in order to teach other people to take care of her. It was like a full time job to learn all the things that pertained to her condition but it was necessary and I think I was successful. 
1	A few years ago, I noticed some bumps on my face that were itching. I remembered that my brother had mentioned that he had the same symptoms when he had shingles in the recent past, so I did some research online about it. What I found seemed to match up with what I was experiencing, so I went to my doctor to talk about it, and I mentioned that I thought it might be shingles. He agreed, and he put me on some shingles medication. Within a couple weeks, the symptoms disappeared, and I was able to keep the situation from getting to the later stages, when it would have become very painful and possible permanently scarring.
1	When I was taking medic classes when I was 19, I was visiting my mother and stepfather. She choked on a piece of steak. I did the Heimlich and saved her life. I have used that more to save people's lives than I've pulled people out of burning buildings.
1	I went in for chest pains and difficulty breathing. I thought it might be a chest infection after looking it up on the internet and it turned out I was correct.
1	When my daughter was born she had an infection and was in the NICU for a week, I felt like I was able to keep up with all of her care as well as discuss it fluently with her private pediatrician when she was released. 
-1	None that I can think of
1	My father reached out to me regarding an issue he was having and I had some knowledge of what his symptoms might be caused by. I confirmed this with my wife who confirmed the ailment I guess he had.
1	My father was recently diagnosed with diabetes. In talking to him, I understood things like his A1C level and blood sugars, due to my previously having gestatiol diabetes myself. I also understood the types of food he needs to avoid as well as the types he should be eating.
1	I had a sore shoulder and went to physical therapy, but felt that it was not right to move my arm so much, so I filly asked if I could go to a specialist...it was a physicians assistant surgeon (I think) that I went to.  He told me to rest my shoulder for 30 days.  I did that, and it healed.  I also am convinced that proper diet is the best medicine.  My friend changed his diet and lowered his diabetes numbers to below diabetic readings.
1	My uncle was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma. I had to quickly read up on the latest studies about immunotherapies and which ones may work for him.
1	I have been asked by several elderly friends to read their medical information to them. So, basically I had to read the information and summarize it in a way that they could understand.  
1	I don't know, I haven't had to read that many things about medicine. Last semester, I had to write a 12+ page paper on the EpiPen and the price hikes and all of that. I know that it only costs a few dollars to create the pen with the epinephrine inside, but they sell for hundreds of dollars now. I don't know, I'm a little distrustful about the pharmaceutical industry, but I don't know how distrustful I am about doctors.
1	I have a family history of heart disease.  My father had multiple heart attacks throughout his life so I was aware of how cholesterol levels affected him.
1	"At work a girl accidentally got stabbed by a small knife between her fingers. A small vein was punctured causing blood to ""squirt"" from the wound with her heart beat. Everyone panicked except myself. I went to the first aid kit and grabbed a cold compress. I put it over the wound and it closed by itself after about 2 minutes. No one else knew that making the vein cold would cause it to constrict and stop the blood flow."
-1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health is when I was sitting down with my parents and explaining to them the importance of changing their diet, and working towards living a healthier life. I had done a lot of research prior, and was able to explain to them the benefits of eating cleaner, and the benefits that it had on their bodies by cutting out junk food, and not going out to eat as much. I want them to live as long as possible and not be in a lot of pain when they're older. When I was talking everything through with them I felt sort of like an expert on the topic.
1	When I was a teeger I once kept a woman alive using CPR long enough for the ambulance to arrive.
1	My mother was recently diagnosed with diabetes. I was able to plan her meals and lay out a diet plan for her that caused her numbers to fall within an acceptable range within  6 months.
1	I have done research into the science of nutrition so I am knowledgeable about how to read nutrition facts. As far as other areas I don't ahve a lot of knowledge other than what my doctor has told me about me specifically. Generally my numbers are in acceptable ranges so I don't put a lot of thought into it.
1	I had twisted my ankle in a basketball game. I went home, wrapped my ankle with ice, and kept it elevated. I made a doctor's appointment for the next day.

1	I found a lump in my testicle and went to a doctor.  He had it scanned and while we waited for results I did some research.  I was able to discuss my diagnosis with my doctor and understand what he was telling me and also offer counter theories as to what it might be or the cause.  In the end we were able to sort it out and I was satisfied that I understood where it was going instead of being scared and relying on everything he told me.
1	My legs were swelling for what seemed like no reason. I'm overweight. I thought about what I'd been eating g in the past several days, and I came to the conclusion that I had been eating way too much salt. So I switched to low sodium foods and drank a lot of water, and this greatly helped the problem.

1	I had a leg rash and so I went to the nurse who told me it was a fungal infection and recommended some treatment. I was skeptical because when I did some research, it didn't seem to match up with my symptoms. Then, when the rash didn't respond to the topical cream, I went and got a second opinion and was able to actually treat my symptoms.

1	Last fall, I had a pain in my side that I was trying to ignore. One night, I woke up in severe pain and knew I needed medical attention right away. I was not all that worried, though, because I assumed it was my gall bladder. I was right, and it was removed about 2 weeks later. Had I not had the knowledge of how gall bladders work and what was likely causing the pain, I may have been much more worried and anxious than I was.

1	I worked in a doctor's office and currently in medical research. 
1	For breakfast I ate a ba and oatmeal with dried cherries, raisins, apple chunks, cinmon, sunflower seeds, and peanut butter. For lunch I ate veggie stir fry with quinoa. For dinner I had white rice and black beans with diced tomato, cilantro, avocado, and cheese (which isn't the healthiest choice but damn if it doesn't taste good).
1	I figured out that a medication I was taking had really bad side effects and that I no longer needed it.  I'd been free of the symptoms it was treating for 17 or 18 years and the side effects included depression and blood thinning and such.  I have been off it for 2 years now and have had no ill effects.
1	I worked as a certified nursing assistant through college. I worked in the newborn unit, and learned some medical knowledge through experience.

1	"Well if 85% of positive mammograms are false positives, then they aren't really good are they???? I'm proving the high fruit raw lifestyle works. Teeth have stopped decaying out of my head. Dentist would tell me to not do one of the those ""crazy"" grape diets. Yet that style of eating is the ONLY that reverses extreme acidosis in people. The amount of idiocy and low consciousness medical professiols have about human nutrition and health is ridiculous. I suppose it doesn't help that our food system is poisened with pesticides and GMO, certainly makes it harder for those who TRY, to even get well."

-1	I had a mammogram years ago. It showed a possible cyst or lump in the breast. The cost of the 2nd scan was $650, which was out of pocket. Turned out that I did not have cancerous cysts, but it cost me quite a bit for proof.

1	I helped my parents deal with their doctors and medical issues
1	I had to make the decision to not resuscitate my mother after her illness. She had kidney failure and it had affected her mental state. She came out of it, but I knew there would be a continuous decline because of the damage done and the chances of a conscious life were little to none.
-1	Had 3 surgeries and I am a nurse.
1	One example is when I learned I had thyroid problems.  My mother has Hashimoto's disease which I learned is genetic.  I was starting to experience a lot of odd symptoms like dry brittle hair, constipation, dry skin and being cold all the time.

1	I was having severe lung pain, saw 3 different doctors who just brushed it off as nothing. I knew it was a real problem so I saw a 4th dr who I demanded to do further testing. That dr filly found the problem after I had to practically beg for further testing.
-1	I had severe migraines years ago.  I noticed that certain foods would trigger them  more so than others. I found that by not eating certain foods, I could reduce them and not have to take daily medication.
1	That is really hard.  I have torn the ligaments in my ankle several times throughout my life.  So after it happening a time or two, every subsequent time I know right away when it happened, I could just tell the way it felt and I could differentiate between that and just a sprain. I have taken first aid training a couple of times.  
1	I have studied different foods and vitamins that are beneficial for my body. At one time I had high cholesterol.

I think the foods we eat play an important role in our health. So when I do get sick I know that my body needs lots of rest and fluids. I'll take some time off when this happens and I'll get lots of bed rest. I have a juicer and a Vitamix and I'll make lots of fruit and veggie juices to beat the cold.
1	I had a pretty high fever and I knew to go to the doctor so I was able to get treated for strep throat instead of letting it turn into to something else. 
1	I was talking with my parents about issues of diet and nutrition. We were talking about how the medical community has recommended low-fat, high carbohydrate diets for patients with heart problems or at risk for heart attacks for the past 45 years or so, but the evidence that this diet has been effective for reducing heart problems (or for losing weight, for that matter) is poor. They agreed with me, and we further discussed how cutting out sugar and reducing your carbohydrate intake while increasing dietary fat is likely to be the most healthy diet.
1	I am triage/first aid certified, and on one occasion I was able to help someone who was had been in a car accident.  They were in shock and bleeding and had broken their leg.

1	I had a burning sensation in my esophagus that lasted for days.  I called my (then) doctor.  He prescribed me something over the phone without seeing me and said it would be ready at the drug store. When I went to the drug store, there was nothing there.  I trusted my instincts, did the research on the medicine he was about to prescribe (which I would have had to take consistently for GERD).  I looked up tural altertives to this problem.  I had arugula salads, and 100% pure aloe vera juice, and the problem was gone in a day, forever. Things like this is why I don't trust doctors entirely.
1	Nothing in particular, just life experience.
1	Understanding that high TG was due to my intake of sugar, decreasing my intake of sugar by avoiding soft drinks and switching to black coffee, resulting in a 60% drop in my TG and a lowering of my blood pressure.
1	When I gave birth to my second child, I felt I had a much better understanding of newborns and what sort of conditions might crop up. When the doctor told me he had high bilirubin numbers and was slightly jaundiced, I didn't get upset like I did with my first son, because I knew that this was a common occurrence that rarely turned out to be serious. I was able to understand what the doctor was telling me and able to enjoy my son's first few days instead of stressing out.
1	I have basic understanding of medical knowledge of simple diagnoses. Plus I can use my common sense to calculate the rest.

1	A friend had been given antibiotic eye drops for her son's pink eye. She told me that in the past they had worked well, but this time they were not working as quickly. I asked if her son had recently had a cold, and she said yes. I told her that some pink eye is viral, in which case the eye drops will not help.
1	In cross country I felt tired and my legs were heavy. I knew something was wrong. I went to the doctor and I had iron anemia.
1	I had 2 heart attacks so I learned a lot about cholesterol. I did the diet thing and exercise and it made no difference at all in my numbers. So I take meds. They work. So I learned about hereditary stuff. No much you can do but take your meds.
1	I was hearing a lot of complaints from my brother about how his stomach was bothering him. I convinced him that he should go to a doctor and have it checked out even though he couldn't afford the cost of treatment.

1	While I have my own health issues, my husband has even more of them. And since he's a bit less capable of taking care of everything himself, I am the one who takes care of coorditing a lot of his healthcare. This means compiling information for new doctors, doing paperwork, and giving information. This experience has given me the insight (generally) to know what kind of information is important to a doctor.
1	As a child I had sinus and ear infections almost monthly which led me to doctor visits very often. I believe I kept getting them because they over prescribed me antibiotics and lowered their effectiveness. Since I have been on my own I have never been to a doctor once. When I feel like I'm getting sick I rest and take vitamins and minerals. If I do get sick I just rest and get through it.

1	I demonstrated knowledge of health issues when I identified symptoms I was feeling as needing medical attention. I don't generally think about or discuss problems, so listening to my body I think shows an intuitive knowledge, even if I don't have the capacity to completely break down the problem's cause or even the solution.
1	I don't have a specific moment showing my knowledge of a health or medical issue.

So I have no medical training or expertise, but I often talked to people with diabetes and they would tell me a lot about their lives. I had a family member with no insurance who was telling me that she was having some symptoms that she thought might be diabetes. I immediately went and bought her a glucometer, and her blood sugar was way above normal. I recommended that she go to the hospital emergency room because I knew that level would be a huge deal, even for someone diagnosed with diabetes.

1	I am currently pregnt, so I have been doing a lot of research online about possible things that could affect my pregncy and make it more complicated. One thing is high blood pressure and how it is linked to pre-eclampsia. I read about how if you have high blood pressure then they will likely do a urine test to see if there is protein in it, which is a sign of pre-eclampsia.

-1	I don't really have any persol experiences other when my children were sick. I gut used gut gut feelings about when to call the doctor.
1	I haven't had many experiences that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues.

I also have some basic first aid knowledge if that counts, and I've used it a couple of times during my life.

I stopped the drug on my own again and in 6 months my rel function was back up to 80%.

1	I went for a testicular cancer test, and they used a sonogram to look for lumps. They said that I had a lot of weird veins and arteries down there, so that's what was feeling lumpy, and I shouldn't worry too much because it wasn't cancer. So now when I do my self-screening for testicular cancer in the shower, I have learned to feel for veins and arteries before I panic and think that I have a tumor.
1	When I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and before I made a decision about what treatment to select I read everything I could about the different methods of treatments and the likely outcome, both physically and emotiolly. I discussed each option with the doctor and then made a choice.
1	Every time I receive a new medication I need to understand medical issues. When I listen to the doctor describe a condition or how a medicine works, I need to understand medical issues. 
1	Growing up I spent a lot of time visiting my grandfather in hospitals and my grandmother was a pharmacist. I feel that by being around them I picked up a lot of medical knowledge by osmosis.
-1	Self-diagnoses of sicknesses. Knowing when to go to the doctor. Not being dead.
1	a friend cut her hand badly and i was able to stop the bleeding by applying pressure and keeping the wound above her heart. we then cleaned and bandaged her wound which healed fine. 
1	when i was in my 20's, i had to deal with endometriosis and infertility. i talked to doctors and everyone i could about these issues. i read books and searched the internet for anything i could find about these issues. i felt like i knew more than my fertility doctor did!
1	I know for a fact any time I pee and it is painful I have a UTI. Its something I have gotten many times before and it still happens once in a while no matter how much a try to follow all the rules for not getting one.
-1	If a family member or myself have a simple medical issue they usually ask me what to do, and I almost always can help out or at least stop them from worrying. For example, my father in law had a high blood sugar reading and I helped him get it down and advised him to get tested for diabetes
1	I think one experience was when I decided to stop eating meat. I always felt a bit sty before, so I decided to try cutting out different things to see if anything helped. I ended up cutting out meat and started eating healthier, and felt much better overall.
1	One day in the shower, I felt a lump in my breast.  I knew that my mother and grandmother had cystic breasts and that a cyst feels round and soft compared to cancer which can feel more irregular and hard.  Although I made an appointment to go see my doctor and they ended up giving me an ultrasound and mammogram, I wasn't very concerned because I knew the likelihood that this was cancer wasn't a lot because of the things I knew.
1	I was going into surgery to get my gallbladder removed.  I wanted to know what was going to happen before, during, and after the surgery.  I did some research online.  I talked to the anesthesiologist before being put out and talked to him about the drugs he was giving me.  He asked me if I was a medical student or a nurse because of how much I knew.  I told him no, I just did my research.
1	i can usually self diagnose through the internet so when i go in (i need to be damn near dead or something is broken to go in) i tell the doctor so here's what i have (typically strep) he agrees prescribes the z-pac and away i go
1	I used my medical knowledge when it I had to decide a treatment plan for my child when he was diagnosed with bronchitis. I made sure the medication prescribed did not have side effects and they were absolutely necessary. 
1	I just learned some stuff through school, or just reading. I don't go to the doctor that often. I never had any major medical issues. I don't have any family members who have major medical issues either.
1	I have taken numerous health related college courses and am well versed in how to find and obatian medical information and how to research medical jourls. I had a close relative that was in the hospital after a very bad accident and I was able to research their condition and gain the knowledge to help them make informed medical decisions as part of their recovery.  
-1	Reading through document about bell's palsy and knowing what to expect because a relative had experienced it.
1	A couple of months ago, I started a keto diet. This diet is similar to the Atkins diet. The major difference is you add more fats and healthy oils. After a week or two of no sugar and lows carbs, you're body will go into Ketoisis. This uses stored fat instead of carbs for energy.
1	I was speaking with someone at my church, who mentioned that their son had scoliosis. I asked her how severe it was; what the degree of the curvature was. She was surprised that I was that knowledgeable about it, and I told her that my son had it as well so I knew about it.
-1	I remember a friend telling me he suffered from very strong headaches that made him sensitive to light and sometimes sounds. He complained that the pain was a pulsing one. You could always describe it as throbbing. I mentioned to him that it sounded like a migraine headache, something I suffer from. I told him to see his doctor to make sure, but it sounded like a migraine to me. Turns out that was what it exactly was.  
1	About 10 years ago I self-diagnosed my Autism Spectrum Disorder. I was filly professiolly diagnosed about 8 years later. During that time I learned more than the doctors who refused to listen to my concerns.
1	I've worked as a life and health insurance agent in the past. Often I would help older people with medicare supplement plans. Going through the various plans, overages, deductibles, etc., took a fair amount of knowledge. Drug pricing, altertives and availability. Hospital costs, referral procedures. I would often help them to understand medical terminology.
1	I had a two day stay at the hospital. I was treated for low sodium,because of a drug interaction. I had to answer a lot of questions and i learned a lot.
1	My husband's urine smelled sweet. I told him to see doctor. Sure enough, he was diabetic.
1	My grandmother had heart surgery and she developed a staff infection. They also found pre-cancer cells in her throat at the same time. My family heard cancer and freaked out. I was more concerned with the infection because she was old and pre-cancer cells could take decades to actually turn into cancer. The doctor said i was right and calmed my family the immediate concern was the infection and the heart.   
-1	The research I did on my own issues and the books I read. I looked at WebMD, Wikipedia (even though it's not secure), and other sites. I even took an atomy course where we picked a disease relevant to the chapter and wrote a short discussion board post about it.
1	I was the caregiver and advocate for my father who was dying of lung cancer. I dealt with his doctors and the hospice nurses daily for many months.
1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is when I was younger I got a rare disease that made me really sick. During this time I was forced to start learning and understanding different medicine and side effects. 
1	I had a liver disease issue. I looked up information on the matter. I became knowledgeable. I discussed the matter with my doctor in an informed manner.
-1	This may seem a bit odd, but my mother was a nurse and once told me that you can judge health by stool samples. As a result of being told this, I would not allow my children to flush the toilet until they were past the age of 10 so I could check their stools each time they went. If they had a loose stool, I varied their diet. If their stool appeared hard, I varied their diet. Also, when they had too much energy, rather than assume they needed medication, I had them exercise - it worked every time. And one other instance, my younger son was slow to talk. An in-law suggested something was wrong. I explained he had no problem communicating what he wanted or needed and, thus, nothing was wrong. I was right; she was wrong.
1	I was able to effectively communicate that an insect bite on my hand wasn't a mosquito but was a spider bite. 
1	I have self treated illnesses that most people believe you need to go to the doctor for. 
1	"I'm not really sure. I had cancer twice so I guess as I was doing chemo I understood how all this stuff was supposed to work. I knew Everytime I went to the hospital what the routine was, and knew everywhere I needed to go. I'm not sure I really ""demonstrated"" my knowledge but this is the only thing I can think of."
1	I was having issues sleeping. And after some research i found out I was snoring in my sleep and had sleep apnea.
1	My mom went to the ER thinking that she was having a heart attack or at the very least heart problems.  I accompanied her to the hospital although I told her her symptoms were not necessarily heart related and that she really just needed to relax and work on stress reduction.  The doctors agreed with me but went ahead and performed heart stress test.  There was nothing found.
1	I've taken a few atomy classes in college. Besides that, I don't have too much experience.  
1	When taking my son for a follow up appointment after getting croup, I felt I could understand and communicate with the doctor about all of the medications given and treatment protocol. 
-1	I fell down a flight of stairs.  My son insited I broke my ankle but I assured him I probably had a hair line fracture.  The bone had not come through and I was somewhat able to walk on it.
-1	Like I wrote before... my wife was diagnosed with cervical cancer and we both fought that diseases....  I was on a phone call with all kind of specialists, doctors and technicians...  we got some more experience than we wanted. 
1	"A few weeks ago, my brother hit his head at work. He'd had several mild concussions as a child and pretty much self-diagnosed himself as having another one this time. (Yes, that's wildly irresponsible. Yes, he should have gone to the doctor. You know what, tell it to fucking Nikki Haley because it's her fault he's not insured.) He did some research about concussion and painkillers and said he needed to take something other than Excedrin, preferably Tylenol. He was pretty upset because we didn't have any Tylenol and his head hurt. So I realized that often, different me brands of the same medicine will have similar mes, and another painkiller that ended in ""ol"" might have the same active ingredient as Tylenol. I looked up the active ingredients online and checked the bottle to make sure, and then gave him a Midol from my supply. So most of the medical knowledge in that scerio came from him, but I was the one who realized that Midol would probably help and did the research to verify it."
1	When my aunt was sick with cancer a few years ago, I read up about information from John Hopkins to see how I could help help and then told her about it and provided literature. It showed her how she could alleviate pain through a lot of methods that I persolly assisted her with, and later it her cancer went into recession, happily.
-1	I have had a few health issues that caused me to speak with doctors.  I was always able to have my questions answered. I understood information 
1	When a friend of mine had an allergic reaction, I had helped to take care of him as the ambulance showed up. 
1	As a teeger when I felt a pain in my right side I knew that I needed to get to my doctor as soon as possible, because it could have potentially been appendicitis. It turned out to be something different, but I knew enough to get to a doctor and have them give me an examition. 
1	Someone had fallen at my place of work and was a pale yellow color and also was clutching his chest. I called 911 and had the people that were already on the floor with him trying to see if he's okay, to prop his head up and leave him still until emergency services arrived.
1	When I had an abnormal papsmear, I knew it was possible that it was a false positive. I went through the extra testing and listened to everything the doctor told me and understood thoroughly the process.
-1	When my mother in law got sick with cancer she needed alot of support.  Since having going through it with my mom, I was able to tell her some of the things that she would possibly experience with chemo.  We were able to go to the store to get some things to make her comfortable throughout the process.
1	In high school I had severe headaches for weeks and missed school for two weeks straight, after seeing multiple doctors I filly understood what was going on in my body and I learned that I had Mitral Valve Prolapse. 
1	My daughter frequently has rashes and I have taken her in a few times to have them checked out but they are just eczema. Now I am able to diagnose that myself. We also are able to handle small issues at home like colds and mild fevers with confidence.
1	I guess any atomy exam I've taken would fit this since those literally involved demonstrating medical knowledge, but outside of school I guess the most fitting thing I can think of was when a friend of mine wasn't feeling well and wasn't sure his symptoms meant. I sussed out based on what he was experiencing that it was probably a UTI that was progressing towards the bladder and kidneys, and recommended he see a doctor immediately. It was indeed a bladder infection, and he was able to get effective treatment. I'm glad that my knowledge of that particular health condition helped, as he might not have sought treatment right away otherwise.
1	I worked in a residential care facility for 11 years as a certified medical aide. It was my job to dispense medication according to doctor's orders, as well as provide medical care to patients who had medical procedures done like surgeries, for example. We also had clients who would have to do certain things to prepare them for the procedures, which usually included a list of doctors orders like fasting, colon cleansing, etc.
1	An experience that occurred that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues would be when my mother was telling my about some symptoms she was experiencing which raised some red flags. I was extremely concerned with the symptoms she was describing so I insisted she speak with a medical professiol to be examined to find out what were causing her symptoms.
1	Several years ago I was having trouble getting pregnt. I had to go through a bunch of fertility treatments including giving myself shots. I researched everything and spoke with medical professiols on many occasions. Not long after my first child was born, I had a friend going through the same exact thing that I had gone through. I was able to explain a lot of what she would have to do and what it would be like for her since I had just gone through it.
1	My boyfriend has MS and during the time of his diagnosis I spent a lot of time doing research in order to to keep up with doctors when discussing his medical options, as well as on medications that were mentioned.
1	Nothing special, It's just migraine.
1	When my daughter fell and hurt her ankle, I was able to stabilize and care for her until we were able to get to a night time clinic for professiol care. The doctor on staff confirmed that I had provided the correct temporary care for her.
1	For a good portion of 2015, I was sick. I had a fever, cold, body aches, etc. at least twice a month. Last year, I started eating about five cloves of raw garlic every day. It's a killer on my breath, but I haven't been sick since.
1	I was sick with flu and stuck on work/travel.  I filly insisted home-time so I could rest, eat fruit, granola, yogurt, and take vitamin C.  I was better in less than a day after being sick for a week.
-1	I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol so I am familiar with medical terms and how they affect my life. I was a corrections officer in the infirmary and had several cases that I was able to help because of recognizing certain symptoms.  
1	I have asthma so that has made me more aware of my health choices and medical issues. 
1	I have  had issues with my teeth. due to that i have some knowlage or antibiots and pain killers. 
1	One time I was talking with a co-worker and she was talking about her nephew that had been born with heart defects.  I know a lot about congenital heart defects because my daughter has that also.
1	When my mother doted her kidney to my aunt, I feel like I learned a lot about medical issues. The entire family felt the need to educate ourselves on the issue. Overall, I feel like I became much more comfortable with the medical environment as a result.
1	At one point in my life i was constantly sore and fatigued. No matter how much sleep i had i would always be tired and had poor recovery from excercise. After researching and cutting out all forms of sugar, processed foods, and dairy and started to eat a plant based diet, My health became amazing. I looked and felt amazing. I never even imagined it was possible to feel so good and have so much energy
-1	I recently went through surgery to remove some abnormal cells off of my cervix and this opened my eyes to better women's health.
-1	I had to take an MRI on my knees to look for problems. The nurse was trying to explain to me how it worked but I already knew how because I had read about them. 
1	In the past, I have had kidney stones. During the emergency room visit, I was given an IV of an anti-inflammatory drug. I was also told to drink plenty of fluids and was forced to urite. I was able to successfully pass the stone.
-1	When I went to the doctor and I understood what he was saying without Leigh man's terms 
1	I once was able to explain to my friend some of the details of childbirth. This only sticks out in my mind because they had no idea about the process at all. I also had a decent amount of details about the process. 
1	My mother is 93 years old and has dementia and my husband and myself are her caregivers. We monitor and take care of her health including her type II diabetes and blood pressure. She has had various health issues including hospitalization due to falls and from all this experience we have learned much on how to cope with and mage her health and safety as well as being aware of complications and things to monitor
-1	I had really bad pains in my right side after eating several times.  I suspected it was my gall bladder because I have friends wohad similar problems.  I had to visit the doctor.  I was correct.
1	When I needed emergency surgery after a twisted intestine due to gastric bypass I was able to follow along with what tests and procedure information my doctor was going to do and perform.
-1	My daughter has a history of passing out and when it happened the first time she had a battery of tests that told us that nothing was wrong with her. It happened several more times and while teachers and coaches freaked out when it happened, I informed them that it was likely caused by my daughter being under the weather - having a cold come on or a low grade fever - as that is what caused these episodes previously. I knew this because of the previous doctor visits and asking questions while at these visits. 
-1	When I tried to eat salads
1	My wife burnt her arm on the stove.  I put it under cool water and then applied aloe vera to it and bandages it.
1	After i was diagnosed with Type II diabetes (three years ago) i got little to no help from my Dr. So, i took to the net and learned everything i could about it. One thing i learned is that i can deduct the fiber count from the carb count and that will be my total net carb intake.   When i was at my Dr's office and mentioned this, she did not seem to know about it or was surprised that i knew about. 
1	I recently had kidney stones again. I had them once before a year ago, and when I started having pain in my back I knew that it was most likely kidney stones. I went to the doctor and it took a while for them to do tests to find it but eventually they found the stone in my ureter. I was right about my diagnosis. 
1	Strokes and high blood pressure run in the family. When my mother called and said her right eye vision was blocked like a curtain had been pulled down half way I knew we had to get her to the hospital quickly. She was having a TIA. She had many of them during her last 2 years alive. They usually lasted only minutes.
1	A time that I demonstrated knowledge of health or medical issues in my life was when I was with my friend David. David suffers from diabetes and fainted when we were out walking the streets of shville. I was very aware of his condition and ran into the nearest restaurant and got orange juice. We rushed back to David and gave him the orange juice and some food and he was able to get oriented pretty quickly after that before checking his sugar and insulin levels. 
1	
1	I have given birth 4 times. Each experience was different and I had to know about what I needed to do in each situation. The options open to me for pain relief and how they could affect me and the baby. 
1	A friend of mine was displaying all the symptoms of anxiety but didn't think anything was wrong, that it was just a rough patch she was going through. I helped her and showed her medical stuff that made her go to the doctor and get treatment. She's feeling much better now.
1	When I was diagnosed with thyroid disease and the depression that is often related to the disease did not go away after being medicated and having normal results, I researched and found that I may need an addition medication to help with the absorption of the synthroid. I spoke with my doctor and he prescribed me the additiol medication to help me absorb the synthroid better. As a result, my depression did go away... which could have been due to my request...I also have had other chronic health issues that I am knowledgeable about only because I have been undergoing treatment for decades. I also noticed a friend having neurological side effects from long term haldol use. I told this friend that I thought he may have tardive dyskinesia which, as it turned out, he did...   Other than that I do not believe I have a great knowledge of health or medical issues.
1	When I birthed my son, I took no preparation courses and I handled the birth well. I understood the progression of labor to delivery and knew what to expect without educating myself otherwise. 
1	having gone to the doctors myself and then going with my family members
1	I just go to the doctor and have seen people be diagnosed. I know basic stuff
1	My daughter was stung by a wasp last August. We were celebrating my ex-wife's birthday with her when this happened, and she has a tendency to panic about things. I thought she was just comforting the little one upstairs, but when I went to check she was on the phone with 911 concerned about allergic reaction. It had been long enough that it was pretty clear our daughter wasn't going to have any kind of serious 911-warranting emergency reaction so I helped the operator convince her that she was overreacting and calm her down.
1	I have a undergrad degree in human biological sciences. This degree is essentially a pre-med degree. 
1	I got salmonella poisoning one time, I was very sick for 5 days. I filly took my temperature and it was at 105 degrees. I knew that anything above 104 could be deadly, so I arranged a ride to take me to the emergency room.
1	I remember a spring where I was constantly congested and had itchy eyes. With the knowledge I had about my symptoms and exterl factors, I guessed I had allergies or hay fever. I felt confident in knowing why my body was like that.
-1	I've had to sanitize and bandage a few of my own wounds that weren't serious enough for stitches.
1	what i typically do to help my hypertension is read a lot of nutritiol labels. i try to keep my sodium intake fairly low (a lot of salt makes me really bloated anyway) and i always look at fat and carb content. this is something i do every time i buy a packaged food that has a label on it. if it doesn't have a label, i look it up on my phone if i am shopping. this helps me be much more knowledgeable and aware of what i am eating.
1	One experience that demonstrates my medical knowledge was that I lost about 30 pounds over two years and gained a good amount of healthy lean muscle. Getting fit involved learning about and counting calories, choosing healthy proteins and carbohydrate sources with enough fat, and learning about exercise. Through this learning process, I was able to lose this weight in a healthy way, and improve in my efforts at the gym greatly. 
1	In general, I have little knowledge of health and medical issues. The only thing I can think of to describe is a time in my early twenties when I went on a no-grain diet. I had read about the diet and what it entailed, and while looking back, I think it was a poor choice, I was clearly acting on knowledge (however misguided) of a health topic. 
1	My teachers spent considerable time with me making sure that I understood word problems. While I cannot proclaim to be the best, I can say that I am competent.
1	I worked as an Arizo Paramedic for 10 years
1	I had a knowledge of health issues when I saw a spot on my mom's hand. I knew the ABCD method of detecting skin cancer, so I told my mom she should get to a doctor because it fit all the criteria. Sure enough, the doctor said that it was skin cancer after he performed a biopsy and she had surgery to remove it. Luckily it was still in the early stages, but the doctor said I should be proud of myself for noticing and knowing the criteria, because if I had just brushed it off, it could have gotten a lot worse. 
1	calling 911 when I had a heart attack
1	My husband is a T1 diabetic, my daughter was born with spi bifida and my grandmother is blind. I have a lot of experience with hospitals, doctors, and their forms.
-1	MY HUSBAND WAS FEELING DIZZY AND FELT WEAK. KNOWING THAT MY MOM'S FAMILY HAD LOW BLOOD SYMPTOMS AND AFTER CHECKING HIS BLOOD PRESSURE, I KNEW HIS SUGAR WAS LOW. SO, I GAVE HIM ORANGE JUICE.
1	I 'm not sure that I really have one. I am on medications for anxiety and depression. Before they figured out what worked for me, I went through a long list of medications that did not work, so in that sense, I was able to determine what worked for me. 
1	I cut my finger while working in the dirt. I had to keep working, but i knew mi finger would get infected if I did without taking care of it. So I washed it, cleaned it with peroxide, bandaged it then put a glove over my hand. It healed fine and never got infected
1	I was able to help my mom choose the correct insulin when she was faced with a choice of switching medicine. I was able to help her read and understand the benefits and side effects of each drug.
1	My friend broke his arm a few years back. I was the only one around so I made a splint out of sweater and some wood. When we got to the ER, the nurse complimented me on my splint.
1	I was sent home from the hospital and told to monitor my intake and outake to check for kidney function.  I measured everything I drank and all urine to determine whether or not to call the doctor.  At one point, my intake was almost twice my outtake.  I called the doctor and was hospitalized because my kidneys were shutting down.
-1	I just have a general knowledge about health and medicine. I do not have any significant expertise, and i have not gone to med school. But when my son scrapes his knee, I clean the wound and put on a band aid. 
1	I went with a relative to the doctor for a medial emergency. The doctor made assumptions and gave them the wrong diagnosis. They began ordering all kinds of tests that were for the wrong things. I told them what to really check for based on the symptoms and I was correct. They canceled the tests and changed the diagnosis. 
1	It's less a specific experience and more a general one; about ten years ago I generally felt awful: constant aches and pains, low energy, difficulty breathing, bad mood, poor concentration, frequently sick with colds and sinus infections. It didn't take a lot of knowledge to know what was wrong - I was out of shape, had a poor diet, smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol. I set out and learned a lot about nutrition and exercise, I quit smoking and drinking, and I put a plan in place to gradually change my lifestyle in a way that was sustaible. Today I'm in perfect health, happy, energetic, focused, and haven't so much as had a sniffle in over two years.
1	A couple of years ago, I began to feel extremely anxious. This is a problem because it told me my anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medication was no longer doing its job. My doctor chose to make no adjustments. I knew, from being told by several different therapists, that eventually mental health medications can either stop working or bring your brain chemistry up to a level where it's no longer needed. That I might need off the medication or to be switched to a different one. My doc seemed uware of this. When I couldn't get the help I needed, I changed docs.
1	I was a witnes of a car accident,two weeks ago. I stopped to look after the drivers and there were no bad injuries at first look.One of them was limping and complained about some pain in his leg.I told him to sit down ot lie down,while we were waiting for the ambulance.
-1	When I decided to get into shape. I did all my due diligence and learned the value of eating clean and exercising regularly. By learning to restrict my calories and exercising to create a caloric deficit. This not only helped me drop the pounds but helped with my asthma. 
1	My child was sick and caught croup. My wife freaked out and said we should go to the hospital, I told her there was nothing they could do and to just make a doctor's appointment instead.
-1	When I was twelve years old, a drunk driver hit the car my mother was driving while I was in the backseat. I have very few memories of the accident, but I do faintly recall a serious but calming face as I was gently lifted out of the car. The paramedic held my hand as we traveled to the hospital. I was in the hospital for several weeks and that same paramedic came to visit me almost every day. During my stay, I also got to know the various doctors and nurses in the hospital on a persol level. I remember feeling anxiety about my condition, but not sadness or even fear. It seemed to me that those around me, particularly my family, were more fearful of what might happen to me than I was. I donât believe it was innocence or ignorance, but rather a trust in the abilities of my doctors
1	I can't say there has been an experience in my life that would demonstrate medical knowledge. 
1	I guess I would return to my earlier statement in that I am a mother who spent a lot of time dealing with everyone's health issues in my family. I have also taken care of helping my parents because they are aging and get confused. I wouldn't say that I feel completely comfortable with everything related to health decisions, but if I have questions, I ask and I also do a lot of research before I make decisions. I have had to do additiol testing in the past for health issues, and I felt comfortable with my choices after I dug deeply into the issues myself. Ultimately I am the one who wants to decide what happens to me, either good or bad.
1	Having gone to my first doctor who approved me for operation on my septum, felt the need to explain things to me about the process as well in simplistic terms and when I explained to him that I already knew it made him angry and then later refused to perform the operation on me by constantly pushing me back until I had to change medical carriers and could no longer get him to perform the surgery.
1	I diagnosed myself with cholecystitis. I had an episode of severe right upper quadrant abdomil pain and gastrointestil symptoms a few hours after having a large meal with a high fat content. It happened again several days later. I figured out what the cause was and made an appointment with my doctor. I told him my symptoms, and what thought the diagnosis was. He ordered an ultrasound to confirm it, and I needed a cholecystectomy. My doctor at the time was one of my favorite doctors, and I think he would've diagnosed me properly, but I know that cholecystitis is missed sometimes and getting an accurate diagnosis can sometimes take quite a bit of time while other diseases or conditions are ruled out. 
1	I was discovered to have high blood pressure a few years ago.  I started taking medication and my BP was lower but I felt terrible.  No energy at all.  So I went back to the doctor and described my symptoms so he put me on a different pill and now I'm doing fine.  I guess that demonstrates my understanding of making sure I get the right medication for me.
1	My college did a free health screening that I participated in, and while I was being explained my results I was able to correct the medical student on several items.
1	There was a time that I fell and hurt my wrist. I couldn't twist my wrist or bend it without pain and I knew that it was more than just a sprain. I figured it was broken and so I went to the hospital to have an x-ray.
1	A friend of mine actually recently had a mammogram that came out positive. I told her there was a good chance that it was a false positive and might just be a cyst or something. It did in fact turn out to be a false positive.
-1	Probably when I had to go for lab work and had to find out about my thyroid. I knew I had a high TSH level, but my Free T3 and my Free t4 was insanely low too. So I had to tell my doctor about those and she was shocked and said I was right. So now we not only look at my TSH , we also look at my Free T3 Free t4 too. Because you can have a normal TSH but have low Free T3 and Free t4 in hypothyroidism. I feel my best when my levels are optimal, not just normal.

I told him that, since I was not having breast issues and I was nursing an infant, I thought it better to wait until the baby was bigger and not nursing so often.  My regular doctor and my midwife both agreed with me."
1	I do not know how to answer this as I feel all my experiences lead me to this knowledge of health or medical issues as I try to study and learn as much as possible.

1

1	I was given a course of antibiotics to take for 20 days.  Even though I felt better after 3 days I continued taking the medication because I knew the bacteria may still be present even though I was no longer feeling the symptoms and stopping early could increase the chances of creating a drug resistant form of the bacteria.
-1	I am 41 with three kids. I have a mother who gets sick, my grand parents who have been in an out, and those who i interact with on facebook., My knowledge of medical is really based on what i have had explained to me within those visits.

This progressed to affect my nose, left foot toes, and sometimes my nipples, with severe episodes causing my fingerils to develop waves and my fingers to develop painful lesions that scarred. I researched and figured out that I have Rayud's syndrome and that constriction in my blood vessels was likely due to stress, cold temperatures, etc. Through diet and exercise, I have reduced the number of episodes that I have. 
-1	I kept having very severe reactions after eating certain types of food or consuming certain drinks. It was very painful, like being punched in the stomach from the inside.

1	I am overweight and I am always told that I probably have diabetes before they ever test me. They always just assume and I tell them every time that I don't.

1	I felt that I was going to faint after I had spent a long time standing up in a particularly hot office. I had had similar experiences  before, and had researched the subject of the vasovagal response and the best action to take in that situation. I quickly got to the ground, elevated my legs, and tensed my leg muscles as I had researched.  As a result, I didn't faint and was able to stand up again and resume work shortly afterwards.
-1	The most important experience was when I took my state board exams for my PTA license. I had to be well versed in medical terminology as well as diseases and the causes and treatment for each one. Most important was knowing what muscle controls what part of the body. 
-1	I worked as a medical transcriptionist in the radiology department at my local hospital. I had to type doctor's dictations regarding patient x-rays, MRI's, CT scans, and ultrasounds. I learned about a lot of health and medical issues from typing these reports, such as broken bones, spine or joint conditions, and many types of cancer.
-1	When I had my first heart attack I was in really bad shape. When I got out I was given all of these different types of exercises to follow every day in order to keep me in tact with my health.

1	It really breaks down to being able to do math cause so much of it is based on a percentages. 
-1	My children had fevers reading over 100. I knew this was no cause for concern because infant temperatures often read higher and to watch their behavior and stools instead for any inconsistencies.
1	Most of my knowledge of health issues would have to be because of my husband who has several of the health issues that you listed in your examples/questions above. He has diabetes, high cholesterol, has had stints put in twice and was diagnosed with prostate cancer, high blood pressure and others. He doesn't fit the norm for most of these, not overweight, gets plenty of exercise and is active, etc. So I have learned quite a bit through his treatments and issues. 
1	A couple of years ago, I had some kind of a bump on my upper leg. It kind of freaked me out, not knowing what it was and how it developed. But instead of worrying too much about it and running to the doctor I just watched it to see if it began to hurt or get bigger. I didn't want to scare myself or my family too much about it so I just waited. I also didn't look anything up online, knowing that that would only make me much more anxious and scared. Eventually, it went away, as I believe it was just from stress or something.
1	Family members with cancer, and a mother with a very odd medical history, mostly unexplained.
1	When I eat and want to figure out how many calories I ate I can calculate that easily .

Every single time I have to remind him that it is the thalassemia minor which is NOT treatable, especially not with iron supplements.
1	When my father was still around, he tripped over a shovel in the backyard. he couldn't get up, so he called me with his cell phone. I only lived about 10 minutes away so i drove over and entered through the backyard. his ankle was swollen pretty badly. So I helped him up and brought him inside. I knew we probably had to take him to the hospital to get it checked out, but him being a stubborn old man, he refused. I had him sit in a chair and brought another chair over so he could elevate his leg. I put a pillow under his foot and taped an ice pack around his ankle. We them argued for about 15 minutes about going to the doctor and I eventually convinced him to talk to an advise nurse. The advice nurse told him to elevate his leg and keep it iced. If it didn't improve within a half hour, to come in to be checked. 3 hours pass and nothing improved, so I eventually got him to agree to go to the hospital.

-1	i think just going to the doctor all these years and listineing to her has really educated me in so many things but i google a lot of symptons too and learn a lot fron the internet web md
1	This is kind of a hard question to answer. I have never had any serious medical issues persolly. I have extensive knowledge of many issues my father had prior to his death. He was a diabetic, along with the majority of his siblings and mother. I know that there could be a high probability that I could acquire diabetes myself if I don't take care of my body by watching what I eat and exercising  regularly.
1	I had blood work done and my glucose level was 130. My doctor was worried that this was elevated. I explained I had just eaten shortly before my blood work. I asked if there was a reading on my A1C. My A1C was checked and not a cause for concern. I had my glucose re-tested later that week and it was below 100.

1	I like helping people figure out the dosage recommended of a specific medicine and also look up symptoms to try and diagnose an ailment.

1	Once I was in the woods when I fell and cut myself badly on the thigh. I was able to use my belt as a tourniquet. I cared a small pack with some medical supplies. Once the bleeding was stopped, I sanitized the wound with alcohol then applied some crazy glue to close the wound at the surface. I slowly made my way from the woods to my car while loosening the tourniquet every fifteen minutes or so to prevent further injury to my leg. 
1	When I was a young child my little brother had chicken pox. My parent didn't speak English that well so I filled the medical form for them.
-1	I suppose helping a friend who's wife was pregnt as I had gone through the same thing a year prior.
-1	When the doctors told me I have a leaky heart valve they explained to me that my heart was pumping some of the blood backwards, or regurgitating. 
-1	The time that I had IVF's.  I learned a lot about difficulty of having a baby.
1	It is difficult to say but I have a certification in CPR, I exercise regularly, received all my vaccitions because I believe in them.
-1	I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease so I researched it which led me to know that there is no cure for it.  Doctors still don't know what caused it.  People get it in their 20s.  There is a class of drugs called 5-ASAs which are prescribed for maintence of my condition.  I'm taking Lialda, which is a 5-ASA, to reduce flareups of Crohn's Disease.
-1	I went through many years of doctor's trying to figure out a mysterious illness that I had. After some time, I decided to start doing some research on my own. I was able to come up with something that I thought fit my symptoms very well and was able to find a few doctors who agreed with me and gave me an official diagnosis. 
1	One day my mother told me she was having severe stomach pain.  The pain happened when her stomach was more empty.  Drinking milk relieved the pain.  I had heard of this and told her to go to the doctor and tell them she probably has an ulcer and needed some antibiotics.  She did that and came home with the antibiotics.  Her stomach pain went away for several years before flaring up again.  
1	I went to the doctor who was having a hard time explaining the pain I was feeling in my breast but I was able to help him articulate what he was trying to say. We laughed about it afterwards. He was a newer doctor.
1	I didn't have insurance and I had an abscess in my mouth where a tooth had decayed.  I ended up treating it with fish antibiotics.  This did the trick as I felt better in 2 days (but continued to take the antibiotics for a week).  A few weeks later I got the rest of the tooth removed at a dental school on the cheap.  But yeah I knew what to do in that instant without going to the emergency room and getting a huge bill and prescription I couldn't afford.
-1	"The first time my husband and I were expecting a baby, we found out that we had lost her at 13 weeks.  I was scheduled to have a D & C at the end of the week on Friday, but began to bleed on Wednesday.  The doctor had me come into the hospital to have a D & C on Wednesday evening.  On Friday, the doctor had me come back to the office for a check up.  I asked if I had been given RhoGam (since I have A+ blood) and was told I was not.   The day I was seen was right before the office was going to close for the Easter weekend.  Had I not asked about the RhoGam and had they not rushed to filly give it to me, the 72 hour would have been missed due to the Easter break.  This doctor knew my blood type but ""forgot"" to give me RhoGam until I asked for it!"
1	I used to have to help my grandmother often with her diabetes issues so I am familiar with what most people typically have to do. One day while I was at work, an older coworker of mine started to feel faint because of low blood sugar. I was able to get her something to eat and helped her restore her blood sugar levels back to normal.
1	This one here has; it's likely shown how inept I am at math.
-1	When I had a bunch of fertility tests done. I had to go over everything from my cholesterol to vitamin deficiencies. 
1	My son had a sore throat recently.  He had the sniffles due to allergies and I thought that was the issue at first, but when I took a flashlight and looked at his throat, it was very raw.  Also, he was running a low grade fever.  I knew it must be strep.  Sure enough, the doctor confirmed it.  
-1	I have had a lot of UTI and kidney issues over the years. i was diagnosed with a UTI a few years back and took medication for it but i didn't feel that was right and kept researching my symptoms. Everything was pointing to stones and a few days later i passed a kidney stone. I learned all about the causes, effects, and preventatives to kidney stones
1	"I guess I would have to say one of the million or so times I had to deal with medical situations with raising three sons.  Looking back, it seems like one or the other of them was always hurt or sick!  They did keep me on my ties.  if we had ran to the doctor every time they ""stubbed a toe"", I would still be paying off doctor bills."
1	I have worked in a parasitology lab.  This has given me the knowledge to know the symptoms of various parasitic diseases as well as the ability to positively identify various blood stage parasites in blood smear. 
1	My mother had an inner ear infection that led to an absess in her brain. She was hospitalized with quite a few surgeries, and spend a couple of months in rehabilitation. There were several doctors explaining several things over the course of her treatment and recovery. 
1	My son has minor asthma symptons so I did some research and ended up understanding the causes and treatments.  There was a time when my son was having some chest pains and having a hard time breathing.  I couldn't find his inhaler so I had him stand in front of the freezer where I learned that the cool air helps with the breathing.  
1	One experience I had that showed my knowledge of health issues was dealing with the hospital when I had a kidney stone. It took 8 visits to get them to listen to me, and search what should have been the first step. I knew they were wrong, and being neglectful, so I pressed them further, and made them do their jobs.
1	I actually had a bacterial infection in my lungs and had went to a doctor who claimed it was a cold. I tried telling him I had no symptoms of a cold and he would not budge and told me to get some Robitussin or something similar. I ended up going to ER where I was diagnosed with a bacterial infection and receive the proper anti bacterial  medicine and within  two days the cough started to subside. Most Dr's just don't bother to spend the time anymore to ask and simply generalize what they think it is based on whatever may be widespread at the time as opposed to your symptoms.
1	I was quite athletic when I was growing up. Did a lot of weight training and exercise physiology. When I injured myself and had to go to physical therapy. Everything that the therapist was talking about made perfect sense to me, and the verbiage and actual motions used during the exercises were all ready within my muscle memory.
1	I just listen to what my doctor tells me.  If I don't understand, i just ask questions.  I saw my doctor, last week for a check up.  this applies then.  I have no real knowledge of health or medical issues.
-1	I just do a lot of research. I read a lot of books on medicine, illnesses and the medical profession and ethics. I watch a lot of documentaries on the topic also and my mother was a nurse.  
1	I was able to take a basic health class and passed it with a high grade, as well I have learned CPR and basic nutrition. I am able to take my own blood pressure and keep records of it and take my basic vital signs.
1	I helped my mother through a breast cancer fight and pallative care for pancreatic cancer.
1	I felt congested and had pain in my chest.  I could feel it when I inhaled.  There was a gurgling sound.  I went to the doctor and told him I had pneumonia.  He said he'd be the judge of that.  When the x-rays came back.  He agreed.
1	I have ran many marathons successfully and taken care of all recovery that had to do with it without any outside help.
1	My friend had recently had recently had a miscarriage and was having problems afterwards that was effecting her work and home life. I suggested that she might have reactive depression which is something that can happen after a miscarriage. She went to see a doctor and he confirmed I was correct. He put her on some medication and she saw a therapist which real he helped her get back to her usual self.
1	"I recently learned I have the MTHFR genetic defect from both parents (homozygous). I researched the genetic mutation issue and came to understand that my body does not ""methylize"" properly. In particular, my ability to convert folate to a useble form is compromised by about 70%. This has an effect on the efficiency of many methylation and detox pathways in my body. This also means I am more suspectible to certain health issues (fertility issues, depression, heart and vascular disease, Parkinson's). Some experts believe there are dietary and nutritiol options that can help to offset some of the effects of the ""mutation."" I am pretty well versed in what they are at this point."
1	I have never had an experience like this before. 
-1	when I was having an extremely hard time breathing I knew something was wrong, I went to the hospital and discovered that I had two PE's in my right lung. I knew it was more than my asthma and I knew it was in my right lung.
1	My daughter has had recurring fevers over the last few years. We've been to our pediatrician and specialists multiple times trying to discover the cause. It's led me to do significant research on auto-inflammatory syndromes, comparing her symptoms to those of the various recognized disorders. While certainly not a doctor, I feel fairly knowledgeable on auto-inflammatory disorders as a result.
1	Recently I've seen that I have more health problems if I sleep less, and my health is better if I sleep more.  So I've been trying to sleep more because sometimes if I sleep less my ear starts hurting.
1	"I've been dealing with back pain for a while (over a few years) so throughout my pain 'journey' i have researched anything from sciatica, plantar fasciitis (which caused this whole thing from the beginning) as well as knowing different terminology for my symptoms as well as the body parts...like explaining to my (new) chiropractor and/or physical therapist which part of my body that are having problems and what kind of exercises i've done. I actually have gone to my doctor at one point (for a follow up visit) and he started our conversation with ""So, what did your online research find?"" and after I explained what I've found he confirmed yes/no on what I read and it was quite a good and efficient meeting."
1	I was feeling a shortness of breath. The doctor thought I was having an asthma attack but here it was just because I had not excericsed in a while and this was catching up to me. I had to slowly bring my excercise up rather than jump in right away.
1	when my husband had to have surgery i had to help him fill out the paperwork and try to explain to him when was going to happen and how i would take care of him
1	A close friend developed high blood pressure and prediabetes. Doctors put him on medication that he didn't want to take, and they gave him a (truly) lousy diet and exercise program that would've ensured he stayed on the meds forever. I cleaned up his diet, got him on a sensible training program, and now he doesn't need to take any medication.
1	My exposure to medical topics began when I was very young. I grew up on a dairy farm and when I was about 10 I started helping the vet when they came to do herd checks, etc. I have worked in hospitals as a med tech in the ED and lab so I am very comfortable around it when I am not the patient. In my late 20s I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and that was when things began to go downhill health-wise. I had to learn a lot about autoimmune diseases and honestly believe if I hadn't fired my docs at the end of 1999, I would be dead now.
1	I play basketball a lot. I was also interested in sports medicine. I have twisted my ankle numerous times over the years. My knowledge on how to treat sprains was an asset to me. 
-1	I have completed a c program several years ago, I have also taken a medical terminology course and enjoy medical tv shows.
1	Several years ago I had a problem with my left shoulder. I would feel intense pain in my shoulder when I would to certain motions, but at other times it was not a problem. I thought it was shoulder impingement syndrome. I knew about this because two of my birding friends had the same problem and talked to me about it and the symptoms and the physical therapy treatments for it. So when it happened to me I thought I knew what it was right away. When I went to the doctor (who is NOT the same doctor I have now) he sent me to an orthopedic surgeon who confirmed that. But I already knew what it was, I just wanted to get the referral to start the physical therapy. I wish my doctor had listened to me more carefully and had given me the referral himself because I would have started treatment two weeks earlier.
1	My friend told me about a disorder they had called celiac disease and I already knew quite a lot about the disorder. 
-1	My blood pressure was high. I began to eat better and exercise. When it remained high, I talked to my doctor and started blood pressure meds.
-1	a coworker complained of have the worst sore throat he had ever had i told him he need to get that checked out because if strep  is left unchecked it can damage the heart  he went to the doctor and he had strep
1	When my mother was diagnosed as diabetic, we were told to limit her carb intake. I spent time reading several guides given to me by her doctor and attending two classes given by a registered dietitian. Through diet and medication, we were able to lower her fasting glucose levels significantly.
1	My mom had ALS.  We cared for her at home for 10 years with nursing help during the day.  She was non ambulatory. She was on a ventilator and feeding tube for the majority of that time. I knew how to administer her medication and feed her, change her catheter, change out vent tubing, suction her throat.  She needed total care.  I could care for her myself when we did not have a nurse.  
1	My niece called me and asked about symptoms she was having. I had a good idea of what could be wrong. I told her it was my best guess and that she should see the doctor. It turned out my educated guess was correct.
1	I had leg swelling, and red blotches above my ankles, so I went to a clinic that open.  The doctor there told me that I had cellulitis, but I didn't think so because there was too much pain involved.  I decided to go the hospital ER and get a different opinion.  After the results of the tests, I was informed that I had three blood clots in my outer vein.  I was given antibiotics and a list of doctors to see for the recommended surgery.
-1	I get migraines so it's interesting to see what causes it 
1	Sometimes the math of medicine is a little bit confusing and you have to be very careful not to make any mistakes.
1	I was able to lose weight a few years ago when I realized that I needed to. I lost about 30 pounds, which was my goal. I accomplished this weight loss by avoiding junk food, eating more fruits and vegetables, and walking every day. I still follow these healthy routines so I can stay fit and healthy.
1	When my son broke his hand and required surgery I needed to be able to understand the doctor as well as the aftercare, etc.  
1	I did my own research on some skin conditions. After successful application of ointments I discovered during my research I felt quite competent about self-treatment of those skin conditions.
1	I cant think of any one specific incident.  There have been a few times I have administered first aid like the heimlich maneuver or recognized someone needed to go to the hospital because of a fever or difficulty breathing, etc.
-1	I worked in the service as a nurse aid and learned a lot about the basics
1	I was trying to figure out my results from a blood test.  Much of the information was abbreviated or included terms I was not used to, so I would use the internet to look up the definitions to help determine the results.
-1	I suffer from high blood pressure and obesity I have to monitor everything.
1	There hasn't really been just one significant experience that demonstrates my knowledge of health and medical issues. There's just small things that I do to alleviate or resolve medical issues that pop up. For example, I take apple cider vinegar for my indigestion because I know that I have low stomach acid. And I take frequent breaks and move around to prevent my sciatica nerve from acting up.
-1	I care for my mother moderately. She is independent and usually takes care of herself but doesn't have information on important health facts. One afternoon she described to me how she had had difficulties pouring her coffee, she explained how she had to hold one arm with the other to even lift minimally. I insist recognized the symptoms of stroke. We went to the ER where they did find she had a stroke.
1	I had two C-sections. Once when I was 23 and one when I was 27. After the first one I tried to look up a lot more information about C-sections and surgery in general, because I figured I would need another C-section with my second child. I was a lot more informed by the time I had my second C-section, which made the process a lot easier and more comforting for me. I knew what was about to happen, so I did not have to worry as much as I did with the first C-section.
1	I don't know a lot about health or medical issues.  When I have questions I refer to professiols or any other reliable source of information.
1	I found out I have Restless Legs Syndrome a few years ago. My doctor had some recommendations, but I did a bit of my own research and found out that low-normal levels of ferritin (stored iron) can exacerbate it. I was then able to follow up with the doctor and get a ferritin test, and confirmed that I should reduce my frequency of doting blood and take an iron supplement when I do. That helped reduce the intensity of my RLS symptoms.
1	I can comprehend health materials as I am very good in science and math. I always look at ways to reduce my risk.
-1	I was not feeling well one day and could not figure out what was going on. So I went online and pulled up WebMD and searched for all the symptoms I was having and was able to rrow it down to 2 possible things. In doing this I was able to give my doctor a better account of what I was going through.
1	The increasing pain, stiffness and swelling in my big toes and ankles was an indicator that I had a problem with arthritis, since it was persistent but fluctuated in intensity depending on the weather, not due to trauma or recent injury, and consistent with the development of arthritis in my aunt when she reached the age I'm at now.
-1	When I had my spil cord tumor I did a lot of research.It has come in handy with  neurologists I have seen over the years.For the fact some are just not experienced with that type of tumor.I have probably taught them a thing or two.
1	Getting preventive care and treatment.  Understanding the blood work data, the colonoscopy and all related.  To be able to know what I needed to improve on and to watch.
1	When I was told I had high cholesterol not only did I understand the changes I would have to make I also further researched the issue to make sure I was on the best diet and treatment possible and brought up with my doctor a couple of concerns I had. I was proactive in trying to understand this issue and with work, I did.
-1	I told my mother to get a flu vaccine as I knew it was helpful.
-1	I am learning about health and medical issues every day. I have several medical problems that I see a doctor about monthly and I frequently have to go to specialists for this test or that.
1	My children will frequently get sick, and my two year old recently had a slight fever of 99.6, but I simply gave him some over the counter Tylenol, and made sure he stayed hydrated with water and Gatorade. My six year old had the same conditions of fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. I knew it was probably a virus, and did not feel it was necessary to take him to the doctor for it.
-1	I received training as a home health aid and participated in certifications such as CPR and First Aid training.
1	Once I remember seeing a medical category on Jeoparody!, the game show. I think I got almost every answer.
1	Not sure if this is what you are looking for but true story. A few years ago I experienced severe pain in my feet that lasted for weeks. I looked up the symptoms and was reasobly sure it was something called plantar fasciitis (sp?). It HURT. I went to my doctor and he agreed with my assessment. Unfortutely there doesn't seem to be an effective treatment other than stretching and not walking (or walking as little as possible) for many months to allow the muscles in the foot to heal. Near the end of the appointment my doctor offered me a shot of cortisone for the pain. I was surprised and promptly refused. The problem with the cortisone shot, in my opinion, is that it simply masks the pain and might lead me to overdo it during a time when I needed to rest, thus making the injury worse instead of better. It took over a year for the problem to go away. Even though I suffered through the pain I feel I made the right choice because the cortisone shot might have made the recovery last even longer!
-1	I saw him live with my mom
1	After having a stress test done I am now informed about all the risks and causes of heart attack and stroke. I had a false positive stress test, but I feel that I have gained a lot of knowledge associated with the heart. Now I have a lot of knowledge and useful information to help take care of my heart and help my family take care of theirs.
1	I studied and researched and read a lot about different forms of birth control before I went to my OBGyn and talked about the best method for me. I think she was impressed that I was so knowledgeable. 
-1	Someone close to me started to freak out about a bump in their buttocks--from persol experience--that sounds like hemorrhoids. I was quite surprised that she was freaking out about such a thing, but it indeed turned out to be hemorrhoids. Another one that comes to mind is that a friend said he had abdomil issues and other related symptoms of appendicitis--I only thought of it because I did some research myself in fear of having it. When he went to his Doctor, it turns out I was correct.
-1	I was given a choice to get a flu shot I was told of all the side effects and I decided to get it.  Later I felt awful.  I called the doctor he stated that it happens sometimes.  I should just drink a lot of fluids and rest.
-1	when my boyfriend was complaining about symptoms in his hands, i suggested that he had carpal tunnel. i knew this because my mom had similar issues with her hand/wrist and it was very likely carpal tunnel. he went to the doctor and he indeed had carpal tunnel. 
1	I have a family with a medical background on both sides of the clipboard.  This survey is mostly simple math.
1	Knowledge of my medical condition has helped me to avoid putting myself in a situation where I would be endangered. I know that I will put myself at risk if I do certain things that would increase my heart rate. I also need to slowly raise my health level through proper eating and strengthening myself to make my heart work less. Therefore by overhauling my nutrition and by avoiding those situations I have demonstrated knowledge of health issues. 
1	My family has a long history of medical issues, primarily autoimmune diseases. It has been imperative we stay as healthy as possible as many doctors are not knowledgeable in this field. Treatment is typically left to us and in several cases had better medical knowledge been obtained, lives would have been extended. One family member was lost due to a medical mistake, another to incorrect diagnoses, and another has had quality of life severely impaired because of incorrect diagnoses. I struggle with my own health and have two children with a complex medical history. I have also become the primary caregiver to my mother who is now severely impaired. If I am not fully aware and knowledgeable then the risks are simply too great. It's worth it to me to learn and understand all that I possibly can.  
1	I am working to lower my A1C count due to being pre-diabetic along with trying to lower my cholesterol. I am exercising and cutting back on sweets. I am also cutting back on my fat intake. I have been working on this for the past 5 months. I will be tested again in one month. I have read many articles and talked with my doctor regarding these tests.
-1	I spent a half a year researching if I had diabetes or not.  I found out a lot of things that contributed to diabetes, so I lost weight and balanced out my hormones. I also looked into people who reversed diabetes.  This saved me from the disease. 
1	An experience in my life that has demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is when I researched an upcoming procedure for my husband and got information about it and gave him suggestions as to things to bring up with his doctor.
1	One of my coworkers sees the same doctor as I do.  She was telling me about a recent visit and had a question about some of her blood work.  I was able to answer her questions because I had experience in similar blood work.
1	I helped to take care of my diabetic brother when he was little. I had to use nutritiol labels to determine how many carbs he had eaten and then figure out how many units of insulin he needed to take. 
-1	When I was in health class and gave a presentation on joints and arthritis.
-1	Never
1	It was a time in summer, when one of my friend started feeling dizziness while playing in sun. We helped him to get him under the shadow and had him drank some water and after that he was felling better.
1	When I helped a family member that had very serious issues I took the family member to all the medical appointments and stayed in the hospital through all the surgeries with them.  I don't know if that demonstrates knowledge but I learned a lot of knowledge doing it I think.
1	My mother was having back problems, anemia and hair loss. The doctors didn't know what was wrong. I did my own research and asked the doctor to test for a genetic condition that was not common in our racial group . The doctor agreed to run the test and it turns out, my mother had the condition, also so do I.
1	Once when visiting a doctor I was asked if I understood everything and explained everything correctly to my doctor.
-1	When I was diagnosis with cerebellar ataxia.  I never heard of this disorder nor did anybody I know.  I have done a lot of research over the past five years including a couple facebook groups.
-1	just what i eat and looking at labels. trying to stay within the 2k calorie of a daily intake of food and try to eat more healthy.
1	I have chronic shoulder pain that has been worsening for 25 years.  I know nothing can be done except pain pills.  I do not take them because I know I might become addicted.
1	One time I was stabbed in the. Because I knew that it had hit one of the main arteries I new to go to the hospital immediatley.
-1	I have moderate experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues. I am somewhat confident.
1	I had a colonoscopy at 32, that showed and removed several polyps, two pre-cancerous. I was told to have a repeat colonoscopy every 3 years, even though my 2nd generation family has a genetic defect that causes a greater, aggressive risk, and the fact that I was only 32. I researched the subject and decided to have one every year. Good thing, because for the next eight years, they always found some. Now I have one every three, if they don't find anything.
1	"I found a mole on my back that met some, but not all aspects of looking suspicious. When I brought it up to my PC doc,  but he wasn't really convinced.  I had to insist on a derm referral,  because I was fairly certain based on my research that the markers it did have meant it was bad. I did get the referral and the derm took one look at it and said,  yep that's coning of today. Though it eventually turned out to be ""really weird"" but not cancer,  i still felt I made the right call by insisting. "
1	I had a class in college that medical questions such as these on this survey. I did pretty well in that class. I was able to finish with a 87 in the class.
1	I took my mother to a health clinic to have them look at a problem she was having with her foot. there was a sign on the wall telling people they should report when they have been outside the country. I asked the doctor why weren't they interested when and if people traveled to Florida and may have been bitten by a mosquito. she agreed that that would be a good idea, but I doubt they printed up new posters or asked anyone then or now
1	I was able to successfully perform the Heimlich maneuver for a gentleman that needed my help.  I was able to successfully pass CPR courses which demonstrates knowledge of medical issues.
1	When I had a job working with kids for the city. I was able to tell when some of the kids were sick.
1	Just having minor health issues throughout my life I have learned to tell the minor from the major issues. The advent of the internet has also made information more accessible and readily available.
1	I found my mother passed out on the toilet.  I knew there was something about pressure on the vagus nerve that could make you pass out.  I remembered she needs to get blood to her head so I put her head down.  She came to a little and we were able to get her to lay on the bed.  Then she became totally awake and  responsive.  We still went to the emergency room, but she was fine.
1	As a medical professiol, my everyday experiences are  a constant testament of my medical expertise and knowledge given my involvement in patient care. 
-1	when i noticed symptoms in one of my friends and told him to see a doctor 
-1	I have endometriosis and had some of my female organs removed but some were left in me. I was able to recognize the signs and symptoms of the endometriosis flaring up and getting worse on my own and was able to make an appointment and my doctor confirmed I was correct. 
1	My brother has type I diabetes. He recently came to visit and in the morning he was unresponsive. I knew that his blood sugar must be low because he was incoherent and combative. I called 911 and when the paramedics arrived I explained what had happened and they were able to quickly check his blood sugar and give him a glucose drip to bring it back up. 
1	My experience is based on news stories, persol experiences, family experiences, now outdated first aid courses, and college biology. I have used my knowledge to determine when I or a family members need to go to a doctor or emergency room and to reassure and explain  information to my niece and nephew. 
-1	I had a doctor present to me various things about my check up. I understood what my blood pressure was and things like that. Just had a good common awareness of the information.
1	Being pregnt and giving birth to my children gave me good experiences with medical fields and medical documentation. 
1	"I'm not really terribly interested in ""wet"" sciences. Because, frankly, ""Eww."" I understand what I read and I don't leave the health of my children to chance, but I don't go out of my way to seek out new medical knowledge."
1	i have been around the medical field for about 20 years, but when it comes to being a patient i am like a novice. it is very hard for me to process being sick, i mostly have denial over it. as far as knowledge, i now a lot about health from working in health related fields.
1	I would get strep throat regularly in the past. I don't exhibit the common symptoms associated with it, but I knew I had it. I made the doctor take a culture. It confirmed strep. The next time I had it, I opted to NOT take antibiotics, stay home for 3 days with lots of hydrations and Advil to keep my fever down. My hopes were to get over it and build a tolerance to it. It worked and I have not had strep throat in the decade since. Most recently, after breaking out with a skin rash of sorts, I figured out it was dyshidrotic eczema and went to the doctor. Without me telling her what I thought it was, she diagnosed it the same. This has also happened with a less common diagnosis of Bells Palsy and other issues.
1	I don't know much about the medical issues I have before I'm dealing with them in the hospital. I've had an infected foot that I didn't know how to treat or take care of and it got out of hand and landed me in the hospital.

1	A few years ago, a nurse practitioner prescribed buspirone for my anxiety. I reminded him that psychiatric drugs in general tend to affect me much more strongly than they do most people, and suggested that I should start at the lowest dose possible. He wrote the prescription for the second lowest dose available. When I got home with the medication, I broke the tablets into quarters for the first week, then into halves for the next week. I didn't have any adverse effects, but did not really see any positive effects either, so on the third week, I took whole tablets as prescribed. I got very useated, extremely dizzy, and found it nearly impossible to stay awake. I continued at the recommended dose, thinking that maybe these were side effects that would wear off with time, but they persisted. I tried to reach the nurse practitioner, but he was on vacation and I didn't feel comfortable discussing it with anyone else in the office, so I went online and looked up information about the medication. I learned that what I was experiencing were symptoms of a severe overdose of the medication. Going to an emergency room was recommended, but I felt certain that no one would listen to me if I tried to explain my drug sensitivity and that they'd probably think I took some illegal drug. I'm aware that some psychiatric drugs recommend tapering off rather than stopping abruptly, so I looked for this information online and found that while it's not recommended to stop abruptly, in some situations it may be necessary. I decided that this was one of those situations, so I stopped taking the medication. The symptoms decreased appreciably within several hours, and though there was some lingering dizziness, everything else was more or less back to normal within a few days.

I also knew I needed a supplement with not only estrogen but progesterone.  So I was sure to notice the physician gave me the right prescription.

It is unusual for me to be woken up in the middle of the night by anything, so I was concerned and went to get a glass of water. It hurt to swallow, so I decided to see what my throat looked like. When I found that there were white spots on the back of my throat, I knew that it could be strep throat and went in to the doctor. The test came back positive for strep throat. 
1	A couple of years ago, I stepped off the front porch of my new home and into a hole that was covered in leaves.  It was instant blinding pain for a few seconds, then I crawled into my house.  My ankle was huge and I couldn't put any pressure on it.  Everyone insisted that I go to the ER, but I looked up how to test fractured/broken vs. sprained ankles.  Canada actually had a great write up on it, apparently ER visits due to sprained ankles seriously hurt their socialized medicine policy due to costs.  I did their tests, and correctly diagnosed my sprained ankle then treated it accordingly.
-1	When I was younger and my mom was sick. I did a lot of reading and research because I wanted to make sure my mom was going to be ok. I took care of my mom knew what medicine she needed. I knew when she needed it and when she had to go to the hospital I knew what to tell the doctors and nurses.
1	i went the doctor once because i was having some problems. i had googled my symptoms and done some research to see what might be going on. the doctor diagnosed me with the same thing that i had suspected i had, so i felt like i had done a good job looking into it myself
1	I fell out of a tree and hurt my neck. I didn't actually think I was hurt that bad but I made myself stop what I was doing and think about it.  Then I realized I could have hurt myself badly even if it didn't feel like it at the time. I ended up having somebody take me to the hospital (they didn't think I was hurt much either).  I ended up have a shattered vertabrae in my neck.  good thing i went to the hospital.
1	I don't really have any experiences that demonstrate medical knowledge.  I just try to do what my doctor and the government tell me to do to maintain good health.  Overall, the strategy has worked, and I feel that I am in good health.
1	A few years ago, I found out my dad had diabetes. Now we know more about it and my sister and I are more careful with our health so that we don't get it in the future.
1	I had a c section and a few weeks later after a long car ride my right leg was in a great deal of pain. It turned purple and swelled up. I went to the ER and said I had a blood clot and I was right.
-1	When my son was chocking I had to give him the hem lick maneuver.It was the scariest thing ever. Thankfully, it worked and the piece of hot dog dislodged from his throat. 
1	I actually do not have very much experience about any particular medical issues I have had many medical issues as have my family but we were so busy trying get to figure out how all the systems worked that it was hard to focus on the actual medical issues.
1	I don't have any extensive training or education on health or medical issue. My experience is very limited to just what I learn on the internet and from my doctor. Basic diagnosis of a typical cold, fever, flu are very simple to figure out. Any abnormal pain in the body will require a doctor visit. If it's just something I am not familiar with, a visit to the doctor will usually answer the question.
-1	When it comes to physical there are not that many. But it's more of the emotional ones that I have a better understanding of.
1	I once had UTI in a row within couple of months.  Before I sees the doctor the 2nd time, I research information from the internet.  I don't use FB, I use Mayo clinic or Wikipedia.  Anyway when I met with the doctor and I start to ask him questions and telling him about when I find from online.  His answer to me was, you possibly know more than me since you researched the topic.
1	My wife is a nurse so I often consult her if I feel like I'm in need of medical attention. I have seasonal allergies so it's not uncommon to have sore throats, runny noses, and coughing at various times of the year. Occasionally, those symptoms are very severe. In the fall, I have a severe cough that was not going away and she thought that it was just allergies. I couldn't take it anymore and felt that it was probably worse and went to the doctors - it was bronchitis.
1	After becoming dehydrated my heart was beating more rapidly and harder. After drinking plenty of fluids it went back to normal.
1	When my mother in law had a heart attack, one of the first things I did was make sure she had taken some aspirin. I know that, because it's a blood thinner, aspirin can help with heart attacks and improve people's chances.
1	I had a swollen lymph node a while back that was not tender to the touch, and I had no other disease like symptoms.  the doctor thought it was best to remove the lymph node and biopsy it for lymphoma.  the results were negative.
-1	Before I thought about having my last surgery I read online and in medical journals about the pro and cons of the procedure before having it done. I wanted to know the facts for myself before making that decision.
-1	I did take some courses on medical administration. But really my knowledge came from person experience thru my mom who had quite a bit of medical issues. 
1	I have a wife with severe COPD and a heart condition that developed while she was in the hospital for her breathing.  I spent many hours talking with the nurses and the doctors as well as on line researching her conditon.  I was able to visit with her for 12 hours a more a day while she was in the hospital and monitor the care she was given.  A few times my research paid off such as the time they wanted to clean her room and I had to ask them to not use areosal due to her COPD and the fact that the areosol triggered it.
1	I saw the history of weight gain within my family, and also saw that I was starting to gain weight. I decided that while I had not gained a significant amount of weight yet, and while my schedule best allowed for it in the stage of life that I was in (i.e., I had a lot of free time), I wanted to take matters into my own hands and gain control of my weight before it became harder to do so. I exercised and took better care in terms of watching what I ate, and was able to gain control over my weight.
1	My mother was very sick most of my childhood, so I picked information here and there from her pamphlets and also her doctors. Also, in college I was in a Physician Assistant program where I started to learn a lot about health and medical issues. To get into that program, I had to shadow a doctor or PA for 500 hours, so I also absorbed a lot of information from there. 
-1	The only situation I can remember right now is that once I helped my mother understand the instructions for a treatment that she needed to have at home
-1	Whenever I think about experiences in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health and medical issues, I think about my grandpa having a heart attack. I remember sitting in the living room of my grandparents house with my grandpa and grandma and then all of a sudden my grandpa started rubbing his chest and saying that he had a tight pain and I continued asking him questions and trying to figure out exactly what it was that was wrong with him and if he needed to be taken to the hospital and eventually, I told him that we needed to go because he was having a heart attack and it turned out that he had.
1	In my early 30s I got serious about taking care of myself. I started going to the gym consistently. I started building muscle, my cardiovascular fitness improved, I could do more activities without getting tired and stopped having dizzy spells. I started reading diet-related articles, reading nutritional labels and cutting out saturated fat and excessive sugar, and increasing protein intake. I replaced fat with muscle and my energy increased.
1	Several years back, I had an outbreak and tested positive for herpes. I knew that the virus can have long dormant periods so I did not jump to conclusions about my wife because it could have been either one of our previous partners that transmitted it.
1	I am diagnosed with schizophrenia and am fairly knowledgeable about the disease. I enjoy learning about it and having knowledge about it.
1	When my sister was very young she choked on a marble. I had my little brother start the Heimlich maneuver right away while I called 911.
-1	I have an auto-immune disease and I researched to learn what to do, eat and which medication would make me feel my best. I also spoke to others with the disease and got input from them as well. I also found a doctor who helped me understand my disease better. 
-1	I experienced tachycardia (rapid heart rate) in my early 20's. This ailment can be caused by a plethora of different things, and it can be overwhelming worrying about what the certain cause is. I did an immense amount of research on my own in order to better understand how to prevent this. Later in life, I met someone who experience the same problem, and was confused. I was able to provide temporary relief to this person because of my past knowledge and experience with tachycardia.
1	I try to stick to the healthy diet and exercise a couple of times a week to be healthy. So i don't really have a lot of experience of health issues.
1	When I delivered my third child, I went into the hospital knowing exactly what to expect. I was prepared to fill out all the paperwork given to me, had all my medications noted, and had a very seamless delivery since I had been through it twice before. I was even allowed to leave after one night instead of the usual 2-3 night stay since I knew what to do. 
1	I explained to a doctor how h. pylori causes gastric cancer and is considered a dangerous carcinogen by the World Health Organization.
1	I have to keep track of my dad's health information such as weight, body temperature, and medications after he received a liver transplant last year. The anti rejection medicine that he takes has to be taken every 12 hours for the rest of his life and he has to adjust the dosage based on his monthly blood work. I help him a lot because I want him to stay healthy and I enjoy helping him.
1	I am able to help my mother manage her blood sugar by testing it after a meal and ensuring that it is less than 180 mg/dl
-1	I have had testicular cancer before and I gathered all the information from many doctors.  I just support forums to gather anymore information.  I also reached out to people that I knew had cancer. 
1	All of the years I have worked as a nurse. Twenty years is how long I worked on  medical floor in acute care. Experience is everything.

1	When I went to my last doctor, she remarked that I have done my research. This is because I asked specific questions about my illness which I only could have known had I done my research already.
-1	i am experienced in the knowledge of what you have presented me with to answer the questions that you are asking me. I have heard of these things or saw them in real life.
-1	I cant say for sure that I have had an experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues. I prefer to trust my doctor and/or nurses that are available to demonstrate their knowledge.
-1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues happened when I discovered that I was allergic to barley. After consulting medical sources, I was able to communicate to food servers that I needed gluten free meals that did not come in contact with cross-contaminated foods containing wheat or rye.
-1	When I was pregnant with my daughter. I was given instruction to perform the test at home and needed to calculate my intake of sugar and carbohydrates. I was able to do it my self and I was able to understand everything
1	I had a nodule on my thyroid that I was concerned about. My daughter was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 15, so I already knew a lot about the disease. It helped me tremendously because I knew exactly what to expect, as well as general information about thyroid cancer, thyroid disorders, goiter, etc. I knew that the lump was not normal, and I also knew that I should have a biopsy just to make sure.
1	I recently had to tape off of some medication. First by taking half my dose for the first 7 days, then  1/4 of my dosage for the next 7 days. After the first 7 days I also started my new medication. I was able to tape off the old meds and begin the new meds exactly as prescribed. 
1	I learned about medical issues through studying in college. I learned a lot by taking courses in exercise science, health promotion, and public health. Through assignments, lectures, and field work, I gained a much greater understanding of health and medical issues.
-1	When my dad was having stomach pains. I told him what medicines to take and what to drink to help calm the pain.
1	I can tell the doctors the side effects of many antibiotics and what drugs you shouldn't take with them. I know drugs in clinical trials that the doctors don't know about. I am the mother of two children with serious health conditions. This is a huge part of my life. I run a support group for others dealing with the same things. 
1	i noticed i had some sort of rash under my arm when i first started college.  i did some research online using several reputable websites.  i figured out what i probably had was a mild skin problem called eczema.  i saw that a doctor can prescribe a cream for this.  i made an appointment and my doctor prescribed a steroid cream and it worked great.
1	I used the best statistical anaylsis I could to determine the answers to the questions.  I really don't know how any medical knowledge would help in this scenario because these were all math problems.
1	My daugther had a recent bone tumor found in her fractured pinky. She was to have surgery by taking a bit of bone from her elbow to replace the weakened bone in her pinky which would also be filed down to remove the tumor part.
1	after a while of taking various medications, i did research on each one so that i could gain knowledge on whether or not i needed to keep taking each one, or whether i could lower the dosage. i used this knowledge to have an indepth conversation about the medications with my primary care physician on the next visit.

1	I know when i catch cold, what I need to take and what to do. I do not need to go to see a doctor while I had a fever.
1	When someone had heat stroke, I ran to them and figured out what was the cause. I didn't necessarily save their life but it definitely helped knowing what it was. 
-1	Not too long ago I was told that I had scar tissue on my liver.  This was caused years ago when my gall bladder ruptured.  I already knew what scar tissue was and how it could affect my liver.
-1	I have very little knowledge of medical issues. I am parent of two kids so I have had to use the little knowledge i have to take temperatures, treat fevers, upset stomachs and other ailments. My knowledge of head aches, which i have often has helped me with my kids in knowing what type of head ache they might be having and what could be causing it, whether it be dehydration or sinuses.

1	For some reason or another, I frequently get UTI's, so I pretty much recognize the signs.  I was able to inform others what to do when they got them. I explained to them what to drink, eat, and whether or not they should go see the doctor. 
1	These examples shown in the survey were simply mathematical equations. Someone who has no experience with health and medical issues would be able to figure these out.
1	Not to long ago my mother in law was diagnosed with cancer.  She had to have surgery, and then some chemotherapy to make sure everything was good.  My own mother spent two and a half years doing chemotherapy.  She was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic bone cancer.

1	The other day at work my coworkers and I were discussing the flu because a lot of people thought they had contracted it. I had done some reading on the flu, knew symptoms, how long it should last, etc. but many of my coworkers did not. They claimed to have gotten the flu, when in reality they just contracted some sort of virus that had similar symptoms to the flu.
1	I can always google what I need but going into the doctors or having a checkup and having them tell me my numbers for blood pressure and heart rate I can tell that those numbers are good for me or not. I keep an eye on my blood pressure and have actively worked to improve it over the years.

I saw that ate a lot of fatty and sugar foods and made no effort to improve his eating habits. In addition, I saw this his sugar level was high and that he did not have much physical activity. I went over all of the information with the nurse to confirm that everything I was reading was correct. She confirmed that the information was correct that I was giving to the patient. 
-1	I can't think of a time in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues.  (I am usually fairly good at figuring out my dog's health issues, but that doesn't help your survey results.)

1	I have correctly self-diagnosed certain conditions I have had or still have such as an hernia and blefaritis to name a few. I took a nutrition course at the University that completely open my eyes about healthy eating and has helped become the health conscious person  that  I am today. I believe that nutrition course should be mandatory starting at middle school at least.
1	I was told all kinds of things by emergency clinics but they could not pin point a certain condition I had. For example, I would experience flu like symptoms for days and even weeks before the symptoms would slowly go away.
1	I visited a doctor at my college campus a few years ago. She told me I needed to diet, and asked me what I was eating. I had come to a realization that I had been eating too much fast food. When the doctor told me about a diet plan, I asked questions, and she seemed of the opinion that I knew what I needed to do. I follow much of her advice, and began losing weight in the first week.
1	About one and a half years ago, I visited the emergency room due to pain in my lungs while breathing. The staff figured out that I had pulmonary embolisms and a blood clot in my heart. I was given a lot of information and I was able to understand most of it without too much struggle.

1	When I broke a bone in my foot my blood pressure readings were high.  Doctors and staff tried to put me on blood pressure medications.  I waited until after my injury was healed and until after I was able to start jogging again.  My blood pressure readings went down, and I successfully avoid the blood pressure medications.
1	When I had my heart attack, I really did not have conventional symptoms, but I knew something was wrong. Though I am not one to go to the doctor frequently, I nevertheless called 911. The EMTs didn't think I was having a heart attack and told me I could go to the ER or not, depending on what I wanted to do. I almost didn't go. I knew though that something was really wrong. I elected to go and went into cardiac arrest before we got to the hospital
-1	My daughter had the flu to where she was hospitalized a month ago and the she got the flu shot and then a week ago she got the flu again.  So that really made think about what is really effective when it comes to prevention of things

-1	There was many times that i had certain symptoms and i would read in books or study online about the possible ailments. I usually figured out the specific illness myself even before the doctor could.
1	After each of three babies, it was important to bring them to their many well baby check-ups. After my middle child experienced some difficulty with weight gain (he was gaining weight but not at the amount expected), I was on alert for the same issue with my third child. Indeed, it happened to him too, even though he did not have the gastric reflux issue that my middle child had had. By being on alert for it, I knew to take it seriously when the doctor pointed out the weight issue, even before the doctor was seeing it as much of a problem. 
1	i was diagnosed with colon cancer when i was the age of twelve, some ninteen years ago. Since day one i kept a journal of each day that owuld include how i felt, what i ate, what if any medical procedures i had done that day and whatever medications i was on at that time. I took every oppurtunity possible to learn as miuch as i could in regards to my doses and not once over the past twenty years did i stop doing this
-1	After having two back surgeries, and seeing five different physical therapists, three epidural injections, two chiropractors, and drugs. I know more about my spine and the L-5 / S-1 disc than I ever cared to know. 
1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was when my mother was complaining one night of having weird visual hallucinations of small bright lights. I took her blood pressure because she has a history of high blood pressure and it was about 170 systolic. I was concerned because her baseline systolic was around 130 on medication. Because of my knowledge, I was concerned that she may be at risk for stroke and her blood pressure was very high. I retook her blood pressure because if you get an abnormal reading, you should always recheck under the same circumstance. She had a headache also, so after rechecking her blood pressure was still around 170 systolic. I told her that we need to go to the ER because I was concerned about how high her BP is and her risk of stroke. She also smokes cigarettes, so her risk is increased. Her symptoms could have been dangerous and the abnormal visual hallucinations could have been aura for an oncoming migraine, but I didn't want to take any chances. I took her to the ER. She ended up being fine. 
1	One time I was discussing an abnormal looking mole on my friend's arm.  He was concerned it might be melanoma, and I told him about the ABCDEs of melanoma.  I told him he should definitely have it checked out because it exhibited some of these signs.
-1	Almost everyday I have to help friends out with some kind of medical or health knowledge, I'm actually really well studied in this subject. I just am not good at math. I can't say there's been many situations in my life that I have actually had to put use my medical knowledge,  cause honestly I haven't really done much or been in situations that people could end up injured.
-1	The heart doctor's P.A. said that I seemed to know a lot about heart issues after I asked several questions related to a condition.
1	My son recently had a high fever so high that I decided to take him to the doctor. After answering the nurses and doctors questions, he was given a prescription for an antibiotic and ibuprofen. I had to remind the nurse that I had already given him a dose of ibuprofen, so he could not have more.
1	I have been on clonazepam for years (for insomnia). Due to a mix-up, the prescription lapsed. Due to the fact that I had been on the drug for so long, my body experienced withdrawal. It was strange that I needed to hold onto the wall of the shower to take a shower. Fortunately, I have not had a similar problem. Got to the doctor asap and got the prescription re-issued. End of withdrawal, which can be scary even if you know what is going on.
1	I was having recurrent infections, but one of my previous doctors keep telling me it was a yeast infection, but the symptoms I was experiences are more like bacterial infections.  I try the medication but as I know the infection doesn't go.  Then I go a natural local and buy medications that treats that kind of infection and after a couple of days my infection was gone. 
1	When I was younger my doctor thought I had pulmonary hypertension, so when I went home I did tons of research. When I went to the specialist after that, he was very surprised that I knew everything I did and that he didn't have to explain things to me because I already knew about the health condition.
1	I do not have any such experience in which I demonstrated knowledge of health or medical issues. Only one such situation when I was able to diagnose that my friend was showing symptoms of chicken pox which was in fact right.
1	I knew something was wrong with my eye and I kept putting off getting it checked out.  I figured if i ignored it that the symptoms would go away.  I tried to put it out of my mind but couldn't silence the feelings of dread in my body.  My symptoms werent severe but something in the back of my mind told me that there was something wrong.  So, I went to the doctor and I was correct....it wasnt just a simple procedure
-1	this was hard some of it i knew but some i have never experinces before so it made it hard but i learned alot from it

1	A co-worker had a family member that had a medical diagnoses ad was told by the dr they could not have that diagnoses because it would have been cause for emergency surgery.  I informed this co-worker that it was absolutely possible the diagnoses was correct and that there is a small population of people who have the same thing and because of  other medical issues they may have they are not a candidate for the surgery right away.
1	I have been to the doctor several times for various conditions. I have two kids that have gone to the doctor for check ups and conditions as well. My husband has bene hospitalized for a condition.

1	My first child was born with a cleft palate which led to othe finding and countless doctors, also multiple surgeries, many times medical professionals expressed that they where impressed with my grasp and understanding of things given the fact that I had no medical training.more so if I informed them I did not even have a full and proper high school education.
1	I believe I was able to effectively evaluate a time I was having a panic attack in turn because of that I knew what I needed to do to get out of the situation. I was accepting and knowledgeable that i was prone to these things and took steps to help identify when they were happening. 
-1	I had a lump in my breast and I was concerned because it felt abnormal. I called the doctor and had to describe where it was and how it felt and when I noticed it. If i hadnt known that information then the doctor wouldnt have been able to find it or tell me it was benign.
-1	It has been a long trip with that for over the year I have rarely been ill and the couple time I spend a lot of time researching what and why and can it be resolve forever
1	I had breast cancer a lot of years ago. At least I had the sense to go to the doctor when I found the lump, I guess, but the rest was kind of all Greek to me.
1	My grandpa  fainted, he has diabetes. I tested his blood sugar and i t was really low. I gave him some orange juice and he woke and was fine.
-1	i had a mamogram with a false positive , it came out false twice. the third time it was good . i took a fourth mamogram and still good, so its very easy to get a false positive
1	Prior to visiting my doctor about my digestive problems I had already done a lot of research about different reasons for the symptoms. This allowed me to explain everything thoroughly so that my doctor knew what was best for me. 
1	When my wife and I recently had norovirus we were able to avoid spending money and going to the doctor or hospital. I knew that we should avoid eating for 24 hours and ride it out and then slowly start eating again. We also cleaned the house to avoid catching the virus again.
-1	since i was a kid i've had asthma. over the years of dealing with it i've learned more about it and what i should avoid (like a lot of exercise or colognes and perfumes). So if I go somewhere and i notice someone spraying cologne or perfume i know to stay away from that area for a little bit or if i'm exercising i know to take it easy and always have an inhaler with me.
-1	There was a time when I pulled out my back and thought it was going to turn out to be a serious injury, but it turned out to be a minor pull and I didn't really need to treat it any further. 
-1	I told my doctor what was wrong with me. I also told him the medication that I needed. I was right about the diagnosis. 
1	I had two back surgeries in my life for herniated discs.  I read a lot about the surgeries and about the condition so I could do my best when meeting with the doctor.  When the first surgery was done I was a novice and only knew some things but by the time the second surgery came along I was an expert.  When he showed me the x-ray of my discs I actually cut him off and told him what the scan showed.  I said there thats the bad disc and that portion needs to be removed in order to alleviate the pain.  I was right and he was somewhat impressed because it was different than the first surgery I had just read so much and looked at so many pictures that I knew what I was talking about.  I also knew that for this surgery they would need to use staples while the first one they used stitches.  
1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health and medical issues would be a summer day with high temperatures outside. I helped hand out water and keep hydrated so people would not have health issues.
1	I was able to know that my son was having a manic attack. After his diagnosis of bipolar disorder, the next time he started with non-stop talking and behaviors that were unusual I knew to get him to the ER.  The issue was not going to resolve on its own.  The laughing at inappropriate times was not a joke, it was a sign of mania as well.  He wasn't just having bad behavior, this was a serious illness.  
1	My son was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at the age of 6. I was already someone who counted calories and read nutrition labels so my experience there made it easy to measure his portions and count his carbs accurately. My experience taking care of him also makes me knowledgeable in other areas of a healthy diet for our entire family.
1	I have had 10 surgeries. I am a breast cancer survivor. I am an audiologist and have worked with doctors, in hospitals, in rehabilitation centers and at the Emory Clinic in Atlanta.

1	My husband's LDL cholesterol was consistently high.  His doctor recommended a few simple dietary changes to see if it would help.  I researched on my own and changed our diet considerably, and he was able to raise his HDL and lower his LDL by a drastic amount.

-1	In my twenties, I developed for the first time, symptoms of colitis.  I was told I would have this for the rest of my life and that only medication would keep it under control.  I began studying the different medications and reading what worked best and what didn't work for people with this condition.  This also lead me to learn about the role of probiotics in helping with gut flora which seems to help people with colitis.  I was able to bring this information to my doctor and he gave me a prescription only probiotic which has helped immensely.
1	Just last night my daughter said she had a sore throat. I looked at it with a flashlight. There were whiteish/yellow patches on her tonsils. I told her she may have strep. I know that the first thing a doctor asks when you take a child in for strep is if they also have a cough, which she did not. That's an indicator for them to actually do the strep test. Since she didn't have a cough, the doctor did the strep test on her this morning and it was positive.
1	I noticed that my son was having issues with breathing. After some determination, we found out that Abuterol seemed to help him resolve the issue.  Knowing that the medicine is typically used for asthma sufferers I knew this wasn't a situation of a cold and needs to be evaluated by a doctor.  After a consultation, it was confirmed that he indeed had Asthma.

1	One time I ate shrimp and I started to get a rash around my mouth and had some slight swelling in my face and I pulled out some benadryl  and took that because I knew that was good for allergies.
1	Several years ago I had to have a hernia repaired. The pre-examinations were considerable, and included three different blood tests. My employer's insurance covered the procedure, and I spent a great deal of time working over the details of the forms with the HR person. Post-surgery, there were many follow-up visits, and of course more forms to file. It was well worth it but far from simple.
-1	When I had a fever, I self-medicated and I realized that it really worked and heal, it was a good thing because I had never self-medicated before
-1	Before I graduated from high school I enrolled in a magnet program school. This school allowed us to get hands on experience in the fields we found interest in. I always wanted to be a doctor so I got to experience what being part of the medical field was all about. I learned a lot and as a result continue to learn more and more about health care. 
-1	Everyone asks me such things. If I do not already know the answers I find them something related on line someplace. My girlfriend has a daughter who had such a question for me about depression. The kid complains of killing herself these day. She was on zolof, before that prozac. The kid is 15, and been on this shit for several years. I told her to get the kid to a real doc asap and sue the quack that put her on prozac.

1	I'm afraid that most of my health knowledge comes from Google. I can recall that I once wanted someone to eat papaya seeds when they had an upset stomach. People thought I was crazy.  I lived in Hawaii and took a chemistry class in high school. I learned that there is apparently an enzyme that is highly concentrated in papaya seeds that is good for an upset stomach.

-1	There was an incident where a young family member had a severe nose bleed and their parent was holding their head back. I told them they should pinch their nose and hold their head forward in order to prevent vomiting because I read an article that it was the right thing to do. 
1	My mother was searching for something on the bottom of a metal shelf, and as she stood back up she banged her head badly on the lower shelf. She was bleeding profusely, and panicking because of it. I explained to her that it looked worse than it was because the blood vessels on our scalp are so close to the surface, even a minor cut can produce a lot of blood.
-1	When I was pregnant with my third son. My whole pregnancy and deliver was completely wonderful and I believe it was because this was my 3rd time. I knew what to expect and what could or couldnât happen.

1	My son was born hypoxic, so I learned as much as I could about children born with hypoxia and what other conditions could result from such a diagnosis. It turns out that my son's brain was damaged at the cortico-visual area, and suffers from CVI now as a result.
1	Many years ago I noticed something was wrong with my husband and sent him to the doctor multiple times. Every time they sent him back and said he was fine. Until years later, he saw another doctor who immediately sent him for an ultrasound. He had testicular cancer and had a tumor growing for the past several years. All I knew is if they couldn't tell me what it is, they couldn't tell me what it wasn't-- they had to check.
-1	A time in my life where I demonstrated my knowledge of health was when someone fainted during an accident. I proceed to do CPR to revive the person.
1	I am a physician, I attended medical school, completed four years of residency, and a one year fellowship. If I answered these questions incorrectly I am going to be crushed!
1	When I had acute bronchitis and acute sinusitis. I was sick for months and kept telling people it was that (since I get it a lot) but people doctors included, kept saying it was just a bad cold. I mean, I know myself and I knew it was bad. People at work thought I was just calling out for no reason until I brought the note from my doctor, who was going to put me into the hospital if the last of 4 antibiotics tried did not work. It finally took breathing treatment, CIPRO, and getting a swab up my nose before I finally started getting better. 
1	Have a chronic condition now for over 20 years. Am also full time caregiver for my mother, so between those two things, I am pretty confident in meeting our specific needs and understanding what those needs are.

I learned what his diet should be, when he should take his medication, and many other things about general health. 
1	I used to work as an assistant in a dentist office many years ago. My primary duties included sanitizing work, but I was also able to shadow the head dentist on numerous occasions. 
1	Most if not all of my information that I get about health or medical issues I get from my doctor or my friend who is working to be a medical professional. Any questions I have in those subjects I ask them. Rarely do I get information anywhere else. I think I have moderate amount of knowledge about health and medical issues because of what they have told me. I wouldn't call myself an expert or anything close to that. I will still continue to get my information from medical professionals. All in all there's no experience I can say that shows off my knowledge. I just get a piece of it time from time.
-1	I always have been very careful at getting valuable information on health issues. This is the reason I always have a solution when it comes to people who suffer from something and need advice.
-1	my grandfather had diabetes and as a child i would watch him give himself insulin shots. That is what sparked my interest in the medical field. Last January I enrolled in a medical course where i learned how to measure liquids in a syringe, how to read needles (cc's and ml) as well as how to do medical billing for hospitals and doctors offices.  Since learning this knowledge it has enabled me to have intelligent conversations with others as well as help myself be more knowledgeable about my health and the health of those around me
-1	I had to go to the doctor last year when I was having upset stomach and feeling very anxious. The doctor thought it had something to do with my kidneys, but I just had a feeling it was anxiety. I think I was right because it went away when the stress went away.
1	Early in my career I assisted in giving cardiac stress tests.  This included learning that if a patient achieved a certain stage on the test even if they had CAD, their prognosis was statistically equivalent to someone who did not.
1	I was told one year ago that I have type 2 diabetes which does not run in my family. Neither am I particularly fond of sweets so I did some research and found that chloresterol reducing medicine that I have been taking some for about 6 years now has been linked to the onset of diabetes. I have stayed on top of this relationship as well as keeping well-informed of diabetes as a whole so that I can better deal with this health condition.
1	My dad has battled Hep. C for the past 2 decades. He was apart of the testing group for the recent drug released that cures Hep. C

-1	I worked in a speech and hearing clinic and I would often need to read audiograms and patient information. Many clients had medical problems I needed to understand.
1	A few weeks ago one of my children became sick.  I began to monitor his temperature.  When his temperature went over 103 I decided to give him a cool bath and prepare to take him to the doctor if that did not lower his temperature.  After the bath his temperature was down.  I continued o monitor his temperature and give him children's Tylenol until he felt better.
-1	I demonstrated my knowledge of health related issues recently when my friend had back problems. I told her what stretches to do to improve the area.
1	I was a CNA for a number of years and had to take in service trainings on a regular basis. I also have a large family with lots of medical issues to address
1	I was in a bad car accident several years ago and have had multiple abdominal surgeries up to this point.  I can and have talked to the doctors about what previous surgeries and procedures were attempted, why they theorized they failed, and I know what options I have to treat my underlying issues moving forward and have explained these during the consultations.
1	When I was pregnant, we found out my son was breech, and could not be turned because he was stuck in on one side, the doctor was explaining the c-section procedure, but I was already familiar with the procedure because my wife, who carried our other children, had already had one.
1	I brought my husband home from the hospital, after telling the nurse he looked worse then when he got in the hospital. She insisted he was okay. So I took him home. My mom said she didn't think he was gonna make it. She was a nurse at a old folks home for 40 years and knew what people should and shouldn't look like. I was so tired I slept a couple hours and then took his pulse and blood pressure. It was so low Im not sure how I got him to the car. But the doctor said to go home, put him to bed, he'll be fine with the meds we gave you. He was in ICU for 4 days and then in the hospital 10 more days after I just brought him home. If I hadn't paid attention he'd be dead.
1	I have my Master's Degree in Chinese Medicine. In order to obtain said degree, I had to learn a good bit of Western Medicine. In the state I graduated in and practiced in I was considered a primary care physician. I was able to diagnose diseases and refer patients out to western doctors when I felt the need to do so. I have learned a good amount about health in general and medical issues.
-1	There have been several times that either me or someone I know has gotten sick or hurt, and I have treated it myself long enough to drive to the doctor's office. When I get there the doctor says that I treated the problem correctly.
1	I had a physical a few years back, and the blood test results showed that I am anemic. This explained a persistent low energy over the years. Iron supplements were prescribed, and it was explained to me that they would improve my results cumulatively, and that anemia is due to not enough oxygen reaching the organs.
-1	I google the web everytime sometime to learn about some common medical conditions, so over the years, I'm gradually become more adequate in diagnosing some certain health issues
1	i got a bump on my gums and my neighbor said it was an abscess and i would need a root canal but i knew better because there was no pain so i waited until it went away and didn't waste money going to a dentist.
-1	I learned tons of information regarding various treatments when my grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, I was her primary caregiver during that time and was present at all medical appointments.
1	Anything I know about health comes from  my own research on health issues.  I do not come from a super health conscious family so it was not something I learned growing up.
-1	Basically anytime I'm sick I know that it's because I've been in contact with sick people and they passed it on to me via some form of contact.
1	When I went to take my test to sell health insurance. I studied very hard and I passed it on my first try. It wasn't easy, a lot of tough questions were involved.. But I managed to get it done and it really proved how much I knew because I passed it and got my licence. 
1	I recently was diagnosed with a UTI. I knew from the symptoms, the constant urge to go, burning after urination  and full feeling that it was more than likely a UTI. I went to prompt care and was diagnosed with a UTI and given antibiotics. I was actually suffering with the symptoms for over a week and hoped it would clear up on its own by drinking plenty of water but it only got worse. 
-1	I have been going to the doctor for a long time know and I have taken a lot of health classes in my lifetime. Therefore with my combined experience and knowledge I feel comfortable addressing certain medical issues with others. 
-1	I can't really think of anything that describe an experience, but I guess the awareness to know when to go to the doctor and when not to. 
1	any of the doctors I have had over the years had little to no knowledge of the type of kidney disease I had and I was forced to explain my condition and provide littiture about my illness 
1	When I was pregnant, there were a lots of tests that were done.  I understood all of what was told to me, and was easily able to follow all the directions for taking whatever I was told I had to take.
1	I raised four children and have two grandchildren, so over the years I have known dealt with illnesses and injuries. I have learned common treatments and known how to research and communicate with medical staff.
1	My aunt was diagnosed with diabetes after she retired from work. Through this period, I helped her to properly measure her insulin and inject it and I also made sure she kept on top of her pill medication and prescriptions. I often took glucose readings for her and explained how important proper eating and exercise was for her condition.
-1	I was diagnosed with an enlarged prostrate. The Dr. gave me thorough education. I also did my own research and developed a healthier diet. Eating clean and organic food.
-1	The only thing i can imagine with my minimal knowledge was when my youngest had over come their bought with the hand foot mouth disease and a friends children contracted it at their daycare. I was able to advice her what we had been advised, the benefit to her was a reduced down time in illness. Her children seemed to get well a bit faster, maybe because i had been able to give her advice on what helped us. I do not have a lot of knowledge nor have i had many sitiuations present themselves for knowledge to be gained... yet!
-1	When my sister was little she had a lot of issues.The doctor would diagnose her with inner ear issues (not infection) to behavioral issues, but I read about sensory processing disorder and thought it sounded like what she might have. I told my mom about it and she asked the doctor how to get her tested. The doctor said it was a made up condition to explain behavioral issues but my mom asked for another opinion. That pediatrician referred her for testing and she not only got a diagnosis of SPD but a few years later we found out she has autism. If I hadn't pushed my mom to have her tested it she might have missed out on early interventions and her sensory issues would be labeled behavioral.
-1	When I was diagnosed with IBS I had to learn how to change my diet first and foremost. I had to do some research because at the time I was told it wasn't a disease and could not be treated (ten years ago). I had to figure out what aggravated my condition and learn to cope with it.
1	I'm not sure what this prompt is asking. I think when I take my kids in to the doctor, I feel that I'm reasonably rational and calm. I feel like I don't immediately jump to the worst case scenario, though that is what I want to do in my head for myself. I
-1	I mean, most of it is common sense. I'm no where near as knowledgeable as a doctor. For the last 10+ years, instead of spending a bunch of money to go see someone who is only worried about getting through the day, I will just look online. If something weird is going on with my body, I will look online and gather knowledge. 
1	I went over the paper work when bringing my daughter into this world.  Filled out all the insurances.  Worked with my wife in signing documents in the hospital and squared away every issue the doctor brought to us.
1	I am unsure of a situation other than when I get sick, I know which type of medicine to get depending on the symptoms. I also know I do not need to go to the doctor when I have a cold or sinus issues.

1	When my sister was diagnosed with ALS and we had to learn as a family about this disease and how to care for her in the best way possible.

1	I went to the doctor and they told me I was at high risk for high blood pressure. They told me to decrease my intake of salt to a certain degree but didn't explain further. They also told me other factors can relate to HBP but didn't further explain. I had to rely on the internet and was overwhelmed. 
-1	 this cancer people effect not taken all over world. it is most people must died.Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body
1	I'm not sure if this really counts but a while back in college I noticed that I had put on significant weight and I was more out of breath than usual. I also noticed that I became a lot more thirsty and lazy than usual so I stopped and considered my risk factors. I know that my family has a high history of diabetes and hypertension (and high cholesterol), so I took it upon myself to buy a blood pressure monitor and measure my blood pressure over a period of a week. It was not favorable, so I talked to a nutritionist and made a healthy eating plan as well as an exercise routine. By monitoring it further, I successfully decreased my blood pressure significantly and it has remained in safe levels since I have continued my routine.
1	I honestly don't really think that I have any. Outside of regular checkups I haven't ever been to a hospital. I guess the closest thing would be that I have a daughter, and I've had to read and talk to doctors about her. However she's only been to hospital once for something other than I regular checkup so I don't know how much experience that really gives me either. Overall I think just my general ability to understand things is probably my best experience.
1	I once had a painful, bleeding (and puss) coming from my backside. I did a bunch of research on my own before deciding that I 100% had a pilonidal cyst. I went to the doctor and he confirmed the diagnosis. I had outpatient surgery.
1	Last year I had an extremely sharp pain in my gut on the right side. I thought that I might have a kidney stone. I knew that it could be serious, so I went to the hospital. I ended up having a kidney stone, but it would be passable. They offered me opiate pain medications but I decided not to take them because I know that they have addictive properties.  I ended up passing the kidney stone several days later.
1	I GAVE BIRTH TO 2 SONS, AND BOTH BY VIRGINAL BIRTH. I ALSO BOTH TIME GOT THE EPIDURAL TO HELP WITH THE PAIN. I AM LUCKY THAT I AM NOT ALLERGY TO ANY OF THE DRUG SO IT'S FINE FOR ME TO GET THE EPIDURAL.
-1	I avoided catching diabetes by exercising and eating correctly for most of my life, its is health problem that runs in my family. 
1	My doctor prescribed some pills for me. Before taking the pills, I noticed that the pharmacy gave me the wrong dosage. I returned the pills to the pharmacy without taking any of it.
1	I had a situation where I had athlete induced hematoma. Because of this past experience I was able to recognize when I was having a side effect from that in a future event that happened.
1	I have recently been experiencing very bad insomnia. I discussed possible factors with my doctor, and asked for bloodwork, which came back normal. I started charting my cycle, my alcohol consumption, my diet, and also considering my stress levels. After three months of tracking, I determined that alcohol was the main factor. I stopped drinking alcohol, and my insomnia has gone away.
-1	My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago and at that time I didnt know much about it. Over the years I have educated myself all about it ans In turn that has given me the knowledge to take preventive measures for myself. A few months ago my aunt was diagnosed as well. Science has come a long way since I first learned about it so that knowledge that I had from the experience with my mom helped me to be prepared for any questions that my aunt had during her process and I think the fact that my mom went through it too help me as well to get through it.
-1	When I was 35 I was feeling really bad all of the time.  I fell generally unwell, dizzy, headaches, thirsty all the time, unable to sleep well and just feeling blah.  I had a weird feeling I was diabetic so I started to do some reading about it for a few weeks and got as much information as possible.  I then made a doctor's appointment and told my doctor what symptoms I had and why I thought I had diabetes.  My doctor was impressed with my knowledge and scheduled a test.  A couple days later I found out I was indeed diabetic.
1	This is difficult to identify. I can only describe it definitively as the moment that I had children of my own to take care of. I care so much about them that I learn about things that I would otherwise ignore. I want them to be healthy; therefore, I learn as much as I can about health and medical issues. While not objectively logical, it is a function of love.
1	When I go for sinus infections and bronchitis.  I always know that is what it is.  And I'm right most of the time.  I already know what treatments will be given.  I usually know how long it will take for the meds to kick in.
-1	I was prescribed a combination of 3 antibiotics. The doctor wanted me on it for 3 months. But after research and feeling sick I took myself off this combination. 
-1	Being in the military has given me a little bit more exposure to the medical and health issues. We practice a lot of medical procedures. Also going to Afghanistan has allowed me to work on casualities. 
-1	I have not had major medical issues, I'm not sure how to answer this question. I guess I know about eating healthy and some about how the body works, but not really medically related.  
1	Recently my elderly aunt fell in the snow and suffered frost bite on both hands. After spending three days in the hospital burn unit, she was discharged home with both hands bandaged. The next day I went to visit her and saw that her hands were in poor condition. She had removed the bandages and several of her fingers had open, weeping wounds. I thought a couple of them might be infected. She refused to return to the hospital. Later a visiting nurse came and confirmed possible infection. She also convinced my aunt to return to the hospital. Fortunately she was able to make a full recovery.
1	I worked in a rural hospital that served as the local area cancer treatment center on the weekends.  I would sit for hours and register patients for treatment the following day.  I would have to file lab and xray results into their charts.  This was before everything went paperless.  I spent a lot of time reading notes and diagnosis because I worked a lot of second and third shifts.  I was still in college and I tried to make the most of my time when I was a work.  
1	One time I was not feeling well and I was able to go online and look up my symptoms. The tentative diagnosis I gave myself matched what my doctor thought.
1	"I was told I have high cholestrol and needed to make changes to improve that. I knew that it meant i had to get my bad cholestrol ""LDL"" to below 100 and the good cholestrol ""HDL"" to above 50."
1	I wasn't feeling well and I went to the doctor. I had been feeling extremely tired and lacking  energy. I wondered if I had mono so I ended up going to the doctor. I ended up having mono, so I guess I was right.
1	while at a restaurant, a patron was signalling that she was choking after eating a chicken wing. i recalled learning the heimlich maneuver in school, and i was able to successfully perform the procedure.
-1	I had hep c. I was told there wasn't much to be done by my PCP. I then heard on npr a new drug was now available called sovaldi. I found a new Dr who put me on a program got the drug approved, and after taking the 3 drug regimens cocktail I was cured.
1	Once my gums above a certaion tooth became swollen and inflamed and it really hurt. I had no idea what it was but then I realized that a cavity that I had neglected to get taken care of was to blame. I went to the emergency room and they took an x ray and confirmed that it was an abscessed tooth.
1	My pregnancy required that I ask my doctor lots of questions about symptoms that I was experiencing. I frequently went to each appointment with a list of questions about what was normal and what was not. My doctor was impressed that I had learned so much about pregnancy and pregnancy complications.
1	Woman problem. I had my period for 8 months straight before my doctor got me into a specialist (gyno). I was quite confident when I was able to go back to my doctor and repeat what my gyno had said and understood what I was talking about. hyperplasia is the overgrowth of uterine tissue, which was causing that issue, but I also had multiple cysts at different times on different ovaries, but not in my uterus.
1	I had gained a lot of weight at one point, so I decided to lose the weight. I went on a diet and exercise program I made up for myself. I reduced my calories and fat consumption. Also, I decided to start running most days. I lost around 100 pounds in about 9 months. During this diet I was kept very close tract of my calorie consumption. I was ware of how many calories different foods have.
1	I was able to bring up some possible causes of what I may have been suffering from to my doctor. When they explained things I was able to easily understand and ask questions.
-1	I don't know , just accepting the fact that I have to go to a doctor and let them diagnose the problem seems good enough. The fact that I'm not someone who goes on the internet and tries to solve there own medical problems means I'm doing better than a lot of people.
-1	I have been Type 1 diabetic since I was 10 years old. This really helped when my nephew was diagnosed because most of my family is semi=aware of what to expect. My nephew still calls to ask questions sometimes and I am happy to help.
1	An experience I has that demonstrated my knowledge of medical issues was when I cut my finger, and due to a rather large snowstorm, was unable to leave to possibly get it looked at. I went ahead and washed it out with hot water, and disinfected the cut on my finger. I also went ahead and elevated it slightly and applied pressure until most of the bleeding had stopped. I had somewhat skimmed the top layer of my skin off, so it looked a lot worse than it actually was, and in this situation I was able to control my thoughts and use basic first aid, rather than freaking out about the situation and causing myself to panic.
1	My brother was recently in a car accident and in the years preceding I volunteered by Special Olympics, therefore I understood how to work a wheelchair, transfer a patient from a bed to the the chair, and other such apparatus know-how. 
1	I have been dealing with persistent colds and respiratory infections and recently, I looked up what I can do to get rid of them and have been taking steps in making sure that I no longer deal with them.  I have been eating healthy, exercising and sharing my tips with friends and family.
1	I am not good with math, so I need someone to thoroughly explain such stats to me rather than depending on my math skills. Most doctors I have had are willing to do that. 
1	I don't necessarily have knowledge of these issues. Whenever I or my family members have issues I usually research on the internet or consult with doctors or people who have been trained in this field.
1	I had an auto accident a little over two years ago. I was rear-ended, and although I had no scratches or bruises, I did hit my head hard on the headrest and the rear impact caused pain in my back within the hour. I knew to apply ice and knew to rest until I could be checked out by a physician, which somewhat controlled swelling. Plus I knew to seek treatment immediately for rehabilitation and to reduce any muscle damage/scarring.
1	When I started working out I learned that muscle building is most effective when gaining weight. After researching the topic, I found that weight gain is decided by one factor only: calorie count. The weight u gain is the difference between the calories you intake and the calories you consume. 
-1	I was seen by an orthopedic surgeon for a chronic ACL tear and osteoarthritis in my left knee. I did physical therapy, and when I was released from therapy, he told me I'd be back in a couple years for a knee replacement. I told him not to hold his breath. Came home, and started walking longer distances - 4-6 miles a day. I lost 20 pounds, and took several anti-inflammatory and ligament strengthening supplements, and kept walking. That was 16 years ago, and I still have my knee, thank you. By the way - the doctor I saw needed to lose about 50 pounds.
1	Several years ago my father was in the ICU after being unfortunately caught in a store robbery. He was shot 3 different times and the medical issues were immense. I was successfully able to listen and understand the doctors as they were explaining everything to my family and I. Other family members came to me to explain it better in layman terms to them. 
1	My wife is a nurse and we have been married for nine years and she helps me understand all sorts of medical issues. Her along with Google makes things a lot easier to understand.
1	I had some heart related issues early on in life so I think I learned about cardio matters a lot earlier than most people which has helped me stay informed with health matters.
-1	I studied medical assistant program and it has given me some knowledge of various tests and procedures as well as health and medical issues. It has also helped working in this environment and from reading and office/hospital visits.
1	I damaged my toe nail. Based on a previous experience I understood that the doctors would only help to rip off the damaged nail. I opted to do this myself to save time and money.
1	every week, when we have exams, my knowledge on medial issues is tested in more ways than i can explain. Boards, are the ultimate test of my knowledge i guess, and thats in 3 mnths. 
1	I have borderline cholesterol issues.  So I have done a lot of research on eating properly  to keep that from going up.  I actually had it go down into a very normal range.
1	I hade to remove my gallbladder afte experiencing pain and found that I had multiple gallstones so I went through many tests and a medical medical surgery
1	In the past 1.5 years, I have lost 95 lbs. I had to pull from my knowledge of exercise and nutrition to achieve this. Additionally, I have had to understand how this affects my blood sugar, cholestrol, pulse, and heart rate. I have also had negative effects from my health goals in terms of exercise causing me injury and extreme pain. I have had to pull from my knowledge of how muscles, bones, and cells work to design plans that have gradual enough progress to prevent injury.
-1	An experience in my life when I demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is in being able to assist when people are having seizures. 
1	I went in for a gastrointestinal issue and it was deemed that I needed a colonoscopy.  I was given a list of medications to consume in preparation as well as a process to follow for the surgery.  Without any assistance, I took the list and prepared myself for what turned out to be a successful procedure.
1	After tearing my ACL in 2012, I ended up re injuring it once again in 2013 and had to have two surgeries. By the second surgery I was already prepared with what I had to do for recovery and rehab. 
1	I had been vomiting every morning for 4 months. I saw 6 different types of doctors and none could give me a diagnosis or any relief. I did my own research and discovered Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome. I brought the empirical guidelines to my doctor and have had successful treatment since.
1	i was in an auto accident and fractured 3 bones in my hip pubis illium and ischium and because i had taken an anatomy course i knew exactly where those bones were.  And why i was in so much pain
1	I researched and implemented a medical protocol (long-term, low-dose antibiotic) to recover from the affliction of undifferentiated monoarticulating HLA-B27-related spondyloarthropathy, in which I eventually went into remission after 3 years (that was 20 years ago, so I'm calling it permanent remission), avoiding becoming a certain cripple with a compromised immune system, or dead, as my colleague's husband ended up, from T-cell lymphoma, having the same doctor as I but actually following his advice to take methotrexate.
1	I was a caregiver for my mother-in-law when she had cancer. So I would go with her to her appointments and I always took along a notebook and made sure to ask questions and write down the answers. It was really important that we understood and remembered everything that was said. I am not sure if this is the kind of answer you are looking for, but I believe that the communication between a doctor and patient is the crucial factor. My knowledge is that I know that I don't know, so I have to depend on my doctor's knowledge and expertise.
1	I understood helath issues when I got a UTI. My doctor fully explained everything that was going on with my health at the time. I told him I fully understood and took the extra steps neccessary to nclear up my issue. 
1	I was having knee pain.  First surgeon I saw recommended knee replacement.  This seemed extreme for the kind of pain I was having.  I sought another opinion and had microfracture surgery instead.  
1	One of my grandsons was pulling on his right ear one day.  He couldn't talk yet so I knew something was bothering him.  He had a slight fever and just wasn't himself.  I figured it was an ear infection.  We took him to the doctor and it was an ear infection.  
1	I had a growth on the side of my torso that became inflamed every 3-4 months. One time it got very inflamed. I didn't know what it could be, so I went to doctor to have it checked. 
1	I am a Standardized Patient for medical students and have been for over 15 years. I have portrayed a multitude of cases including blood clot, sinusitis, pregnancy, appendicitis both during pregnancy and not, gallstones, pediatric meningitis, etc, so I have a fair amount of knowledge above the regular person not in the medical field.
1	I've always had problems with cramping during my periods, and have had a history of ovarian cysts.  I had multiple exploratory surgeries to remove the cysts.  The cysts came on a cycle of approximately every five years, I would have surgery every five years to have them removed.  Finally after quite a bit of research and discussion with my doctor it was decided to do a partial hysterectomy and remove my uterus to see if that would break the cycle.  this worked for ten years, at that time I started getting the cysts on my ovaries again, with the pain being 75% of the month.  it was decided that my ovaries needed to come out to prevent this from happening.  By my doctor being informed on what the best course of action was for me I was able to keep my ovaries for a longer period of time, therefore not having to take synthetic hormones until absolutely necessary. 
1	I worked at as a physical trainer and had to help monitor heart rates and health concerns while people were exercising.  I was also trained in CPR.
1	When I was told I was pregnant. I immediately started taking folic acid, I scheduled my doctor's appointment, I stopped drinking alcohol, and I started trying to reduce my stress.
1	As someone who grew up with family members in the medical field and being around people who often had to take medication, I feel that I've had enough early exposure that I'm not uncomfortable around medicine. I'm also in pre-nursing at the moment so some of the pre requisite classes I've taken as well as advanced reading I'm undertaking have given me some insight and knowledge into these kinds of things
-1	I was eating a lot of food in the past and I was gaining a lot of pounds. I noticed I didn't fit into my clothes and my body was changing as in body weight. I began to exercise and decrease my food intake to the point where I lost a lot weight.
1	When my brother got a frost bite I had to help him warm up his insides and outsides to prevent the frost and cold from affecting his body.
1	My son when he was young began choking on a grape in a restaurant.  I was able to perform the Heimlich Maneuver on him successfully.
-1	I had to be proactive when talking to my son's doctors about a medical course of action for him due to his kidney issues.  
1	When my children ran high fevers, I would take them to the Dr.  When one child got the chicken pox, I knew what the symptoms were, and was able to tell when my second child got chicken pox because they exhibited the same symptoms.
1	It was several years ago when I was dealing with a snake bite that a friend of mine received while we were out on a hunting trip. Knowing that it was a rattlesnake that had bite him, I knew how to handle it, keep him calm, and do what I needed to do until we were able to to him to the Emergency room. 
1	I was recently in a car wreck last year and went to see the doctor because I had pain in my back and neck. I explained to the doctor that I had a previous back injury (bulging disc) from a sports injury and that I had pain in the same places but not as severe. After we did x-rays and and MRI he explained that there was no serious damage done to my vertebrae and I fully understood the situation because I had been through it before.
1	The only thing that I can really think of is a time when I developed pneumonia.  As I stated earlier in the survey, I never go to the doctor unless I'm sure something is wrong.  I felt myself over the course of a two week period becoming less energetic and more and more out of breath doing simple everyday things.  I continued to go to work during that time assuming that my body would defend itself and I would snap out of it.  When I coughed at work and expelled a mass of oddly colored phlegm, I new something wasn't right and went to the doctor that afternoon after work.  That's when I was diagnosed with a form of walking pneumonia.  I hope that's near to what you're looking for.
-1	My husband was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes close to a year ago. We both have become very educated on eating healthier and also managing insulin levels. 
1	When one of my kid is sick, I have to trust my knowledge of health in deciding when they need to see a doctor or if we can treat their illness at home.
1	I had cancer. I had to learn and adapt very quickly. While I went through treatment I had to trust my doctors that they were being open and honest with me about my cancer.
-1	I have always been a fast learner and exceptionally bright. For this reason I read most things I found lying around the house when I was a baby. I also try to keep track of health issues as they arrise for myself or family should the need arise to seek additional care.
-1	I would have to say that an experience that I demonstration my knowledge on health and medical issues would be when I gained 15 lbs in a year and decided that was way too much.  It was caused by a medication I was taking so I requested to get off that medication, started walking fast everyday and lost the weight. 
-1	I am a runner and when I received injured to my foot I would study resources relating to the anatomy of the bones and muscles in my foot so I could pinpoint what was going wrong and how to fix it. Later on, when I would go to my podiatrist, they would explain possible symptoms to me. I was able to hold a comprehensive conversation because I had learned much about how the foot works and learned the jargon necessary to convey a detailed diagnosis.
1	I started to develop a rash on my arm/wrist and visited a dermatologist to help determine the cause of the rash. In preparing for the visit, I listed out foods I had recently eaten as well any outdoor activities that may have had me come into contact with any plants or insects. In talking through the situation with the dermatologist, I mentioned that I had eaten a cherry pie very recently to which he noted that certain red dyes in such foods can cause random rashes. Since all other foods I had eaten were not out of the norm and my activities did not bring me into contact with any poisonous plants, we were able to determine that that pie consumption was the most likely root cause.
1	My knowledge about health issues, starting with myself, was when I had my wisdom teeth pulled under general anesthesia at the age of 22.  I also had a cryosurgergical procedure done following an abnormal pap smear.  Cervical cancer runs on my mother's side of the family.  I've had a C-section, Appendectomy, Gall Bladder removal and taken care of my mother with dementia to her last days on this Earth.

1	My mother had Parkinson's Disease and I unfortunately had to learn about Parkinson's Disease and he stages of the disease itself. 
-1	I was overweight for a period in my life.  I did what I could to lose it by eating healthy and working out.  I got obsessed with staying fit.
1	I have learned that to reduce your weight and improve your health is to reduce the amount of fats and carbohydrates in your diet.  So I changed my diet to reduce those types and food and I reduced my weight and improved my blood pressure.   My plan is to continue you this year since I want to lose another 20 pounds.
1	Discussing high blood pressure and its relationship to weight made it clear to me why I should lose weight. I very well understood the stress that extra weight puts on the heart and blood vessels.

1	I have been to the doctor for a concussion and was aware of many of the possible issues caused by having a concussion prior to the doctor explaining them to me.  The concussion lead to a few complications that I was unaware of, but learned about them and have been able to deal with them because of the information I learned and received.
1	I used to be a medical transcriptionist. My grandmother had gotten home from a doctor's appointment and had not understood what exactly they were telling her. Upon hearing what the doctor told her, I was able to explain some terms to her that she didn't know what they meant before.
1	I was told by my doctor to get a shingles vaccine but since I had already thoroughly read the warnings on the prednisone pamphlet that the pharmacy gave me I knew that someone taking prednisone had to be off of it for  at least 6 months before taking any live vaccines.  Knowing this saved me from having a severe case of shingles.
1	I don't know if I could do that the best I can come up with is that I know some good ways to prevent myself from having a seizure and I can also feel when they are coming on in time for me to get somewhere safe. That is pretty much the extent of my knowledge I don't know how to do much that is not related to that is pretty much my life.
-1	I ripped the tendon in my arm from the elbow to hand, when I went to the emergency room they wanted to xray the arm, I told them several times it was not a bone, however, the xrayed it and found nothing wrong, after going to my pcp and having an mri, he found the tendon was ripped. I worked as a pharmacy tech for many years, so when people come in with a fever, that you can alternate between tylenol and advil every 3 hours. I can usually help my friends when something is wrong by giving them advice about what to take, such as my friend had hurt her knee and was having trouble walking on it, so I told her to take ibuprofen and ice it, the next day she was able to walk and went to the dr.
1	I can't think of anything particularly demonstrative. After experiencing certain conditions, I am better able to determine whether I am experiencing the same thing again or having a new experience.
1	Every time I have an extreme pain in my back flank then I know I have a kidney stone.  Then I get to go to the hospital, have the nurse completely not trust me thinking I'm addicted to pain killers so I get to sit in agony until they finally believe me.
1	I was a registered Surgical Technologist, So I've taken classes that pertain to health and surgery. I've also had family members that have had lots of medical issues. 
1	I have no situation that meets this criteria.  I have never encountered such a situation that can relate to this question. 
1	A few years ago I fell on the ice and broke a rib. I did not go to the doctor. I believe that a rib needs time to heal and that there was not much a doctor could have done for me.
-1	When buying groceries I always look at the ingredients and calories on the back of it. I also try to make sure I dont eat fatty, high cholesterol food.
1	My mom was getting really sick and I was taking care of her.  I needed to know everything that I could about what was being told to me by the drs and nurses so I did quite a bit of research on the internet about her condition so that I could better understand what they were talking about and what tests they were running.
1	"I took my mother to see a neurosurgeon for a neck problem. It was a different doctor that I had used. After her exam, I showed him my hand and explained what was going on and told him where I thought the problem was. He looked at me and said, ""You are exactly right."""
1	I have had several issues come up that have landed me in the hospital either on emergency basis or for surgery. I had mono my last year in high school that put me in the emergency room and urgent care. I also had a horrible ear infection that resulted in 2 different ear surgeries over the span over 3 years. 
1	I had a kidney stone when I was 8 years old and I was in the hospital for 5 days with them having no idea what I had going on. I also had 5 miscarriages in my later years. They couldn't figure out what that was caused by either. 
1	I haven't had one because my family doesn't believe in doctors and I have no health insurance because that's for people who actually have money.
1	Losing weight and calculating how many calories I needed to eat, what to eat, and how much to exercise to keep my appetite satisfied and fuel my body demonstrated my knowledge of health.  I also always make sure to wash my hands whenever I go out in public.
1	My daughter has a food allergy, and I often have to explain the specifics of eosinophilic esophagitis.   It is not a simple process, so having a solid understanding of it is essential
1	When I became very tired all the time, muscles were very weak, it hurt to even sit for long periods of time and I had headaches frequently I suspected my B12 levels were low.  I asked the doctor to test that and it did turn out to be very very low.  Took a supplement for some time and recovered.
1	A few years ago I had a blood test that showed a slightly elevated blood glucose level. I was told I was prediabetic. Because of this I ate better and more healthly, lost a bit of weight with exercise. Because of that I was able to lower my levels. 
-1	I was asked if a certain diet would work and I did know for certain that it didn't work because asked about the same thing from my doctor. I thought it was neat that I was able to explain and answer why it didn't work.

1	I advised a friend from discontinuing a prescription drug because of severe side effects that they didn't know were associated with the drug because it wasn't in the pamplet provided.
-1	Before I  was diagnosed with Essential Tremors, I knew something was not right. So to avoid cutting my throat while shaving or spilling anything else I was trying to put into my mouth. I went to my doctor to see what was going on and if it could be fixed. Not fixed but controlled, that works for me. 
-1	Recently, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. I accompanied her to several of her appointments and was able to help interpret some of the information she was given, as she was very overwhelmed.
1	I have several fruit allergies including bananas, kiwi, strawberries, and grapes. As a young child we did not know this. When I would eat any of these items individually I would get a mild upset stomach however one day my mom gave me bananas and kiwi cut up on a plate for a snack. After eating most of it i had shortness of breath and hives on my chest. I knew I was having an allergic reaction and needed help. I've seen an lergic reaction from my cousin who cannot have milk but one day decided to try it. I let my mom know and she gave me benadryl which countered the symptoms.  
1	I had taken antibiotics and got sick for months afterwards. I was able to present the information to my doctor and he agreed that it was correct .
1	Both of my parents have experienced cancer diagnosis, so I am more familiar with some of what they went through.  Sometimes things are normal, then the next day something can happen that will change your life.  To understand the options is very important to me, so I have read books and talked to doctors to help me understand the options in each situation.
1	There was one instance where I burned my hand with 700 degrees of solder and it hurt like hell. I went to the doctor and I learned all about burns and how I actually treated myself better before the burn got worse.
1	I have broken one bone in my life, my collarbone. When that happened I knew what it was and went to the dr and followed their advice of using a sling and taking pain medication at the specified intervals. They also said they donât often reset broken collarbones anymore cause there wasnât much evidence of them healing better by doing that and it causes a lot of pain to reset that bone so we didnât reset it. 
1	My son has had medical issues since birth.  I have brought up possible conditions, on more than one occasion, that doctors were not concerned about or not going to test for.  After testing, he was diagnosed with that specific condition(s).

1	My friend hurt his arm and i quickly informed him that it was not brokern because i was able to tell it was not.
-1	it would be when i found out that i had diabetes and i had to take a certain amount of insulin and it took a bit of knowledge about medical issues to do so

-1	I don't have any experiences in my life that I can remember that can demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues in my life. Unfortuanetely I am not able to think of anything 
1	Those were tough at the end. I really got most of my knowledge from my schooling. I was going to go as a pharmacist but ended up just going for biology and chemistry. I also have had some severe stays in the hospital upwards of a month from my brain injuries and I worked in a hospital for a year.
-1	I basically read and studied any material that I have come across on medical issues and diseases. It's crazy how you are more knowledgeable than some mainstream doctors. 
1	I took CPR and Basic First Aid and my family very often asks me - and sends photos - about injuries, rashes etc. I don't know a lot, but I am often able to calm their fears.
1	My sister was extremely concerned about a lump she found in her leg.  She called me very upset and scared.  I told her that it is very likely just a cyst and not anything cancerous and to not google it.  She went to the doctor and found out it was just a cyst, as I had told her and she was fine.  I don't really have much experience with anything medically serious, so this was the only example I could think of.
1	In high school, I did my health presentation on atherosclerosis and that taught me a lot about causes of plaque build-up and how the body manages it through a mixture of LDL and HDL fats. It was a half hour presentation and I used visualizations on a computer to illustrate the process. That project also showed me how I could use better sources of information that were available to me, like Nature and Scientific American to get a detailed understanding of health processes.
1	Well, one time I was with my friend who was high and I noticed he started having what appeared to be symptoms of an anxiety or panic attack. I assured him that he would be okay, (he thought he was having a heart attack). 
1	I was having some issues with feeling sluggish and foggy and had to have a ton of tests done. I went through all of the information about the tests that my doctor had ordered so I would know what I was getting into

1	I was a caretaker for both my mother and my father in the last years of their life while managing my own health issues.  I had to learn many skills while caring for both my mother and father like how to change, service a colostomy bag, measure diabetic sugar level, maintain.  Also had to care for my own bipolar 1, meetings, etc. Dad had dialysis as well. had to learn all of that.
1	I had that heart problem several years ago and though it wasn't the cause of my problem, my cardiologist advised me to reduce my salt intake. I now know a lot more about sodium content in all kinds of foods & what is the recommended limit.
1	I went a course on how to provide cpr to a paitient no I am ready for when ever anything happens to one of my family members in order to administer CPR. I know that it can revive someone having a heart attack, and my father has had a heart attack so just in case it happens again I can bring him back to life again. I also spend a lot of time with my grandmother so it will be very useful to know this knowledge beforehand just in case anything happens. I highly recommend everyone taking a CPR course and learning about what it can do for people in danger.
1	I have diabetes II. I met with a nutritionist who taught me how to eat right to keep my blood sugar levels good. I learned what to buy & eat. She was right. When I eat the right foods my blood sugar is great.
1	Well, I had my first child almost two years, prior to getting pregnant with that child, I had an early miscarriage and learned that I also likely have PCOS which could make it difficult to get pregnant again in the future.  Prior to being diagnosed with this I did not know about this issue, but now through those appointments and talking with a couple of friends, I feel like I know a lot more.
1	I was told that I am underweight for my height, as such that I needed to eat more. As such I had decided to exercise in regular intervals as well as I did not want to experience negative side effects associated with overeating. So with the help of online resources I formed a meal plan that fits within a recommended nutritional profile/caloric intake for my body size. As with the previous questions it involves some light mathematics and a bit of research, but it is very much worth it knowing that I am in as much control as I can get in the maintenance of my health.
-1	It was one time when a friend of mine felt very bad and we had to do something immedialety to make him feel better. I took some alcohool and immediately noticed he was feeling better.
-1	When I was younger I babysat for a friend of mine who neglected to tell me that her children just got over chickenpox.  Because of my age, she thought that I would have already been exposed to it.  At point, I had spent very little time around children and during my childhood, I was not often around a  lot of children because I grew up in the country.  On my way home from her house that night, I became very ill and knew right away that I needed medical care because my body did not react in the normal way this illness would have affected a child. 
1	A doctor gave me a prescription and said to take a certain amount of mg for 10 days. The math did not add up. I would have needed another full bottle to fulfill the directions. I called and was told that I needed a second bottle for my prescription
1	I can't honestly think of any situation like this, I rarely go to the doctor or have any medical problems. I suppose just knowing that a pain in a certain spot on my back could be a kidney stone counts but I only know that because I've had one.
1	My wife had breast cancer.  At diagnosis, her radiologist discussed her ultrasound, and I asked for him to elaborate on the shape of the lesion, the smoothness of the edges, blood vessel involvement, etc.
-1	Everytime I go to the hospital I always demonstrate my knowledge or medical issues because my doctor always asks me and I have knowledge about it.
1	I have had two prostate surgeries. From speaking with my PCP, the surgeon, and my own research, I went into them knowing what to expect. There were no surprises. Although the first was successful, I was in the low percentage group that had recurrence and required additional surgery. That was successful and I have not been bothered since.
1	Most recently, our newborn was having mucous and traces of blood in her stool, and because of our prior experience with our first child, we knew right away this was an allergic reaction to dairy/soy protein in my wife's breast milk.  We cut dairy and soy out of her diet and she perked right up in a few days and her stools normalized.  
-1	I was studying to be a massage therapist and a client came in with serious back problems. They asked me what muscles I would work out and if I could help address the issue and possible fix it. I had to learn anatomy to be able to work on clients so I worked on a specific muscle group I had learned about in class and they felt much, much better after I had worked on them. It definitely helped learning anatomy, otherwise I would be of no help to anyone.
1	Prior to my first spinal fusion, I had a list of questions for my doctor. He was surprised at the amount of research I had done in order to be informed. I asked specific questions about the XLIF procedure that he had proposed and what the difference in recovery times and success were in relation to other procedures. I asked specifically where the bone marrow would be drawn from in order to create the fusion. We had a great discussion and he was happy to answer what he referred to as very intelligent questions.
-1	I just had an xray done on my back to see if my scoliosis has worsened, i now have a double curved. It's still not bad enough to do surgery but they recommend physical therapy or it may worsen over the next 5 years. Knowing the risks, I can't afford physical therapy sadly, but if it gets bad enough my insurance covers surgery.
-1	I used to teach mentally ill about their illnesses in a group setting.  I have a bachelors degree in psychology which helped in this.  However, I did a lot of research into the medical illnesses they had and also taught information about the physical illnesses as well to help them in all aspects of their lives.

1	Recently, I was bitten by an insect (prob. spider) and had a bad reaction. I realized from the swelling and coloration of my hand that I needed to see the doctor.

1	I had a strong pressure in my lower chest region. It turned out to be just gas and I was able to self diagnose. i went to the doctor anyways and they confirmed.
1	I had to get a blood test done to see if I could be diabetic. I had some signs and to help ease my nerves I was checked and given a clear bill of health. It just turned out to be a coincidence but I based it off of my dad and my aunt both of whom are diabetic.

-1	Because my parents and grandparents had diabetes, when my husband was diagnosed a few years ago, I had a basic knowledge of what to look for and how to help.
1	When I wanted to lose weight I decided to start tracking calories and macro nutrients. Previously I had never really paid attention to food labels but to properly track my consumptions I had to purchase a food scale and weigh my food and keep a journal. I was shocked out much I was actually eating as you assume the serving size is much larger than what it actually is. Watching my intake I was easily able to lose 5 pounds with diet alone before changing my exercise to lose more.

1	I had a miscarriage. the dr was right away going to have me get a procedure, but there was no need for it. I knew this from my research... that it could happen naturally. When I told him that is what I wanted to do he said that is better (He never should have suggested it in the first place and I left him after that)
1	I have learned a lot due to personal experiences with family members. My father had heart disease, and my mother, a brother, and my son have all had cancer at some point, which caused me to research and learn as much as I could about their respective conditions.
1	One time, a friend of mine got sick. I went over to check on him and make sure he was okay and was able to get him to feel better by buying the right medicine, food and liquids he needed. That is about as much knowledge as I have and if I needed more, I'd have sent him to the doctor.
-1	I have asthma and my son has asthma. We were following the doctor's action plan but it wasn't working. I knew right away that he needed to go to the emergency room. He was admitted and they didn't start him on steroids. I told the doctor I knew he needed them.

-1	Two years ago, I twisted my ankle, and it immediately started to swell. I could still bend my ankle, and walk on it, without much pain. I thought I had a sprain, and applied ice for a few days then warm heat. Within a two weeks the swelling went down and able to walk without much pain. 
-1	I am very sorry but this questions seems repetitive, I already gave an information that I do know how to demonstrate knowledge about health issues, so that in turn would tell you that every time I visit my physician I DEMONSTRATE knowledge always.
-1	doctors are not always right. i was in a nursing home at 35 and told nothing could be done. through my parterns research i was treated off study and walk totally unassisted now. 
1	Few years ago, one of my friends was seriously ill. He had to be admitted in the hospital. He was suffering from bone fracture. I had fractured my bones during my high school. So, I went to meet him at hospital. I told him about my experience. I told him not to worry too much as it would get better in few months. I also recommended him safety tips, healthy foods to eat. 
1	I had a hunch that I was a test subject for a certain rare disease and had to go through a lot of hoops because I couldn't exactly pinpoint what was wrong with me, it included a colonoscopy at age 21 and various other random bullshit since I had no idea what was wrong with me. I learned about various random problems and diseases that may have been unrelated until I eventually dropped everything and continued to live my life as if I didn't have any of those problems. Usually a doctors visit is really simple but I had one that made me rethink my health choices for a couple years in various ways. The disease was called PNH.
-1	I knew that i had something wrong with my uterus so i went to the doctors. They did a hysterectomy because i had a polyp as big as a grapefruit. They did a total hysterectomy because they weren't sure if it was cancerous.

1	im not sure what to write here because i do not have a time in my life where i demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues.  
1	reading of a ct scan of my lungs in search of cancers or other abnormalities and having the doctor explain the purpose and function of lymp nodes and what leads to calcification.
1	I had a mysterious allergic reaction that I went to the doctor for. I was having a very delayed reaction (5+ hours later) so I started keeping a food log everytime this happened. I went to the doctor with my food log so I could show her exactly what food it was. I had also researched why the reaction to this particular food happens and what to do about it and talked to her about that. I went in pretty much knowing what the problem was just looking for a solution. 
1	My doctor felt a lump on my right breast.  I had to get a mammogram, sonogram and have a biopsy. Then I had another mammogram.  I got a call a day later telling me it was benign and nothing to be worried about.  I did research and asked lots of questions to the doctor and nurse.
1	many members of my family have health issues that I had to learn about to help them keep on track. I have had to look a lot of information up also to make sure my kids are going to be alright when they are not feeling well. 
1	I worked as a health unit coordinator for 25 years up until 2014 when I retired. A main part of my job was to have an extensive knowledge of medical terminology. I have worked in various departments in a large city hospital ranging from telemetry, medical/surgical and maternity.
1	I have had parents and siblings in the hospital a few times throughout my life, which has helped me gain experience speaking with doctors and nurses.
1	I recently went to the doctor because I had lost 20 pounds unintentionally. My doctor thought it might be related to a thyroid problem but I want to get my cortisol checked to see if it was an adrenal issue. She then ordered both of those tests. 
1	thankfully most of my knowledge of medical issues has been fairly innocuous things like how to tell the difference between cold and flu or what foods are best for sinus infections. 
1	My brother was diagnosed with Muscular dystrophy and I use to help with him by providing nurses who were unfamiliar with disease with relevant information on how to deal with certain that issues that arises with dealing with individuals with muscular dystrophy.
1	Regulating my blood pressure. I purchased a blood pressure monitor to closely track my blood pressure and realized that I probably needed medication to control it.
-1	I don't really think I have had this other than knowing when not to, or when to call a doctor depending on the symptoms I am having the temperature. I haven't had this happen other than this though, so I'm really not sure what else to say about it. 
1	I had a stroke when I was 22 and I was able to understand why it happened to me and what things I needed to get checked out so it wouldnt happen again. I actually was a big advocate for myself because I had a stroke, followed by a concussion and a seizure but when I woke up 45 minutes later I had no residual symptoms. I had to convince the doctors and radiologists to look for proof that I had a stroke and I was able to find evidence of it so we could figure out more about why it happened.
1	I was able to tell a coworker what condition that they might have. They told me about some symptoms that they were experiencing. I was able to help them reach a diagnosis. 
-1	A time I demonstrated knowledge is when I became pregnant again, and because it was my second pregnancy I was more experienced. I knew of the issue and what steps to take for each trimester.
-1	My brother was once hit by a car when we were biking to school, and the driver got out of the car to help him. I ran to his side, and made sure to tell my brother not to move his head/neck, and told the driver not to move him as well. I knew in doing so, much more damage could be done. 
1	I had major heart surgery in 2006 to repair an aortic aneurysm, replace an aortic valve, and install a pacemaker.  Within a month of exiting the hospital, I suffered a DVT and had a bout of ventricular tachycardia.  After 12 years of ongoing monitoring and medication, I have gained a significant knowledge of the state of my own health.  I have also had other surgeries, and currently suffer from an arthritic damaged knee that needs replacement.  At sixty five years old&lt; I guess it is just the cumulative knowledge that a person gains through these experiences which has added to my health knowledge.
1	After much research and review of my symptoms, I was fairly certain that I had multiple sclerosis. Soon after that, I was officially diagnosed with the disease.
-1	When I was pregnant and had to get prenatal care to prevent gestational diabetes.  I also I to get prenatal testing to ensure nothing was wrong with the baby.
-1	I had a pap smear come back abnormal once. I knew not to get worried till after I had it done again. I was right not to get worried about it.
-1	I somewhat have knowledge about my diastis recti. I would look it up on the internet before asking my doctor and I found out what I had because I didn't know if it was a tumor or cancer. My medical issue was easy to diagnose and I understood way more about it before going to the doctor
1	I once got a fever. I hydrated myself and decided to sleep early. I think that this helped me recover more quickly than if I had stayed awake. I also kept stimuli to a minimum so that migraines wouldn't happen.
1	I really don't have a good example.  I have become knowledgeable with MS because a friend of mine has been diagnosed.  I researched and become more knowledgeable on the subject because I wanted to help her. 
1	I went with my dad to a doctorâs appointment because he has high cholesterol. The doctor told him that he needed to lower his cholesterol to a certain level. After we left the office my dad looked at the results of his blood work and believed that his number was within the range of what the doctor recommended. I showed him that he was looking at the recommended amount and not the results of his test. His actual cholesterol was way too high. He would not have known that if i did not get with him
1	When I was shopping for food, I used my knowledge of nutritional information to select foods that wouldn't give me too many calories, excessive sugar consumption, etc. 
1	I noticed one tiny drop of blood in my urine a while back.  I had a long bout with bladder cancer years ago so I first made an appointment with a urologist for a cystoscopy.  That was negative so I then went to a gynecologist and it was discovered that I had endometrial cancer and I had a hysterectomy.  One little drop of blood would have been ignored for a time if i hadn't had the bladder cancer experience.
1	Lowered blood pressure by changing diet. Found foods I liked that helped lower my blood pressure thst I enjoyed eating. Grains, fruits and vegetables are good for you.
1	A handful of years ago, I was a bit overweight and decided to shed the excess through monitoring my calorie intake. I intentionally consumed around 400 calories less daily than I was previously taking in and lost the excess weight in a matter of weeks.
1	I started doing a lot of research when I started having children. So I became very aware of different remedies and modes of service out there.
1	I took the test to detect the presence of the prostate cancer antigen knowing the high probability of false positives.  I was prepared to consider not taking further action if the test came back positive unless further symptoms occurred.  The test was negative, so no decision need to be made.
1	There are none. You can require a minimum number of character if you want to but that doesn't change the facts. I have never had serious medical problems so my medical knowledge was never put to the test. I don't have any medical knowledge besides common sense in the first place.
1	Several early college classes tested us on human health and medical issues. I also studied psychology as my major, so if mental health counts, I graduated with a 3.5 GPA. I would say that my grade demonstrated an above average knowledge of health and medical issues. 
1	I was able to diagnose the issue when my cousins child was very sick. I was able to tell that she had early stages of typhoid fever and told my cousin to take her to the doctor as soon as possible because of the symptoms and the seriousness of the condition. 
1	After feeling very dizzy for several days I had tests done. My results came back showing nothing wrong. I knew I didnât feel right and while my dr said I was fine I pushed for more from him. 
-1	I hurt my lower back quite badly, I knew that heat would relax the muscles to stop my back muscles from spasming so much, but its wouldn't help with the inflammation. So I decided to take ibuprofen for the pain but also because I know its a NSAID.  After the pain became more managable, I switched to acetaminophen since it would be easier on my stomach than ibuprofen. 
1	I listen and learn when I go to the doctor. I read information on the internet and what the doctors give me. 
1	I have taken a few classes on basic health and medicine.  I have regularly gone to the doctor all my life and have done quite a bit of reading on health and healthy activities.  
1	After I went through puberty, I started getting migraines every day. Since then, I have seen more doctors then probably most people will see in their entire lives. Not a single one took my concerns seriously.
1	"This was many years ago but my mom kept getting these burning, itchy rashes accompanied by hot flashes in the middle of the night.  She went to an allergist that checked her for everything and told her it was allergies.  I was reading about vitamins one day and saw that high doses of niacin is used in cholesterol medicines and causes ""flushing"" as a side effect.  I asked her when she takes her cholesterol medicine and she said ""right before bed"" so I told her what I'd found out.  She had her doctor change her medicine and hasn't had an issue since."
1	I had a severe reaction to an antibiotic a few years go.  A few months after it happened, I filled out my paperwork at a specialist's office and marked that I was allergic to the drug.  I realized when they were printing out a prescription for me that it was the same drug I had put I was allergic to and pointed it out.
-1	For years I have had to take regular PSA tests to determine if I was susceptible to prostate cancer. I additon levels that have gone up and down, I had an enlarged prostate which is a problem in itself - it can affect one's lifestyle since going to the bathroom several times a night can lead to tiredness and other problems -  but not necessairly life threatening. My doctor originally put me on a medication that dealt with the problems caused by the enlarged prostate but being uncomfortable with certain medications (this one I would have to take forever), fearful about the cost and after effects, I took myself off after one bottle. To make a long story short, after two bladder stone surgeries, I eventally had TURP surgery to deal with the problems caused by the enlarged prostate and while it was painful, I do not have to take any life long medication to deal with any problems.
-1	I have read about mammograms doing more harm than good. I read about studies and made my own decision not to have one due to the false positives and stress that goes along with it.
-1	I was having very serious nausea for 3 weeks, I couldn't eat anything. Several people told me it was stress, or acid, but I knew it couldn't be that. I did lots of research and my symptoms were very similar to an under functioning gallbladder. I went to the hospital and had a test done, and it proved that my gallbladder wasn't functioning properly. I'm glad I went by my gut and not what others had assumed. 
-1	When my son was 17 he looked to pass out while playing cards with friends. But he was shaking with his eyes open. This to me was the sign of a seizure, so I made sure to put him on his side to keep his airway open so his tongue wouldnt block it and keep anything he could kick or hit away from him that could harm him till the seizure was over.
1	My grandmother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and I learned a lot from spending time in the hospital and hospice with her.  I would ask the doctors what things meant in her chart so I had a better understanding of what they were doing,
-1	I was taken to the hospital not too long ago because I was having abdominal pain. The pain was so bad that I had actually fainted. The doctor discussed all the different reasons that I might be experiencing the pain.
1	When I had to talk to my mom about a rare lung disease she has. She doesn't know much about it and wasn't sure that she was getting the right treatment. I had to research it more, which I could do because I could understand what I was reading.
-1	My daughter was sick. She was coughing and sneezing and had a temperature of 102.4. Even though she had a cough and sneezing, she was behaving normally. I gave her medicine to reduce the temperature. Later on she started to act very tired. I called the doctor and they said that she was probably fine and wanted us to come in the next day. Then she started to vomit. I took her to the hospital because of her symptoms and she had a stomach viris. i felt that something was wrong with her and i did not want to wait until the next day.
-1	When  I was experiencing pain in my jaw I instantly knew that it was an infection in my gums rather than the molar itself. I began to search for treatments and cleaned in between my gums and found a chunk of food that was causing the infection. I then cleaned my mouth with an antisceptic solution and the inflation went away in about a week.
1	My son complained of numbness in his pinkie finger. I asked him how his neck felt and he said it was stiff from using the computer. I told him he might have pinched his ulnar nerve and to raise his computer monitor. He did and the numbness went away.
1	I have been a type 1 diabetic since the age of 23. This has required knowledge of a number of different body systems and medical specialties, to maximize my overall health state.
1	The flu hit my family last week.  We had our flu shots so our fevers weren't extremely high (less than 101).  The accompanying symptoms were severe fatigue, cough, nausea and an extreme sore throat.  I was concerned because in the past my children have had atypical symptoms for strep throat (pain, nausea but no fever). However, I knew that a cough wasn't typical either.  I watched my son's throat for a few days and there weren't any unusual signs until last Thursday night when white spots started showing up.  At that point, my usual wait and see on a fever and cough symptoms turned into a doctor's appointment.  I've learned to wait out viruses but not to mess with what could be a possible strep.  Thankfully it wasn't strep but I knew what to look for and be concerned from past experience.  
1	I once treated myself for a sexually transmitted disease by ordering antibiotics I had looked up (by affect to body region). I found ciproflaxin for my bladder and urinary tract, and I found doxycycline for my STD health. After looking up how long a trial is of each, I was able to complete two weeks of dosing both. I then paid for a std test at my University Health Center and I tested negative twice, to which I was very happy. In my opinion you don't need a doctor, it's just 99% of people (including myself) will never share the same knowledge as one and medicine in it's concentrated forms can be very hard to dose and apply to select cases. I am glad doctors are around, as anything more complicated than the pills would be beyond me.
1	My son had a sinus infection as a child and was having trouble breathing and my wife and i weren't sure what to do.  I turned on the shower, brought him into the bathroom and shut the door.  The steam helped clear his sinuses so he could finally go to sleep.  My wife was happy. 
-1	My experience of knowledge about medical issues is related to a heart condition I have. I am knowledgeable in general about it and about the medication I take for it. I know what the medication is supposed to do and what effects it has on my body.
-1	Honestly I probably get the most knowledge from watching documentaries on health and medical issues. Also two of my siblings are nurses and another one is in nursing school, so I never here the end of medical issues.
-1	When my mother passed out on the floor I made sure she was breathing. I did mouth to mouth CPR. I also ended up calling the ambulance because she was unconscious. 
1	I have kids that get sick sometimes and we always have to make a decision about when they need to see a doctor or when they don't. I use my past experiences and current symptoms to make that decision. 
1	"I am a mom of 7 children, so I often have to make late night ""diagnoses"" using the internet as my source. Recently one of my children had a sore throat. I googled it and found images. I looked in her throat and determined that it was strep throat by the white spots on the back of her throat. The next day I took her to the doctor, and it was diagnosed as strep throat. "
1	I have had eczema since I was a teenager, and I know that when I have a breakout that I can't control at home that the best thing for me is oral steroids. I have had doctors that have wanted to prescribe something else, but I usually insist that they give me the oral steroid.
1	I I had an abnormal cervical screening.  I was diagnosed with PCOS, inferitility, and IBS.  You just kind of pick up knowledge as you go.  The older I get the more I am diagnosed with.  You just pick up knowledge of your body as you go along.
-1	2 years ago i recieved my first mammogram.a couple days later they contacted me and i had to go in for another more intense one and also a sonagram. i was very upset of course until i read up on the subject and realized that it happened often to people the first time they get one.
1	I'm a personal trainer.  I train people daily on good health.  For example, i had a client today that was wondering about a diet.  I helped her get back on track by going over her intake 
1	well, I think this survey very much demonstrates my lack of health knowledge.  I can't figure the majority of these what % of people got false positives.  I just don't know.  I don't know that it really matters to me, the statistics of it all.
1	I tested positive for the hepatitis B antigen, so I was disqualified from giving blood. However, I know I did not contract hepatitis b, so I know it was a false positive, which can happen all the time with tests like that.
-1	When I took a long flight I ended up getting a blood clot in my leg. This helped me learn a lot about blood flow into the extremities and the damages a blood clot can have on the human body. I also learnt how to lower the rick of getting one in the future. 
1	I have an understanding of endometriosis pain, and getting endometriosis cysts because I have had them in my life. Before having kids, I never had any problem, but after my C section I developed pain that I could not control in my abdomen. After several tests I went in for surgery and ended up having a cyst.
-1	When my father developed blood clots in his legs - I was able to recognize the symptoms: pain, swelling, discoloration, warmth.  He thought he'd just pulled a muscle, but I convinced him to go to the ER.
1	I suffer from chronic migraines. I often found a significant tension in my neck when these headaches would occur. I suggested to my PCP that I might benefit from seeing a massage therapist. He agreed and we found the massage therapy would help alleviate the headaches some. 
1	I suffer from RSD and it originally started in my left arm and hand after surgery to repair a broken wrist.  Within 4 months of developing RSD in my arm my left leg started to swell and turn red and blotchy which is a indication of RSD.  My leg was also cold to the touch and very painful when touched which is a definite sign of RSD.  When I saw my pain specialist and he looked he would not believe that it was RSD because he did not believe it traveled, however after finding a newer board certified doctor in pain management he did diagnose this as the RSD traveling and also said it was not in the stage known as CRPS.  I trust my instincts and what my body tells me even if doctors may not agree. 
1	I was put on a new medication. When I picked it up I read the information sheet on it. I had some odd symptoms. I recocgnized them as side effects from te information sheet.
1	A time when I felt I had medical knowledge was when my child was very young. Her doctor told me that she had nothing wrong with her. I suspected she had a milk allergy and acid reflux. I took her to a different doctor and they confirmed my diagnosis.
1	I am a type one diabetic on an insulin pump and medication to lower my cholesterol. I go to my doctor once every three months for check ups  
1	I look up the side effects to my own medications to ensure that I am not having any symptoms that could result in me having serious complications in the future. A lot of major issues with medication start as minor ones.I saved my own life about a year ago knowing these signs. If I had waited any longer to go, or did not notice the symptoms, I would have died. 
1	My daughter fell off of a scooter and cut her leg open. There was a lot of blood pouring out onto the concrete. I knew that I needed to apply pressure to get the bleeding to stop and get her to immediate care as quickly as possible. She got 5 stitches in her knee. 
1	I started to be plagued by weakness, tiredness and shakiness, I noticed that the ends of my fingers were slightly blue/purple and remembered that that usually indicates iron deficiency, I started eating more iron rich foods and my symptoms went away in a few days.

1	Several months ago, I woke up with a Soren throat.  My glands were swollen, and when I looked in my mouth, I could see the tell tale signs of strep throats in the back of my mouth.  When I went to the doctor, he confirmed what I already knew - strep.
1	I've done a lot of research into aerobic exercise and improving your heart health. I even knew a few things about the way potassium effects your blood pressure that my doctor didn't know.
1	I was a psychology major in college so when I was diagnosed with Depression I knew what was happening to me.  It still affected my judgment and made me reluctant to seek treatment but when I did I knew I had to trust my doctors because of what I learned.  I knew medicine and therapy would be helpful for many with my condition but it does not always work for everyone.  I was more prepared for it than some others may have been in my position.
-1	After my mom suffered a stroke, I spent an extensive period of time learning about the condition and how to reduce its reoccurrence as well as the measures necessary to take if someone around you suffers from the event again.
1	A time when I got a very serious cut and knew to tie a tourniquet to reduce excessive bleeding until I could get to the hospital.
1	I have always believed to have reactive hypoglycemia. Doctors always told me I have low blood sugar but not as bad. Yet I lived with the risks and symptoms all my life. Finally 3 months ago after having a bad symptom, I found a doctor willing to do all the tests possible (unfortunate for me financially). He finally confirmed I have reactive hypoglycemia. And a lot of other health concern no other doctor informed me about before.
1	There is not many experience where I had to deal with knowledge of health or medical issues. At times I have to read nutrition labels, or sometimes in college classes I must execute hypothesis testing where the scenario is often a new drug attempting to fall below the 0.05 p-value threshold
1	I don't have any specific examples, any knowledge I have about issues are ones that I relied on the medical community for, I don't spend any time on these things because I don't want to think about the negatives.

1	Other than high school biology presentations, I have had to switch doctors and apply/appeal for disability and unemployment several times over the last 2 years. I successfully talked about my condition to Social Security and was awarded benefits. Also everytime I've switched doctors, I didn't have transferable records so I have to to recount details of my diagnosis. 
1	My mother had lung cancer and eventually was diagnosed with diabetes due to chemo and eat habits. My mother was not used to her new diagnosis so her sugar levels were up and down. From what I learned in school I was able to help her with trying to get it under control.

1	I have a degree from a culinary school and have also taken several courses on my way to becoming a nutritionist. My stepfather has gout and it bothers him regularly. My mother asked me to design him a meal plan because he does not eat as he is told and as such gout is an issue he deals with regularly. I worked with him and, based upon my knowledge of how to eat with and treat gout, designed a meal plan with food that he likes and was agreeable to eating. This made a noticable difference in his gout symptoms and issues.
1	A coworker was injured on the job. I have first aid training, I was able to assist them with their wound until medical personal arrived.
1	Probably the area where I know the most about medical issues is in terms of sexual activity. In college, I had to write a couple papers about the issue of sexual education, so I did plenty of research on the subject of STDs or teenage pregnancy. This is probably where I gained a lot of knowledge of health.
-1	I developed a blood clot in my twenties. When I walked into the ER I explained that I had a DVT due to the birth control pills I was taking. I had read the insert and I was correct.

1	I used to work in a healthcare company in data analytics. So I would have access to all of the patient information and procedural information for the tristate area to run predictive analytics as well as other things.

They wanted me to help get my dad to his feet because they thought if he started walking he would be ok.  I recognized immediately what was happening and called 911. My dad lived but he was never the same again.  His doctor showed us a brain scan that showed only a quarter size area of damage in his right brain.  It's scary that a quarter size area of damage could change someone's entire personality.
1	The last time I went to the doctor, I had strep throat. I was being checked up on and I needed to fill out paperwork at the beginning of my visit detailing some of my medical history and needs. This went smoothly.

Of course, I don't have the license to clearly diagnose them and give them medical advice without an official diagnosis so I wait until the doctor can.
1	In my life, I have learned almost all of my knowledge of health from either my university classes or from medical websites online. The time this knowledge actually came into play was when I went to the hospital and listened to what hospital staff says to patients. Recently my father went to the hospital from an illness while visiting him with my mother the nurse came in to tell us what his condition was like. During the conversation, I had no problem trying to understand any of the basic terms or some of the more difficult medical terms that were discussed by the nurse.
1	When I was a teenager I got into a pretty terrible car accident. I was badly hurt and ended up pinned inside the car in the passenger seat. The way the metal bent in it crushed my leg. It took the first repsonders awhile to get me out of the stuck car. This meant I ended up suffering from crush syndrome or Rhabdomyolysis. This is kind of a complicated injury. It required a long hospital stay and following my release from the hospital I had to do physical therapy in order to completely rebuild the muscle I had lost in my leg. During this time I was seeing multiple doctors for various problems caused by the injury. I had to  ask a lot of questions in order to find out the best way to treat the pain I was suffering through.
1	I have taken many courses on biology and health in general. I think that I know a decent amount about health care.
1	Over the past two years I have had two major broken bones through falls. In those experiences, my knowledge of health and medical issues, specifically related to bone and muscle healing and development, but also on a larger scale, have increased a great deal. 
1	One thing that comes to mind is the fact that I show up each year for an annual physical.  While this seems like a small thing to many, people who think they are healthy should be getting annual checkups because you really can't always tell.  Even if you work out religiously and eat an extremely healthy diet, it's still vitally important to check in and make sure everything is actually okay inside of you.
1	Taking a course during college for food safety and illness prevention. We took numerous tests, courses and had information about the illnesses people can get from raw food, improper food handling and cross contamination.

1	A couple years back I went to the dermatologist, but prior to that I did a lot of background search on what derms do and what they can provide for a patient.

I did end up getting what I thought I would so it really helped me out.

1	I had a child. I read up a ton on childbirth and pregnancy. I was an informed patient and worked with my doctor to create a plan that would involve as few drugs as possible and would allow me to have as much ability to move as he could grant me. Because I was informed and because he was receptive to my desires, we had a solid relationship that made me feel safe in his care. 
-1	I don't have an experience that demonstrated my knowledge on health or medical issues. I am always reliant on a medical official (doctor or nurse) to help me understand what is wrong.

I can tell the difference between a sprain or pulled muscle and something much worse but past that i do not have much experience.

I also enjoy watching different tv programs that teach you more about how to take care of yourself. I also read a lot of articles online about healthy lifestyle. I took few classes about healthy cooking and nutrition   
-1	As I had said or described previously, through my experience I have been able to learn only the basics for medical cases. For example, a while ago I had some problems with my heart. These problems made me understand that I should drink a lot of water, always avoid strong emotions or dislikes. I understood that I could feel thanks to the problem in the heart dizziness and desire to vomit
-1	I have so many to choose from. When I was pregnany I was put on bed rest for 20 weeks. Was hospitalized 5 times. Had a bunch of different doctors. My husband and I researched progesterone and questioned why I wasnât on it. Turns out all the doctors thought I should be, but none of them did anything because they assumed one of the others had. So upon my urging we began daily treatment

When she does not completely understand or even believe what the doctors are saying are correct she can call me and I can tell her if Ive ever dealt with that before. Even though I do not have a lot of knowlegde about medical conditions I seem to know more then a lot of friends and family do. Also, as I'm sure most people use Google to search medical terms or symptoms. I search google for everything so that helps me help others and myself undersand medical stuff. I do know most doctors hate for their patients to search google for medical conditions. With that said most all medical conditions have the same symptoms as other conditions so we should  only take what we find on google or even hear from friends and family very lightly and make sure to always speak with a doctor.

The ability to explain something so complex shows the extent that I understand what the doctor had told me.

For example, I realized that when he developed ascites, that this was a not a good sign and that he probably had limited time to live. When he later developed hepatic encephalopathy, I knew that his time was even more limited, and tried to help my mother-in-law in understanding this (as she was somewhat in denial about the severity of the illness).

1	My medical knowledge tends to relate around lower back and foot pain. For a number of years I had experienced lower back pain at a young age and doctors just told me there was nothing to do about it. I then went to se a chirpractor and he was able to adjust my back over a number of sessions. This relieved a lot of the pain I was experiencing. A number of years later I started having really bad foot pain and was told by doctor that it was plantar fisciatus and gave me inserts.

1	When I have a headache or a sickness of some sort, I used to take ibuprofen or other painkillers like that. For the past couple of years when I get a headache or feel rough I will just drink lots of water and take it easy. I find that when I run a fever and leave a headache alone, I will usually get well much faster and even have a feeling in my body the next day like my body is no longer fighting something. I've come to feel like the pain you during sickness is literally the thing that's gonna defeat the virus and make you feel better sooner, and recently I've been around lots of sick people and haven't been sick in over a year. I feel that I've challenged my immune system like it's naturally supposed to be challenged, and strengthened it as a result.

1	My mother was diagnozed with Alzheimer's disease at age 76.  At the time, I read that both high doses of vitamin e and hormone replacement therapy could slow the rpgress of the disease.  In addition, vitamin B12 shots administered monthly would also be beneficial.  I convinced her primary care physician to introduce these supplements into her protocol of care and she remained on a stable plateau of forgetfulness for the next six years, with marked improvement in her mood and sociability.  She died of pneumonia at age 82, before Alzheimer's progressed to its inevitable awful end.
-1	There are time when I may try to self-diagnose at home. It worries me at time when doing so, but I have to go to the doctor as well, and there are a number of times when the doctor gave me the same answer I already figured out myself.
-1	When I was given my lab results while in the Drs office I asked them before I looked at my copies if everything looked good and the nurse said yes everything is perfect so I looked over the reference ranges on all tests done. I found 3 blood tests that were flagged as abnormal and one was really low compared to what the reference range showed for Vitamin D and I was very deficient on paper. I told the DR my findings and he said ohhh just go out in the sun more. Well I talked to a nurse practitioner about it on a follow up appt and she put me on Vitamin D3 supplements for 3 months and I really felt so much better after my level was up. 
1	I eat fruit and vegitables all the time. Because of this I never get sick it seems. I think washing my hands helps too.
1	I experienced chest pain on the left side of my chest, so I went to the emergency room thinking I was having a heart attack.  The tests were negative.
1	I suspected that my son had autism at a very young age. When I took him to the pediatrician, he did not think that my son had autism and did not feel it was necessary to refer him for testing. I persisted and was able to get my son tested. My son was officially diagnosed with autism at the surprise of the pediatrician.
-1	My husband recently had an episode of CHF.  He's had heart disease for years.  The day he could no longer walk from one end of the house to the other, I knew he could no longer put off going to the hospital.
-1	When my mother started experiencing tension types of headaches, I suggest she try to work to loosen the muscles in her neck and shoulders to prevent these headaches. She began stretching each morning and the headaches stopped.
-1	I was certified for CPR a while ago.  I never actually had to use it but I was in a situation where I I was able to assist someone performing it and help remind them of the proper steps, etc to keep them confident.
1	An experience that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues was when I took a pre test in my health class in high school. I did well. I like studying health for fun.
1	I was a pharmacy tech student for over a year. We had tests on the subject and I did well, especially in medical terminology. I have been telling doctors for nine years about chronic back pain, and kept getting sent to do physical therapy which wasn't helping, they tell me I need to exercise and lose some weight but I actually have arthritis and 2 herniated discs shown by an MRI I finally talked someone into doing last year.
1	Many years ago I found a mass in my breast. I went for a mammogram, which showed something abnormal, then I immediately had a sonogram, which also showed an abnormality. I was soon after scheduled for a biopsy and it was found to be an unusual but benign cyst. I knew enough to do self checks and have it tested.
1	I have Multiple Sclerosis. One symptom I used to suffer from is extensive pain and numbness in my arms overnight. After extensive research I concluded that water fasting would help improve my condition. After 14 days of water fasting the symptom among many others has vanished.
1	Twelve years ago I was diagnosed with presumed ocular histoplasmosis. It was an emergency situation that I had to make a decision regarding my eyes by putting trust in the doctors. I asked my personal eye doctor a lot of questions and he was able to help me with my decision to have treatment on my eye.
1	Previously I was thought to have hypertension.  My doctor wanted my cholesterol reduced by 15% in the span of 6 months.  I actively took medication and my cholesterol reduced by 40%
-1	I had an experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues when I had a sonogram on my thyroid. I understood what I was told by my physician and why they wanted to do further testing, due to the results of the sonogram.
1	I knew that a loved one had a bowel blockage that needed to be addressed. It wasn't because the doctors only focused on the fact that that person had cancer. They refused to look at anything else. It was a hard battle to win.
1	An experience I had in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was when I when my toddler daughter fell from a tree and cut her arm. She was frantic but I observed that the cut was relatively minor, was an isolated injury, did not appear to need stitches and there were no apparent breaks or rapid swelling. I soothed her tears by reassuring her as I cleaned her cut thoroughly and applied pressure to stop the bleeding. Then I applied a sterile bandage to the wound and walked her through some gentle range of motion maneuvers to verify that her wrist and elbow were unaffected. Since everything checked out OK, I determined that a trip to a physician was probably not necessary. I cleaned and dressed the wound, changed her bandage over the following week, and her healing progressed without incident.
1	I had to determine whether to vaccinate my child.  This led to taking the risk of having autism.  I realized that research was trash and did it anyways.
-1	I have had wheezy breathing since I was a kid, but it was usually only when I was doing something particularly strenuous like hiking or riding my bike. When I got older, I did a good deal of research after experiencing bad wheezing while trying to get back into exercising again. I deduced that I likely had exercise induced asthma. I went to a doctor about it and they confirmed that it was that. 
1	When my daughter was little, she was prone to very high fever when sick, often over 104-105 degrees. I was aware that we were approaching dangerous territory.  Early on, doctors told us that we could overlap Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen every 4 hours because that would allow us to wait the recommended time between the same medication while shortening the time between medications.  We continued this practice, understanding that we were not exceeding recommended dosage, when she would have high fevers. 
-1	Usually I know when something is serious or not, because I try to read a lot of medical research and articles about misconceptions people might have. 
-1	When my daughter got a skin allergy reaction when she was 5, i immediately knew  it was food poison by just looking at the color of her skin
1	I had a rash on my leg and suspected that it was Eczema. I went to the doctor and he diagnosed that.
-1	Well I do not have to much experience with examples that I are listed above but I do have basic knowledge of health and medical issues. Well primary my knowledge comes from my wife who is self taught health adviser. Also my mom is a health aid she have been working for 20 years now. Sometimes I do help her with her patients, I usually drive her and her patients to and from doctors appointments. So generally my experience comes from my family, which I am thankful for, because I found a lot of things that will be very useful regarding my health and medical issues.
1	When my dad was diagnosed with kidney cancer, we both talked about the face that his 1 year survival rate was only about 15%. Particularly interesting was the fact that he had a rare form of kidney cancer and his next door neighbor died of the same cancer a few decades before making us wonder if there was an unusual cluster happening.
-1	My experiences in knowledge of health or medical issues are better till now.I have no any serious diseases infecting my body.So far there has no signs of fatal deficiencies in my body. 
1	I've had many experiences in my life where I felt I demonstrated knowledge of health and medical issues. A few instances that come to mind are when my children were younger. I use to be able to diagnose their issues with an 80 percent efficiency. This was mainly during the ages of one and five. I felt as they got older my ability to pinpoint their illness was not as spot on as when they were younger. I sometimes can make an educated guess as to what is ailing them, today. 
1	Growing up, our maid's daughter had epileptic fits. One night in the middle of the night, I was woken up by my sister who was frantic. Janelle, (maid's daughter) was having a fit and I knew enough to keep her from swallowing her tongue using a spoon and then driving her to the ER. (My parents were both out of town).
-1	I was told I could possibly be at risk of not being able to have children when I went to the hospital a few years ago due to stomach cramping. I questioned them and they could not explain that to me. I asked why they thought that and if they had any proof and they could not. I told them they shoulndn't be telling people that. 
1	I noticed that I have a blue ring around my sclera. I knew that this could be due to an issue with my collagen. I went to several different types of doctors and was told by all of them that I have a strong likelihood of having a collagen defect. I was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos syndrome shortly after. 
-1	I had a red bumpy rash on my thigh and automatically recognized as excema and was told by my doctor that it was it. I can't write anymore I have to pick up my niece something happened at her school. I will try and finish this later
-1	My daughter was born with Sturge Webber which is seizure disorder. I had to learn all about it so that I could make sure she got the care she needed.
1	A few years ago, my youngest son, who was 7 at the time, was hit by a car.  He suffered a traumatic brain injury.  He was on life support and in a coma for 3 weeks. He then was placed in a rehab hospital for many more weeks.  I had to quickly learn what was happening around me, the machines, the medications, and the monitors.  Nothing existed outside of his hospital room.
1	My doctor told me that a new medicine I could take has a 25 percent chance to cause nausea.he said it would help me though if I wanted to chance it.i figured the odds were in my favor.
-1	Being a nurse is obviously the most prominent example of demonstrating my knowledge of medical or health issues. Besides that, having children has been another way of demonstrating my knowledge. I have also had a few health issues of my own. 
1	There have been many times in my life where I was able to assess my medical problem myself and avoid a doctor's visit because I knew there was no danger and I merely needed to ride it out. At the end of last year, I correctly guessed that my oncoming symptoms meant I had contracted strep throat, so I visited a doctor immediately rather than suffer through that for weeks.
-1	I know when I am having trouble with my Cholesterol.  I know when I start feeling a certain way -- tired ect. that I am not treating it like I should be.
1	I don't know that I have many, just that I have have a few surgeries and regularly see a neurologist for migraines.
1	I am a registered sonographer so I get alot of people sending me their ultrasounds to look at baby or tell them what the gender is ect. THis will get annoying after a set of time but when you see a ultraound of a friend that is bad. you never stop thinking about it
1	To be honest, I'm not sick very often and I haven't had much experience with any life-threatening diseases.  I don't call the doctor at the first sniffle, but I do call if I do need to go see him.
1	generally everytime I go to the doctor or er, because I've had biology and medical classes and know a thing or two
-1	Someone was recently mentioning renal failure. I knew what this was just because my wife had explained it to me just recently. 
-1	After I had prostate cancer surgery and was in the process of recovering, I developed lympidemia in my left leg. For a large portion of my life I had been in excellent physical condition. As a result I knew that if after recovery I stayed active there was a very good chance that my swelling go down and stay down with regular exercise. This knowledge was gained through several sources including my doctors and previous trainers.
-1	When my husband had cancer I had to learn a lot of information. He had issues that were never discussed with us about his long term problems from head and neck radiation.
1	My knowledge on health and Medical issues is really only valuable to one person, me. I know how i feel, i know how i don't feel, I have a vested interest in my health and well being that encourages learning about whatever symptoms i may be dealing with at any given time, due to this i usually am pretty educated as to what i may likely have and why, or what i most likely do NOT have and why. I have noticed that doctors have seem to be thankful of this at many of my appointments and maybe even a little impressed! One time in particular i correctly diagnosed my skin condition and the doctor got it wrong in fact i had to really advocate for myself to finally get the medication that would treat the condition i was convinced i had, and finally when i saw another doctor he agreed with my diagniosis and treatment was immediately successful. The prior doctor had told me flatly that the condition i was concerned about was familiar to her and i DID NOT have it, in fact I DID! 
1	In boy scouts we had to learn and demonstrate first aid. I learned all the basics. Also in health class at school.
1	My husband has diabetes and so i learned alot from him. I couple years ago my doctor told me that my blood sugar was borderline but i could reduce it by changing my diet. I was fully aware of what that meant and the implications of it and i knew fully what she was talking about and what to do
1	MY GIRLFRIEND IS DIABETIC, WHEN HERE BLOOD SUGAR IS EXTREMELY LOW HAS THE APPEARANCE OF BEING SAD, IF YOU ASK HER A FEW QUESTIONS AND SHE IS UNABLE TO ANSWER THEM YOU KNOW HER BLOOD SUGAR IS LOW AND SHE'S NOT SAD.
1	When I last went to the doctor, I brought along with me a detailed list of my symptoms as I recorded them when they occurred. Along with this, I made sure to ask questions about certain health conditions that I thought I had a higher probability of having.
-1	One such experience was when I helped to take care of a loved one who was sick. I knew by taking her temperature that she could be monitored more closely for signs of infection. For example if her temperature was above 100, she would have a fever and needed medical care because she might become septic.
1	My son was having lots of issues with his ears.  I suspected that he had an ear infection.  I took him to the doctor to get checked out, and he indeed had an ear infection.  I was lucky enough to be able to try an alternative therapy to antibiotics, which I had heard about from a nurse friend of mine.  The doctor allowed us to try it and come back in a few days to see if it had worked.  It did (it was mullein garlic ear drops) and he avoided antiobiotics.
1	When my mother was ill I had to help her with her medical issues.  I did the best I could and I felt like a very competent person in regards to medical issues.
-1	When my husband died and i had to give him cpr. Which i did till medics got there then they took over. Unfortunately he did'tn make it. I was thankful that i had learned cpr in my younger days and was able to  hellp.
-1	2 years ago I had my son via c-section. 10 months post-partum I had picked him up along with a 24 pack of water and I ended up getting a hernia. I told the doctor and they agreed with me. 
1	I was diagnosed with shingles and I had already had read up on the shingles symptoms and side effects. I felt as though I was equipt enough to understand my condition better because if this. 
-1	I am able to understand when something is diagnosed to me. I understand that antibiotics are only for bacterial infections so if it is most likely a virus they should be avoided so you don't get immune.
1	Just reading random articles and looking to understand more common health occurrences and illnesses beyond a generic understanding of what most individuals would have.
1	There was some white sags in my throat once, I already know what they are, is an infection Iâve already had before, so all I needed to get was some antibiotics, I told a doctor friend of myne to give me a prescription. 
1	With the exception of minor things such as headaches, stomachaches, sore throats, colds and the flu, I am not sure if I ever have really demonstrated much knowledge of health or medical issues. 
1	My mother is a medical social worker and my father is a healthcare consultant. My mother in particular has influenced me knowing a good deal about medicine. I regularly went to the hospital with her from a young age and volunteered at her hospital as a teenager as well. I also had more serious medical problems in my late teen and early 20s that required a good deal of medical attention that made me more knowledge about medicine and tests and procedures than I ever cared to be unless I was attending medical school.
1	My son was diagnosed as having ADHD but did not show many key symptoms. I took him to different doctors after having done my own research. I believed he was mildly autistic and it was confirmed many years later that he has Asperger's Syndrome.
-1	Learning how to eat properly, as a result of growing up terribly out of shape. This led to me learning about the dangers of meat and dairy, finding out which foods nourish and heal the body, as well as nutrients and supplements. 
1	Well I can offer things like I am aware of how to perform the Heimlich Maneuver on a choking patient. Also, I know the modern strictures for performing cpr. Also I knew of a condition called Reye's Syndrome that affects children who are given aspirin.
-1	A few years ago I was diagnosed early with the full-blown flu. I know something was out of the ordinary because my body aches were very extreme. I knew it was the flu and luckily got it before it became worse. 
1	I cannot say that it really demonstrates my knowledge on medical issues but I have clearly learned many things regarding the subject. Many things I learned since my daughter was born and she had all kinds of typical for her age issues. Also when she was found with the mild hearing loss I learned a lot of her condition.
1	When I was younger, I had contracted Mononucleosis. After I had completely recovered, I had developed lumps on my shins. Most people would automatically assume that they were shin splints, but I knew better. I met with one Dr. who diagnoses me with shin splints even though I told him that I was not an active person. I also showed him my research results which suggested that I had Erythema Nodosum, which is common after contracting Mononucleosis. That Dr. told me I was wrong, so I went to a Dermatologist instead who confirmed that I was absolutely correct.
-1	Brain Tumors a condition called Neurofibromatosis. Very serious. I have both and right now my daughter has one of these diseases. Also premature babies my first born was born at 25 weeks. At 1lb 3oz. Over 4 months in the hospital
1	I was eating at a restaurant and a woman in her early sixties started grasps at her chest, and then passed out. I immediately started CPR on her and others in the restaurant called for help. I learned later that she had had a heart attack, and that my efforts had helped to save her life. It was one of the best and worst experiences in my life. 
1	i am an optometry student so i often talk to friends about their eye problems and help them especially with proper contact lens care
-1	There are many, but because I have a nursing background, most of my friends come to me for medical advice and to explain what the doctor told them.  Before I give any medical advice or explanations, I always ask if they have been to their doctor and what did he tell them.  
1	I broke my arm many years ago and was told I needed surgery to fix my arm.  When I reviewed the surgery the doctor suggested I realized that they wanted to put pins in my bones to hold them together and in turn it would dramatically reduce my range of motion in my arm.  I decided not to have the surgery and found a doctor who agreed to take a slow approach to healing my broken arm.  I spent nearly a year in various casts and my arm healed on it's own, with full range of motion.  Had I not taking the time and energy to research my arm and the suggested surgery, I may not be living the life I have now and my physical abilities would be reduced.
1	Wow, um. I guess when my son's piano teacher was diagnosed with the same breast cancer my best friend had just beaten the year before. I was able to point her to resources she needed, and helped her formulate questions to ask regarding her treatment. I learned a lot as my bff went through her treatments and reconstruction that was beneficial to my son's piano teacher. 
-1	actually in very difficult to understand simple read some terms and diagnoses, that's why I find it hard to understand and I need some to explain many times the diagnosis
1	I helped my dad take my grandfather to the emergency room when he was sick. The doctor told us what was wrong with my grandfather using medical terms. I understood this and told my dad in more simple words.
1	I had a liver transplant in 2003. Since then I have become the go to expert for the people I know on anything to do with the liver. Or any organ transplant. Or really any major surgery. Even veterinary questions. I really donât know that much about the medical knowledge behind liver transplants, but I can advise on how to approach the procedure, and what to expect to happen after the procedure (which is more important to the patient, anyway). I know I have been able to put some peopleâs minds at ease who have experienced a transplant, so that makes me feel good. In 2017 I had a kidney transplant, so now Iâm an expert on that, too.
1	My colleague cut himself. So I got a first aid kit, wrapped the cut up with ice, had him hold his cut hand over his head for a half hour, then applied wiped the cut with alcohol and applied cream to prevent infections, and bandaged him up. 
1	A friend began suffering from terrible migraines, but didn't want to go to the doctor. I asked him different questions to identify the cause, including whether he had any dental issues. He didn't see the connection, but admitted that he had an exposed nerve in one of his teeth. I suggested he stopped avoiding the dentist because that may be the cause of his migraines. Within a few days of going to the dentist, his migraines stopped.
1	I had a heart issue awhile ago and I went to the doctor about it. I had a few appointments with specialists for tests and it ended up being a benign issue that has mostly resolved at this point. I researched and listened to the doctors and they were correct.
1	I tried to use my math skills the best that I felt that I could to try and figure out the information presented.
1	In high school I took a class called Medical Terminology that was of great help to learn the medical terms.  But since then a lot of time has passed and I have forgotten most of the information. Now I only now what I read or what someone else tells me about medical issues, or some of my own experience I have with the medical field.
1	I have a lot of health problems and so does my family. I also have have a job in the healthcare field before. 
1	I verbally walked a patient through what will happen during a cerebral angiogram from start to finish.  What they will experience and and to expect from the dr.'s.  I have had these before myself and i also schedule them.
1	I had a friend that I was helping out when I noticed that she was having problems. First it was just not being able to remember but then she couldn't add and that was not like this smart individual so I asked her a few questions and I told her she needed to go to the doctor right away.  I was right she had a brain tumor that was causing her trouble.
1	I was with my grandma when she was diagnosed with dementia.  Based on movies I had seen, I was able to question the doctor about what was to come.  
-1	I had a real bad sore throat a few years ago and I had a feeling that I had strep throat. I was correct with my diagnosis, I realized that I was having to much pain so I knew it couldn't be a regular sore throat. my thinking was confirmed by my doctor. 
1	I had a mammogram that was suspicious and needed a breast biopsy. I asked to have an ultrasound or MRI to confirm before surgery. They did as I requested and found it was a fatty tumor, no surgery needed
-1	well because of my health issues I was able to figure out my husband had diabetes and diabetic nephropathy and he was able to go to the doctor to get treated for it and he is doing much better
-1	About 15 years ago my primary physician was completing my annual exam and asked if I was experiencing any pain in my upper back.  I told her that I was aware of the curve in my spin but that I had attributed the discomfort that I was having from the years of pushing Z-racks at work. She prompted informed me of the medical term for the physical condition and recommended that I keep an eye on it.  She did send me to have xrays done to begin tracking.
-1	my experience is very little, but when i do a medical exam i read the results online after going to my doctor and understand all
1	I had a ingrown toenail that I had to have a doctor remove a few years ago. I knew what an ingrown toenail looked like and the health risks that it came with.
-1	I was able to successfully nurse my bedridden brother who had suffered multiple injuries from a near fatal accident. I followed the doctors directions.
1	A few years ago, I lost about 70 pounds without help from a medical practitioner. I just made a switch to eating whole foods and exercising daily. My doctor always wanted to make it a thyroid issue, but I firmly believed that once the change was made the thyroid would follow. It did.
1	I had many experiences practicing as an emergency medical technician for a fire department. I would have to obtain histories, perform physical exams, treat some injuries, provide health advice, and come up with a differential diagnosis.
1	Apologies in advance if this isn't exactly the type of experience that you're looking for, but it's the only thing that I can think of that somewhat relates. Whenever I run across something that I don't know about (especially a health issue), I typically try to do as much research on it as I can. As mentioned before, I suffer from IBS. I tried to do what research that I could on my own, but I eventually had to cave and go to the doctor when it didn't seem to get any better (it's a good thing that I did, because I likely also had a stomach ulcer). Anyway, fast forward about half a year later, and it seems that my IBS is getting worse and my medicine doesn't seem to be helping that much. I go to the doctor again to get a different medicine, which also doesn't seem to be doing much good. In the meantime, I've been keeping a food journal and doing more research on my own. After a couple of months of pain, I figure out the problem--I've developed fructose malabsorption. After cutting out soda and other things high in fructose, the problem is as fixed as it can be.
1	I had a toothache and found out it was infected. They gave me an antibiotic to take for 15 days. I felt better in two days, but continued to take the antibiotic as directed, because I know that is what you are supposed to do or else a new hardier strain could develop.
1	When my mom had a heart event.  She had to be shocked back to life twice, and put into a medically induced coma for 2 days while her body recovered before they allowed her to wake up and took her off of all of the medications. I had to deal with all of the inputs from the doctor's on if she would wake up, when she would wake up, how should would be if and when she woke up as well as medications and after her open heart surgery, how to take care of her when she returned home.  It was 3 weeks of being in the hospital looking after her with my husband, pulling night shift and working to be a patient advocate.
1	When I was told about ear infections, I knew most of the information because I had had ear infections in the past. I knew any technical terms and what causes them and the treatments for them.
1	I had a perianal abscess a few years ago. last year I started feeling like I was getting another one. I went to my doctor, explained what I was feeling and the doctor examined me. He told me I was right and started me on antibiotics.
-1	I was diagnosed with unexplained high blood pressure. Since there was no explanation, it has made it challenging to figure out how to solve the issue and avoid heart damage in the future.  
-1	I have had to have over 12 surgery's and many more biopsy's in my life. i have had bone grafts done to breast biopsy's.. i have a lot of experience in the hospital care world. Today i do home care for a quadriplegic between his and myself we have plenty of experince.
-1	In 2004, I took a bad fall in front of the hospital I worked at which resulted in a fractured right hip.  It required surgery and 4 weeks later after a rehab stay I was home and regaining my mobility and living life at a much slower pace.  It was the first time I was incapacitated and had to rely on others for help.  I knew that I needed to follow the dr's orders and almost 9 months later I was back to work.  I did everything as ordered and because I was familiar with medical jargon I was a good patient.
1	My mother is a type 1 diabetic which she got in her 20s. So since then she is well versed in medical knowledge and keeps on it. She kept up on me as a kid and into my 20s. I think I learned a lot from that and apply what I learned from my mom to own health. I also consult with her still. 
1	I knew antibiotics have to be finished completely. so With my knowledge I helped my friend to take the full course rather stopping it in the middle after she started feeling okay.
1	I went to college for nutrition/dietetic technology, so I am aware of the values of the lab tests and what they should be. I also know how I could improve my diet to lost weight and help my cholesterol numbers. I am also very aware of having to take care of myself and particularly my heart to help me live a better life. I have also suffered from depression, anxiety and PTSD for over 25 years, so I know how to avoid triggers and help myself so I can stay on a low dose of medicine.
1	I recall when my son had an accident by the door slamming to his fingers. He almost lost the tip of his fingers the doctors told me that I have the option of either amputate or go for a surgery to try to save the fingers but the chances are very slim. I asked them to give written information about the surgery and the likelihood of success. I took my time to go through the information provided and based on what they told me and my knowledge and I decided that he will go for surgery. It was one of the best decisions i have ever made, four years later my son's finger look pretty normal.
1	19 years ago my doctor told me I was diabetic. He knew me well, and said he'd give me 6 months to learn as much as I could about it and to see if I could control it on my own without medicine. If I didn't have it under control within that time (or wasn't showing improvement on subsequent visits prior to the 'deadline') he'd prescribe something to control it. I had it under control within 6 weeks. Through diet and exercise maintaining extremely tight control of my blood glucose level has become routine. I'm almost always below 90 mg/dL. I get a good night's rest to not interfere with my 'dawn effect.'
-1	When I tried to lose weight a few years ago I created an eating plan that was very healthy and I actually ate everything i needed to eat and was losing weight fast without starving.
1	When I was only 16 or 17 I had a gland that was swollen.  Being that I do get nervous about health related things, I did my own research before seeing the doctor.  This was just shortly before the internet took off.  I had a book that explained what my issue was, with the specific name of the gland.  When I visited the doctor, I used that name to tell him what I thought was wrong with me.  He was very surprised that I had any idea what it was, and said that I was correct.  This example explains just many instances like this I have had in my life with doctors.  I apparently surprised them with how much I know.  I do this because it lessens anxiety to have as much information as possible.
1	I was talking to my doctor after a visit and I mentioned that I saw the AHA had changed the guidelines on cholesterol. He had heard about it too and we had a discussion about cholesterol numbers.
-1	I have low blood sugar and my doctor explained the need for me to eat 6 small meals a day and make sure I eat complex carbohydrates and protein at each of those meals.  I understand that doing this will keep my blood sugar level and I will feel better.

1	I was able to cure a bout of strep throat in myself without the help of antibiotics.  When I found out that I had it I researched it and discovered that I could use household products to kill the bacteria and that it would likely go away on itâs own if I waited long enough.
1	When I was pregnant my Doctor always was so surprised that I knew as much as I did.

1	I think going to university helped me demonstrate my knowledge, or rather, my lack there-of. I think I only know some things about the health care industry, and I feel like they are worthwhile things to have, but they need some serious readjusting. I've only had chances to write papers or talk about these things with my friends, but never had the chance to practice these concepts in a profession.

1	I have a friend that is diabetic. She has a pump that constantly pumps insulin in to her. We went on a trip to New York and we were sightseeing. Suddenly Christine did not seem right.

I reported to the operator that I believed my friend was having a stroke, and went through the standard diagnostics to confirm this, while we awaited an ambulance.
1	The only real experience would be when I was young in Boy Scouts and we learned first aid for many different injuries and illnesses. We demonstrated that knowledge every year in an annual first aid competition where we were given different scenarios and judged on how we handled the incident.
1	There's not too many to list for me. I tend to defer to someone else. However, there have been various times where I've commented (ie: on social media) with my understanding of issues that I have experience with. For example, a couple years ago I explained to a worried young male what a varicocele was.

I took that for a period of time and then my sleep returned to normal, which it still is. 
-1	Get a dictionary of medical terms and look up the ones you don't know in your reading material. Use the terms in sentences until they make sense.

1	I worked with children with severe and profound illnesses as a result I learned a number of basic medical techniques including tube feeding, IV maintenance, and other low level tasks that I would have to perform in an emergency.  In addition the necessity of understanding medical issues with a rare disease gets much higher since many doctors have never heard of my condition. 
-1	my life experience while i visit hospitals sometime i observe a few doctors and patients so i know what what its life to pay attention to all the issues and treat them

A few years later a friend was also experiencing a missed miscarriage and her doctor gave her the option to wait and miscarry naturally or have the D&C.

She did not suffer any additional mental episodes during that treatment.
1	I was having severe headaches for a few years. I went around to various physicians/specialists for testing and everything under the sun. I questioned all of them about whether or not my neck could be the culprit of my headaches, and they all just laughed at me. I did my research and found a physical therapist who specialized in neck issues and sure enough, it was absolutely an issue with my neck that was causing my headaches.
1	I cannot recall any experience that has demonstrated knowledge of health or medical issues because I am not familiar with these. At least I recognize which type of doctors I have to visit in order to get correct analysis and treatment. My most recent experience involved a pain I was having in one of my shoulders for a long time. I knew I had to go see an orthopedist who checked and diagnosed me. 
-1	I do my own research on the internet and ask friends. A doctor once misdiagnosed my appendicitis. I   have an appendix that points backward instead of forward in my body, so the symptoms present were in a different location. I researched and found this information.

1	I mean, I take very good care of myself, and I often give people nutrition and health advice. I dealt with mental illness (depression and anxiety) for years until I finally decided I needed to tackle it from all sides and finally get rid of it. This involved a great deal of research and realizing just how important physical self-care was for mental health. This was something I had neglected for years, especially in terms of sleep and nutrition. So I finally started getting enough sleep on a regular basis, eating healthy, and taking carefully selected supplements that are helpful for mental and general health, and overcame mental illness for good.
1	I was having trouble having normal sleep patterns.  I didn't drink caffeine or do anything abnormal within 6hours of my desired bed time, yet i still never could go to bed at my desired bed time.  Worst yet I would experience symptoms such as a fast heart beat, tingly feelings in my appendages and high chest pressure when I laid down.  I figured out my above normal intake of sugar, caffeine, nicotine early in the day caused this and once I stopped the nicotine and reduce consumption of caffeine and sugar the aforementioned side effects stopped.
-1	A couple of years back I had gone in for a routine mammogram and since some abnormality was detected I was asked to undergo a biopsy which , thankfully, was found to be negative. I was glad I had this test done.

1	During my junior year of college I had a cyst in my ovary. I was able to identify exactly were the pain was and what I thought it was based on the internet and using my instincts and all of the signs. 
1	Once I was shadowing a physician prior to begging medical school. The physician asked me (in front of the patient), if the patient started off with a throat infection, and eventually developed an ear infection, how did this come about? I responded with, either the eustachian tube, or a superimposed infection brought on by the weak immune system. He told me great job and correct. Patient looked at me with pride. 
1	One experience in my life that has demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is when my grandfather started to suffer from a heart attack. I saw the symptoms. 
1	After years of going to the allopathic doctor and getting lots of tests done and very little answers, I stopped listening to mainstream medicine and started learning about naturopathic medicine.  I felt awful and had difficultly thinking clearly often. I started taking vitamin B-12 tincture, nascent iodine, and did a parisite cleanse (which includes micro-organisms, not just the FDA's definition of a parisite), and for the first time in my life I can think clearly by default and stopped taking prescription medication for ADD.
-1	I actually worked as Director of Risk Management in a large hospital.  Within that role, I was required to know many aspects of healthcare.  I was exposed to tremendous amounts of medical knowledge and terms.  Working alongside doctors and nurses, I picked up a lot of medical terminology.  However, since that time, I have lost much of my ability to remember much of what I learned due to the toll my illnesses have taken on me.  Also, having to go to the doctor often increases my medical knowledge.  Unfortunately, I can't retain most of it.

-1	Both when I received the news that I had fibroids and it was causing infertility issues.  I researched the best options for dealing with them and consulted my doctor after that. I cut certain things out of my diet and then had surgery. I am hopping to be able to conceive in the meet few months. 
1	Over the course of several days, I've noticed my roommate has stayed in the bathroom for long periods throwing up. His diet isn't the best, as he consumes a lot of sugary foods/drinks such as soda and candy as well as eating a lot of fast food. I told him his symptoms reminded me of someone who has acid reflux and searched online to confirm these symptoms. When he got officially diagnosed by a doctor, it was confirmed. 
-1	I was told a few years ago that I needed to have major surgery, and what the recovery process would be like afterwards. So, I remember that I researched as much as I could and I thought ahead of any questions that I could ask when I sat down for my consultation with the surgeon.
1	A doctor told me to get the flu vaccine during pregnancy. My friend is against vaccinations, especially during pregnancy, and told me not to get it. I did some research on the topic and found out for myself that I should get the vaccine because the risks to my baby seemed to be lower if I did.
1	I had some odd symptoms last year that were not going away on their own, and was trying to find out information online.

-1	Had an ache in my side for several days before I made it to the doctor. In the meantime, I took care of it as a kidney infection (correctly) because I knew that was where my kidney was and saw my symptoms.
1	My grandfather went to the urologist and had a PSA blood test done.  I knew from his results, being over 3.0, that this meant he would likely need a biopsy to test for prostate cancer.  I also knew that these tests could produce higher than normal levels if the patient has an enlarged prostate.  I asked to see his former results.  They were up and down a lot, which is typically a sign that there is NOT prostate cancer, but instead, an enlarged prostate.  I also knew that an enlarged prostate could be due to prostatitis, an infection of the prostate.  Sure enough, he went back to the doctor to follow up, and turned out to have a prostate infection.
-1	When I was in my friend's house and she began to have a big headache, I cured here giving a pill that quits most of headaches in an hour. She thanked me a lot and decided to buy this pill too. I'm always prepared to these cases because I know there are frequent.
1	My husband's cholesterol is high.  We talked to the doctor and then looked up information to see what target number we needed to get him to.

We were able to facilitate that change enough in 6 months to avoid needing to have him take medication.

A few minutes later I heard a loud thud and went to go check on him. The door was open and he was having a seizure on the floor. I pulled him by the shoulders out of the small bathroom and into the larger adjacent room. I elevated his head on my knees and stuck my leather wallet between his teeth. After about ten seconds or so he calmed down. He was kind of out of it so I called an ambulance for him. He was ok in the end but is now on medication.
1	When I was in high school myself and bunch of friends were at a friends house one of my friends fell and twisted her ankle badly. I carried her to the house elevated and iced her foot until someone was able to take her to the doctors. She had a bad sprain, with a lot of swelling.

My father was diagnosed with Low-T, and given a testosterone booster (that he later dismissed and stopped taking, in lieu of his beta blockers). My brother taught me how to sterilize the injection site and my hands, properly take precautions such as gloves, and how to inject and administer the drug (through a slightly forceful, straight motion, applying the dose over a period of roughly 15 seconds into the gluteous maximus).

At 39 weeks tests finally showed it and i was hospitalized and induced the same day due to severe preeclampsia.

1	I was on a medication that had a side effect of lowering blood pressure, and my doctor had added another medication at night that also had that side effect, which I was only to take if I wasn't at all dizzy. Since the second medication worked very well for the symptoms for which it was prescribed, I suggested possibly changing the other medication to something else, since it wasn't as good at controlling the symptoms for which it was prescribed as the new medication. My doctor agreed.
1	After having several kidney stones I knew what my pain was and I also knew what the procedure was to remedy the problem.

-1	When I had my daughter my Dr. insisted we delivery 4 weeks early due to me having a previous classic c section to avoid the risk of going into labor. I researched the topic so I knew this wasn't best for my baby and was unnecessary. I tried to argue my point but the Dr. would not listen to me. My baby turned blue while rooming in with me and had to be put in the NICU for 21 days due to immaturity. Ten years later when I had my son the laws had been changed to not allow my baby to be taken more than 2 weeks earlier due to the NICU cost of doctors like the one I had with my daughter taking babies too early in situations like mine where there was a previous classic c section. My son was taken at 38 weeks and was fine. He went home the next day with me.
-1	 I used to work in the public school system. I worked with a teacher who was a Type One diabetic. I also had a son in law at the time who was a Type One diabetic.

Because of my hands on experience with my son in law,I was able to recognize the signs and symptoms in the teacher I worked with,when she fell ill one day. I was able to summon help for her and give my opinion on what was going on with her in the moment,health-wise. It turned out I was correct and that she did indeed have Ketoacidosis.

As a result, I try and pass on the knowledge to other people who are dealing with similar back issues and refer them to doctors that have helped improve my condition. 
1	In 1995, I came down with an extreme flu-like illness that I almost died from. Several years later, after researching the information online and talking with my doctor, i came to the conclusion that i had Hanta-virus due to living in close quarters with a field mouse that infected me.

I do this because I understand muscle mass is important, and can be harder to put on as one ages. Also, strength training can help with bone density, which is useful especially as women age. I also want good cardiovascular health. This is all because people in my family tend to live to be quite old (my great-grandmother is 96!), but not necessarily with a great quality of life, and I want to have a great quality of life as I age.
1	I was at the doctor's office and they were explaining to me what it meant to have high blood pressure, the potential complications that it can cause, and what I need to change in my life in order to get my blood pressure under control.

1	I cannot think of a time in my life where I had the chance to demonstrate my medical knowledge except to apply it to my daily life and try to keep myself as healthy as possible. 
-1	When I met a surgeon prior to going in for back surgery, I looked up many questions to ask the surgeon so I would know more about how many surgeries he had performed and how successful he was, as well as how long my recovery would take, and if there was a problem who to call. The surgeon broke everything down beautifully and in terms I could easily understand. I felt extremely comfortable prior to my surgery and confident in his skills.

I had spent much time in headache clinics as well as a month inpatient in a special migraine unit in Michigan where they tried to solve my migraines.

When I went to see a doctor he told me the same thing that this is going to be ligament and/or meniscus. I ended up having both. Bot I got it fixed and now it feels better.
1	I passed my CNA exam in high school which you can do in my state without taking classes. I just took the book and studied so I could charge more as a babysitter.

1	My children have been ill on numerous occassions with upset stomachs.  I know from past experience that they need to stay hydrated and also eat foods that are easy on the stomach.  Being able to know to give them a BRAT diet has saved trips to the doctor.
-1	In college I took a health and wellness class as an elective. We studied the human body, environmental risk factors that effect human health and all kinds of sicknesses.
-1	Went to a doctor. Told me I had some heart issues and needed to exercise more. Immediately I started walking and jogging on my breaks at work. 
-1	I know a lot about hypothyroidism because I was diagnosed with it when I was born. I was born without a thyroid so I have to take medication my whole life for it. I am very knowledgeable about it and get blood tests regularly. I explained this to a new doctor I was seeing, so I demonstrated my knowledge of my condition.
1	When my grandpa was in the ER for his gout and fever, the doctor prescribed him a new medication to treat his gout. When we were given the discharge papers, I reviewed everything and reviewed the medications side effects. It had stated that the medication should not be used if another medication is currently being taken. I asked a nurse about that and she wasn't sure about it so she talked to the doctor. The doctor had to review all the medications again and ended up saying it was okay to take both medications at the same time after a thorough review. 
1	I usually obtain copies of blood work, etc. from y doctors.  I realized that there was a vitamin D deficiency.  This went unnoticed for several appointments.  When one doctor recognized the deficiency and called me, I knew I could u as t him.
1	My 1 year old burned his hands on a curling iron and we had to go to mutliple emergency rooms and hospital.  One doctor told me we needed to do immediate surgery.  The burns were bad but not that bad.  I have some knowledge of burns and new the heal naturally very well.  I asked for a second opinion and did not do surgery.  Every thing worked out great.
1	I scraped my knee. I washed it gently, to prevent infection. I found a clean old rag  to use as a bandage. I wrapped it around my knee and secured it with tape. Not too impressive, I know.
1	I work in healthcare as a patient care tech so i demonstrate my knowledge to my patients day in and day out. I also took an EMT course through the state i reside in so i use the information i learned there at work each day as well. Lastly, I tend to be the friend that everyone goes to with their medical questions despite my lack of statistical knowledge presented in the past few questions. 
1	Most of the time I had to explain what the diagnostics were to my parents and now I do it  with my wife
1	When my ex attempted suicide due to a benzodiazpene overdose, I took appropriate measures such as making sure she stayed awake after I found her to reduce risk of brain damage. A negative result of knowing about that class of drug is knowing that memory damage is likely due to damagine GABA receptors, which have a critical role.
1	I have PCOS.  I have done research on it and been to various doctors.  At one point, my doctor put me on the drug metformin.  He did initial blood work but did not follow up.  After doing more research, I learned that he needed to do follow up blood work to check my levels.  He was not doing follow up blood work.  I took myself off of the drug and never went back. PCOS involves a lot of trial and error. I feel like the patient needs to be their own advocate. 
1	I have taken classes for medical billing and coding. I also have an aunt that is a nurse and I learn a few things from her. I received my degree in medical billing and coding, but I have never used my degree through employment.
1	I have advanced education in training in the medical field. I have a Bachelors of Science degree in Biological sciences. After obtaining my undergraduate degree, I went to graduate school and received my doctorate in immunology.
1	I can absorb knowledge and information better than most. I have no problems figuring out what I should do when a problem or condition. Usually I have been told before, and I remember it. I always see a doctor for most problems. When get a new prescription, I always ask the pharmacist about the new drug.
1	I know that when I take a UTI test strip test, if it shows signs of leukacytes or nitrates that there is a good chance that I have an infection.
1	One time when I was younger I was around a friend that experienced severe burns to their foot.  They instantly wanted to run to put their foot under cold water to cool it off but I told them that doing so could result in a lot more pain than they currently were in and also tissue damage to the foot.
1	About 20 years ago my daughter called me one morning as my 10 year od grandson was getting on the bus and she happened to mentioned he had been getting up in the night to go to the bathroom. In the next sentence she said and he is so thirsty the last coupe days all he wants to do is drink water. He had already taken the bus so I told her it was urgent for them to get him when he got to school and take him right to his Dr. I said sounds like diabetes. They took him in and his numbers were so high they admitted him to the hospital for a few days. He is a type 1 diabetic.
-1	well i know that some of thesee i did not know but with myself i know because my dr tells me and i can read my paper 
1	My friend had a gallbladder attack and her doctor told her that she could avoid surgery if she ate healthy. She started talking about the things that she ats and I noticed that her diet was not the kind of diet she should have if she is trying to avoid gallbladder attacks. She still ate things like fried chicken or pizza which are foods rich in fat, fat triggers gallbladder attacks and I told her that this kind of food would most certainly lead to a gallbladder attack if she does not cut back or completely eliminate them from her diet. 
1	Sometimes I have a hard time breathing due to asthma but I can't tell if it's asthma or my throat is dry. I know that a sign of asthma is wheezing, so I breathe hard to see if I'm wheezing. If I am, then I use my inhaler.
-1	I donât have any health issues so I donât know how to answer this question... so donât know how to explain 
1	I had gestational diabetes with my last pregnancy.  I was required to eat a healthy diet with limited amounts of carbohydrates. I also had to prick my finger 3 times a day and monitor my blood sugar to see if i would need to be placed on medication.  I was also required to walk for 20-30 per day.  Therefore, I learned how to test my blood sugar, count my calories and carbohydrates and make sure i was exercising.  It was required for my health and my unborn baby's health.
1	I sometimes deal with IBS and have researched a bunch of information on it for possible remedies. When my sister started dealing with some stomach issues I was able to help her with some diet tips to get it back under control. She was on a fairly unhealthy diet due to being in college and limited food options, so we figured out a plan that would work for her.
1	I had to help my mom with her insulin.  She needed 1 unit for every 20 points her blood sugar was over the reccommended level and i was responsible for figuring out exactly how much insulin to give.
-1	I had to go to the hospitial at 20 for them to remove a tumor on my left testicle. I did a lot of research then to find out the whole process of it all. Thats about it 
1	There was a time when I was hiking with a friend and she cut herself deeply with a knife while we were away from help. I was able to use a butterfly bandage to hold the wound shut because of what I knew about the nature of the cut.
1	While asleep on the sofa on a weekday afternoon, I was awakened suddenly by a sharp pain in my upper chest.  After a brief moment, I realized that this was a pain that I had never experienced before.  It was definitely something important and possibly very serious.  A minute or two later I was on the phone with paramedics and soon on the way to the hospital.  Three cardiac stents later, I am glad that I was able to recognize the location and unusual character of the pain and seek immediate help.
1	I broke my arm in 4 places and had to go to the Doctor who almost had to do surgery on it. Instead though, she put it in a cast and within 8 weeks it had healed. But those were the longest 8 weeks of my life.
1	I was admitted to hospital having premature labor with my second child. A nurse attempted to start a pitocin drip with no doctor present. I told her pitocin was unnecessary since I was already having contractions. I told her to confer with doctor. Turns out I was right.
1	We were hiking in the backwoods and my friend slipped and cut her hand.  She needed stitches and we were to far out to get help in  time.  I used my sewing kit to sew up her wound.
1	I used to be a lifeguard and was responsible for first aid and basic care in the event of any of the swimmers getting injured. This showed that I knew basic medical information.
-1	When I applied for SSD I was able to essentially tell them what was wrong with me in the forms I needed to fill out. This helped them make a determination regarding my eligibility for disability. 
1	When I first made my initial visit to my doctor I came prepared with several questions. I was pleased that she did not just talk about what medicines I may have to take but asked about my diet and exercise routine. She was rather pleased that I already had an established exercise program and watched the intake of sodium in my diet and encouraged me to continue on the path I was on.
-1	I am not sure I have had an experience that gave me any knowledge of health or medical issues.  Except I have a friend with diabetes and have known folks with cancer and have died.
1	A woman I know was having chest pains, she wanted to call an ambulance or drive herself to an emergency room, but I told her that the cost of the ambulance ride might not be covered by her insurance, and her insurance might not cover the cost of her emergency room visit if it turned out that she did not actually need emergency care. After some discussion she decided to take a Lyft to an urgent care facility. I haven't been able to find out what happened to her after that. 
1	There have been a number of times. One time was when our son had an allergic reaction to pecans. He started breaking out in a rash so we gave him benadryl, called the nurse, and kept an eye on him to make sure his airway didn't become involved.
1	I majored in psychology and took many science classes. When I hear about anti-depressant medications, I know the differences between SSRIs and other types and generally understand the mechanism by which they work on the brain. 
1	I have a chronic illness and have had multiple complications from that. I have a positive ANA, I've had a stroke yet I've had no heart or vascular disease, I have chronic fatigue, I've had extremely elevated liver enzymes where they go up and down. The one thing they do know I have is Hashimoto's auto immune thyroid and even though it hasn't been confirmed yet, I believe my stroke was caused by my Hashi's because it causes me to have afib sometimes. I know that if I have one Auto immune disease I could have others. I know that if my thyroid hormones are not at the right level they can cause all kinds of problems with metabolic processing that could include problems with my liver or my immune system may decide to attack my liver. I have figured out on my own that my body does not convert T4 to T3 and being on a medication that has both is optimal for me. And I've learned that sometimes blood work does not tell the whole story, that more than anything you have to listen to your symptoms and use those as a guide along with blood work.
-1	Not that there was a lot but the times I did have to have hospital visits for myself and my family members. A few times it was very serious but mostly routine checkups.  And general knowledge I have learned over time.
1	Just going to the doctor and listening to my doctor and reading stuff online from credible sources. My own health problems and how to make it easier through food/exercise and my mother.
1	I had to make level of resuscitation decisions for my father last week. I consulted with him, my brothers and sisters and the medical professionals to decide on a middle level resuscitation order.
1	I was having a lot of issues with constant low grade headaches for several months. I saw several doctors and did a plethora of online research to try to find out what was going on.
1	An experience in my life that demonstrated this was when I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I learned more about health and medical issues than I ever wanted to.
-1	After finding out I had anemia, I started to drink carrot juice. My doctor was delighted to see my hemoglobin during my next visit.
1	A few weeks ago my roommate had a fever and felt ill. He thought that the fever was the issue and he would be okay if his body temperature was lowered. I explained how fevers occur to help your immune system fight off illnesses, and lowering the fever would only make it harder for his body to deal with the real issue. 
1	Well I suppose one of the best experiences of my life that demonstrates my knowledge of health and medical issues is the classes I took in college.  Between studying anatomy and physiology, doing labs on the same subject, and taking tests on everything, the fact that I passed I suppose proves my knowledge of the subject matter.  I also did a study-abroad trip in college with a group of nursing students in Cameroon doing health screenings.
1	"My dad was having ""bad indigestion"" one day and he told me the symptoms he had had the night before.  I told him in sounded a little like a heart attack.  He was checked out and it was not a heart attack, but it did have similar symptoms."
1	Someone in my extended family was diagnosed with a terminal illness that required aggressive treatment and eventually end-of-life care, and even though I have no medical training I read a lot about many topics, including medicine, and some of what I'd learned helped me take care of my family member and speak on their behalf with doctors.
1	I was a division 1 track and field athlete and over the years after many muscle strains and pulls, I have been able to properly identify the difference between the two when I get injured.  I usually am able to self-rehab on my own from learned experiences.
1	My neighbor came over to visit and as she was leaving she lost her balance a little, I noticed that her speech was starting to slur and face seemed a little slack on one side. It was apparent to me that she may be having a stroke, I called an ambulance and they were able to get her to a doctor quickly to minimize the effects.
1	I've had asthma and allergies my entire life and can explain what is happening with my symptoms accurately to doctors in order for them to best diagnose and solve the issue. I also know which of the over the counter medicines tend to solve which issues quickest and most effectively.
1	An experience in my life where I demonstrated my knowledge of health or  medical issues is when I had jaw surgery. I have been going to the orthodontist since I was two years old. I knew a lot about my mouth and what was going on. Whenever I went to have the actual surgery, I went to a different hospital with different doctors. They were explaining to me everything that was going to happen but since I have been going to the orthodontist for years I already knew everything that was going to happen and could talk to the surgeons like I knew what I was talking about.
1	I have no single experience. I just understand what my doctor is telling me because I understand the human body to some degree because of courses I've taken in school and my own reading.
-1	I can recall a time a couple of years ago where i started getting this really sore thorat.  It started slow as first and within a couple of days it would not let up.  Ive had strep before and figured that is what it was turning into. i got a flashlight and looked in the back of my throat and sure enough there were little white puss pockets started to form in my throat.  At that point i went straight to the doctor where they ran a strep test and it came back positive for strep.  I was giving antibiotics and it cleared withing a few days, but i finished all of the medicine even though i felt better as it took what was prescribed to me until it was finished. 
1	As I have PCOD problem i am aware of the symptoms and cares to be taken of the health to reduce the problem and in my home my dad have this acromigaly problem by which i am aware of the symptopms of that problem and there is no treatment for this problem and similarly i have knowledge on BP and blood sugar
-1	none because I have not needed to go to the doctor for any serious issue so I am still healthy and do not need to see to my health for now.       
1	after my father was diagnosed with two conditions, i was worried about my risk for developing one or both. so i went to my doctor knowing the symptoms i'd seen show up with my dad's conditions.
1	I had to get my gallbladder taken out. Before the doctors realized it, I had mentioned I thought it was gallbladder, and the instacare doctor dismissed it and said I wouldn't be having pain in the middle of my upper stomach area, but I had researched and talked to others that this is true, that you can feel the pain in the middle. Needless to say, another attack landed me in the ER and they did an ultrasound and diagnosed me with gall-sludge. They scheduled to take my gallbladder out and did. Pain went away.
1	I have been taking care of my grandma who has several health problems full time for the last several years. She has diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, and cancer. I help her with understanding her medical information as well as help her with her medication. 
1	At one point in my life I was considered obese. The weight gain had happened quickly and with no apparent change to my lifestyle in terms of exercise or diet. I went to the doctor because I assumed it could be a hyperthyroid issue. 
1	"I was able to quit smoking cold turkey when I had a child. Regardless of the ""benefits"" it may have brought to me for quitting, the fact that my child won't have to grow up breathing in second hand smoke because of me is good."
1	I took a class for EMT basic training and passed with flying colors. Some of the things I learned were how first responders react (secure the scene, ABC - airway, breathing, circulation). Also learned to how to give oxygen, check blood glucose, among other things.
-1	A lot of it was math, as I work with math a lot. For myself going through a high risk pregnancy I had to be careful of my diet and exercise. Also my mental health and what kind of anti depressants I have to take and the side effects.
1	I graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor's degree in General Science - focusing on pharmacology. I have taken 1 year of health classes, 1 year of chemistry, 1 year of organic chemistry, 1 year of human anatomy and physiology, and one term on animal physiology. 
-1	When taking my daughter to the hospital because she was sick. I was pretty sure she had the flu, and I turned out to be right. 
1	In high school one of my friends said he felt bad. He got up to walk down the hall and passed out. He was sweating and in a sort of daze. Knowing that he had diabetes I grabbed a piece of candy out of my purse and shoved it in his mouth. This perked him up enough to help him get to the nurses station and get his sugar levels sorted out. It had dropped insanely low. 
1	In my undergraduate years at college i did a presentation over a chronic illness that my mother had that lasted for 15 minutes describing the effects of the disease as well as what caused it and how it was treated
1	I have been diagnosed with IBS.   I participated with my doctors for over a year narrowing down the possibilities for my symptoms finally to that of IBS.  The diagnoses came after multiple tests and appointments requiring me to listen to the doctors and interpret the results of testing with them.
1	I delivered a sternum rub to an incapacitated passed out friend after they'd had far too much alcohol to consume in order to wake them up and make sure the were ok.
1	My husband has a very complicated medical situation that involves PTSD, TBI and other ailments from a car accident. I have had to help him interpret medical information, and doctors notes.
1	Two of my sons are on the autism spectrum. I have had to learn a lot through the years on how to raise them and help them the best way I can. I have a lot of family and friends who refer people they know to me when they first find out that their son or daughter is also diagnosed. It is one area I feel highly knowledgeable in without ever having gone to school for it. I once was at the pediatrician and the doctor asked if I would be okay going to the next room over to talk to a mom who had just found out about her son. They thought it might be helpful for me to come in as an experienced mom in this matter. I really enjoyed it and the mom seemed to leave feeling at least somewhat better about the future.
1	When I was hiking one time, I fell and injured my leg. I knew what I needed to do to be able to perform first aid and get myself back to my home.
1	I had a brain tumor.  I had to learn how to take my medication, about surgery, recovery, rehab, physical therapy, etc.
-1	I have been working in the medical field for over 12 years. Also,  I have taken college courses which describes medical issues in detail. The issues given were more the line of using your maths skills to complete.
-1	at times when my brother was small and had a fever I knew what to do for example to put fresh water on his forehead see if his throat hurts to check whether or not infection take the temperature.
-1	MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT EATING, STOMACH PAIN, AND NOT HERSELF.  I MADE HER GO TO THE DOCTOR AND SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AN ULCER.
1	I had the flu and was feeling very bad. .I went to the drug store and got the medicine and treated myself The flu cleared up 
1	I experienced symptoms of a sickness, fever for a few days, etc.  I remained sick for an extended period of time which caused me to think something was wrong.  I went to a doctor and it was determined that I had walking pneumonia.  I feel relieved to have gone early to prevent anything worse from happening.
1	Going through a complicated pregnancy, I had to do a lot of research as to what was causing my symptoms and if they were normal/treatable. I had to have a lot of conversations with my doctor to find the right balance.
1	When I went in after my first kidney stone attack, I was presented with a list of information about various liquids my body could take in. I thought coffee and soda were dangerous because of their high caffeine intake and they said in great amounts, that's true, but what is most important is water intake. So as long as I am balancing with enough water, it will cause me no problems.
-1	I recently have been doing research on the benefits of the ketogenic diet. I talked/discussed the diet with my Aunt, who was inquiring how I was doing, knowing that recently I had started this diet. I was able to tell her about how I needed to increase my water intake because my fat cells were no longer holding onto the water your body needs to thrive properly. I also told her the benefits of cutting out carbs decreased inflammation in your body, which is pertinent information because my family suffers from psoriasis, a immune disease that shows itself in the inflammation of spots on your skin. 
1	One event in my life where I was able to understand a medical condition and its warning signs is when I developed a pneumonia, and although my mother refused to take me to the doctors, I took a cab to my local urgent care and setup and appointment to help cure myself. Luckily my mother listened to the doctor there and I was prescribed antibiotics so I could get better. From then on Ive chosen to help myself when it comes to a serious condition
1	I have a friend who often comes to me stating that she is sick or unwell, but usually I ask her a series of questions starting with if she has had any water that day. Usually the answer is no, and she feels better after she drinks some water. My next question would be whether she has eaten, how she slept, and if she has allergies depending on the symptoms.
1	When my depression and anxiety were getting worse. I was knowledgeable about current medications and treatments (by personal research) and was able to use that information to better communicate with my doctor and set up a plan I was familiar and comfortable with. 
1	I generally have knowledge of the common cold, flu, stomach pain, etc., so I've been able to guide my healing habits as well as give advice to others.
-1	My eyes were feeling really dry, itchy and irritated.  Before I went to the eye doctor, I checked my symptoms online and thought I might have dry eye and blepharitis.  When I went to my eye appt., I was diagnosed with dry eye and blepharitis.  So I guess I am able to figure out what my symptoms mean and be right about it. 
-1	Last december, I was having some really bad pain in my bladder. It was difficult to urinate, and I constantly had a burning feeling. And an urge to constantly go to the bathroom, even though I didn't need to. I remembered these issues from a previous time that I had a UTI. I called in to my doctor and gave him my symptoms. They were able to review my chart and see that I had a UTI a year prior and instead of having to go in for another visit, they sent in an RX for the UTI. (although it is pretty easy to diagnose a UTI haha). 
1	When I was still in high school I originally thought I had a sore throat. After a few days of taking over the counter cough medicine I felt that it was something more than just a sore throat because it was getting harder to swallow. I went to the doctor to have it checked on and found out that the nodes in my neck were infected and filling with puss and if it had gone untreated they would have caused serious issues that could lead to death.
1	I have some previous experience working in a health-related field. I also have Bipolar Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, and generally have seen quite a few doctors many times.
1	I woke up one day to brush my teeth as my daily routine.  I noticed that my tongue had a white coating no matter how much I brushed.  Trying to scrape off my tongue led me to bleed a bit.  After some internet research, I was sure I had oral thrush.  When I went to my doctor, I specifically asked her if I had oral thrush and she informed me that I did.  I was quite pleased with myself that I knew exactly what I had.
-1	It just seems like a lot of magh I guess Iâm not sure But it just seems like you have to have a good melt knowledge of math and your fun
-1	when i had a enlarged cyst in my neck and i had to go to the hospital to have it drained and biopsied.
1	I have had high blood pressure for many years.  I can take my own blood pressure and understand where I am at regarding the blood pressure.  I know that as long as it stays high, I have a much higher chance of a heart attack or a stroke.
1	My husband had become very mean to me.   This is really unlike him.  So I brought him to the doctor, who said everything was fine.   His behavior continued, so I brought him to the ER and insisted he be checked over.  After blood and urine was drawn, come to find out he was septic. 
1	When I was in the hospital I was able to completely understand what was going on, what the readings on the machines meant, what the doctors and nurses were talking about and how the medications would help. 
1	I recently found out I have Type 2 Diabetes. With my medical knowledge and research ability I have been able to keep my blood sugar within normal limits without the use of medication.
-1	One of my coworkers had an important meeting later in the day and was anxious about it. Around lunch time she started to say her chest was tightening and that she was having a heart attack. She was shaking, sweating, and breathing quickly. I told her to focus on taking slower, deeper breaths and that it wasn't a heart attack it was a panic attack. After about a minute she was in a calmer state, her chest wasn't as tight, and she was breathing slower.
-1	I have had fertility issues because of increased NK cells, more than 5 years and visited 4 doctors, nobody of them told me how to reduce the level of the cells which block the possibility for implantation. Then I found a holistic doctor doctor who recommended change in the food diet and test for food intolerance, my ob-gyn doctor started laughing at this and said this is silly. But I did everything my holistic doctor told to me, I even started core gymnanstics and acupuncture and 7 months later I was pregnant with my first child, so I read tons of books, blogs, articled, I tried a lot of things and succeed.
1	 When my daughter was 9 months old she had a serious infection. I repeatedly brought her to the pediatrician and emergency room before it was finally diagnosed. Only after a doctor was convinced that her white blood count needed to be checked was the infection clear to the medical professionals. I needed to be insistent. I also needed to be able to accurately administer her pain meds and antibiotics once we were discharged from the hospital.. 
-1	This event happened in 2007 when I was officially diagnosed with PCOS. I knew I had it just by the systems I was experiencing. I conduct all of my research online and throughly read through any material and sources I could place my hands on. When I finally saw my provider she diagnosed me PCOS which I knew.
1	My close friend fell ill, and I was with him. I helped him navigate his serious illness by doing research while he was mostly incapacitated.
1	I had been told by an Orthopedic surgeon that I had three bulging discs.  I tried taking Cortisone injections in my back.  They did not work to relieve the pain.  The next form of action to take would be surgery.  I question other health officials about the results of these surgeries.  I was told that I most likely will have to go back in later and have additional surgeries. I had read about Chiropractors and what they were able to do for people with back pain.  My general practitioner is an O.D..  He said that I did my homework and should follow through with my decision to seek a Chiropractor.  I have been pain free since seeing one.  
1	During a pregnancy I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Due to my knowledge of food label reading and general healthy eating I was able to regulate my blood sugar with a healthy diet throughout my pregnancy.
-1	A time in my life that I knew more in terms of health or medical issues was when I was talking to a friend about anxiety and how they were having attacks and what they should do and avoid in terms of alcohol and food that would help decrease their chances of experiencing anxiety attacks. 
-1	I once went for a yearly physical and a couple of days later I was told one of my test came back abnormal and I was so scared. I waa scheduled for another check my another doctor and come to find out it was normal. I knew an abnormal test means something in my body was not working correctly and according to websites where I received a lot of medical knowledge on my scare issue 
1	Iâm not great at health things. I just have a liking for math and if a medical issue equates to a math problem, I can usually figure it out. Percentages and chances are math equations. 
1	I was found to have a curve in the spine so I had to go and get more test done and pictures were taken to determine the severity of the curve and whether or not I would need a brace or surgery. Recently, I found out that there is 50% chance that I have mutation in my genes that makes me more likely to get certain types of cancers
1	My mother went through a lot of health issues when I was younger. This led to doctors visits and specialist appointments for a lot of my life. She has still not been officially diagnosed with anything. This has helped me understand health and medical knowledge a bit better. 
-1	i normally research any potential side effect or condition on the internet to understand and ask the right questions before I go to the Doctor but I don't have a great deal of knowledge in one particular area. 
1	I worked with an elderly gentleman providing in home care. I noticed his labored breathing, blue lips and gray skin one morning and informed his daughter that he really needed to visit the emergency room. She disagreed. an hour later he had a heart attack and passed away in my arms. 
-1	I know my best because I read that carefully and I'm a person that like to have knowledge. I put all my effort in this survey to try to help myself learn more and to help you guys.
-1	If I understand the question correctly when I suffered the emergency.  I don't know if it qualifys knowledge of medical issues but I experienced like I said earlier chest pain and couldn't breath.  I ignored the symptoms because it was just a little chest pain at first but the following days breathing became difficult.  When I guess I reached my tolerance point I guess I dialed 911.  
1	"I don't think there is one great experience that demonstrated my personal knowledge of health issues.  I guess one experience would be that I regularly get a blood screening on an annual basis to stay in the know about anything that may be wrong health wise and it always comes back with flying colors - all blood screening ""things"" in the green."

1	Whenever I get truly sick for a prolonged period of time or feel it may be serious enough to see a professional I generally do my research first through google, webmd, and other resources so that I have a general idea of what it could be.

I learned a lot about the anatomy of my back, my lungs and what a radial pulse was.  I learned the treatment plans for my conditions and what could be done and what could not be done. Previously, I had no experience in these areas. I had to trust the doctors and what literature they provided to educate myself. It was a long recovery with still remaining issues that I continue to seek treatment and get educated about the body and recovery.
-1	My experiences have been to listen to my body, as I'm getting older I realize that if you pay attention to the seasonal, cyclical, and redundant reactions to changes, you will begin to learn your own body better than any other person; you can learn to trust it.
1	Most of my knowledge regarding health or medical issues is not from learning about them from doctors or reading about them on the internet, but rather it is from my previous experiences with them in my own life. When my friend was experiencing problems with frequent stomachaches and trips to the restroom, I told him that it sounded familiar to my own experience with the stomach flu.

I remembered how a paramedic once told me, in order to stop a nose bleed; you place a gauze under the inner lip and apply some pressure until the bleeding stops.

1	My wife felt lumps in her breast. From my medical knowledge I knew that the firm nodule tha was easily moved was likely a cyst. The other one had a chance to be malignant so she had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. I could see during the X-rays that the lump was not characteristic of a cancer. Then, during ultrasound I could see the round black hole on the screen indicating all lumps wee cysts. Was able to relieve both me and the wife while we waited for the radiologist to tell us the same thing.

I knew to not be very concerned when his fever stayed at 102, and he continually kept liquids down, but grew concerned when the fever reached 104. I called our doctor and he agreed with me on what we should do next to get the fever down. He wanted me to call back if it didn't work, but to try avoiding the eremgency room if possible with the flu outbreak locally. My minor knowledge with health and medical issues helped me be able to care for my son appropriately and help him stay as comfortable as possible at home.

They listened to my description of the problem (I did not change it to match the online symptoms because I didn't really have any pain) and they prescribed me fiber and told me that if it continued or became diahrrea-like to come back immediately.  I took the fiber and shortly after I no longer saw blood in my stool.
1	I really can't think of a situation. I depend on my doctor for info. If I don't know something I seek out resources to help me.
-1	After years of taking care of my grandmother's medications, when her doctor wanted to ignore her odd behavior, I made it clear in no uncertain terms that her medication could not be the cause of it, and if he started messing with it, her diabetes would become unstable. He didn't listen. Guess what happened to her diabetes? Yeah, listen to the person who has been doing it for years.

1	A few years back I had what I thought was a routine stomach ache from the flu.  After a few days the pain had not subsided and it didn't seem like the same old flu.  Given the location of the pain and my knowledge from popular culture I thought maybe it could be appendicitis.  I went in and I was correct.  It was removed immediately. 
1	Well about 10 years ago I experienced a staph infection on my leg that needed to be treated.  At the time I the cost to have it treated was well beyond my means as I was between jobs and my co-pay was infeasible. Luckly I knew to process of dealing with such an infection was to remove the core from the boil, disinfect the wound, place a drain, then cover it up and request some antibiotics.  I was able to lance the boil and do all the treatment work (I have a very high tolerance for pain) and requested my doctor prescribe some antibiotics.  When I arrived at the office he examined the treated wound and told me he was impressed I was able to do that myself and that it looked as good as the work he would have done.  He did suggest I let a professional do it next time as I could have hurt myself but still I managed to treat it myself.

From then on, both mom and me helped him to recover and do everything that the doctor told us to do to help my dad.
-1	When my husband was sick and had to be taken to hospital three different times it was helpful to understand some of the information more after each visit.
1	I hate math! Never was good at it. I demonstrated knowledge when my son was recently life flighted to UNC Chapel Hill for an emergency shunt surgery. He purged and a Resident wanted to do an MRI on him again. I tried to explain with projectile vomiting and laying a kid on his back he could aspirate. The young Resident exclaimed that to put the shunt in he had to guide it with CT. This was the first time I had heard of that. He got sassy with me. I told him the machine would need to be closed down if it got vomit all over it. Eventually I got the charge nurse and I told the young Doctor to be that he was off the case. The Head of his Department came to us and said we were right, my child could aspirate if left on his back in that MRI. (He cannot sit up alone as it is.) I have to advocate all the time or things can be dangerous.

I asked her questions about her job/family/identity, she answered easily. I watched her overnight, did some research, and found out it was transient global amnesia.
1	With my first pregnancy, I was induced for gestational hypertension. For my second pregnancy, I was able to discuss preventive treatment with my OBGYN and went on to have a normal low-risk pregnancy. 
-1	My son experienced aversions at a very young age to many fabrics, and other sensory experiences. After the years of doctor visits to neorologists for so many of my own neurological problems I was able to see correlating patterns between he and I. I was able to get him seen by a developmental pediatrician much sooner than I would have were I unexperienced in such matters. I consequently obtained a diagnosis that allowed me to request specialized services at school at the earliest possible grade. As well, I was able to help at least 2 friends see that their kids had some issues or symptoms that similarly called for a more proactive approach with their respective healthcare resources than if I hadn't pointed it out.

1	I was in a car accident which left my back hurting.  I have done one month of physical therapy and the doctor asked if I thought going back to it would help and if not what would I want to do next.  I said the physical therapy wasnt going to work the way I need it to and suggested the pain management next.
1	I don't think I have an experience that demonstrates my knowledge of health.  I did not take and classes related to medicine nor go to medical school.  I do not pretend to know about topics I don't know about.  When I have anything I see as a possible health issue I seek professional help.

-1	There's been times where I was at the hospital and I was already suspecting myself to have POTS.

Lo and behold, I was right and it was an incident where I knew more than the doctors.

Ignorance is not bliss, it is deadly.

Some of the things they had no clue you had to do. Like and SSG, having blood draws every other day, having to inject specific medications at a very specific time. I guess if they have never dealt with IVF, they may not know, since they aren't specialized in that area.
1	"I am actually in a more ""extreme"" situation than most people right now because I unfortunately had to become my husband's caregiver at a young age (28)... He shot himself in the head and is now quadriplegic. I have had to learn a great deal about how to care for a person in his condition, physical and occupational therapy, (mental health therapy for myself), medicines, diagnoses, possible future outcome, etc. all within the past year and in a very short amount of time.

There I found out that their is a portable x-ray machine nurses can take around, but they have to stand outside the room as they activate it to ovoid build-up of radiation in their body over time.

1	When I brought my child to the doctor and she was diagnosed with pneumonia and/or bronchial disease. I had little knowledge about the different and when she was explaining it I thought I knew what she was saying. But then I was trying to explain that to someone else and I felt lost. The doctor thought that she was explaining it well but maybe I was just not understanding.
1	I'm not exactly sure what experience to write about, but about 10 years ago, I stopped eating meat. I was quite concerned about getting enough protein, iron, and vitamin b12, so I planned my diet in a way that I would get the nutrients I need and remain healthy. I ate a diverse diet and made sure I had at least the recommended amount of each most days. When I had to get a blood test done 5 years later, everything was normal. I'd like to think that the care I took about planning my meals contributed to that. 
1	I am currently in a PhD program studying Transplantation Immunology at Emory University. If that alone doesn't demonstrate my knowledge of health and medical issues I'm not sure what does. I have also diagnosed a friend experiencing low blood sugar who ended up developing type II diabetes.

1	Taking care of spouses who had diabetes taught me a lot about the disease. I lived with one husband who had Type 1, juvenile diabetes.

Several years later, her son received and official Autism diagnosis and was able to receive beneficial services.
-1	I haven't had anything majorly life threatening happen to me so I don't have a lot of knowledge or experience about very many medical conditions.

1	I have a lot of friends that are pharmacists, doctors, or physician assistants. If I have any question that I can't find online I usually ask them.
1	My college roommate started feeling awful one evening. It came on very suddenly, and she began to feel pain in her lower abdomen and some serious nausea. I got our RA for the building to come look at her, and she called an ambulance because my roommate's condition was getting worse. I remembered those symptoms from my mother's kidney stone the previous year, and figured that might be what the issue was. We called my roommate's parents and they thought it might be appendicitis, but I was pretty sure about the kidney stone. My roommate rarely drank water but was otherwise healthy. I of course let the medical professionals do their work and didn't posit any theories, but I was right in the end.

1	When my grandmother was being examined by a neurologist he made her stand up and close her eyes and try to remain balanced. She could not keep her balance.

1	When I was younger, my mother was diagnosed with leukemia. During this time I had a lot of exposure to medical procedures and thus learned a lot.
1	I know how to take blood and also how to read the blood pressure monitor. I also took care of my mom one night when she was about to have a stroke I recognized it in the early stages when she started to slur and then she could not raise her hand so I  called for the ambulance immediately

I had to go to a Gastroenterology specialist because it was determined it might be a GERD issues that might be causing this my throat issue.  I had three procedures where my throat was opened up, but the Dr. could quite figure out what was going on as each endoscopy was returning nothing that could explain the obstruction. I started doing research on possible causes one possible cause took my attention. I knew because of other unrelated testing, that my iron was low, and in my research, a possible cause showed that low iron could be responsible for webs forming in the throat area. During my follow up meeting I asked the Dr. about this and after he ordered additional blood work, he confirmed that it was my iron-levels were the reason for the obstruction. He prescribed iron and I have not had to go back since.

1	When I was pregnant, I was constantly having gallbladder attacks. I had researched a lot over how to prevent them and talked to my doctor numerous times. I tried many tricks to get rid of them and prevent them, which all worked. I since have had it removed and have helped 2 family members receive their own diagnoses of gallstones after recognizing that their symptoms were exactly like mine.
-1	When I started having lumps under my skin, which I knew to be a complication due to the Alpha One Anti-tripsyn deficiency, and my doctors didn't know anything about it. It is a condition called Panniculititis and it is due to my lack of alpha one protein, and I had to educate my own doctor about this.
1	During my educational years, I was pretty proficient in science. One of my favorite subjects. And also, my teachers throughout high school would discuss health, health issues, and medical procedures. Then there are also medical shows on tv that also go into those things as well. 
1	Uh, I dunno. I don't get sick very often and when I do, it's just for a few days and it's never that severe. The worst time I can recall is when I got food poisoning a few months ago and that lasted one day (one horrible, puking day). I've never had an experience that I would say demonstrated high knowledge of medical science.
-1	When my mother had the flu I helped take care of her, making sure she took not too much Tylenol and gave her plenty of fluids, etc.
1	The only real main surgical procedure that I've ever had done was a repair of my rotator cuff.  The surgery also cleaned up some cartilage that was floating around and shave down some bone spurs.

Within 6 months I was 90% recovered and by 18 months I felt 100% again.
1	I think the most important way that I have displayed my knowledge is by taking care of family members who have become ill. It is very important to watch children closely when they have an illness because their life could be in danger. The scariest moment was when my son had a fever and I knew to bath him to help bring down his temperature.
1	I haven't been faced with situation where I had to exercise any medical knowledge, most of my experience has been with accompanying patients and being there for emotional support.
-1	an experience that demonstrated the knowledge of my health issues was me having an asthma attack. I knew the symptoms of asthma while knowing other friends who have it. However, when I felt the same symptoms I knew that I was having an asthma attack. this allowed me to get to the hospital quicker and not have to wait around the paramedics to come. It was very disturbing because I didn't know what my outcome was going to be. However, I was able to make it there on time and get sorted out while the doctors giving me prescription to help ease the pain.

1	A few years ago during a stressful time in my life, my weight rose to 180 pounds.  I decided that I needed to make some changes in my life.  I started with tracking my meals in a food log on my phone and taking a daily measurement of my weight.  After a few weeks, I was able to determine that I was consuming far too many calories and that most of those extra calories came from a few empty calorie sources.  Over the course of the next few months, I slowly adjusted my diet, cutting out many empty calories and trying to add more nutrient dense foods.  After I year, I had lost 30 pounds and have been able to maintain a weight of around 150 pounds for the last few months.

He started complaining about pin in his left arm and strong headaches. Part of his face was starting to paralyse. I knew it had something to do with his heart and him eing diabetic. Sure enough a few days later he had a heart attack. Luckily I was watching over him and I reacted quickly and got him to a hospital in time to control the situation.
1	When taking care of my children my wife and I try our best to research their health and provide the best care for them.  For smaller items and conditions we will research solutions and provide care ourselves.  If it is something more than we can handle we will take them to a medical professional for care.  A lot of the common colds and such are things that we can cure ourselves.
1	At my age I am regularly scanned for colon cancer. It is common. While many people avoid it, I understand that avoiding it can cause rectal or colon cancer.  If detected early it is treatable.  I go every 5 years. I took one at 50 and 55

The doctor usually suggests testing for very basic things, but I know that names of the tests and procedures that need to be done for other diseases that the doctor has overlooked.
-1	Once, I was prescribed an antibiotic.  I informed the doctor I was allergic to penicillin.  After reviewing the prescription, I got it filled.  The pharmacy I visit has my health information on file.  After turning it in, I was called to the front and informed the medicine was in the same family as penicillin.  I had no idea what that meant.  The pharmacist explained that I was probably allergic to it.  I was so mad! I had told the doctor what I was allergic to! If the pharmacist hadnât warned me, I could have been in big trouble. So mad!
1	I was a certified CNA for a few years. I have also worked in Home Health Care for several years. I took care of the elderly and several family members with health issues. 
-1	I did some medical research and realized that some symptoms I had might be similar to the symptoms for hypothyroidism. I talked to my doctor about it and we did a blood test. My blood test was negative for the disease, but it's still good that we tested for it.
1	I have a degree in a health-related field. I am generally knowledgeable about commonly used medications and can distinguish some conditions/symptoms. I understand that there's still uncertainties in the medical field.
1	"My grandmother was 87 yo and in need of a hip replacement.  Her maternal longivity history included an aunt who lived to 107 and her grandmother who lived to 100.  Her primary care doctor did not want to recommend a hip replacement surgery because of the HMO ""at risk"" plan she had.  I accompanied my grandmother to her physician, explained I understood his reasoning for not recommending the surgery and asking him to reconsider or I would take her case to the state board.  She received the surgery and turned 108 in December 2017.  The new hip has lasted 20 years."
1	I had done some reading about medical robotics before I actually saw any actual footage. So when I looked at the footage, I was able to identify what tools and what process was being done. It was fascinating to see what I had only beforehand read about in front of me.

-1	I think when you see problem you should go to hospital or doctor.The deep lesson is that civil servants always have to behave civilly at the office and in the community where the leader needs to be exemplary.
-1	A experience that demonstrated my knowledge of health was when I was in college, I was on the Track and field sprint team. Yes I was fast but, at times I would feel sluggish compared to my teammates. So I realized the reason was because I was not eating correctly, so I went to a nutritionist that taught me how to do so.
-1	I could write a novel here.  There is no one experience, rather a conglomeration of them, from dealing with ill large and small livestock and dogs in a farm setting where the vet leaves you with drugs and iv's to make judgement calls and administer yourself,  to having many of my own injuries to being a caregiver for both parents, to breaking my own neck.  I am, sadly, very wise to the obvious workings of the human body, from how it responds to colds to cancer and 3rd degree full thickness burns.  When I make a judgment call on a medical issue I am usually, but not always right, be it for myself, or another.
-1	a time is when my niece was choking and I asked my sister in law if they had a bulb to take the mucus out of my baby niece

1	The last time I had a respiratory infection, (5 years ago) I monitored my temperature closely, covered my mouth during coughs and sneezes, and followed my doctor's treatment plan.
-1	I had an ultrasound on my uterus. The results came back showing a mass. I had another ultrasound done. I went to the same doctor and then I went for a second opinion. The first doctor told me to wait for six months and we would do another ultrasound to compare. The second doctor talked to me about the image and the mass and suggested surgery. I went to the second doctor.
1	I don't consider myself to be especially knowledgeable in health or medical issues. I have general knowledge in the areas of nutrition from a class I took in college. I try to choose healthier options when I go grocery shopping because of that like ground turkey over ground beef. I know sitting for extended periods of time is bad for you, so I try to get up and walk around every hour or so (I work an office job). In terms of medical problems I have gone straight to the doctor for a mole that started to look abnormal because I know that can mean cancer. For the most part I just try to make sure I take all preventive measures and get all required tests for my gender and age group.
1	Almost every instance I can think of demonstrates my *lack* of knowledge, so this is a hard question. But I've kept my husband alive through 30 years of a still-undiagnosed progressive neuromuscular disorder (he was diagnosed at first with ALS, and it looks a lot like that). I've taken him to emergency for what's turned out to be pericarditis, and for TIAs. I talk to his doctors. He's still alive, so there's that.

1	I was talking to one of my friends and he was mad his insurance quit paying for his crestor and forced him to start taking another drug (I'm sure it was atorvastatin). He told me he needed to get a massage because he has a personal trainer and his muscles felt sore and weak. I asked him if that was normal or did it just start recently. I asked if it started around when his insurance stopped paying for crestor. He said now that you mention it, it did! I said it is probably your new cholesterol drug because statins have a tendency to cause muscle weakness or aching. So his doctor filled out a prior authorization detailing the effect of the drug they recommended and he went back to his crestor and the muscle issues went away. 
-1	"My father passed away last year after a unexpected medical issue. My husband and I being the only medically knowledgeable parts of the family were able to ask about his liver and kidney status and brain function. We also understood what the outcome was with him being placed on the ventilator and the ""reflexes"" he was exhibiting where as my other family members took it as signs that he would be better when he wasn't going to."

Come to find out that I had high cholesterol so my doctor told me what I needed to do or if I wanted to take some medications. That was the time I learned more about health and what precautions I needed to take. So I started to pay more attention to my health.
-1	Well as a friend jumped on a trampoline, they started to feel funny in their back. So they told me to take a look at it and her spine was curved so I told her what it was and that jumping wasn't the best for it.
1	Years ago my aunt was diagnosed with chronic leukemia.  She had a doctor at a different hospital who at one time he just didn't know what to do with her. Shortly after that I read an article about a new drug called Glevic to treat this and that people who were dying in hospices were getting uup and walking out.  I talked to the Head of oncology and he advised which oncologist she should see.   She lived 10 more years.
1	often times when I have a non-medical emergency I simply take care of the injury or illness myself. most of my knowledge has come from past experience and some actual education. this in turn gives me the ability to handle most small medical problems that I encounter throughout my life. Some of the more severe actions I have often look for assistance from another person close by. I often times diagnose myself or use the internet to try and find a common cure or how to treat an injury. I feel that my experience and knowledge is always growing, regardless of what I have known in the passed
-1	i explained to a friend that HVP can be contracted by simple skin to skin contact.  It was a quick expaination but a lot of people seem to think that you can only get it from sex.  However, that was not the case and I had to explain that to a friend who thought it was a myth.

1	An experience in my life where I had knowledge of a medical issue was when I was coaching a family member on how to eat healthier.  This family member is obese and at risk for diabetes, so it was time to make a change. We came up with a better meal plan; cutting out a lot of sugar and adding more protein, fruits, and vegetables.  We also came up with an exercise plan, where my family member joined a gym and went multiple times a week. He lost a lot of weight and felt a lot better overall. His blood test numbers improved at the doctor.
1	One time in life that demonstrated my knowledge about medical issues is when I made a home remedy to kill my cold. I use peroxide, lemon juice,  baking soda,  and some salt.

Algebra ahh Here's some random crap off the internet Medicine (British English Listeni/ËmÉdsáµ»n/; American English Listeni/ËmÉdáµ»sáµ»n/) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.[1][2] The word ""medicine"" is derived from Latin medicus, meaning ""a physician"".[3][4] Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.[5] Medicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is ""variable and inconsistent"" for any condition,[6] but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.[7] In contrast, treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery."

1	As stated in the letter of intent, the NHMFL offers the capability to measure actinide materials under unique conditions. Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile samples m.

-1	Relating effectively with patients is among the most valued skills of clinical care. As a beginning clinician, you will focus your energies on gathering information. At the same time, by using techniques that promote trust and convey respect, you will allow the patientâs story to unfold in its most full and detailed form. Establishing a supportive interaction helps the patient feel more at ease when sharing information and itself becomes the foundation for therapeutic clinicianâpatient relationships. 4 Because illness can make patients feel discouraged and isolated, âA feeling of connectedness with the doctor, of being deeply heard and understood, reduces this feeling of isolation and despair. This feeling is the very heart of healing
