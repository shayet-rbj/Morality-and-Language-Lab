1	When is was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had to make a decision on the best treatment plan for me.  I relied on my primary care physician to talk with me about all options.
-1	When visiting the doctor's office sometimes I fear that I will hear the words cancer or something like that.
-1	depends on why I'm there, last time was for my back sciatica and I was expecting a worse case thing because the pain was severe, but it turned out not to be a major issue and in a few months I was good again
-1	I do not typically get worried when going to the Dr. Unless it is going to be a painful procedure.
1	Being told that my condition may be worst than I thought it was. Discovering a new condition or being. Not having any options at all to fix my condition.
-1	I get anxious when I visit the doctor's office because of the fear of what could be wrong. I think that it is deep rooted from the loss of my first born child.
-1	Not knowing the answers are my worst fear. I feel like I want to know my results now even though sometimes that is impossible.
1	waiting in the waiting room and then when you are in the doctors office - waiting on test results - 
1	I sometimes feel like I am being judged by my doctor. Also, I am anxious that I will be misdiagnosed again. 
1	I have had medical issues in the past, I am scared they will return.I don't like going to he doctor for check ups, but do anyway. 
1	I am worried about finding bad news and I am worried that there will be judgement from the doctor. I also worry about not knowing everything I need to know. 
-1	it would be only when my doctor is not there and i would have to deal with another doctor that i don't really trust or know to much 
-1	Review of test results if any. Like if he ordered a blood test when I go back to get the results I'm usually axious even though I know I have a healthy body 
-1	So far the only thing that makes me anxious is when I have a physical and the doctor has to do a breast exam. I worry about breast cancer because of a history. I also am anxious of mammograms.
1	I have medical PTSD from a very bad experience with an ambulance and hospital. Anything medical worries me. The nurse, in particular, is rude and has no business being in health care. She has mocked my mental health and has gotten away with it. I am afraid of actually telling them how I feel because of this. 
-1	Not knowing what the test results might be, whether positive or negative. I feel better after knowing the results.
-1	I sometimes have fleeting feelings of uneasiness that my test results may find something negative about my health
1	One of the main reasons I don't have a primary care physician is because I never liked going to the doctor as a child. Having physicals scared me really bad and I'm probably traumatized. So I am in no hurry to go to the doctor for any reason. If I get sick I just wait it out. 
1	I might feel more anxious because the doctor could tell me something that I dont want to hear.  I have some minor medical conditions that could be getting worse.
-1	Blood work or additiol studies that might be needed and take a few hours for results. 
-1	Having a blood test coming in for results or having something wrong and worried about what it is wrong with you 
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried at all. For the most part I feel like doctors would just start prescribing pills that I don't need so I wouldn't take them.
1	I was always somewhat anxious about all of my prenatal visits. I had struggled with infertility and had experienced a miscarriage prior, so everything related to the pregnancy made me nervous. It wasn't specific to the doctor. 
1	That they will find something seriously wrong or that they will miss something important or not listen to what I have to say.
1	The doctors always like to blame the patent for  everything.  They dont understand  that we  have a  real life out side  our health. I  cant make  it  to  6 doctors  in a  week and  still work enough to be able to pay for gas  to get to them doctors appointments  
-1	It is an irrational emotion that sometimes comes up, but not always.  I like to have the experience behind me each year.  As I have aged, this has been the case, for when I was young, I seldom saw a physician, except once for a gall bladder attack due to which, the gall bladder was removed. That period was somewhat anxious until over.  But that was 25 years ago. 
1	Because anything could be wrong it could be a many things that he can tell me about my body or health
1	What might be found that I wasn't aware of or couldn't see.  No one wants bad news, especially at the doctors!
1	I am always anxious that I will receive a diagnosis for a terminal disease such as cancer or heart disease.  It makes me feel very nervous because that is one of my greatest nightmares.
-1	That I'll have a super long wait. I really don't get nervous about visiting the doctor. 
-1	the costs of the visit would be high or i would not be able to afford it. also that i could have bad luck
-1	I hate everything to do with getting any medical thing done.  It makes me feel sick just being there.  The worst by far is getting blood drawn.  I hate it so much and it makes me extremely anxious.
1	They have a definite lack of communications skills, and bedside manner, forget it. They either talk down to you or not much at all.
1	I have a family history of cancer so it's always a worry, not a huge one but still a worry that I may be come to find myself with it as well. 
1	Im always scared when going to the doctor because im scared there going to tell me some really bad news  what would change my life forever and i hate seeing my weight everytime 
-1	I tend to be a hypochondriac so when something is bothering me enough to go to the doctor I worry that he will find something wrong with me. My mind can make me fear going to the doctor stronger than it should be by a lot.
1	I often worry that results from an exam or test will point to a disease or condition such as cancer. When I wait to hear back via email from a doctor regarding test results, it is often a tense and worrisome time. 
1	The single thing that makes me feel the most anxious is the fear of being diagnosed with something that I had no idea I had. I am always scared that when Iâm doing a check up theyâll find something wrong with me, but I know it is better they find it sooner rather than later.
-1	That I might find out something new I have to deal with, when I really don't have the time or patience for more medical drama. 
-1	I don't usually feel worried or anxious when I go, I live a fairly healthy life and I feel healthy. On the rare occasions where I do feel anxious is when I hurt myself working out. I've sprained my ankle badly before and I felt anxiety cause I didn't know if I broke a bone or something more severe. So the anxiety stems from not knowing the severity of my injuries.
-1	I don't usually get anxious when I see my doctor.  I might get anxious if I see a new doctor b/c I don't know how he will treat me.
-1	Nothing has ever made me feel anxious or worried when meeting with my family doctor. He is always outgoing friendly and tells you the straight truth of what is going on.
-1	because i feel i cannot trust him based on previous experiences.....i get dismissed about my concerns.....i have tried other doctors, and they do the same thing
-1	I have had health concerns in the past and I worry about things that may come up again when I go to see the doctor.  Since I do not know what he is going to tell me, I naturally am anxious about what I am about to hear.  Those who say they are not anxious are either lying, or just ignorant about what can happen to peope as they get older.  I work in a profession that has a lot of people having health issues and these concerns travel with me when I go in to see the doctor as well.
1	I'm overweight, I don't like getting on the scales nor hearing about it. Otherwise not much else bothers me.
1	That their so needles and stuff that can hurt you and you an also receive some bad news that change your life forever
1	I do not have to visit the doctor often enough to have worry.
-1	Don't really like someone proding or poking me or asking personal questions. I also don't like the idea of something going on that I may not be aware of that could have major complications on my life and my family. 
-1	I don't too much get anxious or worried during a doctor visit. I am normally completely at ease. I trust my provider so I;m sure that helps ease any worry or anxiety
1	If I have a health problem I usually get anxious over whether the doctor will be able to help me or not. I get worried about what tests or procedures might be necessary and whether any serious diseases might be discovered.
1	Social interactions in general are a big thing for me. I am not very good at handling them without some form of anxiety cropping up. I also feel that going into the office is like going into the unkown where I might find anything to be wrong with me that could change my life.
-1	I'm often worried that my health may have deteriorated since my last visit. May blood pressure or weight may have gone up, or some other medical condition may have arisen.
1	That my lab numbers will be bad, that I will have gained instead of lost weight, that my PCP will find yet something else wrong with me. 
-1	Fear of the unknown. He might find something wrong that I don't want to know or hear about. I usually wait as long as possible before going to the doctor. We don't have a lot of money so I wait until the problems pile up and I have no other choice but to go. 
1	I have panic attacks,which I control with medication.  But, when I go to the doctor, I get very scared about them taking my blood pressure.  One time it was very high and they were concerned, but it was because I was having a panic attack in the office.  Now I always worry that my blood pressure will be high, and consquently my blood pressure is high!
1	My doctor often tells me to quite smoking, but have not quite yet. I get worried that he is going to get mad at me for still smoking.
-1	That i might not get what i want done. That iâll pay a lot of money for no benefits.  I do not have anxiety about visits.
1	 Well when I have a problem and I don't know what is wrong with me I am always worried because I don't know what is wrong with me. That is usually the only time I am worried because I trust my doctor to give me the answers to why I am feeling sick. 
-1	If I think something is actually wrong with me. I'll be a bit nervous until I get the results. Usually I try to keep calm.
1	With many problems due to a gastric bypass and anemia, I get worried when I have stomach issues or symptoms related to anemia so when I go to Dr. I think the worst in those cases.
1	Maybe I have gained weight, or my blood pressure or cholesterol is too high. Afraid there might me something wrong that I don't know about.  If I am having a worrisome symptom, I am afraid it might be something serious.
1	Whenever something doesn't feel right with my self I'm a little apprehensive. I fear that the doctor will give me disheartening news after an examination, but I go because the sooner it's diagnosed the better.
1	If I am going to the doctor for a health problem I can get a little anxious nervous and scared. I have a habit of always fearing the worst.
-1	My doctor often will ask me to attain certain goals or record health details,which I often forget to do or try my best to reach
1	What makes me feel worried or anxious is a feeling that my health is not good.  I am afraid that I will be diagnosed with something.
-1	It's the uncertainty of it all that's nerve-wracking. You second-guess yourself and maybe something is wrong and maybe you lose sight of the truth and start to fear random things.
1	Well personally I don't like to be touched and I don't like to be spoken to in a demeaning way. I'm very bright, I'm in a Ph.D. program for pete's sake so it makes me worried that physicians think I'm stupid but aren't even nice about it and don't try to explain in  a way that would make sense to me or don't even take the time. Also the being touched thing is obviously a huge source of anxiety as well which stems more from my personal history. Like I'm 22 and I still haven't had a pap smear because I just can't do it. And I had an older male doctor as a kid who didn't explain what he was doing and was examining me and it was just a weird and difficult experience and it's hard to advocate for yourself with a doctor when they always think they know best. Sorry this answer is so long I hope it kind of made sense! Also bruh I don't understand health insurance for the life of me so that makes me worried too. I hate spending money so having to pay $25 for a copay when I feel like the doctor didn't even do anything makes me cranky and anxious about my budgeting. 
-1	Nothing makes me too anxious. I think the only thing that does so, mildly, is when you're uncertain or waiting on results. The doctor couldn't do much to allay that.
1	The biggest fear when going to the doctor is that something seriously wrong might be discovered. In fact, I have health anxiety, and the fear that a small normal sensation is cancer or some other disease is quite scary. That is what makes me nervous about visiting the doctor. 
-1	Sometimes I may have to discuss something of a delicate nature and I don't know how my doctor is going to respond.
1	When I visit a doctor's office I feel most worried when his or her expression is worried and when he or she can't explain exactly what is going on.
1	im always afraid something else is going to go wrong, and i hate that im having a hard time losing weight even though my doctor warned me I have to.
-1	What makes mw feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office is finding out that there could be something seriously wrong with me and also having to get a shot or blood drawn.
1	When it's an issue that potentially requires more than a simple solution to it makes me feel concerned heavily thinking of what may be options or what could be the potential outcome of everything. There are times when I've become overly worrisome as to what could be happening to my health or whether or not these signs are going in line with what I may be thinking is the issue at hand. 
1	What makes me nervous about the doctor is the unknown, not knowing what to expect, I don't like bad news so I tend to get nervous...that white coat syndrome. My doctor is very thorough so that helps the anticipation a little bit.
1	I tend to expect the worst so I often feel anxious about what the actual diagnosis will be. 
-1	i hate a new doctors visit and the nurse practitioner i saw was a different one then the on i saw a few years back at the same facility 
1	The most worrying experience would be getting bad news or news about a problem that will be hard to fix. Also, getting news that will include discomfort or inconvenience.
1	I'm either anxious that my general health isn't good enough, or that a specific issue will be a major problem (e.g., routine mammogram gets malignant results).
-1	I can hear or look at a doctor and tell  if they are the one for me and some doctors want even touch are look at you when they don,t listen and just tell me what I need I get someone else.
-1	I feel like he might find something that I didn't spot. I get nervous thinking that there is something wrong with me, and I'll have to have surgery. 
1	I often worry that they will discover something is wrong with me.  I also worry about how much the doctor's visit will cost and whether or not I will be able to afford by bill when I check out.  In general, visiting the doctor gives me high anxiety.
1	awaiting tests results is stressful.  going to the doctor for sugary is worrisome.  i feel taking lab tests while seeing the doctor makes me anxious for the results. 
-1	I may have felt worried about receiving a bad report or weight gain. This are some determining factors in anxiety during visits. If the visit pertains to a problem I often worry the problem may be more complex and need referral to a specialist.
-1	
-1	I usually get anxious or worried knowing something may be wrong with my body. It could be something deadly or mild. Anything is possible.
1	I am anxious when my mother is there with me. She will ask questions and sometimes , when the physician asks me a question, she will pop in with her input before I speak.
-1	
-1	Nothing really makes me anxious. Unless I am doing blood work. I have a fear of needles and I hate the sight of blood. It terrifies me.
-1	I seldom feel it. Maybe because the doctor is gorgeous or maybe If I'm afraid to find out that something bad is happening to me which I'm very thankful that it hasn't happen to me yet.
-1	I don't like waiting in the waiting room. But I especially hate waiting in the examining room where it is so cold and there's nothing to do while you wait. Plus the visits are too short to delve into any problems you may have. The doctors are always in a big hurry to see as many patients as they can so you feel like you're not anything special. I wouldn't care if the doctor just pretended to be interested in my problems as long as he/she showed any interest at all.
-1	The primary medical condition I have has to be monitored so I try to do well in doing the right thing
1	At first I feel nervous, but fortunately I have to trust, because this should be, otherwise everything normal, and why not ?, we can only trust

-1	I am anxious because I do not like waiting to see the physician. Sometimes the wait is too long and it make me anxious. 
-1	
-1	The thought of finding out that something is worse than i thought. Especially during the cancer screening. I also worry when i am actually hurt because i know now that they are less likely to prescribe useful medication because of the opium epidemic. A cough that used to get prescribed cough medicine now gets crazy lung numbing pills that are newish to the market. not a fan. I worry about anything they may find, and how i will pay for all of it. 
1	I am worried that they will find something serious. Although I'd rather know than not know.
1	I feel anxious that they are going to find something and give me bad news. No one wants bad news in their life. I know I could make better judgement as far as health goes and I am always worried that what I am doing is not enough. Especially when I was pregnant I was always afraid something would go wrong. 
1	My feelings of this is that I have trouble coping with anxiety and not knowing how to solve certain probelms.
-1	Not knowing what results the doctor will find.
-1	The cost of the visit is most stressful.  When you don't have health insurance that can be a big issue.
-1	I never feel anxious when I visit the doctor. The few times in my life when I did it was only because I thought the illness I was experiencing might be indicative of something very serious. I was worried about the diagnosis but not the doctor.
-1	I do not feel worried or anxious when I see the doctor. My doctor's reports have been very good so there is no need for me to worry about anything.

-1	I don't normally feel worried or anxious when visiting my doctor, the only thing that concerns me is when I go in to get my blood work results!
-1	How long it takes. The test that I have to take.
1	I feel this way because I am sometimes worried about tests results. Also, if I may have to take more or different medicine.
1	doctors always find something wrong with you when you go in even for a regular checkup so all hat is wondering what they will find this time and how ad it is going to be
-1	If I go see a doctor then I have a medical concern. My anxiety is hoping that whatever I am going to be seen about is minor or will have a positive outcome 
1	 Not thorough. Others were invited in the room and I weren't asked if they were permitted. Ill advised
-1	I may get worried or anxious if i have an appointment and have a long wait period. I dont mind waiting a few minutes to have time to relax but after about fifteen minutes i get restless. 
1	I feel anxious because I don't know what they are going to say. If I have something wrong with me or not. I'm worried that the problem is to big and I have to go in to surgery 
1	I just feel like it's a waste of medical insurance dollars -- you don't get well and the sick get sicker
-1	Finding out what is wrong with me gets me worried. I think I donât want to know whatâs wrong or it worries me a little bit 
-1	I'm worried to get bad news and I don't particulary enjoy needles. I try to, however, be mature and remain realistic. Whether we're perfectly healthy or struggling with a medical condition, we just have to do our best to achieve the best quality of life and health as possible.  
1	If something's wrong with me that I can't afford, things could get bad pretty quickly. Plus, I just want to know what it is. It's nerve-wracking.
-1	The thing I find most worrisome is a doctor not being able to recognize the symptoms of what I may be going through
-1	I am always worried that I may get bad news in any dr office. I am nervous I may get bad news and I may get. 
1	Honestly I don't know. I have always felt this way and my blood pressure always rises to the point that I have to warn my nurse
1	The feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is often because of the very long waiting time to be seen. 
-1	I tend to google things a lot (big no-no) whenever I feel exceptionally bad, or have something weird going on physically, so that tends to create a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor. I assume the worst. 
-1	nothing makes me anxious or worried when I go to the drs. itry and take care of myself so I don't have any major issues
-1	He Us A Trump Suporter And I Am NOT...This Is Very Irritating To Me. because I Never Thought Of My Doctor Being An Idiot Like The Trump...
1	I don't want the doctor to randomly tell me I've been doing something wrong, or that I have 2 months to live, or some type of cancer. All of those ideas freak me out. I don't want there to be something wrong with me. 
-1	Concern about what they may find and what they may have to say about my weight! :-) Other than that, I find it an enjoyable experience. 
1	Because I know I am going to be slammed through as quick as possible. I feel like I am on a production line. I see more of the support staff than the doctor.
-1	I am worried that I am just another customer and that I am the only one who truly cares. I wish medicine was a much smaller thing and that doctors practiced more independently. 
-1	I would be most anxious about something being wrong with me in general. My family has many hereditary health and autoimmune problems and I have a few myself. Several members of my family have also had cancer while young and I have shown some signs of potentially developing two types of cancer in the past. I am moderately concerned and worried about the possibility of developing cancer while relatively young like several relatives. I am anxious in general about talking about myself and having myself touched by another person. I have general anxiety and just don't really like talking to people much, especially about myself.
-1	I don't tend to be anxious.  The only time I can remember feeling Any anxiety was the period of time I waited for the results of the biopsy taken of the 2' of intestine that were removed after an abnormal colonoscopy last year.
1	The general environment of the laboratory makes me feel like a test subject. I also tend to worry about the diagnosis, or that I'm not really sick and wasting everybody's time.
1	I fill anxious or worried when I have to wait for so long. scared that there might be bad news. that there's a problem that cant be fixed. something Medicaid or home remises cant fix. something ill be embarrassed to have.
1	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office. I find it easier to remain calm and trust in the care of doctor.
1	I don't know the person and I feel vulnerable. I don't like talking to stranger or having strangers touch me.
-1	Not knowing what the outcome of the examination. Always hoping for good results but in the back of my mind the doctor could give me bad news.
-1	The only thing that makes me anxious or worried is that my concerns will be ignored. Which they usually are.
1	I'm not sure I can change what will happen. I really don't need to know the answer to many questions I can't afford to treat in the way I would need to do. most problems go away if you can not worry about them long enough.
-1	I am the type of person that always goes to worst case scenario so I am always nervous that my doctor will find something horribly wrong with me. 
1	Finding out about something that may be a short term or long term sickness.  Having to change my lifestyle for a long term or permanent time.
-1	Everything I just don't like going to the doctor for anything I feel like if I can take care of it at home I do before  I go to the doctor 
1	I seem to get very anxious when seeing my doctor because I always forget what I need to tell them. I am usually worried about what I may find out at that visit. I sometimes feel worried that the doctor may think I am a little crazy because I do not know how to explain a certain symptom. I am sure they know most of the time what the patient is talking about as they have normally seen that problem before. But with myself I am not good at explain a certain pain or feeling. But as far as actually walking in the office and talking with the staff I always feel comfortable. 
-1	I am more worried about getting the news than I am after I have received the news and know how to take care of the situation.
1	Usually it's things like how bad my cholesterol is, maybe anxious on things that might be suggested by my doctor...and definitely not looking forward to full (yearly) or prostate examition.
-1	If test results something might be wrong or if persistent pain cannot be attached to a reason. Usually have little or no worry when visiting doctor.
1	Most of the time I feel dread and anxious because I'm scared of what they will find out and the cost of the visits and treatments. I'm also scared of their opinions of me in regards to taking care of myself the proper way.
1	When I don't feel like I'm getting the best attention from the doctor and the staff association to answer questions I may have during my visit 
1	i am always worried my blood pressure number may be bad, or he tells me i would have to go on another medication
1	I get anxious about possibly hearing bad news about my health. I also get embarrassed about getting undressed. The results of my lab work makes me apprenhensive.
-1	I am very afraid  of certain diseases like cancer since I have a family history of cancer in my family. I sometimes smoke and drink and that is a concern as well.
-1	I am in good health so I really do not have any concerns when I visit.  The only thing that makes me anxious is when I have to wait for a long time to get called to the back.
1	I worry about getting weighed and having my blood pressure taken.  I also worry of course about them finding something bad
1	I am self conscious about my body, so I don't particularly like having to undress or show certain parts of my body. I don't like to be touched and I am also sometimes concerned with what my diagnoses could be or other things unrelated to the reason I am there that the doctor might find. 
1	I just generally don't like interacting with people on a very personal level.  I don't like to be touched, I like to be private.  Getting undressed in front of a stranger in a strange place and having them poke and prod and examine me asking personal questions is semi traumatic.  
-1	Even though I'm very healthy overall and generally feel pretty good, there's always that gging idea in the background that they may discover something seriously wrong that isn't currently presenting any symptoms. It's also just an anxious situation in general when another person you don't know well - or know at all - is examining your body and mind and peering into some persol and private things, even if you trust them to be objective and professiol about it.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor it's a part of life and I'm use to it know it is what it is
-1	Not knowing what's going on. Waiting for results. Receiving bad results would have anyone worried, so many thoughts rushing through your head, ex&gt; is it doing to kill me? Is in incurable? How would these issue effect my life?
-1	Mostly the attitude of the doctors and their staff.  It makes me a bit worried if the staff is not professiol in handling the appointments and/or paperwork.  
-1	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor because im worried about the results and the diagnosis
1	Anything medical sets off my anxiety. I'm always afraid they are going to find something so terrible that it can't be dealt with. Frankly, I rather not know and be happy if that is the case. 
-1	bad news from a doctor makes me feel worried.it makes me feel un couraged about myself.and also to know that im doing the rite thing for myself.
-1	I mostly just get worried that I will have some unforeseen symptom that they notice that could mean something bad. I also get worried I will need a shot that day.
-1	I only feel anxious when I know there's something wrong with me already. I worry that the treatment might be expensive or not effective.
-1	I don't like sitting around in the waiting room not know the people there nor knowing what is going to happen in the doctors office. Uncertainty is not my strong point. I like to know what is going to happen. I understand that can't always be the case but I like to eliminate variables. 
1	That something is wrong with me because I may have neglected my health over the years or may have terminal illness. Or maybe the bill for the doctor is too high.
-1	I do not feel anxious or nervous and I have not been to a doctors office for years so I really cant relate
-1	I'm frequently worried that I won't be able to correctly explain my problem, or mess it up so that he won't fully believe me. It's also worrisome that doctors frequently prescribe things that you know isn't what you need.
1	I just don't want any bad or discouraging news when visiting the doctors office. It's not a pleasant feeling at all.
1	what makes you feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is when i have to go in there at all because i dont like doctors offices and they are terrible and stuff like that
1	Finding out I have a condition I'm not aware of or having to go thru a test I haven't seen or heard of before.
1	What they may find or tell me what is wrong.
-1	
1	As I get older, my reactions to minor injuries become more acute and I never know if a new skin or muscle change is harmful or just a sign of aging. Fortunately my Dr is very understanding and explains what is/has happening so I am aware of my current situation.
-1	
1	A male OB/GYN threatened to impregnate me during an examination. He said he was joking, but I didn't go back to an OB/GYN for years after that because I would start to feel anxious while trying to make an appointment
-1	"While I have never really experiences the sensation of anxiety or worry when visiting a doctor or health care provider, I can definitely imagine why many people are apprehensive.  Many people are worried that the treatment may hurt or feel uncomfortable during the exam.  People may also be scared to hear the truth regarding their condition and be in a state of ""ignorance is bliss"".  These factors cause people to not only worry and become anxious, but to also not follow up or seek treatment for their condition or ailments."
1	When visiting a doctor's office I feel worried because of the results, anything can be found that I don't know of has silent effects.
-1	I do not feel  worried or anxious I feel like I in a place I belong and know I will get the best care I can get 
-1	I feel most anxious before the uncertainty of answers. I understand trained medical professiols are not supposed to let on emotiolly about the prognosis/diagnosis of a patient. Still, I rely on the small nuances in their expression or tone, body language, etc. to gauge the real severity of the situation.

1	I feel like they will diagnose me with the wrong thing or make a mistake that might make matters worse.
1	I just get myself worked up for no good reason. I hate going there, even though I have never had a horrible experience. I guess I don't like other people poking, prodding, and seeing me ked. I am the same way about going to the dentist or giving blood.

-1	"I RARELY go the doctors since I really don't value their opinions and feel they just order tests for the money and not necessarily ones that are truly needed.  I haven't had an annual physical since 2011 and have only had a bad cold once since then.  I don't worry about things I can't control or the ""what if"" situations of cancer, etc.....refuse to waste my life with this type of thinking."

1	I hate shots, giving blood, etc., and will do anything I can to avoid them.  I wish there was a way for the doctor to put me more at ease.

1	They will not believe my condition is real, ghey will think it is all in my mind, made up. They will only humor me.
-1	the most obvious is if the doctor gives you bad news, regarding life threatening cancerous tumors.  followed by high bills or copays that you probably cant afford for the rest of your life, which is worse than college tuition

1	I lost trust , because i want doctors to tell the truth if they are not aware of some type of medical problem before, rather than using someone as a guinea pig for their experiment.

1	I feel anxious that the doctor will come across something that is life threatening. I feel sometimes that I answer a question that they disagree with such as how much I smoke a cigar or how little exercise I get. I feel as though he judges instead of understanding.

1	I might be afraid that something is wrong with me that will effect the people in my family as well as myself. 
-1	The thought of something being wrong with me is of course my worry. I think everyone has that same feeling. 
1	I get anxious and worried because I feel like something is going to pop up in my health records that is just going to throw my life for a loop. It seems like having a doctor officially diagnose something makes it just that much more real and scary.
1	I don't like being examined and you never know what may come up.  There's always a worry that a doctor will find something wrong.  
-1	Needles primarily, but once it happens it isn't htat bad. It's the anticipation that bothers me.
-1	Nothing, I know that I am in good hands with my present doctor. Previous to him I would be anxious and scared because I knew that I was wasting my Co pay on not being treated for my issues. I o lying go to the doctors office maybe once or twice a year, when something is severe, so I am in no way shape or form a hypochondriac. 
1	What makes me anxious and worried is what he is going to  tell me about me and how willi react to  what he is saying to me
1	Pain.  But also, I know that I need to lose a few pounds.  I exercise regularly and am not dropping any weight.  I know I'm going to be scolded for it.
-1	I don't know what my test results will be when I get a check up at the doctor's office. I feel uneasy about this.
1	I am worried that my doctor may tell me something is wrong.  I am anxious that my blood work would reflect that I contracted a condition.
1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when I go to the doctor is knowing that I will probably leave with some sort of mind altering medication. I have bipolar 1. That can not be treated with therapy alone. I hate my medications and the side effects of them. I almost died because of the medications that I was given about a year or so ago. I am now horrified to try anything new when it come to medication. Though it does stop certain moods, it turns me into a vegetable that can barley function. 
-1	since I am getting older, I worry that something else will be wrong with my health. Problems that arise with age.
1	Typically I feel that way when Iâm having a basic procedure done and routine exam. Not sure why because itâs not the Dr. 
-1	If I have to have any tests taken I feel anxious and waiting for the results I feel worried. Overall I feel this way every time I have tests taken
-1	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is that something could possibly be wrong.

-1	Trying to keep myself healthy and I don't like when I have a blood test and it isn't good news. I don't like going on the scale. 
-1	IS THERE NEW HAPPENING WITH ME!! I DO NOT THINK OR BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING GOING WITH MY BODY ALL THE TIME!!
-1	That I will be judged for my weight issues or there will be other issues. Other than that I like my doctor a lot and look forward to his knowledge
-1	You always hear horror stories about doctors finding serious issues during routine checks. Although the odds are minuscule the thoughts still cross my mind 
1	When I have a medical problem that I cannot identify the cause, or a recurrence of a problem that I know portends a negative prognosis, I become anxious.
-1	What makes me the most worried when visiting the doctors office is finding out if I have a heath related problem that is not good for me. 
1	Having my doctor shoot down the possibility that something may be wrong with me.  I worry that because of her, I won't find out about a medical condition until it is to late.
1	I worry about judgement of my ability to express my concern adequately. I have encountered many impatient doctors. I often remember questions that I wanted to ask after I leave the appointment.
1	The reason is because I am worried when visiting the doctors office is I am wondering if they are going to take care of my complain right away and just want to go
1	Thinking that the doctor's going to do things that make my life difficult, and he'll bully me if I try to stick up for myself. I've had doctors tease me, tell me that I should purchase life insurance (I was in college at the time and NOT a fan of risky behavior), the works. 
1	They will either find something drastic (cancer, autoimmune disease) or they'll write off a serious concern as just being my anxiety
1	I have social anxiety. Going to see a doctor is like being asked to perform on broadway completely ked without ever having been given a script. You don't know what to expect. You feel like the doctor might be secretly judging you, and when it's all done you might find out that you are gon be dead in a month.
-1	The unknown and thinking that maybe there will be some health related issue I do not know about in my life.
-1	if my health is at its normal standards. whether had weight gain, labs normal, if there is any need for new medications or not.
-1	I don't get too anxious at the doctors office unless I feel very sick. In that case I'm usually already worried about my health. 
1	If i am going in for a new test maybe or getting the test results from my blood work.I may worry that something new may come up.
1	You're afraid of finding out answers in case they might be bad. You're afraid of the cost. You're afraid of being embarrassed. You're afraid of being vulnerable. You're not sure what's going to happen, and there's a possibility of bad news, so you immediately only focus on the negative.
-1	what the outcome may be what might be found after the visit. hoping there's no issue that will involve surgery or going to another doctor to get checked out
-1	The potential for a negative visit usually is what bothers me the most. If I've never been to a particular doctor's office, their demeanor mostly gives me cause for worry.
-1	i feel anxious when im sick and something is wrong i get upset because of the waiting on the test result to come
1	I consider myself a hypochondriac so when I got to the doctor I sit there imagining all the things that could be wrong with me.
-1	That I will be misdiagnosed, prescribed medications that will be ineffective or counterproductive for some reason, or just that I've wasted my co-pay for something I didn't really need.
1	I feel anxious or worried he is going to diagnose me with some untreatable illness that I will have for my entire lifetime. He also always tells me to quit smoking which sucks but is also necessary for my health.
-1	Just that something might be wrong but only slightly have the feeling
-1	Finding something that I will need more treatment for or a referral to someone else. I also get a physical every year, so sometimes I can worry that my numbers aren't where they're suppose to be.
1	I feel most nervous that they are going to tell me about something that will kill me that I was uware of. 
1	That the doctor will find something wrong with my health.
-1	I do not often feel worried about visiting the physician. Sometimes, however, I would worry about a potentially serious diagnosis. I do not think this is uncommon, however, and it arises from a childhood fear I had of being diagnosed with a terminal disease like my uncle (cancer).
1	I feel fearful and anxious when I go to doctors office over the test results I have to wait for after a two week period. I sometimes think the worst.
-1	No one wants to get on the scale.  Unless they've been losing weight, everyone thinks they weigh too much.  Especially me!
1	I am always afraid that something is going to be wrong with me because of my history with doctors and things that have gone wrong in the past.
1	I would just get a little worried about what the doctor diagnostic would be, hoping that what might be wrong would not be major or life changing.
-1	I just get nervous of hospital and Dr. settings and general I get pretty anxious sometimes I just donât want to go for fear of the unknown so that usually makes me nervous but other than that I have complete confidence
1	only when my doctors feel that they tell me I might have a heart condition or something to that nature 
1	Basically, I have a constant fear that Iâm dying. Cancer, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, brain tumors,
-1	They are almost always running late. There's just something about a doctor's presence that creates anxiety.
-1	I think I feel apprehensive whenever I have to reschedule an appointment or have to wait far longer than anticipated prior to seeing the doctor or when having to wait while s/he checks on a particular result.
-1	I don't feel that way at all I also think you are asking some very stoop thing to ask me and I will be glad when I finish this survey.
-1	If my condition or the doctor find something that turns out to be worst than it really is. Or the doctor find something that's too late to be treated.
-1	I have some health issues so each time I go to the doctor I worry what could be wrong this time or what tests are necessary AND how much it will cost me.
-1	I guess the one thing that most patients feel, including myself, is concern about the unknown. I think it is just human nature and conditioning that make me a little anxious. I have noticed that there have been times when my blood pressure would be slightly elevated upon my arrival at my physician's office, but my blood pressure returns to normal before I leave his office. 
-1	I don't feel dread with most doctors. I dread getting any sort of OB-GYN exam for obvious reasons.  (It's weird, intrusive, and unpleasant.)  With new doctors, I worry about being dismissed as not knowing my own body or not being taken seriously.  
-1	I am worries about hearing something that may be detrimental to my health. Health issues run in my family and though I believe I've taken necessary steps to prevent certain illnesses, hereditary is still very vital.
1	I know going in I may have to bring research and my power of persuasion to get diagnosed correctly and get the right medications. It was bad when I had insurance and had to do this. It's many times worse now that I go to a clinic for the poor and see nurses instead of doctors.
1	I am most anxious about the cause of the problems I'm having as well as whether or not I'm wasting money with a particular doctor who won't address the problems until other costly procedures have been completed. 
1	Well you never know what's expected and on top of it what will take place going to see what the doctor has to offer either by advice or a medication that will help you get through any anxiety.
1	I'm worried, I won't get a solution to fix my health problems. I worry that they will judge me based on my condition.
1	I am worried because I'm overweight and self conscious. I'm worried they will give me a hard time about my size. I'm worried they will find something wrong with me. 
1	I feel anxious or worried when I have to remove my clothes. Also, when I am concerned that my problem may be serious.
1	When you have a lot going on and don't know what to conten to first to move to the next it gets kinda annoying and hard to do 
1	Again as I explained...my doctor and I do not have the relationship we had for many years and I am in the process of switching doctors.  I have two appointments to meet new physicians
-1	sometimes some doctors dont realize that it hurts to go through some examinations and they are rough with tender parts of the body
-1	I am always wondering if she is going to find something wrong that I had no idea existed and I always worry that my high blood pressure is not going to be as low as it normally is at home.
-1	I do not go to doctors enough so a little anxious that might be told I have a medical condition, also as a male it also means they are going to inspect my junk so always a little nervous about doctors looking at my balls
-1	I am most anxious about screenings for diseases such as cancer and heart because there's always an element of doubt on how the results will be and if I would require further tests. 
1	Getting a bad report.  I don't want to hear that I am not as healthy as I hoped to be. I feel there is more I could do to be healthier. 
1	I just hate the whole experience. I think it's the attitude of the doctors. They seem like they are better than you. I get super nervous.
-1	Most of the time myself and many people visit doctor's offices is because there is something wrong, so being examined for the problem you've been having can make you slightly anxious or worried of the outcome of the examination. While it's great to potentially get answers for medical problems, you can get informed that what you're experiencing is worse than you expected. I believe that is typically in the back of the minds of most people in a doctor's care.
1	Fearing of hearing something like cancer or bad news.wish they would find a better way to withdraw blood I have a big fear of needles
-1	I sometimes am worried about the outcome or what I may find out. Don't want there to be something wron with me. that is waht I get most worried about.
1	Worried that I will have to start taking a new medication or that test results come back and cause him concern. Also, worry about wait time and getting sick from other patients in waiting area.
-1	I have Congestive Heart Failure and A-fib and am always a little anxious and worried at check-ups because I never know if my condition has worsened
1	I'm scared of needles and my mom will force the doctor to do optional procedures using needles even though I say no and I'm over 18.
1	I had a bad experience with my doctor when my daughter was born and from then on going back makes me nervous that something else will happen. 
1	I typically won't go to a doctor's office unless I am completely sure something is wrong. By the time I am there, I know I have a problem and I tend to worry about how bad it is at that stage. I do not like people touching me as well, so being examined always pushes my personal space limits. 
1	I am not sure. I guess it would be if it is just a check up or for a specific reason. If it is for a specific reason then I am always worried about what they may find or tell me.
1	Because they hold the key to knowledge i am unaware of so giving up control to random people is fearful and naked. Putting trust in a stranger for my well being is also not as controlling as I typically like and i know i am my own best fighter. The sickness that i am walking into at a doctors office is also seems like i will walk out worse than i walk in it seems counterintuitive to what im looking for.
1	I am worried I will get bad news even if I have been practicing healthy ways. I am worried of a sickness I might get despite healthy eating.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious in the unknown.  You don't know what they will find if there is a problem.
-1	I'm just worried about my health too and I hope to live longer and someday have nice friends and a nice family
-1	What would make me feel anxious or worried is the unknown. Primarily aside from yearly check ups the reason for going to the doctor would because there is somethingwrong with my body. So the not know what is going on would make feel uneasy.
-1	Because I'm over weight so my weight males me feel uncertain or uneasy....................I don't know what els dto aay
-1	I don't feel anxious at either scheduling or attending a visit to the doctor's office.  I am pragmatic and choose to deal with health issues as soon as they become apparent and insist that I get all the available options as well as the recommended course of treatment.
-1	I am currently diagnosed with a chronic condition.  The thing that makes me the most anxious or worried is finding out that my health has gotten worse rather than stayed stable.
1	I feel most anxious or worried visiting the doctor's office when I feel like something can go wrong or I may hear something from my doctor that I don't want to hear.
1	I am most worried about finding out bad news about my health when visiting the doctor. More than that I worry about any treatment I may need. I worry about any physical pain I might have to endure and how I will pay for it. Since I can't afford it and my insurance isn't adequate, I worry because I know I probably won't receive proper treatment. 
1	I'm always anxious that I will get some bad news about my health, especially if its something I don't see coming. I enjoy being active and feeling healthy. I wouldn't want anything to jeopardize that or to have a long/lasting effect on my family. I don't want to be a burden to anyone. However, I also would want to catch any problems as soon as possible to hopefully battle whatever it is that I have going on.
-1	Just going and not knowing what they might find and hoping its nothing really bad or even untreatable
1	I have severe anxiety to begin with so I don't need a reason to be anxious as I'm always anxious - usually without reason.
-1	I can sometime imagine that he will find something terribly wrong with me, even though I am not feeling bad.
-1	I think that what makes me feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the uncertainty and probability of receiving bad news.
1	because i think people in general are somewhat fearful of the unknown, i would be afraid that maybe my doctor will tell me something negative in regards to my health
1	I feel that the doctor might find something that is bad like a health condition or a disease that I have recently developed.
1	I get anxious when I have to go in to the doctor to get my blood pressure checked.  I also get worried if my labs are off..
-1	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor if I am required to complete a rectal exam since it is not the most pleasant experience I have ever had.
1	I'm not a big fan of being touched by people I don't know, even if it's by a medical professional looking for 'lumps' or what have you. I guess that makes me feel uneasy, but I also worry that one day I'll receive a negative medical diagnosis. 
1	Most of they time I'm pretty okay once I get to the doctor's office, clinic, etc...being in the waiting area, or out in an exam room, for too long may bring about a bit of anxious feelings or even aggravation.
-1	The uncertainty is what makes me the most worried.  I am actually eager to get back the results as soon as possible so I could see what the issue is but waiting for it is what worries me the most.
1	I guess I worry first because it's full of sick people and the energy is negative. Anxiety about the future is also a general condition existent in all and a doctor's office is a good symbol for that. No one knows what the shadow knows.
1	I'm anxious about the results and the fear of what's wrong with me. Usually I'm afraid to get naked in front of my doctor... Even though my doctor is a woman. I still get uncomfortable.
-1	I am not usually worried when visiting the doctor's office, but I do get anxious waiting for test results. I hate the anticipation of having to wonder how my blood work is going to turn out, and if I have anything I need to be concerned with. My family has a large history of cancer, so I constantly worry about developing it. 
-1	I'm always just a little worried something really bad will come up in the visit. I try to be completely honest about my physical condition, but I fear the doctor might discover something really serious about my health. I'm in a career field where my physical health (and lack of prescription medications) is extremely important, so I wouldn't want anything to come up that would affect my work.
-1	I am most anxious and worried when I go to the doctor's office about whether or not she will find something wrong with me.
-1	Being touched by strangers. I'm not a very touchy felt type of person to begin with so this makes me uncomfortable.
-1	Being touched makes me highly uncomfortable and I would rather you not do that, please and thank you.
1	The only time i have these problems is when i do'nt know what going to happen, or not sure of the outcome.
1	Often times it's the possibility of having to argue with them about what would be a better treatment for ME. There are certain meds that just aren't necessary, and I hate that I have to go in with the mindset of having to be my own advocate and ready for mild confrontation. A doctor should have my best interest in mind and not just what is easy or done out of habit for them. I also worry I won't be listened to when I try to do my due diligence to list ALL symptoms pertaining to whatever is ailing me. 
1	i'm always anxious about results and i hate having to wait. the wait always makes me worry more and i'm the type of person that usually thinks the worst when something comes up
-1	The worst issue when visiting a doctor's office the the unknown factors.  The problem may be something simple or complex, the solution may be expensive and troublesome or it may be inexpensive and simple and the overall experience may feel good or bad, but the unknown factors involved make the experience worse.
1	i hate to go to clinic  the atmosphere makes me sick more
-1	
1	A diagnosis that i was not expecting or finding out that ive put off treatment for so long and it's worse that I thought
1	What makes me feel anxious about the doctors office is finding out information that I didn't want to hear or finding out bad news.
1	I have health conditions which could lead to serious problems. Especially when my doctor is looking for signs of cancer, I'm anxious. I know that it could be bad news for me.
1	mainly just being at the office knowing that i may have to get blood drawn or something, or if i have to get a pap test that makes me very anxious b/c it is painful
-1	I don't know exactly why I just get a little nervous when I go to the doctor or the dentist.  I am nervous and then I am relieved when I find out I am okay.  even if there's an issue, I am still relieved.  I think that just not knowing, and uncertainty about one's health is nerve-wracking.
1	Just about the procedure and if it will hurt or not. That causes a little anxiety. It has nothing to do with the doctor
-1	Because sometimes their scales or blood pressure cuffs doesn't read the same as mine does at home.  theyre always making me service because that's just how I am feeling when I go to my appointments.
-1	Just the not knowing of what you are experiencing if it's something that is going to be life changing once it has been diagnosed.
1	I am always afraid he will find more problems or that the current ones will have gotten worse. I don't like having to sit waiting to be seen
1	What makes me feel anxious about the doctor's office is whether I'm doing well or not. If I'm not doing well, they could prescribe me something that affects my body in a negative way.
1	Well I consider myself rather poor so I always worry about my doctor finding some kind of condition I have , that would be very costly to cure. So basically I am afraid of the money I will have to spend. 
-1	If I think iam having a baby, or if iam being checked for a STD other than that iam a clean person so I no that I don't have to worry about it
-1	Nothing at all, lived and am living a good life, do not fear God or the after-life, ready for whatever comes, spouse and 3 dogs taken care of, all is well.  No anxiety, no worries.  Remember, Pobody's Nerfect  The only perfect person I know got nailed to a cross and I'm not trying to go there ~
1	If I am being seen for something I feel is serious then I have probably already researched symptoms and possible causes and I am worried about what the diagnosis is going to be. I also feel anxious when having an exam because sometimes it is just awkward
-1	I'm occasiolly nervous about what the diagnosis will be or if there will be one. There have been times that I've had to go back a few times before being referred and finding out what is really wrong. 
1	I am usually worried that they may find something wrong.And my mother died from infection in the hospital, so I dont trust them either.
-1	What I hate is the intolerable wait in the outer office and then again waiting for the doctor to see you once inside a room. Every doctor I visit seems to think it's perfectly acceptable to keep a patient waiting endlessly, without any apology or explanation.
1	I am most anxious about hearing bad news. I am worried that something would pop up positive on tests. 
1	I don't feel anxious more annoyed. I feel like I end up wasting my time and get little results. I feel like I have to keep going back and wasting more money.
-1	"Mostly it's finding out something is wrong. Other than that, it's more of ""did I cut my ils, or wash well"", and making sure I don't smell. The exam is just ""there"", and doesn't cause me too much worry."
1	I worry that something will be wrong with me. I worry that she will criticize me for not having lost weight or exercising enough.
-1	Nothing usually. I am generally very comfortable visiting the doctor. 
1	Whether they are going to find something wrong and try to pressure me into some 'treatment' which will suppress symptoms and interfere with my body's attempts to heal and rebalance. I really wish that I could find a holistic practitioner who could help me live a tural and healthy lifestyle, making the most of traditiol medical knowledge and modern medicine. 
-1	Number one, I don't like going to the doctor. I never have liked going to the doctor. I usually go because I have to go. Then, I expect to receive bad news.
-1	Most people don't go to the doctor until they feel something is wrong. With so many illnesses being in existence, it's hard to not be anxious of what could possibly be told to you. 
1	I just always feel like there might be something wrong that they are going to discover and that puts me on edge. 
-1	When I'm not feeling well and have no clue whats wrong. I have had cancer twice already, so illness really scares me.
-1	Getting bad, difficult or negative health news, is what makes me most anxious about visiting the Doctor's.
1	I don't like to go to any doctor or hospital for any reason not even to visit someone else. I worry that they will find something bad so I do not like to go get a physical and I avoid the doctor's office as much as possible. They always have a pill for everything and I feel some prescription drugs take away the body's ability to heal itself. 
1	"I'm pretty typical in the fear of ""something being wrong"". I also have history of anxiety including previous family members."
-1	I know my doctors professionally and I don't like them looking at my undressed body and this makes me anxious and a little uncomfortable or unease. I don't worry because I know that God has my back and all is well.
1	I worry that something is seriously wrong.
-1	At my age, although I keep very fit, there is always the dreaded report of high blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart conditions.
-1	nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried except just making sure the doctor knows what they are doing because were I live they really do not
1	That they won't figure out the source of the problem and will just prescribe medicine with side effects
-1	What they will find is the only reason that you have to do that and get a new name. There's has a good time to get the money to the store is a good thing. 
-1	there is nothing that makes me feel anxious. I look for my PC to be clear about my condition and what I am doing and need to do to maintain my health.
1	I normally only go to the doctor's office when I know something is wrong. Finding out what is wrong makes me very anxious. I often go to the doctor's office alone, so it makes me nervous to have to deal with that.
1	I worry they will perform a painful procedure.  I worry they will recommend that I have a painful procedure.  I am anxious about rather or not they will listen to my needs, concerns and rather or not they will spend enough time with me.
-1	I do not get anxious or worried about the actual examination or medical procedure itself, but more from a general misunderstanding of what is going on. I feel that I have no idea how much everything is going to cost and if I am even visiting the right doctor for the issue. If I am sick or have a medical issue, I don't know who to go to and do not understand how my health insurance policy works. 
1	Find something in my body and have to check me, have bad news about me and have to operate or something like that
1	"A general health care facility doesn't always understand that some people are intelligent and they don't like when a patient says ""I don't want that"". "
1	Usually any procedure that involves the doctor inspecting private areas makes me worried.  I don't feel comfortable with that at all.
-1	The one thing that makes me feel even slightly anxious is the idea that I somehow may have contracted some sort of disease that I would have not noticed without going to the doctor.
-1	Nothing really makes me feel anxious at the doctors office. I have always been pretty relaxed while I was there.
1	you dread  awful test results even if you may have been expecting it so the natural response is to be anxious
-1	If I have a problem that I'm unsure what it is. Everyone is always scared of the what seems like the inevitable. The inevitable is the big C word. Cancer. Either we die from a heart related problem or cancer most likely. It's just a matter of time.
1	Usually I've had to wait so long in the waiting room in order to even get to triage, that I am distressed and anxious. I hate that there's no continuity between the staff, so I usually have to describe my signs and symptoms 3 or more times. The doctors always seem rushed and rarely have time to explain anything. Usually I wait to go to the doctor when it's a serious condition, so I'm already anxious. Doctors just want to get you in and out, so they don't do a thorough assessment. Some already have your prescription written on a pad before they've walked into the exam room.
-1	What makes me feel anxious when I'm visiting my doctor's office is what day might find. Since I don't visit the doctor as often as I should I get a little anxious or worried that that they might tell me something is bad about my health something I could be devastating to me so I get a little anxious but I think that's normal right?
1	I would normally be anxious about my weight, my blood pressure, and my other health indicators. If the numbers are not good I might get scolded by the doctor, or worse, they might indicate I am not healthy. I would also feel anticipation to hear the results because I would be hoping for good numbers instead of bad ones. I would feel worry that I might get health news that I do not like.
-1	Getting a shot makes me feel most worried. I hate getting shots because they hurt and I'm not a big fan of needle. 
1	"I feel the most anxious about the unknown.  Even totally healthy people can have bad things happen and I have not been living the healthiest lifestyle.  I worry that there will be something wrong with me that cannot be ""fixed."""
1	 Every where I go, I am always anxious and worried. At any moment, you don't know what could go wrong
1	The Doctor finding something very wrong, either cancer or something caused by my diabetes. I don't want to leave my family at a young age 
-1	Recently I took X-ray's and a blood test I was anxious and worried about the results. He told me everything was good which was a relief. I'm still worried about why I'm not  getting better I go back in a few weeks . 
-1	
1	the most anxious aspect of visiting the doctor occurs in the fact that i will be touched with very cold hands. 
-1	I get most anxious and worried about the bill I will receive. I have an HMO and pay $25 for PCP office visits. However, after my appointment my doctor's office will re-evaluate the co-pay and what was discussed and bill me for items that came up in conversation during an appointment. 
1	That the doctor is going to find something very wrong with me.  I worry that if I am sick that I might have a serious illness. 
1	I am always worried they are going to find some cancer or some other paranoid crap like that, since a bunch of cancers are present in my family. 
1	I am not good with needles, and I have had a bad experience in the past when they pricked my finger. I almost passed out, so they had to take me back into a room. I ended up having a blood blister and bruising on my finger for the next few days. 
-1	There really isn't anything that I feel anxious or worried about.  I very much believe that, even if a doctor recommends a certain treatment or test, it is ultimately up to the patient whether that recommendation is followed.  I have resigned myself to the fact that I am not in good health, just as I've resigned myself to the fact that everybody has to go sometime.
1	After having some tests done, I'm always fearful while waiting for the results.  She will usually tell me what to expect, but I worry about everything. 
-1	I always think there is going to be something wrong with me, or it will be even more negative I get worried cause all of my health issues.
1	Even if I'm perfectly healthy for some reason I get a little anxious because you can never know what will really happen. There are people younger than me that have died from cancer and horrible things, so it's always in the back of my mind.
1	I always feel anxious at the doctor office, because I never know what they are going to find.  Even if I am healthy, I worry they may find something bad.
-1	I am not anxious about the doctor themselves just about how much it is going to cost me that I cannot afford in this day and age
-1	If they look at the chart, and then exit the room immediately. This happened when I had interl bleeding from a wrestling accident. I immediately knew it was more serious than I initially thought.
-1	Am get older. Frienfs and gamily are havinghealth issyez and i am concerned that doctor may discover pronlems for me.
1	I feel the most anxious or worried about finding out there may be something seriously medically wrong with me. I usually don't feel super worried if I go in for sinus infection symptoms, or something routine. Last time I went, it was for a breast lump, and I was terrified. 
-1	I have Lupus which attacks the organs in the body. The norm for me is quarterly blood work to check for organ function, blood count and urinalysis. You're only as good as last test.
1	I am most worried about my doctor personally attacking me for my choices I have made. It is hard telling how he will act. 
-1	just the idea or the unknown and what my be found or  discovered and then the impact on myself and others
-1	I am not anxious or worried ever when going to the dr. 
-1	Contracting something from other sick people, or feeling vulnerable just being in the office when I don't really want to be there.
-1	I don't like waiting for the doctor. I feel uncomfortable. I can also feel anxious about finding what is wrong with me
1	That I may find out that I have a life threatening condition or something that is expensive to cure. 
1	Sometimes I get anxious over whether or not something is wrong with me, but mostly I get anxious because I have social anxiety disorder.
-1	Only when I know  something is wrong and I worry about what the reasons are If it is nothing serious  my doctor is good with reassuring me 
-1	Since I was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years ago, there is always some trepidation when going to the doctor: Am I all right? Has the cancer come back?  I regard these as legitimate concerns.
1	What makes me feel most anxious is that the doctor is going to discover a serious medical condition I did not know I had. I am anxious that this will affect my quality of life going forward. This makes me anxious to some degree about visits.
-1	I have many health problems so I am always concerned that those conditions are worsening.My doctor runs tests and I am always slightly concerned with these reports.
1	I have issues.  I don't want them to get worse so, of course, I feel anxious awaiting the results.  It is not the doctor himself that makes me anxious
-1	Sometimes, I felt uncertain about my disease condition and related treatments when visiting the doctor's office. I was not sure if I should take a new medicine for my disease. 
1	I hate needles I hate the blood pressure machine my health is reasobly good it's just I don't like being poked and prodded
1	I feel like I'm being judged
-1	I think it is just the fact of the unknown. Everyone comes across health issues at some point in their life and im just nervous waiting for mine. Worrying that my blood test will come back abnormal or the doctor will hear something in my lungs or see a lump somewhere. 
1	I feel anxious or worried because I would hope there is nothing wrong with me internal or external. Just the thought of going to the doctor's office makes me scared and nervous because I don't want to be delivered any bad news.
-1	
-1	nothing. i try to keep myself in shape. so there is never a worry or doubt in my mind. he is a striaght shooter and tell me things how they are. so no need to worry
-1	My biggest fear would be a diagnosis which revealed some serious medical condition which I was uware of.
-1	Big Sean time clocks you have good Vick look treat good  pop top drop come cook sleepy heart of mind sweet hat
1	Finding out that I might have a chronic disease.
1	It's not easy place to be and with dealing with insurance to seeing dr so many things to think about 
1	i've had high blood pressure and chest pains. i've had pretty serious kidney stones. when i go to the doctor because of some pain, at my age i always worry whether it might be heart disease or cancer. haven't had anything that serious yet, thankfully.
1	I am always afraid that they are going to find something seriously wrong that I am not aware of.
-1	What makes me most anxious when visiting the doctor is myself. Aside from strep throat, which I get fairly often, I usually have a worse case scerio that turns out not to be so bad afterward. 
-1	Sitting surrounded by sick people, in an environment where nosocomial infections abound. A doctor's office is where sick people come, and a percentage of them are contagious.  Limiting the amount of time in a doctor's office reduces exposure risk.
-1	I do not worry when I go to the doctor's.  I know it is necessary for my health.  I have confidence that my doctor will listen to my complaints and proscribe the necessary and correct treatments.
-1	I don't really know; it's been a long time since I've needed to see a doctor, so nothing springs to mind.
1	I don't feel anxious about nothing I'm very much laid back and conservative. I like to observe every situation 
1	"I am most anxious when discussing symptoms and/or test results that do not conclusively provide a diagnosis. I have had a few experiences where my doctor at the time assumed that I was simply ""anxious"" and refused to take my concerns seriously. I was later diagnosed with a serious illness. It is my fear that I will be perceived as having a mental illness that causes my distress, or as ""drug-seeking""."
-1	I don't ever feel overly anxious. I usually go when I need to have an ailment treated with medication. Diagnosis is normally simple and routine. 
-1	I think it's just the concept that you may be of ill-health and that's a very troubling and worrisome thought for anyone.
-1	"I think there is a general anxiety when visiting a doctor or dentist's office. I feel more anxious when I am in the office because of a serious problem I am having. The anxiety is not caused by the doctor but rather by the possibility my ""ailment"" might turn out to be serious."
-1	Whether my condition is more serious than I expected
1	That i am going to be sick. That the doctor will be rude
1	I am always worried and concerned that something serious has developed since my last appointment. Itâs a fear based on nothing in particular 
1	You never know what might be going on in your body. It's always a worrying feeling getting test results back . Depending on the rest you never know what to think or what to expect . 
-1	What makes me anxious is the anticipation. I don't know if I have something wrong with me or not.
-1	In general I always get tense visits to the doctors because I always think the worst of my diagnoses and it makes me nervous to think about the results, it is a tense situation and I think it is something that all patients experience
1	I am not comfortable getting naked in front of man I do not know.  I do not think that healthcare providers give a patient enough information about what they will be doing BEFORE they do it which makes me very jumpy.  I do not get in another person's personal space without permission or without telling them what I am doing.  I don't think it's too much to ask of virtual strangers especially when I am already naked and vulnerable.  I worry about what tests I will be told I need as many of them are painful or at least uncomfortable especially when someone has an issue with the sight of needles.  I worry about being diagnosed with a condition that could mean significant lifestyle changes or death.
-1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is his eagerness to prescribed drugs as a solution to most problems.  Drugs can become expensive especially if you have to take more than one everyday.  Other than that there's not many things that makes me anxious  about visiting the doctor.
1	i only go to the doctor when absolutely necessary, and i am always nervous about what they are going to tell me. i am uninsured, so i don't have the money to go in the first place, much less pay for any tests or follow-ups they may want. at times i feel as though it would be better to not do anything and die because then, at least my family will not be stuck with outrageous bills they cannot afford
-1	you never know what could be found. You might feel fine but test can indicate otherwise.  I usually expect that all is well but one small thing can lead to a bigger problem.  I most worry about how the doctor will react to my questions.  I hate being prodded or poked.  The starkness of the room does not help either.  The wait for the doctor can be unnerving also.  I just want to get in and out quickly.  The cost can also be a factor in how much i might be concerned.
-1	nothing makes me feel anxious or worried because i do not go to doctors because i am in good health so i do not need to go
-1	I have anxiety.  I don't like interacting with people.  I'm a private person. I don't like discussing what's wrong wit me.
1	A diagnosis of a disease. Finding out I'm going to die. Stuff like that is scary you know? That's all 
1	It is just uncomfortable.  It is not something you do everyday so when the time comes for an appointment it makes me anxious.  I worry about gaining weight or my blood work numbers not being in the range they should be.
-1	I worry when there is a waiting time before diagnosis. I have had 3 or 4 good scares in my life, liver failure and cancer. I am not the kind of person that will freak out on possibly fatal news like that.  The other thing was needles. I used to become quite anxious when waiting. 
1	I  worry  about  his   diagnosis  and  what I will  have to  do  formyself    if there r serious  problems
-1	Not knowing what the results of tests or an examition might be. It makes me a little nervous,not knowing what to expect.
-1	That there might be something seriously wrong with me, my heart rate or oxygen levels are down, my blood work came back bad, the pain in feeling is something bad.
1	I anxious or worried because I'm afraid that they might find something wrong with me or I mind get sick.
1	i don't feel anxious or worried at all if i am just having a visit or have only a small problem that is not serious.   if i had a serious problem, then i would be worried and maybe have a second opinion after their diagnosis of me
1	Just the idea of going to the doctor makes me anxious and worried that some major medical condition will be found even though this is probably not going to happen.
-1	I dont feel anxious or worried at a doctors office. I am probably one of the few that actually looks forward to going to the doctors office.
1	I'm not great around people. I get super nervous when around someome I don't know. And I hate getting a check up.. some strange person touching me.. I don't like it
1	What makes me feel the most anxious when visiting a doctor's office is the unknown. Generally, when I am going to the doctor's office, I don't know what is wrong with me and I fear the worst in some circumstances.
1	im just anxious bout hat they will find i have several ailments that can turn into worse ailments in m family history ithere are diseases that can be bad
-1	When you go to the doctor's office you don't want them to give you a bear results you don't want them to find nothing wrong with you you want to be okay and in good health
-1	Nothing really, He'll tell me the truth and not beat around the bush.  My philosophy is it is what it is, and we'll go from there.
1	I get anxious and worried about the doctor having possible bad news during my check up or telling me something important that I need to worry about.
-1	The feeling that something could be wrong that I dont know about that the doctor realizes is what makes me most anxious when visting the doctors office.
1	i get worried about finding out something about my health that totally blindsides me, or that ended up in a poor state due to lack of action on my part.
-1	The only thing that makes me nervous are physical tests. I hate injections and pap smears. Also, I am a smoker so I get a little afraid to hear bad news of abnormal result.
-1	What makes me most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is if any of the procedures they'll be performing on me are painful or not. Another thing that makes me somewhat anxious is when they ask me questions that I find to be too personal or embarrassing.
-1	Not knowing what they might find. Worrying something might be wrong that I don't know of. as I get older there is a chance that I might have a condition that I need to take a medication for.
-1	Once again they seem to be judgemental when treating their patients.  I disagree with that way of looking at things, especially if a patient is a drug addict or in recovery being tested for something other than that addiction.
1	I am at this last stage in life, old age, really sure of anxious  (meaning excited, don't have the dictionary to look) if anxious looking forward to seeing the doctor, not really but there is need for the routine check or the need for the prescription because you can't get without the doctor's help. Worried not really until something done or stated wrong. I don't like swallowing a lot of pills, either. Testing that may cause unseen problems or being mistreated. Usually, want my health need over with. I also know I can stop but the treatment of the disease is chronic.
-1	My family has a long history of heart trouble, in particular high blood pressure, so I am always anxious when I go in for a physical that now will be my time to start down the heart disease path.  I also worry about mammograms. I haven't had any diagnoses that justify my concern, but I do nonetheless.
-1	The only thing I get worried about is what my number on the scale will be. (weight)
-1	I would be worried that there could be something seriously wrong with me during a visit.  Especially when I've been experiencing pain or unusual symptoms.
-1	Its entirelt possible that my health is such that the my doctor might find a problem that will be of major concern to me. Luckily I have never left the doctors office with such worries as my doctor has always been upfront with me about my health.
-1	The only thing that would make me anxious or worried is the condition that sent me to see the doctor in the first place.  I'm the sort of person who won't go to see a doctor unless I think there is something seriously wrong.  Not serious in the sense that I might think something life threatening but serious in the sense that it's something my body's defense system seems to be incapable of taking care of on it's own.
1	Always  the fear they may find something serious wrong or may tell me something I do not want to hear  
1	I get worried if they can't figure out what is wrong relatively quickly. I would start to think it is something serious and potentially lose sleep over it. Luckily, I've only had that happen a few times, and in the end the problem was resolved.
-1	I only get anxious sometimes in the waiting room because I get social anxiety. 
-1	I can feel anxious regarding when I have to wait for a test result as if its something that could mean there could be adverse results for long term.
1	Ah we hehehe did turn it in the morning and I will be there in a few minutes late but I don't know if you want to go to the gym and then I will be there in a few minutes late but I don't know
1	Human nature. Always wonder if he will find something wrong and if I had acomplaint, will it turn Otto be minor or major
-1	I worry because when I go to the doctor it is usually because i have been having some symptoms and the doctor is going to tell me what is wrong, and I dont want anything to be wrong
1	"I am always worried I am going to get a ""death sentence"".  I also worried that the procedure will hurt.  I also worry that the doctor will tell me something that I should be doing, because what I am doing is not good enough."
-1	Its just embarassing. I am a modest person, so having ANYONE see me naked or half dressed is stressful
1	If I am supposed to be working on my weight and I have not or have gained weight. If my lab results are not good.
1	If we can come up with an honest yet reasonable solution for every problem that I may have during my visit.I also wonder if he had my best interest at hand when he does my check up.
-1	When I go to the doctor I am usually nervious some because they do blood work first before the actual physical. I always want to hear good news. I always want to know If I have been doing the right things to keep my body physically fit. Blood pressure, etc. is a small problem for me. My age predict what I can do and ear and participate . 
-1	nothing, I feel fine when I go. 
1	Not knowing what proceedures they want to do or not knowing if they are really safe when I am told they are but have a gut feeling them are not.

1	waiting rooms and seeing other patients in sad and debilitating  conditions while wondering about my diagnosis
1	"I do not like to pay money for nothing. If I do not get the help I need or if the cost is excessive, I am displeased. I also must consider if all ""treatments"" are worth the cost."
-1	It all depends what i go to the doctor for especially when i just got out of the emergency room. Do not know what he is going to do for me.
-1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor is that he will tell me that I have a major illness or condition that will make it impossible to live my life the way I want to.
-1	On my most recent visit I was a little anxious because I was beginning a new medication and didn't know if it would be for me, but after all was said and labs were done it worked out for me.  
-1	I really am not her anxious but I have lost my last three doctors to retirement. This time I picked a younger one hoping he will not retire til I am gone.
1	Just the idea that something could be worse than it seems. Or that they'll berate me or something like that.
1	When I am visiting an doctor office I am worried that I may get some terrible news that I don't want to hear. I don't do good with bad news at all. Then I know my blood pressure get high. I don't like bad news and I don't want to hear it. I really dread going to the doctor but I know that we all need to go because if something serious is going on we can catch it in time. All news is not bad news. The doctor can and will deliver good news also. I know it can really makes someone day.
-1	I don't like when she rushes me.  I don't like when she does not listen to my health concerns.  It makes me anxious that something could go wrong that my doctor could simply brush off and overlook.  I often wonder about a mole on my back, which she said was benign just by looking at it.  Meanwhile she is not a dermatologist.  And she then referred me to a dr that had killed my friends father by misdiagnosing him.
1	I feel the most anxious about visiting a doctor in general because of the dread of the diagnosis.  I am worried about what a doctor will find wrong with me. I am also worried about the fincial burden tests will entail.
1	Not know what they might find, Not know if i could afford medications, Not know what of  anything might come of it
1	I dont normally feel anxious or worried at the doctors. The only time i was infact worried and scared was when i burned my legs. I was scared for my life but they helped me through it
-1	I have had poor past experiences with doctors that automatically makes me anxious when I go to the doctor, even though I trust my current doctor. Just being in a doctor's office setting seems to trigger the anxiety.
1	I worry that my symptoms or the reasons why I came to the doctor's office will turn out to be more serious than I had thought.  I worry that it might be a bigger disease or issue.
-1	Nothing generally makes me worried other than the thought that something might be serious wrong with me.
-1	I feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor because sometimes i don't know what to expect. In my mind i think the doctor may end up finding something negative and not good and that makes me worried most of the time
1	I am worried about finding out any bad news. I also worry about the staff being rude or uncaring.
-1	I'm not usually anxious or worried at my doctors visits.  If I am there with a complaint I don't jump to the worst case scenerio
1	I don't like to be picked at like a lab specimen.  I worry that they'll find something wrong with me.
1	I'm afraid they are going to judge me because I have several mental health issues. I've had several doctors in the past treat me like I'm crazy instead of a woman with some mental health issues to deal with. 
1	The not knowing...what I have, will they take it seriously... it's a crap shoot if the doctor is having a bad day.  My experience with doctors has been discouraging for the most part
1	I have had so many of them refuse to treat me I am scared every time I walk in. I have had to travel around states and the country finding care. I am fully aware I may not get treated and not to take it personally. I am tired of being called crazy or a liar when I am really sick and NOT feeling well.
1	Id be worried about them sending me medicines that i really dont need and They telling me i have something that is notable true
-1	Waiting in the waiting area.  I hate it because when they give you an appointment time and you show up, they should be ready to see you.
-1	Natural feeling. Doctors offices for some reason have an anxious vibe about them or a hospital. And if you are there because you are sick, it adds more anxiety 
-1	I can experience anxiety if I'm having a new problem or concern that I haven't dealt with before dio taking tests cab make me feel a little uneasy
-1	"I tend not to be anxious unless I am in the waiting room too long. I found that if I bring something to read, I am less anxious. My anxiety has nothing to do with anticipating what the doctor might ""find"". I have also learned to have no other commitments scheduled on the day of my doctor's appointment. If I am working, I schedule the doctor's appt. for the afternoon. "
1	I just don't like going to the doctor. She's nice and all but I just hate going there. Nothing against her at all
1	I'm most anxious and worried when I don't know what's wrong with me and unsure if I'll be able to get the answers I need.
1	It makes me anxious or worried when i visit the doctor's office when i know theres something wrong with me
-1	i never feel anxious or worried when i go visit my primary care physician or any doctor's office. I just act like myself and ready for the day to be over with.. sometimes I get worried when doctors give me some prescription and I don't know what to do
1	I don't know what to expect when I visit the doctors office... anything can happen and be unexpected... you don't want to expect the worst 
-1	Worrying about blood results coming back
1	I am anxious that the doctor visit will end up costing a lot of money. Sometimes I think that ignorance is bliss and I would rather not know if something is wrong. If you look hard enough something will always be less than perfect.
1	Not knowing what is wrong with me or having the doctor or nurses find out additional problems that I had no idea about.
-1	The waiting is sometimes nerve racking. Other than that if I feel okay and it is a normal check up visit I am not worries. If I do not feel okay then I worry a little.
-1	The chance of receiving bad news I suppose. I have cancer in my family and it is always a worry of mine. 
1	I always get nervous at the doctor before testing procedures because I have had a lot of health problems so I am scared that something else will come up but I always have a lot of trust in my doctor.
-1	The unknown, not knowing if what health check up could turn up or progress into something worse or more intense. Anxiety hits everyone, and just going to one would incur a little bit of worry or doubt when getting checked out and evaluated.
1	  If someone there or around is ging to get me sick.  If someone will give me the wrong diagnosis.  If someone will give me the wrong medication.
1	I think that most people walking into a doctor's office, even if they look and feel healthy, are anxious and worried about being diagnosed with something terrible. Just a few years ago I thought that I was quite healthy and was told at the age of 30 or 31 that I had very high cholesterol and had to start taking prescription medication to address the problem.  Every time I go to the doctor I'm worried that I might learn of a similar problem.
1	I just feel nervous and my blood pressure raises I have a bad nervous system been like this since a baby
-1	about what he would find if anything and what the treatment would entail how it woud effect everyone basically just worry for no reason
1	Waiting and things not being explained.  I also feel anxious when they ask questions as if I'm three years old
-1	I do not feel anxious when visiting a doctor. I might feel worried that I am ill, and can't be fixed. I feel most doctors have the best interest at heart.
-1	There is nothingI feel anxious or worried about with my doctor.I have nothing else to say on this matter.This is to much.
-1	Having someone poke me and hover around me. I like my space.
-1	Probably just that I am worried that there's something wrong or that it's worse than I imagined. 
-1	I am worried that I won't be able to get my prescription any more.
1	A physical exam is generally unpleasant to me. I worry about what professiols might think about my body, or me in general. I also worry that something unexpected might show up and my health is declining.
1	Sometimes when visit my doctor ,there's a fear of the unknown. Feraing that there may be something wrong
1	What makes me feel the most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office is receiving bad news about my health and wondering if I'm going to die or become extremely sick.
-1	Well I have the normal worry of hoping that I don't have a serious conditions when ever blood tests etc are done. We all want to avoid bad news and pain. I know the irony is that avoiding the doctor heightens our chance of bad news when we finally do go. I learned this first hand when I when I had the emergency, telling myself that the pain in my chest and difficulty breathing was nothing to worry about. It turned out to be more serious than I thought.
1	When they are scowling and in a bitter mood. It's not my fault but they still end up taking out their anger on me. It greatly pisses me off. So i go home think whether or not they truly told me what I needed to hear
-1	Since I have had numerous medical issues, I do have some anxiety or worry that something may be amiss when i discuss current symptoms or have to get certain blood work done.  I usually, however, keep things under control!
-1	The only time I feel anxious at the doctor's office is when I feel like I may be receiving bad results.  Other than that I never feel anxious or worried while visiting my doctor's office. My doctor puts my worries at ease.

1	I'm never anxiious when visiting my doctor because I know whatever is going on he will get to the root of the problem
1	that they will dismiss me again and i will have to do research onlin, once more, to find out how to best treat myself
-1	Not much makes me worried about a doctors visit. If one takes the best care of herself or himself, exercises, eats right, than there's not much to worry about
-1	I am usually not that nervous or anxious when visiting any doctor but, am not that excited or comfortable either. I dont have any particular feelings it's just neccesary.
-1	if they will tell me something bad or if I have to set another appointment if they found something doctor visits in itself or just nerve wrecking
1	I fear being sent to stay in hospital. I have open  wounds that do not heal, often illness is due to infections
1	Contagious disease testing, having to get blood drawn by an inexperienced staff person. Anything related to the unknown and having to wait for results.
1	The most anxious part is the waiting, whether it is in the waiting room or inside one of the examition rooms. It is the time where I think about what's going to happen, what the doctor might say, and the necessary questions I need to ask. Since I don't know all of this ahead of time, I'm trying to think of questions for any scerio, which is stressful. 
-1	I'm worried that I may have a hidden condition of some sort. I generally feel healthy, but there is also a small thought in the back of my head that I may have hidden, lingering cancer or something. I don't want to get bad news. 
-1	I'm most worried because I never know if my health has changed in a way that I dont know about. Like different things that may only show up in blood work.
1	nothing really makes me feel that way i love my doctor and know that he has my best interest and would not do anything that should not be done
1	Remember that doctors are there to help you and try to solve your health problems. It's not their purpose to hurt you as much as possible. On the contrary, they will try to achieve what needs to be done with as little pain as possible. Yet some things just hurt. No doctor can change that, unfortunately. Try to pluck up courage s much ad possible and say to yourself: we're just gonna do it. I'm not gonna get beaten by a stupid needle!!! Try it, next time. It works and you will feel proud of yourself!
-1	Bad results 
1	The unknown to me is definitely the worst part. I often think of the worst thing that could happen and it's hard to think of anything else afterwords. Sitting in the waiting room also makes me feel anxious because I keep thinking about anything bad that could occur.  Finally, when the doctor starts talking too fast or talks about confusing things i get nervous that I will not understand something.
-1	Typically I am just worried something will come up during the exam. My doctor is capable of making me feel better. The diagnosis of things is typically explained properly as well with little questions from me.
-1	IT IS VERY BEST TO FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG AS VERY SOON AS POSSIBLE . THEN THE PROPER TREATMENT AND MEDICINE CAN BE PRESCRIBES BY THE DOCTOR.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit my doctor for any reason, be it acute or chronic care.                                           
-1	I never get upset or feel anxious, although I had to see a female doctor twice when I was younger and both times when the nurse first had to check my sore I got an erection. She blushed and so did I. The doctor was more stoic.
1	I feel most anxious when the doctor can't give me an answer right away. Whether it's due to waiting on a lab result or needing more information
1	I get worried that something may be getting worse like my blood pressure or my blood sugar levels and that I will have to deal with new medical problems.
-1	I feel anxious when I have unexplained pain (I worry if it's something serious or a part of my anxiety).
1	I am most concerned about the doctor telling me that I have or might have a serious, even terminal, medical condition or illness.  This is certainly something that nobody ever wants to think about.  It would be a scary thing to contemplate for sure.
-1	I don't like going to the doctor's office anymore than anyone does. Not thinking they will find something wrong with you but the fact that it is uncomfortable to have someone checking all over you.
1	Being judged, etc concerning my health conditions. I am an inactive alcoholic, but often receive judgement for it. Or Drs tend to ignore my other issues like anxiety.
1	I feel that way because I never want to hear bad news about my health. You just never know what is going to happen when you have test done.
-1	Nothing does, I have no anxiety when visiting a doctor.
-1	When I not sure what I will face with the doctor. I felt anxious. If I have to stay there for too long or have a lot of exams, I feel nervous of course.
-1	In general I don't feel anxious or worried unless I have a disturbing symptom.  The disturbing factor is my health, not visiting the doctor.
-1	I always think they will find something I didn't expect before entering. No one likes hearing bad news about their health, because it could be worse than they thought. I deal with any issue that comes my way, but it's a normal reaction to be worried that something is wrong, especially when feeling bad.
-1	I don't know, really. I'm not scared, just nervous. 
-1	I am worried with the test result.  Worried on what if I have the non cure disease of what if I'm dying.  That's awkward but it's really what I feel.
-1	"I do not have anxiety or worry during general health check ups: I'm usually confident and interested in my ""numbers"" and generally look forward to learning about my overall health. The only time I may feel anxiety is during a mammography (either because I'm waiting for results or because I'm worried that the x-ray won't accurately pick up my results due to dense tissue. Additionally, I recently experienced a call-back which produced unnecessary anxiety). Or, during a rare emergency visit for an unknown, serious illness and am awaiting diagnosis."
-1	If I am a the doctor it is usually something wrong. I am sick or not feeling well. I am nervous sometimes to find out what the problem is. I hate waiting for test results. It just delays information. We live in the information age when every answer is at your finger tips. So waiting 2 days for results is agony. 
-1	I am not sure what he may say. I am nervous of hearing any type of report. Then I do not want to be placed on machines.
-1	The needle if i have to get a shot!
1	The fact that I may find out bad news about my health makes me feel worried. For example, my last visit was a pap smear. A few days later, my doctor emailed me saying that they have to do my pap smear over because there were not enough cells to test.
-1	Again, I do not have any medical issues.  If I need a doctor or medical help I will go to the local urgent care office.  Most issues I have had in the past can be taken care at the urgent care.
1	I guess there's always the back-of-the-mind fear that the doctor will find something wrong. That's not usually a huge concern for me, though, because I've always been quite healthy aside from my weight, which I'm working on. Mostly I'm just anxious because there's nearly always SOMETHING uncomfortable in a doctor's visit. Taking off more clothes than I'd like to, or painful examitions (and I have a VERY low pain threshold - I consider those blood pressure cuffs painful), or being told yet again that I'm overweight as if I couldn't see that for myself.
1	Waiting for test results.
-1	The only time I feel anxious or worried is when I am not sure what could be wrong with me. Sometimes I feel they will find something seriously wrong with me
-1	Not knowing what is going on and how bad it will be.
-1	When I was pregnant last year i went to see my doctor very often and I was always worried about being told there was something wrong with the baby. I didn't really care about me as much as i cared about my baby
1	I'm a worrier, always have been, so seeing a doctor, even for a regular checkup, is nerve-wracking to me. I always think beforehand that the doctor will find something wrong or need to do a followup on something that's worrying to him. I tend to get myself worked up before doctor appointments, but that's just my personality.
-1	Nothing, I feel comfortable with them.  They know what they're doing so there is nothing to worry about 
-1	Just a very little that he will find something that might reveal a serious health problem I was previously unaware of. 
-1	I would feel most anxious about any test results I may be getting back.  I would also be a little anxious about the potential that something may be very wrong and I would need an extended hospital stay.
-1	That at age 72 he may have some bad news about my health.  My mother has Alzheimer's and it's always worrisome to me to know I may aquire the same disease.
-1	If I have a concern and do not know what the outcome may be, this can make me anxious. Usually never worried or anxious as my health is very good for my age.
1	I'm scared that my life won't go the way I need it to go and I need to be successful and make my mom proud.
1	Not knowing if something may actually be wrong with my health
-1	What makes me feel most anxious is making sure I cover everything.  I want to make sure I don't miss anything that I should have told my physician during my appointment. What has me worried is the unknown. Worrying about my blood pressure or sugar or iron levels. 
-1	The only thing I ever had that made me anxious and worried was a possible cancer diagnosis. The other things I have been less worried about, even though some of them have been serious.
-1	There is nothing that makes me worried or anxious when I visit the doctor I usually have a good sense of what they are going to tell me there is no reason people shul be worried about seeing the doctor
-1	nothing at all high quality office visit for all patients.giving very well routine checkups. great nurses,and lab,technisions
1	It's an unfamiliar environment and people usually go to the doctor's office when there is something wrong with them healthwise or they are afraid something could be wrong. The uncertainty is likely what causes me the most anxiety.
1	I worry that they will overlook my symptoms because they do not understand the complexities of my illness or that they do not take my condition seriously enough to educate themselves on it. 
1	That they will find something wrong with me that is very harmful and that would be life changing. Today going to get checked by a doctor with all the things that can go wrong is a very stressful thing.
1	What makes me most anxious is the thought that he may give me bad news.  I particularly don't like to wait for results from test because I start to worry the results might be bad. 
-1	I am not worried or anxious when I visit the doctor I feel confidence what ever he tells me I will be able to pray and ask God for guidance
1	What makes me worried is what the results are from the exam I just had.  If I am sick or have a pain and I see the doctor and he does some type of exam, x-ray, blood work, etc., then the results are what make me anxious.  
-1	The bill when it comes in the mail. Why isn't healthcare universal? Health insurance should not be a privilege. 
1	It's the not knowing.  Not knowing if he'll find something wrong with me.  Wondering how bad it could be.  And what to expect after that.
1	I just do not like the Doctors office or hospital setting.  It is not a happy place to be.  It is a dreadful place to be.   Who would like that .   
-1	The times that I have felt anxious has been when I didn't know what was wrong.  I had knee pain a few years ago after injuring it playing basketball.  I was nervous or anxious that I would find out after examining it that I would need major surgery.  It turned out to not be a big deal and I just needed to rest and rehab it, but it was a very anxiety inducing day for me. 
1	The unknown always tends to make me feel anxious or worried.  We all look forward to good news, however when it is unforeseen, it leads to your thoughts running wild.  
-1	SITTING IN THE WAITING ROOM AT MY DOCTOR'S OFFICE I AM ALWAYS A LITTLE ANXIOUS. BUT ONCE I AM IN THE EXAMINING ROOM I AM NEVER ANXIOUS OR WORRIED
1	I am scared because at any moment, they could diagnose me with something that is bad and it could make me get scared.  I don't want to die and they could say I have a condition that will kill me.
-1	I worry that he may uncover unknown ailments that could create new life challenges, or exacerbate the ones already experienced from being a type 1 diabetic.
1	I hate being hospitalized. I am worried they might find something that will require me to go back into the hospital. There I stay thirsty and can get no rest.
-1	Have them telling me that I have incurred some kind of physical problem that cannot be treated. Sometimes you never know what some blood work might show
-1	I'm usually worried they won't believe me about whatever problem I'm having. I've had this happen multiple times, and both issues turned out being detectable, serious ones even though the first doctor didn't believe me.
-1	Can't say as I'm usually worried when visiting the doctor's office.  So, nothing? I pretty much know why I'm there and what the ultimate result/plan is going to be.
-1	What usually concerns me most is how much it is going to cost. Though I have insurance the bill can sometimes still be considerable.
-1	I do not feel anxious with any doctor O go to. Either i will follow their suggestions or not. I only go to the doctor when i have to.
1	It's expensive and I don't want a poor diagnosis. It's also uncomfortable,  because I am shy around strangers and do not like talking about myself.
1	What makes me most anxious is finding out that I have some horrible sort of disease or illness. I also tend to feel worried that I'll be taken advantage of.
1	I usually imagine a worst case scerio, so I am worried about finding out something is seriously wrong with me. I also worry that the Doctor wont take my concerns seriously.
1	Never know what they're going to find.  Don't want to be misdiagnosed or know that I'll have a life altering event.
-1	I feel anxious or worried because I feel like I can predict what they are going to say. They are going to talk about how I need to lose 20 pounds and they will ask me questions about my lifestyle and recommend ways to lose weight.  It is a sensitive topic for me and I just don't want to talk about it, let alone with a stranger.
1	Just the fear of finding out something is wrong. I don't want to be or a some incurable  disease I have a family I want and need to be here for
1	waiting on what they doing to say or do to me  or the way he or she looks at you and what they read online when they talk to my mom in the language I don't know as well as i should
1	I am a bit (at least) out of shape and I have concerns that visiting will cause me to work on too many things that I know I should.  Lame, I know but I can live with it alright for now.
1	Because I either wants it to be over with. Or am worried about the outcome. Because these can be really bad 
-1	I really don't feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor.  The only issue I have is that I had a really bad experience with a doctor in the same practice and I don't really like to see him.  If I do, I just pretend that he isn't there. It is so worth it to see our current doctor that I will deal with seeing the other doctor for a minute or so when we are walking to the exam room.
-1	What makes me anxious about visiting a dr. appointment is the wait. I see and hear sick people and worry Im going to get what they have. I also feel uncomfortable being in a confined space with people that I know are sick
1	My blood pressure results, first off. It always runs really high. And I hate to see my weight because I really need to lose about 15-20 pounds. Also, they always ask me about smoking and drinking, of course, and I am a little embarrassed by how much I do of both because I know that should be less.
1	Scare of what Doctor may say that a person may not be taking care of themselves right. May say tat you are not taking your meds right. That you may gain to much weight. Your blood pressure may not be right. Maybe eating poorly. 
-1	I was waiting to get test results back for in STI AND STD and I was nervous because I've heard people in past have gotten things and had no symptoms. What made me nervous is how many days it would take to get results back from my pap smear test. 
-1	The news i may get of something not being normal after was collected for further testing i think would be worry some 
-1	In all honesty nothing makes me feel worried or anxious about visiting my doctor's office. I usually look at it as going in to take care of a problem and that's it not much else.
-1	The most frustrating occurrence is the never-ending rotation of doctors.  It seems every year, (interns) I have to go through my entire history again.  Including, family, life, medical, etc.  Then, a new diagnosis, new medications, and so on, and so on.
1	I get scared because I worry about what might be wrong. I get all worked up about it. I'm worried about having to take a new medication or if there might be something seriously wrong with me. It really freaks me out.
1	I want to live forever, but as I get closer to 40, I've had a few more issues.  I hate that I now have to start getting rectal exams and things like that.  I just don't ever want to get bad news.
-1	When I visit my doctor's office, I do not feel worried, unless I am experiencing symptoms that are new and I am uncertain as to the cause of the symptoms.  
1	They are going to tell me that I have a serious health problem l. I also hate needles so I do not want to get shots 
1	Well, after examination you never know what will be the results. For that reason you definitely going to be unease and I know myself I'm kind of always worried about things that I don't know
1	Going to a doctor could always mean something bad. You never know what you're going to find out when you're there. So it makes me fearful every time I go to one
1	You just never know what is really going to happen if you have as many things wrong with you that I do. I hate going and get all worked up everytime I have to go. I just hate it more than I can Write.
-1	Typically. I do not feel terribly worried or concerned when going to the doctor. The only time that I really had concern was when I had a biopsy done, and then when I had a surgical procedure. Other than those times, I typically do not worry.
-1	The unknown. Plus, when a doctor has to touch me, sometimes that makes me feel uneasy.
-1	The idea that a stranger is going to examine me and that he has the ability to diagnose me with illnesses or a clean bill of health.
-1	I just don't like that you set an appointment and are on time but your time is a lot less valuable then the doctor's.  I understand things run longer or sometimes something comes up .. but the wait times are just ridiculous.
1	I don't always know what the doctor is going to tell me when I am there for a visit. There is no way of telling and they can sometimes be very blunt when telling you things that can really upset you. Once again, it goes back to their insane workload and the fact that they don't really have the time to form a genuine rapport with their patients.

In addition to the pain and swelling there was a very aggressive rash on both feet. After sitting in the ER for hours, the doctor told me I had athlete's foot. I followed his instructions and took the medications and one weeks later the condition only got worse. I went to my physician and was then told the problem was an extension of my eczema and that he would put in a referral for me  to see a dermatologist. After a few reminders and months later, I am still waiting to see a dermatologist.

1	Unless it is for my annual exam, that means I am going to see her because I have a problem.

1	I'm not sure there's anything specific. The whole visit is overwhelming. I'm nervous I won't get to tell them what's wrong. That they will be rushing and not listening to you. If you go for a physical and tell them things that have been wrong with you, you have to worry about insurance because it's no longer a physical. You worry about them overbilling because if you aren't requesting an itemized bill, you know they are.
1	I think its mostly because I'm worried that the doctor could find something that could be serious or fatal, but I think its just my worrying. I also sometimes I just feel a bit worried that something awkward might happen during the visit.

-1	Visiting the doctor's office, one usually feels apprehensive. The reason for this is that there's always a chance they can find something else wrong than what currently ails an individual. In other words, while I'm seeking treatment for one problem, I may end up having multiple reasons for my sickness.
1	not wanting to hear that there is a major problem looming in the future and the negitive effects it will have on hunting season
1	Just the fact that I'm going to or in a doctors' office gives me a sense of dread. It's not that I think something's wrong to something's going to happen, it's just that there is always the possibility.

-1	The examination, the feeling of the unknown, relaxing and being comfortable with the doctors and nurses. How you feel about the facility is it clean, equipped with all the right necessities  Uncertainty about the Doctor, is also a big concern, is he caring, is he in it just for the money. Picking out the right doctor, is very important, and 1 of my main concerns.

1	I don't want a bad diagnosis but not knowing is worse. That is why I go. I also don't want uncomfortable procedures done.
-1	I would say the only thing that really makes me worried is the chance that my doctor will have some bad news for me after a checkup. Something like cancer or another terrible disease.   
-1	Getting weighed 
1	I worry that there might be something more wrong with me than I was expecting.
-1	I fell worried that my physician may find out some new condition I might have and how that will affect my life.
1	I fear that they will find something seriously wrong with me, and they will want to prescribe drugs that have serious side effects.

-1	I am not sure what the outcome will be. Is he going to give me any news I may not want to hear.
1	That I might have something wrong with me that could be bad.
1	I'm always worried that the doctor will tell me something bad is wrong with me or that I need surgery or something to that matter .
1	It depends on what has been going on with me lately. I know when I haven't been trying to take care of myself in terms of diet and exercise and fear what the doctor will say about the results of some of those little examinations. If I also have some kind of sickness I've never dealt with before, I can start to feel fairly anxious. 
-1	I feel that the thing that makes me the the most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is the uncertainty of own's overall health. A person's health can change from one visit to the next.
1	I am just anxious and apprehensive when I go into new environments and have to deal with people that I don't know and situations that are uncertain, that includes doctor's offices.
1	"There are certain types of doctors that are just uncomfortable to visit.  I am fine with my eye doctor and sort of o.k. with my dentist but other doctors do make me apprehensive. I don't like being that ""vulnerable.""   This applies to general practitioners, chiropractors, etc."

1	I worry about my health issues and what the doctors may have to say about them. It makes me very anxious. 
1	The unknown of what is going on with me. 
1	I worry that I wont cover all the things I feel like I should talk to the doctor about in order for them to give me proper medical care and that the reason I wont is because I worry they will think I'm some kind of hypochondriac (although I see a doctor less than once a year, sometimes if you have a lot of concerns when you see them they seem to become pretty tired and dismissive as the exam proceeds.)
1	Just the uncertainty of what the results of what I went to see the doctor for and what I need to do to fix the problem.
1	The whole thing is anxiety producing and nerve-wracking. One of the primary contributors to these negative feelings involves my persol knowledge of how physicians frequently behave, think, and act i.e. their utter lack of genuine care or concern for patients, their tendency to essentially ignore patients and just drone on about whatever they would like to, and their tendency to behave like patients are a burden and infringing on their time. 
1	Im afraid what the doctor will find and what they wont find making a worse health condition then what i originally went in for
1	I worry that something is going to be wrong with me that I can not fix.  I don't like waiting in the waiting room or in the exam room.  I usually can't wait to get out of there.  
-1	I worst fear is that of catching a cold or flu from someone else that does not take the same needed precautions as I do. for example, washing hands.
1	"Even though I have a ""good"" insurance plan, I am in constant fear that something unaffordable will happen at the doctor's office. If the doctor decides to send me to a lab, imaging center, or hospital, it might be out of network or there might be some other loophole that will give my insurance company an excuse not to pay. A prescription might be on some arbitrary list causing my insurance to deny it. Even the doctors fees might be mishandled by the insurance company. There is no way to comparison shop or get an estimate of fees beforehand. As a patient I am at the mercy of a healthcare system rapaciously seeking to squeeze every possible dollar of profit out of me."
1	it is just a feeling I have always had doctors really do a number on me I really dislike going but I have to every now and then 
1	That I will have to spend a lot of money and I won't be able to afford however much it cost to pay off my medical bill, especially for unnecessary 
-1	Finding out from the doctor that I have medical condition is what makes me most anxious or worried.  The medical condition may require taking medicine or seeing a specialist.  I always feel relieved when I go to the doctor for a physical and it turns out that nothing is wrong with me.
1	I am not comfortable going to the doctor. With all the health issues in my family, I am always afraid that my problems will turn out to be something serious. 
1	Well I am an anxious person to begin with so just having to go to the doctor is already enough to make me anxious. Plus it makes me feel vulnerable and uncomfortable sitting there being examined, often times in that flimsy robe thing. On top of that there is the overall worry of what might be wrong with you.
1	I'm afraid she will find something serious and then I will have to make decisions on what to do. I prefer not to think about such things.
-1	I am getting to an age when physical problems seem to crop up out of nowhere and show up unexpectedly.  I am always a bit anxious that the doctor will find a problem even if I am feeling good.
-1	Well, this doesn't really apply; see, I go to the doctor when something is bothering me or once a year for my checkup. The doctor is there to help me, is my attitude, so even if I'm worried about some condition, I don't fear going and doN't feel very anxious or worried.
1	You never know what to expect when you go into an appointment. Usually you are going because something doesnât feel right in your body and that worries you. With the internet nowadays you can always look up the worst case scenarios and no matter how hard you try the thought of the worst is always in your head. This scares a lot of people before they go to visit the doctor and that sometimes includes me
-1	I worry that they might find something that I didn't know about and it is very serious.
-1	Worried they might find something wrong, requiring more surgery. I've had three major surgeries over the past 5 years.
-1	It makes me anxious to think about something being seriously wrong with me. That's my worst fear. Other than that the doctor does not phase me. 
-1	I am not anxious, but I have had a biopsy before and that did cause a bit of anxiety. In that case it was just hoping that the biopsy was benign and not cancer. The anxiety stems from unknown health problems that could be present.
-1	Telling me about a condition I have that knew nothing about, like having a lump on one of my fingers and find out that it is cancerous.  Cancer I my biggest fear.
-1	That the examition/treatment might be painful (such as the time when I had an ingrown toeil remedied).
-1	That I will be forced into a new medication that my body won't tolerate. 
-1	Nothing really, it's more if they make a face like I did something wrong or it wasn't going like they wanted.
1	Well what makes me feel anxious or worry is that they might find out something new wrong bc with me n I would have to take another pill
-1	"Just the thought of testing and needles.  The ""uncomfortable "" dr visits. Those sort of things.  Who likes to go to the dr?"
-1	I generally do not worry or feel anxious except when having to wait longer than scheduled appointment time to see the doctor.
1	I am most worried about what diagnosis they are going to give me and what I am going to do about it.
-1	
1	I'm always afraid something terrible is going to happen. Like the doctor will tell me that I have some terrible incurable disease
-1	I know I am a fairly healthy person I try to watch what i eat and exercise at lest three times a week, but even with all that you never know if the doctor finds something that is alarming. I never rule out a possibility of something bad occurring, that is why I try to limit these risks by choosing to live a healthy lifestyle.  
1	I think that my doctor will judge me, because I have to tell them everything.  Having to talk to people. Getting weighed on a scale. Potentially having to write down anything.  Thinking I don't have everything I need. 
1	I think that the time constraints upon my doctor visit. I don't know what to discuss with them and it seems that if I bring up too much, I may be charged for an extra visit. And, when I bring up something with my primary care physician, it will probably result in one or more referrals which I prefer to avoid.
1	I just don't usually trust people in general that easily. I also hate that I feel like there job is to judge my everything I do. I feel like many doctors don't follow their own advice which makes them hypocritical. 
-1	There is always a concern that the doctor will find something wrong with me that is serious.  He could discover something that turns out to be fatal.

-1	The thing that I experience the most anxiety from is the fact that there are other people at the office. I always have anxiety when being in the same room as multiple people. However, one on ones with the doctor or nurse doesn't bother me at all.
-1	I have never felt anxious or worried when I go to see my doctor. The only way I would be if he found something wrong. He has never made me feel anything but trust and loyalty. I am very pleased with this man
1	I feel most anxious or worried when it comes to what the doctor might tell me is wrong with me. When I am waiting to see the doctor, my mind starts to race with negative thoughts. While I understand the doctor is there to help, I would usually not be seeing the doctor at all if there was nothing wrong with me.
1	Staying in the room for a certain period of time for them to come and only give me medication just to see if it works out.
-1	I have arthritis and it is all over and awhen I get a check up I dread hearing what won't work or what I won't be able to do any more. I dread hearing about what can be done about certain eye problems due to my spinal condition called spondylitis and my migraines already have to wear tinted lenses even at night. Not sure if I will be restricted to day driving only or not.
1	Not sure what may be discovered. Not sure if the provider is going to tell me Im not taking care of myself. 
1	Getting my results some times worry me and nowing that I have not been taking the best care of myselfâ
-1	because they always want to give you more pills to tale all the time.i guess they think just keep pop pills.
-1	The inly reason I have worry or anxiety would be because Im not sure if they will tell me they find something or if they tell me that Im not living as healthy as I could be or should be.
1	As I'm getting older I am concerned for my health. Problems run in my family and I'm a smoker, increasing the chances of something going wrong later.
-1	afraid that he will find something dramatically wrong with me - afraid he might be upset with my smoking and weight
1	It's always nerve wrecking when I visit a doctor's office because I don't know if there is something wrong with me. Most of it is the wait after you are examined and waiting for the results to come to me.
-1	Well, I was nervous, when the doctor had to put his or her hands into my body and I did not like it, when he or she had to do something drastic to my body.Thank God that it didn't happen like that to make me feel hurt and upset.
-1	"I am usually not anxious or worried. I suppose I would be if I was expecting a test result that could possibly be ""bad news."""
1	when you have not been to the doctor in awhile you are worried. because when he tell you what wrong that when you get upset
-1	With my primary care physician, I am not terribly anxious. When I have to see a specialist, I get anxious over possible/probable necessary procedures.
1	I just worry they will find some major health issue wrong with me. 
-1	May never know what they'll tell or do to you. So it makes me feel those reactions. Even afterwards when you're done.
1	I hope they dont find something wrong with me I wasn't expecting.  I hope they have the answers I need
1	Mostly just the fact the person is usually someone I haven't met before because I do not have a stable family doctor, and also the cost. 
-1	I have a fear of needles, so anything have to do with needles makes me anxious or worried.  I don't like shots or giving blood.

-1	Nothing.
-1	I'm often worried that the solution to my problem will be complicated or very time-consuming/expensive.

1	When visiting the doctor's office, I feel anxious or worried about not being given a choice about anything that may be wrong. I also feel anxious about being poked and prodded as well as being told I need a needle to make me feel better instead of treating a problem, the doctor treats the symptoms.
-1	i would only feel anxious or worried if i went to an appointment with a pain or illness and was unsure about it
1	Any typical mortal man does not want to hear that there is something wrong. There is a certain inevitability for all men regardless of how much healthy for you programs one may ascribe to use
1	"I'm always worried that I will do or say the wrong thing and be a ""bad"" patient. I have issues with anxiety surrounding being a ""bad"" person or doing something ""wrong""."
1	What makes me most anxious is that I feel insane. Doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result. They keep telling me I'm fine and there's nothing wrong with me and making me waste time when I don't feel fine and need better medicine.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor.  I just tlak to him and ask any questions I may have but that is rarely.
1	There is always the possibility that they will either find something seriously wrong with me that will require a great deal of time and money to work on, or that because of their incompetence or indifference that t h ey wil l miss something.
-1	Just that I may have to switch medications or that something new will be discovered. That she will not be able to find or fix what is wrong. That she won't give me a recommendation if she feels it is not needed. 
-1	I am hoping to get the most out of my visit. I want to be able to be comfortable with my doctor for future purposes.

-1	I don't feel worried or anxious about the doctor about at all when I go I feel calm and stable and always stayed relax so I don't feel worried or anxious.
1	That things are worser than she is saying. She had no compassion and offered very little explanation and didn't want to take the time to further explain
1	you never know what a doctor is going to find wrong with you. doctors poke and prod and look into things that it is easy to ignore
-1	Hearing if something else is wrong with my health. Generally I go in when I need to fill a prescription or if I need a check up. 
1	Not knowing exactly what to expect and not knowing the outcome. I also don't like the environment and smell of a doctor's office and being around sick people. 
1	I   guess  ,   for   me ,  it  is   kinda   anticipation  on   what   the  doctor  will   be   telling   me,   with   hope   everything  will  be   ok ,  and   nothing   new   to   panic   about
1	Sometimes i feel they will find something they didnt last time. And other times i feel they will discourage me on one part of my health and make me feel horrible about my choices. Other times i just think something is wrong all the time by the way the doctor talkes to me so either way I'm worried all the time when going there.
1	Always worried that something I can't fix will go wrong. I'm like that with everything not just medical problems. Bring my car to the mechanic and wait anxiously until I get the diagnosis. Same is true of my health. I'm sick I go in to find out what's wrong but going to be anxious until i get the all clear.
1	When I go to the doctor and they take a long time to tell me what's going on. I also gets worried when I'm not sure about what my problem is.
1	Being told that I'm a liar, or getting fat shamed. Being blamed for most of my issues. Getting treated like an idiot. I'm really sick of it but it happens every time.
-1	there is no way the I ever feel that way when visiting the doctor, I'm old and accept my limitations and all my medical impairments. never anxious 
-1	
-1	When i have a upcoming doctors appointment i sometimes be fearful because i don't know what to expect
-1	not all the i feel anxious but when i'm see a doctor i get anxious about needles and worrying that i might faint or something
-1	When I go in for a preexsisting condition I some times get a little anxious about the results as the results can can because of life style changes
-1	I'm generally not a person that worries much about anything. Unless, I am in a great deal of pain or agony, I'm confident that there's nothing seriously wrong with me. Now, if there's every an instance where I'm experiencing great pain and the doctor can't figure out why, then that would make me anxious.
1	Going to the doctor in general just makes me anxious in general. I feel like it is all in my head. I sometimes think of the scenarios that can go wrong.
1	When visiting a doctors office it's usually due to an illness or something else that is wrong with me so it makes me nervous while I'm there. I'm nervous what could be wrong and the treatment that will be provided and I'm also nervous that hopefully the doctor is correct.
-1	I always have a slight feeling that there might be something seriously wrong with me. It is actually an unreasonable feeling but it still exists.
-1	I am mostly worried about long waits. I am sometimes worried about a possible diagnosis.I am sometime worried bout the doctor's mood.
-1	That I might get a bad diagnos8s I fear that something might be really wrong with me I also don't like needles so I am scared I might need to take a shot
1	I worry that they might find out I have a medical condition or disease that I will have to deal with. I am also nervous they might say I have not been taking good care of myself, like not exercising enough or not doing enough to watch my cholesterol.
1	I only have one chance to talk to him/her and then I have to wait 2 or 3 months so I have to write a list of all the things I need to discuss and hope I didn't forget anything
-1	Not seeing my doctor is not the problem. It is the actual diagnosis of what my illness is that makes me nervous.
-1	"One incident stands out from my 67 years - my current physician said ""we"" needed to check my heart again. Turns out I had a murmur. Subsequent tests revealed a mitral valve problem, which will be corrected via robotic surgery. That was scary for me and still is as the surgery has not been scheduled. Generally, I am somewhat apprehensive concerning new complaints (e.g, a mole). Part of my anxiety is related to having seen family members suffer with various diseases. For example, my father died of cancer at age 40 (I was 11). My mind tends to go to ""cancer"" when I have an otherwise unexplained pain. Generally, however, I find the typical examination to be quite routine and not anxiety inducing (except in the circumstances i have outlined above)."
-1	That my weight has gone up, that my doctor will judge me, that there will be some sort of bad news. 
-1	I have a severe social anxiety problem, so being out in a public place makes me anxious, but there's nothing about the doctor's office in particular that's upsetting for me. I usually feel more calm once I'm in the examining room than I feel before I go because I know I'll be taken care of.
-1	
1	Most of the time i do not feel anxious when i have a visit with the doctor. It is more a feeling of relief that I am in good hands
-1	Usually I go to the doctorâs office for a reason â recently I had a skin cancer diagnosis â so Iâm obviously concerned about the results of a visit. Also, Iâm kind of getting tired of the hassle of healthcare. I have a growth that needs looked at â I know thatâs going to be at least four visits. The initial visit, another visit to get the growth removed, another visit to have a follow-up (either stitches removed or just a wound check for healing), and another check in a couple of months to make sure nothing is growing back. Iâm not anxious about regular check-ups very much.
1	I have been to the doctor's office concerning sugar issues . I am most afraid of having to get shots a blood drawn, that seems to be the most anxious thing for me.
1	From the smell when I hit the door until I escape, I am anxious about everything. I trust them to a point but am always wondering what they aren't telling me which isn't really fair to my current doc because she is very thorough and takes more time than any other doc has ever spent with me. My blood pressure always skyrockets although it never is away from medical facilities but filly my current doc figured this out. I expect bad things to happen because of past experiences.
1	I'm afraid they're going to point out a medical problem that may be damaging to me. I'm unsure whether or not I can trust them to make the right diagnosis and prescribe what I need. 
1	Ready and destroy wife in Hamburgers cars every sodame leagle the money to pay and hit the money to Obama is history
1	I come from a family with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc, and I'm always anxious when I go to the doctor that they'll find out I have one of these things.
1	My child I'm always worried about him. I dont know how to stop my worry. I know things will be okay but I still worry alot
-1	I just don't like waiting. I am in pretty good health so I'm not really worried that something terrible is going to turn up. I am always a bit anxious to find out my weight since I have struggled with it in the past. 
1	I am afraid that they will find something wrong with me that will be difficult to treat such as cancer, or that they won't look into my health needs as much as I'd like them too
-1	"I do not feel either way, i feel more towards ""why can't we get to the heart of the matter without more tests or another presciption"
-1	I am sometimes anxious because they may find out something that is wrong with me that I am unaware of. Going to the doctor is just is a stressful thing.
-1	I am afraid that I might have a serious life threatening illness that cannot be cured. Also I am worried that I will have to take more prescription medicine.
1	Are they going to be honest? Is this doctor actually a doctor for the right reasons? Who can be trusted? Why can't we find a middle ground as far as chemical drug treatments and nontraditional healing?
1	I hate visiting doctors and having to take prescriptions and feeling old and having health problems I hate getting older
1	I'm worried that they won't look for what is wrong with me and think it is all in my head. I'm scared they might find something bad wrong with me and I'm terrified of having painful procedures and tests done. 
1	The unknown. I like know what's going on in a situation, and the few times that I do need to see a doctor outside of routine visits, it means something is not right and I don't know what's wrong.
1	I am afraid they will discover something about my health that will be negative, about which I was previously unaware.  Sometimes, I worry they will suggest preventative measures such as immunizations, with which I am not 100% comfortable.  However, in my experience, most doctors I have encountered are quite accommodating to different approaches (mine is more wholistic) to health, as long as they are working/workable.
-1	i feel worried that the doctor may tell me or diagnosed me something that can be dreadful and heartbreaking to hear
1	never know if he is going to find something wrong after blood tests have been completed.  I am comfortable with him just not  bad news 
-1	I don't worry or have anxiety when seeing my doctor. She knows my medical history and is there to help. 
1	im afraid i will get bad news or i will have too get a shot that makes me very anxious other then that i trust my doctor 
1	I am worried that my doctor will do a seemingly common test that will indicate i have a life-threatening medical condition that i was completely oblivious to.
1	I feel uncomfortable in general in a doctor's office. I feel worried about being touched by someone who is generally a stranger.
1	"After having blood work, I know my cholesterol is high and I know that he is going to ""lecture"" me about my eating habits which makes me very uncomfortable, he wants me to bring it down naturally."
-1	Nothing.  Except if I have to do surgery I may get a little bit anxious or worried but besides that I no problem going to the doctor.  
-1	The thing that makes me the most anxious is that they will diagnose me with something worse than what I expect.  Also, I sometimes worry they will notice something irregular that I didn't notice on my own, such as a tumor or heart conditions like high blood pressure.
1	The doctor may find something that will effect my life in a negative way or diagnose me with a condition that is not a promise me favorable outcome 
-1	How invasive things can be. That's what prevents me from going most of the time. I'd like to be able to discuss things with a doctor remotely (say, online) and then if a more invasive visit is needed we could arrange for a face-to-face. 
1	The potential that something might be wrong with my health, that the doctor will do a test that is uncomfortable or painful
1	I feel more worried if the doctor states that another problem has been discovered in my body. This could be the result of some laboratory tests which were redone.
1	Pap smears make me very uncomfortable. However I know they are necessary so I get them done. If there was another way that was more accurate and less invasive I would be for it
-1	I feel anxious being left in a cold room by myself for too long. It leaves me too much time to think and make myself worried
1	Finding out something really bad is wrong or thinking the doctor just doesn't understand or care. Doctors with bad attitudes would upset me and make me less likely to  share information with them. The cost of medicine or tests can also upset me or cause me to worry.
-1	I worry about the outcome of exams.The possibility of some life threatening condition causes worry, but for the most part I have very few problems with exams.
1	I am overweight and have high blood pressure. I am not exercising and doing things i should in order to get fit so i dread hearing that my health is not better because of my poor decisions. 
-1	sometimes I might be nervous if when they are doing tests if my numbers or info is not good and they might suggest more meds
-1	I worrie bc I have back problems and I have a lot of pain problems that hurt really bad sometimes I trust doctors
1	I am always worried that the doctor will discover something that could lead to something complicated and unwanted.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office.  I'm completely confident and never scared.
-1	nothing makes me feel anxious when visiting a doctor except the blood pressure that is the worst par t
1	Potentially having something life threatening wrong with me. My doctor missing something important. Having to take medicines with terrible side effects.
1	That she not listen to what i have to say. And that she just wants me to go to this doctor to that doctor. 
-1	I worry about my health in terms of weight and weight related conditions. I want to make sure I'm doing well in general and until my doctor gives me the results i feel a little on edge. 
-1	The times when I don't know what's wrong with me, or how much it's going to cost. Also if I don't know what to do after the doctor leaves the room (do I wait for a nurse? do I go to the checkout desk? do I just leave?)
-1	The thought of my numbers for my blood tests being bad are what worries me the most.
1	I don't feel worried at all, about visiting the doctor's office. I've been to the doctor's office so much, that I'm use to it, by now.
1	I think anytime I go to the doctors I always come out with 10 times more problems and issues then I came in with
-1	I don't know what can happen with the doctor or with the nurse. I get nervous just thinking about going to the doctor
-1	When i have unexplained symptoms that are on going. When an illness lingers for a long time. When my blood pressure is high.
1	I'm just a very anxious person in general, and I have white coat syndrome, so my blood pressure rises when I go to the doctor, which in turn makes the doctors/nurses worried, which makes my anxiety increase. I also get anxious that the doctor will find something wrong with me, which will have a negative impact on my life.
1	Making sure that all the bills are getting paid. Getting a better job with more pay, and better hours. 
-1	Being a fortunate 18 year cancer survivor, the return is always in the back of my mind.  If I have any symptoms that seem applicable - then I have an underlying worry or concern.
1	Thanks again for the kids are getting on with the pound today but will be able to make Shure to the hospital with my husband s aunt Sheila loves you too much to do with my husband is going well and that is
1	I get anxious about what medical conditions that the doctor might discover and the treatments that might be suggested.
-1	I hate the unknown, this is what causes so much anxiety when I go to the doctor.  My doctor actually tries to help the anxious feelings since she knows how I feel when I go.  I don't like surprises so my anxiety comes from not knowing what is going on or what will be done about it.  I wish I didn't feel this way so I wouldn't be so uncomfortable about going.
1	Fear that I may need to spend more money. Whether it's a follow up, a medication, or even just a test.
-1	If anything would make me anxious or worried about visiting the doctor's office, it would be the uncertainty of how long I would have to wait, what the doctor will discover, whether I can afford the treatment, whether I will understand and remember what the doctor has told me, and whether or not I am able to carry out the doctor's instructions. I am most afraid that I will not understand or communicate my medical needs.
1	My last few drs appointments have revealed some potential fertility issues. I am anxious about them.
-1	"I get most anxious about some ""hidden"" illness that might be found. My health in general is good, but sometimes illness just pops up on you. "
1	I feel that way some times just because I don't know if my condition is getting worse or better. I think it is some what normal to feel this way.
-1	It'll sound odd, but okay. It's extremely rare for me to catch a cold, but I always feel a little anxious about the potential germs. The main reason getting sick bothers me is that it'll get in the way of my weight training (and I happen to be a training stimulus addict). Ironically enough, nothing else bothers me...I maintain a single digit body fat percentage virtually year-round, and my doctor often comes to me for fitness advice ;-)
-1	I don't like appointments and I prefer to get them over with and move on with the rest of my day as quickly as possible.
-1	When I have an issue and I don't know what area of my body has to be checked. This happens when I can't quite explain what's bothering me Or having to explain what kind of pain I'm having whether it be  sharp, dull, burning, etc.
-1	I am agoraphobic. I also suffer from white coat hypertension (formally diagnosed.) I am much better with my current doctor.
-1	I worry about how long I'll have to wait because it means time away from work and I worry about how much it will cost because I don't have extra money. 
1	First and foremost, I hate going to the doctor office simply because I do not want to be around other sick people.  I'm afraid that I might pick up some sickness from someone else and then end up feeling actually worse than I already was feeling.  Also, I hate just sitting in the doctor office because it seems like they are so slow about calling you back to actually see the doctor.
-1	I usually don't get anxious.  They only times that I really am worried or anxious is if I know I am going to a dr. that doesnt listen to me or I think won't.  Or if it is for one of my children and I know something is wrong with them.
-1	the results of whats wrong with me 
-1	Just the process of going to the doctor.  I get nervous about giving blood and the overall exam process.
-1	I am a major hypochondriac. Every time I go to the doctor's I am convinced that I'm going to be told I have something fatal, even though I'm still pretty young. It gets me really uneasy, unless I know for a fact it's just a cold.
1	The number one reason for anxiety when going to a doctor is the cost. I fear they are going to recommend something I can not afford.Or find some form of cancer or something.
-1	I'm never worried when I go visit a doctor because I know that I am in a safe environment & if I felt worried I wouldn't have went to the doctor in the first place 
1	I guess, just the possibility that something could be wrong, or that the doctor will try to steer me down a path I don't totally agree with. However, it's best to address any issue asap. 
-1	hopefully my physical will not reveal any new problems and my existing problems are under control. the treatment i am getting is effective
-1	Last years diagnoses of cancer and then surgery and then a good diagnoses that they had caught it early.  That does make my appointments more stressful than before.  I think even before that that you wonder or worry more about your health as you get older.
1	The fact that I am getting older and sometimes I just never know that my health condition can always change 
1	I am afraid of needles so Im always worried about that. I don't like getting undressed it makes me feel overly exposed. Most of all im afraid that the doctor will give me bad news.
1	Once I am waiting over 20min I start to panic severely because the wait alone is bad - it is exhausting, then you kind of lose your momentum and forget to tell the doctor things which makes me more anxious - then I am fearful once I tell her my symptoms that she will tell me 5 different BAD deadly things that it could be and she wants to run a bunch of blood work and tests which then make me have panic attacks until the test day and then weeks until the results are in - the waiting for everything is the most difficult
1	I always think something is going to be worse than it really is. Always have been like that since I was a kid, and because of family members problems turning into major issues always makes me feel that way before going to the doctor. Afterwards it's usually ok news and have a good plan of action for what I need to do to get my health on track.
-1	if my doctor not there and have to see and another doctor i dont know . i get very and have anxisty , i do not know are trust the doctor.
-1	
-1	I do not  feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I am confident that things will go well and that evverything will be fine and dandy after I leave the office.
-1	I usually get my blood drawn when I see my doctor. He does it as a good habit, I suppose. I'm terrified of needles.
-1	"I always wonder what my diagnosis will be; I am a worrier and always ""WebMD"" things and blow things out of proportion. I look forward to meeting with my doctor because she helps to put things into perspective for me."
-1	I only feel anxious or worried if there will be bad results. Most of the times things are good, so I do not have to feel worried about anything.
-1	if it isn't something that is easily diagnosed then there would be cause for concern. most of the time it's a cold or a cough so not anxious usually.,
1	I have always been afraid of going to the doctor.  I am very fearful of pain and doctor's visits always has been related to pain in my mind. I think  I have phobia maybe.
-1	I was diagnosed with a sarcoma 14 yrs ago and I am always concerned that it may reaccure. I also have a family history of diabetes but I do not have it and that is also a concern. 
1	About my health I worried if I got a good bill of health and it makes me to want to find out if I do.
-1	Hardly ever but sometimes i will think the doctor is going to tell me that there is something more that is wrong with me.
-1	I worry about nearly everything, but that is one thing that I oddly don't general worry about.  I would say the only thing I might be slightly anxious about would be to find out I have something I didn't realize (tumor, heart condition, cancer), but that seldom crosses my mind.
1	I'm done writing pal, this is ridiculous for the pay.  
-1	I'm most worried about how long it takes.   Generally, going to the doctor's office does not worry me
-1	That he may find something wrong. Even though it would perhaps be able to get better, sometimes ignorance is bliss.
-1	Everything makes me anxious. i am naturally this way but my doctor that I am currently seeing is very sensitive to this and makes me feel pretty comfortable. She has a sweet and caring demeanor and is confident in what she knows. 
1	i worry that something is wrong withe me. i worry that they wont know how to help me. i worry that they will tell me bad news. i worry that they will tell me i am overweight and need to lose weight. I cant go to the doctor without being told that i am overweight.
-1	Their incompetence. I take care of a (non-family) disabled adult. Many doctors appointments are just terrible for them, because the doctors seem incompetent and inept. So that person doesn't want to see the doctors because they know it will be stressful.

-1	Im not worried nor anxious anything at this very moment at all not at all zero percent none of the way
-1	When I had gained weight over the winter and I get the spheel about being out of tolerance. Other than that I have no concerns. 
1	Fear of the unknown. I have come because something is wrong and I do not know the answer and I will have a long wait and this will be all I am thinking about because  have to reschedule my whole day to do it.
1	I'm a very introverted person.  I prefer to keep to myself and am usually comfortable talking with anyone outside my immediate family about health issues or mental health issues.  As such, even though I'm fairly familiar with my primary care physician, it still makes me a bit uncomfortable and a bit nervous, or anxious.
-1	I very rarely see my dr, except for yrly exams/bloodwork. I have always been very healthy, other than alergies to bee stings and asthma
1	just the uncertainty that something is really wrong and that is a bad feeling. im scared of going to the doctor
1	Every thing makes me feel anxious and worried when visiting the doctor because thats how i am around the majority of people

-1	I GET ANXIOUS AND WORRIED ABOUT STUPID THINGS. MY JOB, MY FUTURE, MONEY, MY FUTURE RETIREMENT. BILLS
1	When visiting my doctor for a routine check-up I'm generally calm and comfortable. I feel slightly anxious concerning lab results because that's what tells the true story. Visiting the doctor due to an illness causes the most anxiety because I know something is wrong. 
1	"I don't like the possibility of being diagnosed with something bad. I also feel like I will have to do my ""homework"" such as individual research and seeking second opinions before agreeing with what my doctor says."
1	Not knowing what he will find, and the cost of any treatment that might need to be done. My family has a history of health issues and I am afraid I might follow suit.
1	I get anxious or worried because I have to sit around other patients. It is almost like a social anxiety. Also going to wait, I get nervous waiting and feel like I'm wasting time and could be doing other things. So I just try to avoid the doctors visit if possible.
-1	Just the uncertainty if I have a major illness that is going to kill me
1	That the doctor won't listen to me, will persist that something is better for me against my wishes, and will rush my appointment.
1	was brought up not going to doctor unless it was life treating so now I see that I have a wonderful doctor to go to 
-1	If there is something wrong I am worried of the outcome, of any possible conditions or complications. Going to the Doctors sitting there mostly naked is the most comfortable experience.
-1	Getting test results for things that i'd rather not knows, for which if the results are bad it's totally going to be my fault cause I made bad decisions in  my past.
-1	I feel anxious and worried that perhaps someone will make a mistake that very well could have been avoided.
-1	I was anxious and worried that they were going to tell me that I was going to need surgery for my tonsils a few years ago because I had constant sore throats.  My PCP was able to make a great decision with me about not having surgery because it would not have helped in the situation.
1	fearing the unknown is always in the back of mind its been like this ever since I was a child and I have a few medical problems some of which are going to kill me in the end but Im afraid of surgery
-1	That the doctor may find out something wrong that I need to deal with.  Being a RN we tend to ignore some symptoms and I worry that I let them go to far.  
1	I'm about to find out that there STILL isn't a damned thing they can do for me. My weight is fairly stable, but that's about the only thing that is.  My diseases are progressive, and they absolutely refuse to allow me to use the only thing that ever helped.  
1	What makes me fell most anxious when visiting the doctor is the fear of the unknown. It could be something very simple or extremely complicated.
-1	I mostly worry that my condition may worsen or something else may come up and I won't have the money to be able to fix it.
-1	I am always worried about two things primarily. When I enter a doctor's office, and sometimes even before, I am slowed down by the thought of the total cost of the visit. I find it very taxing to my patience that I get charged for my visit to the center, and then I get charged for my doctor's time AND THEN I get charged for my prescription. This is all of course assuming you pay the school's insurance fee which is far higher than the govt marketplace plans available to the public. The second worry I have going in is that whatever I am scheduled to have checked out will be worse than I thought. I have an acute worry that if I go check myself up the doctor will tell me oodles of things that are wrong with me, which sounds scary honestly. I suppose the second reason also ties into extra bills.
-1	The time i have to wait to see him. The amount of medicine i have to take.  If the doctor disappointment in me.
1	I just don't like medical visits. You're vulnerable and not in control.
1	When I feel like my doctor doesn't know what he is doing and asking for you take this product and it's wrong. You pretty much get anxious and scared.
1	I don't usually feel anxious at the doctors office, it's tedious and I usually just want to be finished. I dislike going because I am not made to feel like an individual 
1	I don't like needles and there is always a worry that they will find something that is serious. I worry they will find cancer or something like that when examining me. I don't want to have to battle a serious health issue so I get a little anxious. 
-1	With American being diagnosed with various cancers at such high rates, being a Black woman the risk of various health ailments is quite high. A general check up could easily turn into a life changing event. 
-1	I am not usually anxious in the doctor's office. I know that there is not anything wrong with me health wise, so I am always confident that I am in good shape. Occasionally I get anxious walking in, but that is it.
1	Not knowing whats going on with me. They might not find whats wrong with me until its to late. But i hope they find whats going on with me.
1	Anxiety builds up after waiting for so long.  I don't like my arm being squeezed by the blood pressure monitor.  I am worried they will find something seriously wrong with me.
-1	Nothing makes me anxious about my doctor.  We have a good, relaxed relationship and I feel I can talk to him about anything and not feel any fear about it.
-1	I don't generally go to the doctor's office very much except for a routine check up. It doesn't make me feel very anxious or worried because I am fairly healthy and active for a woman of my age, and I don't see why anything would go wrong or if anything negative would happen when I am having nothing going on.
1	I feel most anxious and worried that the older I get he is going to find a life threatening illness. I fear that unless I lose some weight that he is going to give me some bad news health wise.
1	The thing that makes me the most anxious about visiting the doctor is not necessarily knowing my current health state. Knowing that something could be wrong with me makes me anxious. 
1	Am I going to have the issue addressed or will I have it out aside again.
-1	Anything involving needles. I have a HUGE needle phobia that has oftentimes prevented me from getting typical blood work or vaccines.
-1	
-1	 To hear about my health is key in my life. I'm somewhat of a health nut of sort. So, an examine is important to me. If exercise can help I'm willing to do it. If I need to change to my diet I can or willing to.
1	Shame, afraid that I will be judged for not taking better care of myself. Anxious based on past experience when the doctors wouldn't listen to me and couldn't figure out what was wrong.
1	Honestly, just the thought of having to go into the office and waiting. I have gotten to the point in my life now where I freely discuss health issues and concerns. 
-1	When I go to find out something is wrong I am usually nervous but for a regular check up I am usually at ease.
-1	That what I think is no big deal will turn out to be something a lot more serious. I also get anxious if I have to get a shot as I am not a fan of needles. I also get a little anxious being exposed to sick people.
-1	Walking into the doctor, you have no idea what is going on with your body. Sometimes you might need to do further study and look deeper into the body to see if there is anything wrong. There is always uncertainty if you go into the office with some kind of symptom that seems normal, but it could be worst than you thought.
-1	I fear that something will be wrong with me, that I will be sick and I won't know it, and when they find out it will be too late.  But that is just a general feeling and doesn't really have too much to do with doctor visits, per se.
1	I am always anxious or worried about receiving bad news. I never want to end up leaving their offices knowing that I could have done something differently, but now that I did not, I will suffer in some way.

1	sitting in a waiting room full of potential sick people. that he might charge me a unreasonably high amount etc,
1	I do get quite anxious when it comes to my health because good health is promised to no-one and the feeling of security can be snatched away in an instant with any bad news especially regarding health.
1	I'm just worried something will be wrong with me or that my doctor will say that I appear to be unhealthy. 
-1	I don't think I ever feel anxious or worried. I think if I did, the only reason would be if my blood work panels came back normal. My doctor always treats me with respect and I never feel apprehensive or anxious to go to the doctor. 
-1	I don't feel anxious at all. I am confident in my doctor. He knows what he's doing. He makes me feel comfortable when I come in to get my check up.
1	"I see a doctor for one of two things: an unusual symptom or condition, or an annual checkup. During the former, I sometimes wonder if my symptoms could indicate a more serious medical problem, or worry how long the condition might persist, even with treatment. In the latter, a ""wellness check"", I worry that I may have an unrecognized problem that will affect my overall health, or require extensive and/or expensive treatment. Since I am typically in very good physical condition, the thought of being ill bothers me a lot."
-1	If I have a condition or symptom that I do not know what it is caused by, I can get a little anxious or worried about it. 
1	I feel the most anxious about how much money it will cost me when I'm there. If I'm told I have a serious medical affliction, I practically have to accept my death. This is understandably unsettling to cope with, and thus I to an extent don't want to visit a doctor for this reason.
-1	I'm little bit afraid of bad news.
-1	I am always completely relaxed when I go to visit my doctor's office. He is very friendly and his staff always puts me at ease.

1	Every time i go with some pain, i am thinking the worst case scenario. I dont like going to doctors office at all.
1	What am I going to hear and what am going to take for what ever the problem is so I can be back healthy in good

-1	Mainly just my triage. I am concerned most about my blood pressure and my weight. Otherwise I am fully aware of my conditions so rarely do I worry.

1	don't like giving someone else so many personal details it takes up a lot of time and energy to go to the doctor and it can be expensive

I always go in worried about what he is going to say. "

1	My biggest concern is whether my A1C level and my cholesterol will be in the acceptable range. My blood pressure has been under control for quite awhile now as I have learned to manage my stress a lot better. Because I am getting older, I do worry that other issues may occur more than in years past and that things in my family history will crop up.
1	When I am visiting the doctor's office,the things that make me feel most anxious or worried is first of all, not knowing what the actual problem is and worrying if my ailment is something that could be quite serious.

1	When I'm going in for something and I'm not sure what is wrong with me, there is always uncertainty there with not knowing what could potentially be wrong with me. 
1	"I basically have ""white coat"" syndrome. Everything about a doctors office scares me. It just makes me feel like I am in danger even though nothing is wrong."

1	They will get me hooked on some medication that makes me worse and dependent on office visits.

1	I'm always afraid they will discover some terrible new disease I have to go with the ones I currently experience. 
1	The generalized anxiety feeling that something might be wrong with me. I always think they're going to tell me bad news, or that my health is not as good as it should be. I already have bad anxiety as it is so when I go to the Doctor for my anxiety specifically I am scared my condition has gotten worse or that they will physically find something wrong with me. I think everyone gets a little uneasy when going to the Doctor because it represents sickness and illness. 
1	Usually the doctor makes a comment about my weight.  I also worry if my blood pressure is high since it usually seems like that's the case when I go into an office.  At home it's almost always at a good level.
1	If the doctors says unpredictable things or some thing bad it scare me to see the doctor.
-1	More so the results of testing or the results for why Im there.

1	that my DR. will tell me that my health is deteriorating, that my diabetes is getting worse and that I will have to go on insulin
-1	I can't really say because it all depends on what I am going to the doctor for. I'm the type of person that doesn't worry much and I'm not very emotional so I don't usually get anxious to begin with. unless its the Emergency room, then its the bill they send.
1	Usually when i visit a doctor it is because of a health problem. I am always concerned that it will be something more serious. I also worry about costs and whether I can trust the doctor to offer the best situation.
-1	Not knowing the results of whatever ailment I have come to the doctor for or if they will truly be able to diagnose symptoms. 
-1	I ususally do not feel anxious. I have a pretty go with the flow personality. There have been time I have recieved negative news from doctors but that's just part of life.

-1	If i'm going to have a procedure done or a surgery i'm obviously going to be nervous and worried. That's always how it works for me. When going in for a routine exam i'm not usually worried, however.
-1	I'm worried about what the doctor will tell me. I don't want to be sick or know I'm going to die. I also worry about cost. 
-1	I mostly feel anxious or worried when I'm not losing weight or haven't walked as often as I should  which can effect my lab results, which the doctor can tell if my the cholesterol, sugar, salt and blood pressure numbers have elevated instead of going down.
-1	I am anxious to know what's going on and what can we do to take care of the problem. How long is it going to take us to get it right.
1	I just want to make sure my health is on track and no other aliments pop up. In addition, my goals include being preventive and living a healthy life style.
-1	The bill, for one. I can self diagnose online for free. We only go to the doctor to get pills for a condition we didn't know we had. I would rather die a horrible cancerous death than bother going on chemo or any BS like that. There are numerous altertive medicines out there that can literally cure this, but since big pharma says no, doctors won't acknowledge it. That's where the mistrust and anxiety comes in.
1	If the doctor seems preoccupied or spends little time with me and leaves my care in the hands of his nurse, that concerns me.  When his staff makes a mistake, that worries me.
1	I have already explained this previously.  I do not feel like my doctor spends enough time and explains things in terms I can understand.

1	The fear that something might be wrong.
-1	I am some sometimes anxious if I think I am overweight and not been eating or working out like I should
1	I never feel nervous going to the doctor to see about my health I just don't like needles because I never want them to mess up using them I hope they always pay attention to detail 
1	I am most anxious and worried when going to the doctors office because I am anxious that something will be wrong. There are several conditions that run in my family, like diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure and more.  Each time I go to the doctor, even for a routine physical, I am always anxious that this will be the time we find out that I have those conditions too.  I do not like taking prescriptions and therefore do not want to have to start taking them for life. 
1	I feel anxious because I am a person that is reserved. I am quiet so it is hard to open up to somebody. 
1	Sometimes I feel anxious or worried because I think of what it is that could be happening to me and sometimes it's the worst that I think it could be, also I'm not very fond of needles, so I have to try to calm myself down.
1	That they'll find something wrong with me or something like that or tests will come back positive....
1	i just do not like being touched by people i am not close with. i also hate waiting to see if something is wrong with me
-1	There's always some amount of concern and anxiety associated with getting test results, because you never know what they might show. 
-1	I have had breast cancer and am now always ready for the shoe to drop when I am in to see her.
-1	That they will find something unexpected that is detrimental to my health.
1	I think the fear that something might be wrong with me is the worst. The scary thing is that even if you think it's something small it might turn into something huge. I can see why people try to avoid it.
1	I guess worried that the Doctor may find something wrong or more serious than I thought. The uncertainty of going to a doctors office brings about a tension and I know that elevates my blood pressure. Some times a problem might be embarrassing to talk about and that brings about a feeling of anxiety as well.
1	I feel nevous because my doctor might find something thatsoon not healthy in my body and order tests
1	I worry that there will be something wrong with me, something that will cost a lot of money to fix and I would not be able to cover the medication or procedure. I do not going to hospitals in general so that does not help my situation at all.
1	I worry a lot that I am not being told what I, as an individual need to do. I feel as though there are very standard treatments and more often that not, these are not the best for every single individual.
-1	Finding out more and new illness that should have been found years ago. Having to wait for a long time when there's surgery involved
-1	The possibility of getting bad news causes a small amount of anxiety. It's also not the most comfortable experience to be examined by a person that's basically a stranger.
-1	I really do not get anxious or worried when I visit the dotor so this really does not apply to me at all. I am very comfortable going to the doctor.  
1	I am most anxious if they grab my nuts. I hate when they have to examine everywhere it's just uncomfortable and they need a new procedure. That is just wierd.
1	Honestly whenever I think about going to the doctor I am very reluctant just out of fear that I might hear bad news
-1	because i am not sure if i will ever get better an i tell the dr iwnt to get better but he says its a long journey
1	Because I don't want to have any surgery type of nothing.I already know that the outcome is going to be.
-1	Because instead of addressing the source of symptoms they usually just give you something to cover up the symptom while the underlying causes just get worse. And also because they are very time inefficient. I once had to sit in a room for an hour and a half with very excruciating pain just for the doctor to figure out my nose was broken, which i already knew but he didnt think so
1	I'm more worried they might find something bad that I wasn't aware of. This is more me worrying than anything as it's rare they find anything serious. Most of the time the problem isn't serious and they can treat it. I just kinda hold my breath when I'm at the doctor anyway, you never know if they'll find something you don't know about....
1	I do not like the possibility of being told that there could potentially be something wrong it me. That stresses me out a whole hell of a lpt
1	I'm always nervous on visits when I have to come to hear about the results of some test that I took. There are some health issues that run in the family that i'm afraid to find out that I have one day
-1	Like most people I have a big fear of a cancer diagnosis. So if something is out of the ordinary I am anxious until I find out it is nothing or it goes away
1	Pap smears make me very uncomfortable. I do not like getting ked in front of my doctor. I often leave the hospital feeling violated.
1	Doctors tend to have cold hands. that's the weirdest part about the doctors, is them having to touch you. I don't mind I mean they're just doing a job but its just weird. 
1	I feel most anxious when I know that my appointment is going to last a long time. Even when I know my procedure would only take five minutes, I know that the entire appointment will take at least an hour. I also feel anxious to get things over with. Anytime I go to the doctor I'm never excited, but who is. I don't know anyone excited for shots, pap smears, and sickness. In addition, I get worried that maybe I have some disease, particularly an std. I get worried that it may be something serious or incurable. 
1	I have been for several different exams and what bother me the most is, I usually know what the problem is and so does he but I dont really wanna hear what it is. The few rare times when I dont know what it is, Im worried about cost, and what I will have to do for treatment or if something new is wrong that I will have to deal with. You always have the dread of finding something new, when you think you know what is wrong, doesnt happen very often but when it does, it scares you.
1	I don't like doctors so it's the answer to whatever is wrong with me and whether whatever is wrong is going to be fixed 
-1	When visiting the doctor's office, I am most likely to feel anxious or worried about someone there making me sick.  I absolutely hate to be in small areas full of sick people.  If I could isolate myself in a little personal bubble/pod while in the waiting room, I would certainly not mind the doctor adding a few bucks to his rate to cover it.  Why don't you invent that and throw me a few bucks?
1	When I visit my doctors office what makes me feel the most worried is that I will be told that I have a chronic illness. I worry because both of my parents suffer from illnesses and I know that they are hereditary. My mother suffers from high blood pressure and my dad from diabetes. I want to avoid both of the illnesses for as long as possible, but since I am overweight I have a higher chance of developing any of these illnesses. Therefor on my annual checkups when I go for my results I do get nervous and anxious because I don't want to be given bad news. 
1	I don't like being touched or judged. 
-1	My doctor has a small waiting room and all the chairs are very close together. I'm not comfortable sitting in the midst of a sea of germs.
1	Just going to the doctor makes me anxious because I suffer from anxiety. I also get anxious and worried because I have the fear that they will find something else wrong with me than what I initially went there for. 
1	I don't like taken my clothes off and it worry me that i might have to and worry about that make me feel a whole lot of anxious and worry that they found something else wrong with me and I also feel a whole anxious about getting shot
-1	Sometimes I feel anxious or nervous when I'm getting a physical exam by a physician because I'm worried they will find something wrong. 
-1	Nothing makes me feel nervous about going to the doctors and I'm just comfortable with who I am and it will continue to be like that.
-1	Nothing much just that feeling comes out of no where fam mind your business please and thankyou and please
-1	Getting on the scale and seeing how much weight I have gained since my last office visit is worrisome 
1	finding out that something is wrong with my body.  I make sure to tell my doctor everything that is going on.
-1	I generally don't feel anxious or worried about visiting the doctor's office but I sometimes feel a bit stressed over what my blood pressure reading will read.  This has been something that I've worked hard to control.
1	Feel like I am going to get bad news or have a condition that is not covered by insurance mostly how much is it going to cost or what is in my future
1	Just the not knowing if anything is seriously wrong. Also visits are usually annoying because you have to wait so long and it can be hard when you are sick. 
1	sometimes things dont go well and you have to do things to make sure that they go well and this is sometimes stressful
1	Because of my age, I'm anxious that he will find something seriously wrong with me.  My blood pressure is usually high before I see the doctor but comes back to normal after.
-1	I'm only worried about catching someone elses sickness when I go to visit the doctor.  I'm not so much worried about myself...what's the point?
-1	nothing makes me anxious; feel confident and always welcome to ask questions if there is something I don't totally understand
1	I think I would mostly be worried or uneasy about not knowing what is wrong with me medically, and waiting for the tests to come back, or finish the doctor's examination before I can find out what is going on. So, it's mostly just a case of uncertainty or a fear of the unknown.
-1	I would probably only feel this way if I was worried about a really bad diagnosis.  I have been luck so far and nothing like that has happened to me.
1	that they will cause me more harm then good I have no need for  alot of meds thta cause other problems
1	I worry they might find something really wrong with me that requires hospitalization. Or possibly some terminal disease, for which there is no cure.
-1	I don't really get nervous that much. It's more about shots. I hate getting shots and i'm terrified of needles. That's really the only reason. Getting my flu shot was hell LOL.
-1	"I am most worried about the ""fear of the unknown"".  In other words, will the doctor discover something that I am not aware of.   I am not worried about taking any shots or vaccines - but more worried on what I don't know at this point about my health."
-1	I do not have any medical problems I do not visit hospitals or have a primary physician. I do not take prescription medications.
1	Well, I'm always concerned about getting a bad or not so good report. Therefore, I'm always a little uncomfortable about receiving the results of tests.
1	The feeling of being rushed and not taken seriously is a worry. Which leads to anxiety about whether the doctor actually paid attention or not.
1	That the doctor may not be taking the time to fully examine me or read my medical history. I don't want to just be a number and only have 10 minutes to examine, diagnose, and treat me.
-1	I am worried that my A1c levels will be way too high. I try to keep my blood sugar as close to normal as I can but have been having problems lately because I was taken off of a dangerous medicine Actos
-1	Was told that I  may have a lung disease that only affects Blacks and Asian. Later found  out lungs are ok.
1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I perceive that something during the appointment will cause me physical pain.
-1	just waiting for my turn waiting to find out results of meical test afraid of needing surgery and all expenses
-1	I REALLY DO NOT FEEL VERY ANXIOUS GOING TO THE DOCTOR UNLESS I GO THERE WITH SOME COMPLAINT. IN THAT CASE, I HAVE A SLIGHT WORRY THAT THE CONDITION MAY BE MORE SERIOUS, PERSISTENT, OR REQUIRE MORE ATTENTION THAN I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH. ALMOST ALL MY VISITS ARE FOR ROUTINE CHECK-UPS, AND I FEEL NO ANXIETY ABOUT THEM.
1	I'm afraid he may discover a life threatening illness and I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to handle the illness.
-1	there's the inevitable 'you need to be taking a statin' but that doesn't bother me much.  I know its coming, I know she's doing it because thats what the establishment teaches her to do.  my understanding of the issue, based on recent research, tells me different and the establishment it just lagging.
-1	I feel most anxious or worried when i visit my doctor's office because i am worried that he might find something else wrong with me. But i trust that he will know how to fix it.
-1	never anxious at the doctor's office...so used to going that it's like riding a bike so I am now very comfortable going on my own.
-1	I feel anxious most to find out my condition. I get nervous to see my results, more than how the doctor views me. 
-1	I feel upset if I am being taken care of by a PA/NP instead of an MD. I am wary of their diagnosis or whether or not they are able to give a better assessment than the MD.
-1	What makes me anxious about the doctors office is more so when they make you wait and wait in the examining room to see the doctor.  It's the physical atmosphere of the sterile environment that gets to me if I have to sit in that little room too long.  I'm not anxious about actually seeing the doctor because he is familiar to me and I trust him completely.  It's the equipment and the environment I don't like.
1	"Fear of the unknown when experiencing symptoms. More so a problem of ""How long will I have to wait today?"" for a routine physical examination."
1	My past doctor was really rude and not caring at all, made me dread going to a doctor. Not feeling I can trust my doctor anymore.
1	Well, having been misdiagnosed and, on other occasions, groped by doctors in an inappropriate sexual way (especially by 2 ob/gyn practitioners) has resulted in my being anxious and worried whenever I visit. One misdiagnosis nearly cost me my life--thank goodness I was able to figure out what was wrong--I then marched back to the doctor's office and demanded the right course of treatment. I have also been subject to Dr. Perverts--as in two ob/gyns who sought fit to check my breasts for cysts by groping them for long periods of times. One ob/gyn even closed his eyes and smiled as he squeezed my breasts and told me afterwards how beautiful my breasts were. Suffice to say, I feel anxious, worried and very much on guard when visit the doctor's office. 
-1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office for something that is not routine (outside of my regular appointments). It is the unknown that I worry about.
-1	I am usually nervous and anxious during my doctor's appointment. My blood pressure is almost always higher when it is being measured by the nurse. I guess I want to unconsciously be as healthy as possible and can sense judgement of some sort - or maybe it is all in my head.
1	Sometimes I feel anxious if I am seeing a new doctor. Depending on why I am going to the doctor, I feel anxious about test results.
1	Using my recent visit, I worry about the cost of the visit itself, the work they want done, and anything else (kind of like a lawyer's fees for responding to emails, or making phone calls) that needs to be done. That is number one. Number two, is just being told there might be things wrong with you when you feel like you are pretty good. It creates a psychological tendency to worry about the issue, potentiating the extremity of the issue.
1	I feel like everyone nowadays ends up with cancer or some other huge disease, even when symptoms aren't present. I am generally very healthy, but I do worry about the doctor finding something abnormal that may not have presented symptoms. I like to be in control and have a fear of the unknown. 
-1	I just don't like to go. I think nurses are worse about it. I dread it because I've been so sick and it brings back  bad memories.
-1	I feel the most anxious when I have to wait awhile to see a doctor.  I usually have other things to do, and my day does not revolve around seeing a doctor.
-1	THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO HELP AN ONGOING CONDITION I HAVE. AND I WILL BE IN PAIN THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH IT.
1	You never know what they are going to say about whats wrong with you.I only go to the doctor when there is a problem, I'm always anxious
1	I am incredibly anxious to begin with and I'm not a huge fan of going to the doctors. I hate the unknown, but I hate bad news even more. I also get scared of being judged by the doctors and nurses. 
1	I'm always aftraid that something will be found that is wrong with me when I perfectly feel fine. There could be something under the surface.
1	That she not going to find out what's wrong with me and won't help me get         better. I'm always disappointed when I leave her office
-1	I'm worried that I won't present my case or issues well, and that I'll be brushed aside. My doctor doesn't have intimate knowledge of my history, and I'm worried I'll somehow leave out information that would help them identify my problems.
-1	What makes me the most anxious is that I'm afraid my kids might catch a bug and get sick. Especially my middle son who has a PICC line so he can get sick very easily.
-1	There isn't anything that make me feel anxious or worried when I go to my doctors office, it is always a pleasant visit.
1	I have had family members that have lost their lives and one that almost lost her life due to patient negligence in hospitals. I am not at all comfortable with the idea of being seen by a medical doctor.
-1	When I first get into the doctors office there is a certain amount of anxiousness, just to think that everything is going to be good
1	I feel most anxious or worried when the doctor asks how I've been feeling lately, I also feel anxious or worried is when the doctor has a serious look on their face while looking at my health chart.
-1	I am worried that they will find something serious that is wrong with me. I dont think its a very rational fear because I am in very good health but it is something that always lingers in the back of my mind while i am waiting in the waiting room at the doctor's office. I usually just want to get in, get treated, and get out as quickly as possible so that I can go back home.
1	that a doctor doesn't have enough time to talk to the patient and/or doesn't really care about individual problems
1	The reason I may feel this way sometimes is because I may have taken test and I am afraid of the results 
-1	I am not worried or eacious when I visit the doctor.  I feel they can help. I look forward to any assistance they may be able to give me regardless of the diagnosis.
1	I am anxious about my condition, whether it is improved or worsened. Because I am really trying to take care of myself with respect to this condition, I am really worried if it is not working in the good direction.
-1	It's more just a general worry of could anything be wrong or irrational things like even though I'm on birth control is it possible I'm pregnant random things like that. Not so much an actual I am worried because of my doctor or any real possibility.
1	What makes me most anxious and worried when I visit the doctor's office is that the doctor will find something seriously wrong with me and I will have some sort of health problem that I've been unaware of.
1	That I will not be believed when I say I am in pain outside of the normal, that they will decide things about my health based on my appearance rather than my symptoms or not do the right testing because they think they know what my problem is without checking
-1	The potential for being diagnosed with something serious, I suppose.
1	I am worried the doctor will find something that is wrong with me and that I have health problems I wasn't aware of.
-1	What makes me anxious when going to the doctor is maybe finding out something that is worse then what i thought
-1	I'm mostly anxious about getting results for testing that was performed. I'm also anxious about talking to the doctor about something I'm worried about or concerned about regarding my body.
-1	I don't have at issue at all.  The only thing I don't like is like mammogram or pep smears that it could hurt.  Also fasting blood work could get me hungry.  Other than that I don't have any worry or fear.
-1	I dont like to give blood. I get dizzy so that bothers me sometimes. I also get anxious waiting for the blood test results at times
1	I am confident that I do not currently have major health issues, but I do struggle with extreme pain from a root cause that is not serious (life threatening). I get anxious when going to the doctor because my pain issues get dismissed due to my relative good health otherwise. I worry that my problem will never get solved and that going to the doctor is a waste of my time and money. 
-1	There are some good doctors not all are bad, but we must not put trust in doctors but only the Lord Jesus Christ
-1	I worry if the doctor may be right in the diagnosis and I worry that the doctor would prescribe a medication that would eventually harm me in the long term. I feel that the doctor only concern about making her quota for the day and would not give me the full attention i require.
-1	I dont feel anxious or nervous when i go to my doctor because he lays everything out in the opening for me and takes the time to explain it to me if i dont understand something
-1	I don't usually feel anxious or worried. If I do it's usually when I have a rare or odd issue that I am not sure will be diagnosed.
-1	The possibility if having to get my cervix checked , I'm pregnant , I hate cervical exams They suck !
1	I think I get anxious just because it is usually for an acute problem, so it was not something I had scheduled. It ends up making me rebalance my board study schedule which makes me anxious. 
1	"I am always worried about how much the visit will end up costing. If my doctor recommends or requires lab tests or imaging, I often can't afford to pay the bill. I have ""good"" health insurance, but in the US ""good"" health insurance still isn't enough for many of us."
1	I do not know the person and to get a check up I have to remove my clothes and the touch me. I do not like strangers touching me
1	Just the unknown. I tend to be a bit of a worry-wart, so knowing everything will be ok and that I don't have X, Y or Z is always a relief. As I ge older, I realize the difference between being vigilent and attentive to one's own health and being a bit paranoid.
-1	I am usually worried my blood pressure will be high but it is because I know the doctor will be judging it
1	what he will find wrong even though most of the time I feel pretty good. what tests he will have me do. because I work in the medical field with elderly pts like me I know some of them are painful
-1	when they make little noises that sound uncertain or unaware. when they tell you things seem odd or abnormal.
1	I am always concerned about finding out information that yields a high likelihood of having a terminal type illness or chronic condition.  I guess I openly feel like I have a chronic condition which cannot be helped without surgery and/or medication.  Both of these alternatives really cause worry for me.  I do not like medication at all.  I feel that the side effects associated with them increase the problems associated with my health. Furthermore, I know any surgery can turn more problematic so I would say it is the uncertainty that makes me most anxious.
1	I feel more anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because I never know what they may find. It is an uneasy feeling going in and having to wait and see what may possibly be wrong with you. It makes me overall nervous and my blood pressure rises a bit when I go to the doctor's because of fear of the unknown. What also makes me most anxious is the kind of tests they may have to do or if I have to get a shot, or blood drawn.
1	I feel worried when going to the doctor simply because I have no idea what may happen at anytime. I may feel fine but have gotten an ailment I didn't know about.
1	Invasive tests like rectal and pelvic exams that can be painful..  Long waits to be seen by doctor, after sitting in lobby or exam room in gown.  Office personnel who botch taking blood and cause painful bruises that last for days after sticking needles in multiple veins.
1	The cost is worrisome in addition to having insurance. Also, they mess things up and don't give me the hysterectomy that I desperately need because I have uterine fibroids and ovarian cysts. 
-1	i am scared of what my doctor might find wrong with me i am afraid the doctor will tell me bad news  i am worried thngs will turn out bad
-1	I feel anxious or worried when I don't know what may be the problem. I usually like to have some idea of what might be wrong so that I can ask questions.
1	I'm most anxious and worried about visiting the doctor's office when I haven't gone in a long time or haven't been taking the best care of myself
1	I feel anxious that I won't get the right diagnosis or that the doctor won't tell me preventative or natural methods to my health issues.  I don't just want a drug.  I want to know how to prevent my condition from getting worse and what natural steps I can take for my health before taking a drug.
1	Most doctors offices are terribly sterile and uninviting and don't foster any since of being a caring individual. It makes me feel like a piece of meat.
1	I just feel like the doctor might not take my opionions seriously and maybe rude to me. I also fear there maybe something seriously wrong.
-1	Just because one thinks he/she feels good does not necessarily mean that there is not an underlying health issue to be dealt with.
1	I feel anxious and worried because I don't know what's going to happen or what is wrong with me. I'm always worried something really nad will happen 
1	I am worried that my health isn't good. I am worried that the insurance won't do what it promised that it would do. I am worried about not having enough money to pay.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, is the possibility that he finds something abnormal during the check up.
1	Anxiety is one of my diagnoses. I get quite anxious before I get there. Long wait times to see the doctor don't help. The doctors that rush, specifically my pain management physician, and don't seem interested in listening to me leave me feeling misunderstood. I have to fill out the same 3 forms every time I go, but I'm pretty sure that they aren't looked over. So, when I see her, I feel anxious the whole time I'm there. I don't like changing doctors, so I continue to go there. I need her services if I want to have some quality of life.
-1	The amount of time the appointment will take and how expensive any new prescription might be are my main concerns. 
-1	
-1	It's only when I visit specialists or medical people I don't know that I feel worried or anxious. It's least, that's how I feel about it.
1	Just the thought that something could be really wrong with me and I can't figure it out on my own. I get anxious because doctors take forever to get to the point and they don't come right out and say what's wrong they try to ease it up on u especially if it's bad news  
1	Usually if I am seeing a doctor it is because something is wrong.  I am a natural worrier and tend to worry that it is the worst case scenario.  Even though I usually know deep down it's not the worst case scenario, I feel tense until the doctor tells me that.
1	I feel a sense of anxiety knowing I'm getting older and there's nothing that can be done about that even though I'm in great physical shape and even after all these years I can still say I hate shots
-1	I feel worried that I there should not be any major or serious issue with my health and I can should get complete relief after visiting the physician.
-1	I am anxious about possibly being seek, or needing a treatment. Usually I go visit during routine checkups, I am not very anxious about those. When I go when I do not feel too good, I worry about finding out if I will need a treatment. I also do not like needles, so if I have to get a shot, I feel anxious. 
-1	What makes me feel most anxious is not know if something serious is wrong. Also, there are worries about medical coverage and insurance. Costs of medical treatment also make me anxious.
1	I worry that something could be found to be wrong with my heart. Sometimes my blood pressure is higher than it should be when they test it. I worry that the doctor will think I am faking the physical pain and anxiety I feel so that I can get drugs from it.
1	Sometimes I just get worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me, and that I will need surgery or something too costly.
1	life it hard to unstand  in life and it take me a long  time to make what wrong in life to be all i can be
-1	I just don't like not knowing what's wrong.  Sometimes when I go to the dr I jump to the worst possible scenario of what my ailment could be and probably over stress about something that I don't need to stress out about.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I see my doctor.   I know that he and I agree on what I need and what I don't need.
-1	Wondering what the outcome of a prognosis will be can make me feel uneasy. Also worry about paying medical bills can give me and uncomfortable feeling.
-1	Would be worried or anxious for the results of any tests given by doctor at that time. Don't know what would come about because of it.
1	I always worried they are going to disregard what I am telling them or that I am making stuff up. I feel that there really not going to help with the issues.
-1	Nothing at all. If there is an issue there is nothing I can do so no need to worry or be anxious. What will happen will happen no matter how I feel.
-1	Worrying about what could be wrong and how it could affect me and my family's lives. Worrying about side effects of medications i might be prescribed.
1	When its times for blood work and knowing what you can find out I hate new things that's wrong with me
-1	Its the waiting for results that gets to you, especially when the nurse calls and tells you the results are in but won't tell you the rexsults
-1	I am most anxious when I see a needle for a shot because I have a strong physical reaction to them and feel uncomfortable, but I know it will pass
1	I get nervous around doctors. I am afraid they might find something really bad about me or it might cost a lot of money. I do not want to have to do any procedures or anything or they might be just judging me by my health, as a person not just a doctor. 
1	I feel most anxious at the doctor when  I have an unexpected pain that I need looked at. I get anxious because I never know what the outcome will be. I have a huge fear of cancer, not a fear of dying from it but a fear of having to fight it.
-1	I usually expect the worse. I usually find out my fears were unfounded and the problem is easily solved.
-1	I always worry that they will find something that is going to be a problem in my life.  I think I go in hoping for the best and expecting the worse.  But so far so good, nothing wrong with me yet.(knock on wood)
-1	Not knowing if there is a problem with my health that I don't know about that he might find that will need long term treatment.
1	I never know what could be wrong with me.  I'm most worried about not knowing what the procedure might entail, if anything will hurt, and if a new condition will be discovered.
1	Due to the fact Iâve already had 9 surgeries on my shoulder Iâm always worried I might need more. Iâm only 25 and Iâve had 3 shoulder transplants so it always makes anxious when I go.
-1	I'm never really anxious when I go to the doctor. The only thing that would make me anxious is if I was experiencing horrible pain but didn't know where it came from 
-1	
1	Just that I don't go very often at all, and I'm not young. Sooner or later, they are going to find something wrong. I also don't like getting undressed for anyone. I have major self esteem issues, and as I said, I am a very nervous person. 
-1	Nothing really. I'm very healthy and don't have any serious medical conditions. Only thing I hate is having to wait in the waiting room.
1	That they will find something seriously wrong with my I don't know about and that I may have to get an expensive treatment or my life is in danger.
-1	Feeling  that I am going to  hear  something that I am  not prepared to hear. Need to  change  diet.need to take different  medication. 
-1	I don't worry so much about getting a predictable diagnosis or treatment for a physical condition I have already noticed and/or need to have taken care of. What I worry about is whether the doctor will tell me it's worse than I thought or find something else wrong with me.

-1	I am most anxious about the results. I am scared that they will find a disease or condition that will affect my life. I am also anxious about how the doctor will handle my care. Third, I am anxious because I am self-conscious about my body.

1	I am worried sometimes when I visit that my weight will be more than the previous visit.  I am worried to he get onto me possibly about the weight.  I am worried that the blood work could show some issues like high cholesterol.  I am worried that the blood test could show high liver levels which could be fatty liver.

-1	I very rarely feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. I might tend to be a little worried if I am referred to a specialist.

1	When I see one of my specialists I am afraid she will find that something is wrong and that I will require surgery.  I have already had four of them for a medical condition I have.

1	That I will find out something negative or bad about my health. Not only would it be bad healthwise, but it would cost more money. And more medical bills is a nightmare in the US. 
-1	Not usually feeling anxious so I can't remember an situation or office visit where I did feel anxious or worried as I usually have a good outcome and feel I have been helped very much by the visit
1	I feel anxious because I always feel like he is going to find something wrong with me.
1	I just don't like the sterility and seriousness in the office. It's not because I'm afraid of what's he's going to tell me.
1	The fact that they could say anything. Anything could be wrong with me, or happen to me, or need to be done to me. She could ruin my life in one checkup if something is wrong with me.
-1	I feel anxious or worried that something more serious may be wrong than is really the case. I also become anxious about the possibility of having to get any additiol tests given to me because often times my doctor's office is not very quick about getting results to me, so I will wait and worry about test results. 
-1	What makes me feel anxious is not knowing rather I did good of bad when it comes time to check my diabetes and what the results will show.  I dont follow what i am supposed to be doing on a regular basis so everytime i usually get anxious about it and what my doctor will think. Also when going to the doctor sick people are in there and i dont want to catch what they have like strep, cold or even worse this years Flu. 
1	You just never know what you are getting into or what you will be diagnosed with. It's always fearful not knowing what you're about to hear, especially pertaining to your health.
-1	Sometimes I feel anxious or worried because I don't know what to expect. I'm worried about the potential prescription that the doctor will prescribe me
1	I usually do not have anything serious wrong with me so that is not a worry. However, I am always just a little bit afraid that they will find something new is wrong with me that I didn't even know about. I know this is not likely but it is still a fear of mine. 
1	Me personally, I have social anxiety disorder. So I feel uneasy just leaving my house. I feel like mine gives the most worst case scenario much of the time. I end up worrying a lot until they get the test results back. I have been told I might have cancer. False alert. I was told I have diabetes and had to stick my finger twice a day for a year. Just to have another doctor tell me I didn't have it. etc.
1	In the back or my mind there is always that idea that I could have some life altering disease that the Doctor will discover.  Because of my family history, I have a fear that I will develop some sort of cancer, and he'll find it, and tell me I'm termil. 
1	I always worry that the doctor I'm seeing won't be attentive to my needs. I have encountered several doctors that seem to have a script that they recite, no matter what ailment I'm being seen for. I worry that the visit will not accomplish anything, and it makes me feel quite helpless.
-1	When it is time to have lab work done. My veins are very small, whenever they can find thema nd it also hurts
-1	Worried that she might give me a diagnosis I didn't expect but so far she's been up front with me about my health 
-1	when the exact outcome is not known I will become a bit worried .  Not all medical concerns have a concrete ending
-1	There is always the risk that something could be found that was not foreseen, but on the whole this is not how I typically feel since I lead a relatively healthy lifestyle.
1	Whenever I visit a doctors office I feel most nervous that the doctor is going to tell me to do something which will not help my condition or better understand my condition but instead just prescribe whatever is most fashionable or lucrative for himself. I am concerned that my best interest will not be taken into consideration. I am concerned about harmful and poorly understood medications being prescribed to me. 
1	to hear the fact that something is wrong like, having cancer or something even more seriously life threating, or having an accident and major surgery is required.
1	when the doctor is not confident about his diagnosis, i feel very anxious because I dont really  know what i have
1	I just hate going there I've always been that way. It's kind of hard to explain. The doctor isn't a big deal but the nurses and assistants are different all the time and do different things like look at different things I don't think really matters. Then there expressions change and they say nothing so this makes me anxious. So pretty much the whole thing I hate, I'm just always happy to get out of there.
-1	What makes me feel the most anxious are the long wait times, wondering if whatever I need will be covered by my insurance, wondering if any illnesses are genetically predisposed to are appearing
1	Number one is that they will find something wrong even if I am there to treat something minor.  I will be nervous and worried and then it will most likely be nothing, a mistake.  Or the treatment will do nothing for me.
-1	I just generally feel this way whenever I am out and about, doing things. I am a bit shy so I get nervous when I'm interacting with a lot of people.
1	That they might find something seriously wrong with me that I was not expecting.  Hoping everything is normal
1	just the uncertainty of things, knowing that you may just be going in for a general checkup that is somewhat easy but you can come out with the most shocking news. Also the cost!!!
-1	What makes me anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office is them finding something that is seriously wrong with me. In some degree, everyone fears dying and living a lifestyle where they virtually have none. I do not go to see a doctor very often at all and when I do, It's usually for something pretty serious. Therefore I worry a bit because I obviously do not completely know how the outcome may be.
-1	The only thing that makes me really anxious would be getting shots or have blood taken.   I am in relatively good health so I don't usually have health problems so I am not usually worried when I see a doctor 
-1	nothing unless I have pains in my body which I can't explain. then, my doctor will have to find out the causes and future remedies.
1	What makes me most anxious about a doctor visit is two-fold: the thought of finding out something dreadful is wrong OR that nothing is wrong and I look the fool. 
-1	The anxious part is just the exams in general. I don't have great health insurance so if they find anything wrong I couldn't be able to afford it.
-1	Anxiety or worriness is not really an issue. But being realistic if a person may require needle shots or blood draw, sometimes its difficult to get used to receiving those treatments, but you know you have to do it if it is required.
1	I feel nervous and anxious because I don't know what will happen. I tend to get scared of the unknown.
1	Sometimes I feel like everything is alright, but crazy things happen all the time. Far of the unknown worries me the most.
-1	I don't really feel anxious about visiting the doctor, I feel like I am wasting my time. I'm not worried either.
1	They will tell me what I am doing wrong based off of what other people in my race do. A doctor told me to stop in fried chicken when that is something I rarely eat. Not all people of color eat or like fried chicken.
-1	I AM NOT ANXIOUS OR WORRIED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IS EQUAL TO OR WORSE THAN THE LEGAL PROFESSION. YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
-1	When they talk to about getting shots and when i hear screaming from the other rooms also when they ask me if im sexually active 
-1	Nothing makes me anxious or worried when I visit my physician. She always make me feel at ease during my annual checkup.
1	I am most worried about the bill.
-1	I don't always speak up for myself, especially with a new doctor, so it makes me anxious that I may agree to a treatment/medication/etc that I don't actually want to go through with.
1	I am always afraid even if i  am doing  everything right that I'm going in and they are going to tell me bad news. I have what they call white coat syndrome and it makes me feel bad. 
1	i feel that way only because I feel Im only wasting my time. I go every 3 months and its the same thing.Meanwhile Im still in the same shape for 11 years now
1	I feel worried that something might be wrong with me and don't want to find out the bad news. I also don't like showing my body to my doctor. It can be very awkward.
1	I'm always afraid that I will catch something there. I also, feel anxious that I will have a bad test result. I worry they will find something seriously wrong with me. 
1	I sometimes feel somewhat anxious or worried about my general health profile and whether or how much my health might be declining or how much I might be developing risk factors for future problems.
1	I'm always worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me that I didn't know about or that the doctor will criticize some part of how I live or what I should or shouldn't be doing with my life. 
-1	I just think going to the doctor isn't a fantastic day also does make me a little anxious for no real reason
1	I be worried about what they will say. I don't know what they will say is or is not wrong with me. The result worry  me the most 
-1	Although I have been diagnosed with high cholesterol & diabetes II, I am not overly anxiuos or worried when I have my checkups
1	When I go to the doctor, I find myself far more concerned with the costs associated with being there than I am with my actual health. I feel like I constantly have to decided between taking care of my health and mainting fincial security. Knowing that medical procedures can be very expensive causes me serious anxiety and stress.
-1	Sometimes if I need bloodwork done I worry about the results, but other than that nothing really upsets me. 
-1	I get anxious or worried about what kind of pain I will have to endure. I hate pain and usually at a doctors office I know I will have to experience pain.
-1	I usually do not feel anxious or worried.  I have not had any serious health issues to date.  I sometimes get a little anxious waiting for blood test results.
-1	There really was nothing that made me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. If anything, the only unpleasant part about visiting the doctor's office is the wait.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious at the doctors office. I take any of the bad news to come with stride and try and have a positive outlook whenever I visit the doctors office. I do not fear checkups or any examinations.
1	What makes me so anxious and worried is a lot of different things . The one that bothers me the most is getting shots . I hate shots so much to the point where sometimes I can barely breath and feel like I'm going to pass out. I mean literally I get hot and breath real heavily . Then I don't like to see needles because they scare me especially if there big. I hate to get my throat swabbed by the doctors because I literally feel so worried that I'm gonna choke out. The feeling of it makes me gag to the point where I'm red . The last thing I hate is getting blood drawn I just hate it . I hate where doctors can't find my vein and they have to keep poking me . I just hate it . I really dislike the things they have to do . 
-1	I just always wonder if he will find something wrong that I don't know about. Maybe something has changed in my bloodwork that I need to take care of 
1	Finally finding out why and what makes me hurt so badly, just like i did a few weeks ago. Take it from someone who has lived mainly with no health insurance ( just got into Waterman clinic) it's a scary place sitting on a chair after decades of pain about to get answers. I am scared and grateful all at once.
-1	I used to get anxious and worried, but not anymore. My doctor has given me the trust and the confidence that everything is alright and that everything is going to be fine.
1	What makes me feel most anxious is being misdiagnose with a terminal disease like cancer or HIV when i never really had it. I'm scared to get vaccinations when i'm healthy because i feel it will only make me susceptible to those diseases. I believe the only thing that gets sick is your mind and if i begin to feel helpless due to a misdiagnosis, my immune system will get weaker and the virus will be easier to take over my body & emotions.
1	Because I only get to see a doctor when there is something wrong, I am always waiting for the bad news.  I need to see a specialist or I need to go on a new medication which I probably won't be able to pay for.  So, that just puts more stress in my life and makes me anxious at the doctor's office.  In many ways, it's just less stressful to live with whatever problem I have and not go see a doctor who will just tell me about the problem that I can't do anything about because I can't afford the co-pay.
1	I'm typically at the doctor's office when I'm not feeling well or something is wrong, so I feel anxious or worried about what the diagnosis or problem will be.  Depending on the issue I might also feel worried or anxious about the potential testing or treatment (if it might be painful, etc).
1	When I am going in for a procedure that I have never gotten before and it is serious enough to where you can potentially be told you have something long term or untreatable. 
-1	I feel noxious when going to the doctor because I don't know what to expect and I don't like hearing bad news
