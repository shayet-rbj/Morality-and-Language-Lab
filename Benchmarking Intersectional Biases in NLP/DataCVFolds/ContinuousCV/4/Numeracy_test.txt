I looked up problems with the epididymis and found, unsurprisingly, that there is a condition called epididymitis, and I knew right away that ""-itis"" means that something is inflamed, so I knew from the name that I was experiencing an inflammation of some kind. I went to the doctor who confirmed the diagnosis and gave me an antibiotic.

In my late 20s I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and that was when things began to go downhill health-wise.

I then paid for a std test at my University Health Center and I tested negative twice, to which I was very happy. In my opinion you don't need a doctor, it's just 99% of people (including myself) will never share the same knowledge as one and medicine in it's concentrated forms can be very hard to dose and apply to select cases. I am glad doctors are around, as anything more complicated than the pills would be beyond me.

0.928600	I don't have any extensive training or education on health or medical issue. My experience is very limited to just what I learn on the internet and from my doctor. Basic diagnosis of a typical cold, fever, flu are very simple to figure out. Any abnormal pain in the body will require a doctor visit. If it's just something I am not familiar with, a visit to the doctor will usually answer the question.

0.928600	My mother had a stroke; the treating physician considered administering TPA to reduce the chance of further damage due to clots that blocked blood flow. I knew TPA could reduce clotting so much that bleeding could occur in the brain. I and the doctor weighed the risk of continued brain damage due to clots versus potential damage from bleeding and agreed to administer TPA. She did not suffer any additional mental episodes during that treatment.
0.857143	I found out that I have three different blood clotting disorders after I was diagnosed with blood clots in my lungs twice in six months. At that point, I started to read up on the blood clotting disorders, blood clots and health information in general.

0.785714	When I was 20 I had opitnuritus.  I was told that might be a precursor to MS.  I again had it at age 26 and 36.  At age 39 I was diagnosed with MS as result of a spinal tap as MRI's were not yet readily available.  No drugs were available.  When they were available 3-4 years later I had had no relapses so neurologist recommend no treatment as side effects were bad.  I have had only minimial direct symptoms in 33 years but many autoimmune disorders so I understand taking care of ones health, watching symptoms and being grateful for every day that one is in an upright postion and walking.
