Instead, I sought a second opinion after doing extensive research and located a physician in a neighboring state willing to do the surgery. We arranged for the testing to be done locally and results were forwarded to him. We drove in, and the following day did a pre -surgery eval.

It was a very painful recovery but with the help of therapy I made it. I am thankful.
1	I was seriously injured when I was 24. I subsequently had to go through many tests and medical procedures which has given me much higher than average knowledge of doctors and medical procedures.

They were unable to help me - I was beyond their scope of help to offer - so they referred me to a local clinic and set me up to get medi-cal, the local medicaid.  I was told that I needed the joints in both hips replace so that process began.  After the second hip replacement, it soon became infected so I was back for another operation.  The surgeon was one of the best and the room I was taken to was more industrial.  The terms and drugs I was given were really something and often confusing.  This really isn't in my wheelhouse!  I've had a few minor things happen since then though most of my issues are resolved now and I can walk again!

Her brain swelled up and there was a medication that could be given her to lower the inflammation on the brain but she had diabetes and this will increase the glucose level. She was 75 years old and I expl to the doctor that based on what I read online the chances of her going into a diabetic coma were almost none. Based on what I read there is a little chance of a person with a high glucose level who is over the age of 70 going into a diabetic coma almost non existing and also she was going to die anyways, the tumor was not operable and it did not respond to radiation.

1	One experience that demonstrates my knowledge is understanding terms given to me by my doctor when he was explaining my hypertension diagnosis.

I once got pregnant while using an IUD and being on the pill. I had an intrauterine and an ectopic pregnancy at the same time. They always teach reproduction at the end of anatomy and physiology courses (6/6 times for me it was at the end) so it's usually rushed and cursory, so I needed the doctors to explain a ton to me. Like I didn't know that ectopic fetus' (feti?) don't grow at the same rate as intrauterine ones.

-1	I have Gerd and as such done extensive research.  Even with that I am continually learning something new.
-1	A time I can think about that demonstrated my knowledge about a health issue is when I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. After I was diagnosed with high blood pressure, I went home to do some research on things needed to lower my blood pressure other than medication. At the time, a doctor I had did not tell me to make any lifestyle changes, instead just put me on medication which had me sleepy all of the time. A few months in, I was taking my medication and came to the doctor and got it checked and it was normal. The doctor asked if I was consistently taking my medication and I also explained that I was also making healthier lifestyle changes in which he was very surprised.

-1	Back in 2009, I was getting dizzy spells where the room would just spin and spin all around me without any warning. After I had collapsed to the floor, an ambulance had arrived where I was taking to the hospital and it was there that the good doctor had diagnosed me with having vertigo. Since then, I've been managing it by taking medication. And though from time to time I may still receive slight moments of blurred vision & the occasional dizzy spell, I'm still managing and doing a whole lot better today, than I did 5, 10 years ago.

-1	being in the hospital for surgery and diabetic ulcers and watching and observing
1	In 2013, I went deaf in one ear after blowing my nose. I waited a week to see if it would get better. It didn't. I realized the cause was actually an infection I had had a decade earlier that never completely went away. A small participle of infection had remained in my sinuses for a decade, then moved when I blew my nose. If I hadn't figured that out, and relied upon a doctor to figure it, I might have have had the infection inside my ear pop my ear drum or worse.
1	I've broken fingers and toes and splinted them myself, I've dressed wounds, I've given myself stitches. I'm former law enforcement and also a certified first responder and CPR card holder.
1	At one point, I was experiencing a band headache, shooting pains in my left arm, and a pain in my chest.  I got to an emergency room of the local medical facility as fast as was practical; I warned the admitting nurse -- and was moved immediately to examination.  It turned out that my blood chemistry was perfectly normal (I had acid reflux -- which, according to the attending ER doctor, could mimic a heart attack).  But I took the correct action, given the symptoms observed (get to the ER immediately, and clearly identify the symptoms).
1	When playing hockey there have been times when I knew if an injury was serious or not.   It comes with age and experience and not just levels of pain.   When you learn your body you can tell when something is really not right or is just a soreness that will go away.
1	My last place of employment did not even have a basic first aid kit. I carried a trauma kit in my car. So, anyone that had a minor injury came to me for assistance.
1	My then-12-year-old daughter ate a brownie and broke out in hives & started wheezing. I gave her some Benedryl, and took her to the emergancy room immediately.  Turns out, my daughter had developed an allergy to tree-nuts. My husband is deathly allergic to eggs, so I had an idea of what a food-allergy reaction looked like & how serious it COULD be.

1	When I went to a doctor last year about painful anal fissures and haemorrhoids, I was already pretty well informed about them. This was due in part to having researched them in the past, both in how they relate to poor diet and how they can be caused or exacerbated by anal sex.

I went to my primary care physician who referred me to a specialist.  The specialist told me everything is normal, and prescribed a strong acne cream which damaged my skin, but also helped with the acne.

-1	My back was aching me for days on end.  I took it upon myself to self diagnose the situation, looking online for ways to ease the pain from a tural and holistic way.  I knew that a doctor could not magically make my pain disappear, I had to do something for myself.  I iced the location of the pain and began an exercise regimen to begin the healing process.  I knew what I was doing and what needed doing and I did it.

1	When my wife was pregnt I felt like I was able to understand and comprehend all that was being discussed about the pregncy.

1	A couple years ago I was discharged from the ER suffering from abdominal pain, and other weird symptoms like high blood pressure, and no insight really given as to what was causing this given by doctors. On my own, I was able to figure out that diverticular disease was leading me to experience eventual high blood pressure, and that it got worse the more that I ate, so I could avoid this by fasting when I began to have these kinds of symptoms. That's more than the doctors figured out, maybe I should be a doctor.
1	I had once pulled a muscle in my chest just above my heart. I knew the pain and location and remembered it quite well. I visited the doctor and he informed me it was a pulled muscle.

He was panicking in fear but I calmed him down and told him to let me take a look. I placed two fingers and a thumb on the location of his chest and pushed hard.

That was a time in which I was able to help calm a worrying friend and demonstrate my knowledge of health and medical issues.

1	After increasing my exercise regimen, my shoulder started to hurt (like a dull pain and heat) during and after exercising. I took 2 weeks off working out and it got a bit better and then worse again as I started working out again.

-1	I was given a diagnosis that was contrary to what I have already looked up on the topic concerning the symptoms and it turned out to be what I had expected.

1	I started being seen by Dr.'s at a very young age, around 5-6, due to gastrointestil issues. Later, as a teen, I was diagnosed with mental health issues such as bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety.

I have had a broad range of medical experiences.

1	When I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia 20 years ago I started doing a lot of research in books and with people in general.  Doctors tried multiple medicines and I kept getting worst.

Now we work on just treating major symptoms instead of everything that Fibromyalgia causes and doing exercises.

-1	I have experienced not for me but family members health issues. I concentrated on learning as much as possible on those conditions and there treatments
1	It was when my doctor was asking me what I thought was wrong with me.  I had done quite a bit of googling and had went into detail, explaining the symptoms.  Basically, instead of saying it hurts, I am able to constantly explain exactly where, how much, and that type of thing.  I am able to coherently explain my condition to any medical person, to better help them diagnose me.  I feel that is a kind of knowledge of medical issues.
1	I was having trouble going to sleep at night which is very unlike me. Usually I fall asleep within five minutes.

-1	A client recently informed me that her daughter didn't seem herself. The daughter recently began receiving chemotherapy and was nothing eating. Loss of appetite seemed like a typical side effect. The next day she said the daughter's mouth seemed swollen. I immediately assumed she was having a reaction & advised her to get to the ER. Turns out the daughter had an infection & was sceptic. 
-1	I have taken a health class in college. I also enjoy reading about nutrition. 
1	I self diagnosed a pain in my knee as a bone spur. Upon visiting the doctor I explained the symptoms I was having and what pain I was going through and what I thought the issue was. The doctor took some x-rays and decided I was correct.  
-1	I had a wart on my thumb, the doctor used the freeze medication to burn it off. But I knew it would still grow back because I could still feel and see remnants, and sure enough it grew back. Sometimes common sense is useful in medical issues!
-1	I had to learn about my health conditions from diagnosis to research.  I not only consulted with my doctor but also sought papers from Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic
1	I think the biggest reason I don't smoke is because of my dad.  He died at 61 with complications from pneumonia.   I remember him running out of breath walking up 5 steps into our house and puffing on his luck strike cigarettes at he same time. 
-1	"My husband had severe pain in his left side after a pleurodesis procedure. He also had a fever, an elevated white blood cell count, and constipation. The doctor insisted it was just ""residual pain"" and the body's response to the procedure, while I kept arguing that it was more likely he had an infection of some kind. The doctor refused to do any blood work or send him for a CT scan to be sure, so we left that hospital AMA and went to another facility's emergency room. They found out my husband had a ruptured intestine, which required emergency surgery. He died 22 days later of sepsis from that rupture. Doctors don't always know everything and should learn to pay attention when their patients say something else is wrong."

1	When I had my baby he had to stay in the NICU for 2 days. At first, I didn't understand exactly why, as it could have been a few reasons. It could have been because he had pooped before he was born so there was poop when my water broke. It could have been because I tested positive for Strep B. And it could have been because I had a fever during labor. I later figured out it was because of my fever.
1	When my husband was dying, his gout flared up and I was able to explain to the nurse what was happening to him.  They were concerned with his heart, lungs, and kidneys and overlooked gout.  I had to explain that it was unrelated to any of those things.  Of course they knew what gout was but that didn't immediately come to mind when he was in excruciating pain.

There are of lot of studies that back up the use of garlic as an anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal medicine. Dice 2 cloves finely, let it sit for 20 minutes, eat with some peanut butter or other fat. If you already have a cold repeat for 3 or 4 days. If you're not ill do it occasionally anyway to boost your immune system.

I just knew it was my sinuses because of the switch in altitude, but my friend was worried and took me to the ER. They did a test on my heart and told me that was normal. I told the ER doctor that I was almost certain that it was my sinuses; the ER prescribed something for me, which I took, but it didn't help.

-1	"When the government inverted the food pyramid in the early 1990s, I told my children to ignore it. Replacing proteins, fats, etc with carbohydrates would create US epidemics of diabetes and obesity in the US -- it has. 75% of the brain is myelin, myelin is 100% cholesterol. Statin drugs inhibit liver production of cholesterol, creating our epidemic of Swiss cheese-brained cadavers from Alzheimer's disease. A 6.4 cent 100 mcg vitamin K tablet - size of saccharin tablet - prevents required blood serum calcium and blood  serum cholesterol from bonding at the molecular level into vessel plaque. When I had to tell a doctor that I had a strep throat, he took a culture, then didn't know what to prescribe because I'm allergic to penicillin. His PDR was no help to him, and he finally asked me what was usually prescribed for me, and wrote the prescription after again checking the PDR for correct dosage by weight, after asking me my weight. I was 20 at the time. Want more? Despite foreknowledge of both grandmothers dying of uterine hemorrhage and special care being taken for my first two deliveries, I suffered a uterine hemorrhage with my third child and ""died"" and I'm here only because I responded positively to resuscitation. Further idiocy? Second hand smoke was disproved in 1999, but they keep beating that dead horse. I smoked a pack of Marlboro reds throughout all three pregnancies, and gave birth to healthy, perfect, over 8 pound babies, a girl and two boys. Start looking for the correct reasons -- like minerals missing from the diet because they're never replaced in arable soil -- for birth defects."

I went on line and googled my symptoms and Web MD and a couple other sites which gave me a few diagnoses and I was able to pinpoint what my issue maybe so when I went in to the clinic I was able to provide the physician with my symptoms and he to came up with the same prognoses of sinus infection.

I also am always looking up the CBC test results, just saying I'm with-in acceptable range is never enough for me.

1	When my first son was a small toddler I started to notice tiny painless bumps on various parts of his body. After doing some pretty extensive research online I was pretty sure that the bumps were caused by a harmless virus & it was molluscum contagiosum. Sure enough, the next time I took him to the doctor she came to the same conclusion. A year later my other son developed the same bumps. I was able to immediately identify what it was and was able to get rid of them based on my prior knowledge.

-1	Once a year, I usually get a very bad case of the flu and I never go to the doctor to get medication or to get a check up. I avoid going to the doctor so much and despise the thought of getting told bad news about my health that I just tough it out. It can potentially last for months at a time, and even though I know in the back of my head that if I go to the doctor's office they could probably prescribe a medication that could help me much faster than whatever is over the counter, I do not go. I know I am in the wrong and it really shows a lack of understanding when it comes to medical issues.

Sure enough, she just hadn't been drinking enough water and was really constipated, which was putting pressure on her bladder. This whole thing was pretty easily understandable, and was explained well by our pediatrician.

Well, he ended up having a heart attack (his last major one) in the car with me, my mom, my husband and daughter.  I watched his behavior change and when I saw what was happening, I reached forward in the car and pushed the stick shift to neutral.  I then ran out of the car to the closest store and screamed for them to call 911 for an ambulance because my dad was having a massive heart attack.  I then got back to the car, tried to get his arms raised and undid his tie.  He couldn't respond and was having major difficulty breathing and I made sure he hadn't swallowed his tongue and gave him mouth to mouth until the ambulance came.
