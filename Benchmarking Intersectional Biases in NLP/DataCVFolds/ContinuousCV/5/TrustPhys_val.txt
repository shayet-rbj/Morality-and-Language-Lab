1.000000	been seeing my dr since 2015 after my own regular dr of 10 yrs messed up my ekg and heart condition.. my new dr found out i had high cholesterol and my old dr prescribed me pills for high blood presssure when i didnt have high bp . now i trust my new dr she never steered me wrong 
0.760000	I believe that the process for becoming a doctor is a long and arduous one.  This makes it a profession in which a larger percentage of the individuals in it are truly committed to their practice.  Being a doctor is an extremely important job and I think the majority of doctors in it truly want what is best for the patient.
0.680000	I just started with a new doctor and I like her a good bit. However, this has not been the case in general with doctors giving me medications without telling me what exactly they're meant to solve, what interactions I should be aware of, or what side effects to expect. I end up doing a tremendous amount of googling to make sure I'm not missing something. 
0.920000	They have always been helpful and informative. I've never had a problem  talking with them. They are respectful and I feel I can talk honestly to them.
0.960000	He is very knowledgeable and always puts my needs first. He often listens to my problems at our sessions.
0.400000	Physicians in this day and age are governed by insurance companies and regulations more than medicine and science.  They don't always willingly do these things, but nonetheless they have to bow down to these entities in order to get paid by using less effective treatments first, or substitute treatments for others due to money.  Also, a lot more time is spent on documentation than actually giving the patient good eye contact and favorable bed side manner along with taking as much time as is needed with patients.
0.920000	I have had he same primary physician for 9 years and I trust him with my life because we have formed a bond and I know he cares about me and my well being
0.800000	"I do believe in being informed, myself, but at the end of the day, for some things, one has to trust an ""expert"" - I feel that picking a doctor is hard. But once you have picked a doctor you feel you can trust, then you should trust them."
0.840000	Typically doctors are there for your well-being and they have no interest in being dishonest or holding out on you usually they want what's best for you and will give you the best informed information about what is best for your condition and how to diagnose it and take care of it properly
0.240000	I distrust my pcp because he once delayed giving me test results for months when they were available and I contacted him over and over for them.
0.960000	I trust my Doctor because I have been with them for a long time. They have always gave me accurate information and diagnosed problems with relative ease. I have never had an issue that resulted from any decision they have made regarding my plan of care.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable. She has diagnosed issues that others were not able to pick up on. 
0.760000	I usually look things up online before going to the doctor. When I do this, what my doctor and the internet says usually matches yp
0.760000	I have never had to see my primary care doctor for anything serious, so I might feel differently if that were the case. All in all, I think my doctor can be trusted and has given me no reason to think otherwise.
0.840000	He has never given me a reason to not trust him, he always explains things in ways i can understand, and usually lets me choose my own options, though he will always let me know what he recommends and why.  He is also very understanding of my issue with when i go to him, i usually try to ask and talk about all my issues at once, which can make meetings last longer then they should.
0.800000	I have no issues with my  doctor,  just  believe my doctor have my best interests  regarding my health.th. I  believe that  my doctor help me  reach my goal  regarding my health. 
0.520000	I mainly trust the doctors that I see or my children but I definatly make sure that we agree upon a treatment
0.520000	I do believe doctors want to help people. The issue I have is hospitals are driven by profit and people can be driven by rewards. So I may have high blood pressure but instead of trying to give me a diet to follow they go right for the medication. They do that because its a pay back to them. If I have pain in my knee the first thing I dont want is an opiod but thats the go to becasue there is so much money in it. So in all I trust them to help but I dont trust them to do it the cheapest or more reasonable way.
0.760000	My doctor is very concerned about my questions and always listens to me so that help me develop trust.
0.320000	The body is meant to heal itself give the proper environment. I don't think taking chemicals and drugs are the way to make that happen. A lot of allopathic doctors don't want to acknowledge tural altertive treatments for their patients because they are being paid by big Pharma to solicit their drugs.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she is smart she has her degrees. She's great at explaining things to me and she really cares about my health.
0.600000	i dont typically go to a doctor something i need to start doing again in the very near future.. i was addicted to drugs and let my health go just began recovery getting back to health is important to me gain
0.680000	I feel like my doctor cares, but is also very busy. Sometimes it feels like a whirlwind once she's in the room with me. She always asks if I have any questions before she leaves, but sometimes I feel so caught up in the pace that I can't really think of anything at the time. It's nice that her office has an online portal that I can send in a message and get a response from a nurse after the fact. 
0.360000	I was diagnosed last year with NF 1.. instead of my doctor trying to get me to a genetics doctor who specializes in what is wrong with me all he would do is say I had a patient with that once.. no test, no scans, no mri's, nothing to see what is going on inside.. I would show him the tumors on the outside of my spine and no reaction.. just I use to have a patient with that..
0.200000	Because A lot of Doctors have been known to false diagnose a person Blacks are high in that trick.  Example tell someone black they have a lump then who are they to know the future. They say you need to take Chemo therapy we THINK!!! its Cancer. Lies. Then 2 months later they Die. Secretly murdered by a Doctor
0.640000	I don't  have a primary  care or physician I use walk in clinics  some I can't give you that much information  so you see whom available 
0.800000	my doctor hasn't given me any reason to doubt his thoroughness, especially since i follow up his treatment with my own research on other treatments and medicines.
0.600000	I generally trust my doctor because she is highly educated and has gone through years of training in her profession.
0.640000	He is very true and I never had a misunderstanding and understand my needs and wants.Always diagnosis me right
0.840000	I usually trust my primary care physician as I am taking treatment with her for a long time and she is a good friend of me and she used to give a good treatment and guide me in good manner.
0.840000	because they work at one of the top hospitals in the country and they know their job. plus they took an oath, which should stand for something.
1.000000	My primary Doctor is  very cut throat person.He does not try to sugarcoat anything she it comes to my health. I trust him very much ad so far ecerythig that he suggested turned out just as he told me it would.
0.520000	I feel like most doctors just write prescriptions for whatever condition you may have and things like diet, exercise and more holistic options are not given to the patient. I would trust my doctor more if it seemed like they knew more about things other than drugs. 
0.680000	Ultimately, I trust my primary care physician. He has more knowledge than I do and a medical degree, so I will trust him or get a second opinion if it were a really big deal.
0.680000	Sometimes they give you the wrong information . Or may say you have something and not tell you what to do about it. 
0.600000	Having known a number of doctors, I know that they are human like the rest of us, and make mistakes like the rest of us. I also know that many are over worked and will sometimes rush a patient through his appointment. Others seem to care more for their bank accounts than their patients. And still others are hemmed in by rules and regulations where they work to really provide honest opinion. So no, I don't completely trust any doctor.
0.680000	I feel like doctors usually try to do what is best but sometimes they are really busy. Also, sometimes they might recommend a certain treatment because they might get a kickback from a drug company.
0.680000	Because theybcan totally lie to you but yeah uavent you heard of doctors lying their patients like dude that's why slwmtimes you can't just trust undone like make sure you asked of their degree and look up there history 
0.840000	I feel that doctors are generally trustworthy as if they're not, then what is the point of them chosing their profession if they just want to scam people?
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he listens to and trust what I have to say about what is going on with me and doesn't try to tell me that I don't know myself and my own body. He talks to me and doesn't talk down to me and I believe he provides me all the information that he has about me and my condition.
0.640000	I have had the same physician for more than 30 years. Also he is the same physician for all my family members.
0.600000	My Dr has been in my life for years and is always there when I need her. She is kind and like a second mother figure I am depressed and I could go to her office without an appointment and she will pull me in her office and be a listening ear
1.000000	I trust my doctor to give me the medical knowledge I need to mage my life the correct way.  I've never had a doctor who is so willing and able to take the time to listen.  They block out time for each patient.
0.600000	I like how my doctor treat me. And when I ask him for something he does it. And I don't have to wait when I need things.
0.800000	My PCP always sits and listens to me and together we choose an appropriate course of action.  She explains anything I question.
0.760000	I trust most doctors in general. I feel they provide adequate enough healthcare services. I don't really have a reason to not trust them because I feel like they know enough about whatever health-related things to made accurate assessments of my health. 
0.760000	My doctor has consistently demonstrated a high level of knowledge and empathy to me when i talk with them about any health conditions. I dont feel like they judge me or take prejudice with me 
0.520000	I trust her because I've had hey for years and she hasn't let me down yet I've had two kids successfully with no problem
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he was there when I was born and is very trusted by my parents. He has taken good care of my siblings and is very kind. 
0.520000	It seems that doctors can be too detached from their patients. They can sometimes forget patients are people not problems. 
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician a lot. She is always kind and helpful and she goes above and beyond to answer my questions and to help me understand everything. 
1.000000	My doctor I have know for almost 20 years, he is always been friendly and trusting and I have never once had an issue with my care. He always has been honest and helped me through anything I have come across. He always makes me feel like I am a priority.
0.640000	I have a hard in easy life in I try to do the right thing all the time but life can have a way of bring you down in doubt yourself in put you in a negative mood but I try to over come it 
0.800000	My doctor haven't given me a reason to distrust me. He tell me his personal struggles and I tell him mines, but he might do things for himself also. I wouldn't doubt that or blame him, but he haven't given me reason not to trust him
0.640000	I have never been in one place long enough to establish a primary care physician. I think it depends on how connected I feel to them, if I feel rushed and that they don't care then I am less willing to talk to them honestly or feel confidence in their opinion.
0.760000	I feel like I generally trust most doctors that I have dealt with because I usually do some good research or ask friends on doctors they have had experiences with before making a decision to visit them or not. 
0.720000	I  have  never had a  bad  experience  with  my   doctor   I  trust  him   completelyif  you  don't  trust  your  doctor  you  shout  not  go to  him
0.600000	You should never trust anyone completely. That is just being lazy, and letting someone else do the thinking for you. You should always put some effort in to evaluating things that other people say/do, regardless of how much you trust them.
0.560000	I don't have a primary physician, I see whoever is there. And while they all seem nice, I do not feel like they fully listen to what I tell them. I don't think they are as thorough as should be. 
0.720000	I believe doctors had some participatory stake in the prescription opiate mess.  While most doctors didn't have inside information on the pharmaceutical industry's practices  with respect to testing and marketing, I believe there have been relatively few doctors who have actually expressed a lot of remorse about the whole affair. That being said, doctors can't be held entirely accountable for living in a culture that is, in some sense, addictive in its makeup. My attitude toward doctors is governed by the principle that I do not expect mistake-free behavior on the part of anyone. All I ask is that doctors or other medical professionals who work with me give their best effort and use the best information available to them.
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my physician for ten years and I will not have it any way.  He make sure I am good and whatever I problem I have he addresses the problem with the upmost reapect
0.840000	He is looking out for my well-being running the best test for my conditions prescribing the medicines that's going to improve my condition.
0.840000	She is always patient with me and takes as long as I need.  She never seems bothered when I ask her questions, and if I call with a problem, she usually can see me that day. 
0.520000	Sometimes it seems as though doctors look at you as a number first rather than a person. This makes me not have complete trust in doctors that I come across because it's almost as though they don't really care what's actually best for me.
0.600000	He is a family friend but I personally do not like his bedside manner. He is a good doctors but he can be cold and brusque, which I do not like
0.800000	I always make sure to choose a physician I am comfortable with. This means that I feel they have my best interest in mind and are not just out to milk my insurance or have little interest in their patients.
1.000000	I believe in my doctor because when I need a doctor I go to them for help and I talk and explain everything and I listen to them  than I notice when they are listening to me.
0.600000	I feel like doctors are usually in a rush to see as many patients as possible and just throw out the most broad diagnosis and treatment that they can hoping it will solve the problem. I feel like if something is more complicated to diagnose, it will take a long process of narrowing down if they ever even get it right
0.680000	I feel they do the best they can.  There is always a standard to what you need to do when looking to speak with a doctor. 
0.800000	I have been going to the same doctor for about ten years. He is very thorough and knows my medical needs. He hasn't failed me yet and has helped me tremendously in all aspects of my health.
0.760000	I have been seeing my doctor for several years and have established a trust and confidence in his ability and diagnosis
0.960000	I have only had two primary care physicians in my 30 years of life. I am very particular and will only stick with a physician I feel I can completely trust. My current doctor is very open minded and has never once shut down any of my concerns. He has never made me feel rushed in an exam room. He gives his patients his cell and home phone numbers in case we need anything. He is always there and available. He is extremely supportive of my choices and the way I want my healthcare to go, but isn't afraid to tell me I'm making the wrong choices and offer better ideas when needed.
0.720000	I trust my doctor but will also do independent research to see if there are other options that my doctor is not aware of.  I also prefer to discuss medications with a pharmacist.
0.680000	In general, I would say I trust doctors since they are the professionals and they know what they are doing. Being able to become a doctor would imply that you are well educated in that area and have an adequate understanding.
0.800000	He's the expert. I don't know much about medicine, so I don't have much choice. Additiolly, he's always been open and honest with me about my treatment options, side effects, etc.
0.640000	Right now, I have a very good doctor. She takes the time to explain everything. I never feel rushed and in the way. She make me fill like she cares.
0.880000	My primary care physicians takes the time to talk to me, even discussing things that are going on with my family and work that might be affecting my health. She seems truly concerned about my well-being.
0.760000	I've never been given a reason to distrust a doctor I've seen. I've always been given information and had my questions answered in a reasonable manner. 
0.760000	They have not misdiagnosed me or ignored my fears or reservations about a particular treatment. My PCP does not treat me as another number.
0.800000	They seem very educated and experienced. They have also worked with a variety of patients who have had complications, so they are qualified to make decisions. If I ask them a question regarding something I am hesitant about, they will give an educated response as to why they are doing what they're doing.
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because he has never done anything which has lost my trust. There have been several instances where he knew is capabilities and referred me to a different doctor who have the knowledge and skill necessary to help me in my time of need. When I visit with him his head isn't in a pad or notebook so I do not feel like I am just another checklist in his big book of clients. He is very personal and takes the time to actually talk to me and get to know my family which is nice. I have also been going to him for some time so I have built a good report with him.
0.400000	Because there decision is made off of generals. They are not specialist. If I tell my PCP that I am not overweight but I eat well(veggies, all organic) they will at the end tell me to eat better. 
0.720000	The reasons why i trust my physician is because i have known him for a while. He has always been honest with me and my care. For that reason he is my daughters doctor as well.
0.640000	"I mostly trust my doctor but sometimes I believe that doctors are only taught one way of thinking and therefore do not consider alternative treatments in all cases but rather use only drugs to ""fix"" issues."
0.600000	I trust my doctor but due to him having so many patients I do not feel like I gte the most thorough of care. However here are not too many doctors to chose from that deal with my medical condition.
0.760000	I know next to nothing in the medical field and I see no reason why my doctor would not be interested in me regaining my full health. Hence, I see not reason not to trust them. My trust is not complete because they are still humans and can still make mistakes.
1.000000	I have a new primary care physician who is very cordial, friendly, smiley, smart, and caring. He looks at you and listens carefully to what you say and responds very politely and respectfully. He explains things nicely and with details and examples. He takes his time with you and makes sure he's answered all of your questions before the session is over. He doesn't order unnecessary tests or medications. He is great!
0.760000	He is willing to listen to me about my illness and help the problem by giving necessary medicine. When ask questions by writing it down he make sure he looks at it. And I ask him what vaccines do I need base on my age. And he make sure it get done the same day.
0.400000	A lot of doctors see too many patients to be very through with each patient, which I fault health insurance companies for the doctors needing to see so many patients. I was prescribed a medication that could interact with another medication I was taking. I took that medication for months, seeing the same doctors and using the same pharmacy. It wasn't until my regular doctor (pain magement) was on vacation, an older doctor recognized the risk and took me off of it. This greatly reduced my amount of trust in both doctors and pharmacists. My PCP was also aware of the medications but, did not recognize the interaction. 
0.240000	I have a terrible list of back problems and the doctor is afraid to give me anything stronger because of all of the opiod addiction in the country, even though I've never done anything wrong. so he keeps giving me expensive medicines that don't work and wont listen to me when i talk to him. he seems in a hurry to get me out of the office.  
0.560000	I don't put too much trust in doctors because I know they get kickbacks from certain medications and don't always look out for their patients. I know they mean well, but sometimes they don't do what's best and I don't want to put myself in that risk over something small that I can treat.
0.600000	overall I think doctors are trust worthy but there are a few sketchy doctors out there and that makes people not want to trust any of them. 
0.800000	My doctor has given me no reason not to trust them. They have provided me with the means to help whatever medical issues I have and have even gave me their contact info if it is after hours and I have an immediate need.
0.440000	I do not trust doctors in General from past experiences.  This is in regards to family members not getting the care they needed in order to prevent death
0.520000	I feel like sometimes he's in a rush and just wants to move on to the next patient.  He addresses issues but I don't feel like he's being thorough and thinking through his answers.
0.400000	I feel like there have been other treatment options that my doctor didn't tell me about because they got extra money for getting me on something they were in business with.
0.360000	I think the doctors that I have seen lately , let their degreesâ get in the way of understanding their patients needs, they are quick to offer solutions withoutâ all of the facts..not sure I trust many doctors
0.960000	I feel that I can completely trust my doctor.  SHe listens to me when I talk and she helps me to feel at ease.  I believe that she has my best interest in mind.  SHe genuinely cares about me.
0.760000	i trust him because he will always make sure i have the information that i need and that i can do what i need
0.760000	Overall I trust the doctors I have see.  However, the last time I made a Dr's appt. the office scheduled me with  a PA, I did not like this because no one told me I wasn't seeing an MD,  therefore at this practice I they were not being truthful or honest with me, and will not be using this practice again. This did cause me to distrust them.
1.000000	My doctor is always very open with their thoughts on any condition I come to them about.  They always give me a chance to ask questions and always make sure that I have a chance to say everything I feel is important.
0.680000	I have been going to him for years. He has always given me good advice. I trust him completely to make good recommendations.
0.360000	My primary care physician is quick to prescribe medication and has often overlooked diagnoses when reviewing my records. She schedules appointments 15 minutes apart and then rushes you during your visit. 
0.720000	She listens to my issues and concerns and we are able to have discussions about them and likes that i go on web md to further understand things
0.560000	I trust doctors who take the time to get to know me and my situation, but all too often doctores don't take the time to see you as a person and do not custom,ize their advice to fit your particular circumstance.
0.840000	I trust my doctor he's knowledgeable he knows my kids the next best to myself. They seriously help me 
0.960000	I trust my physician completely. I have been sing the same doctor for many years. He knows were I stand with taking non nonessential medications, and antibiotics. I believe he respects that. He has never steered me wrong before. I have also never had any health issues other than an occasional cold. I also believe that a good education in the medical field is also a must have. My doctor has taken many courses and is very well rounded. He has a great amount of experience.  
0.760000	Since I feel good and get cured after a doctors visit i feel like the doctor is helping me to stay healthy.
0.720000	For the most part, I think doctors are trustworthy. However, they are very busy and see a lot of patients, so they could make mistakes, just like everyone else.
0.320000	It's my life, it's not my doctor's life. It's his job. Even if he has every intention of doing the best by me, that doesn't mean he's capable or doing that does it. Doctor's don't know everything, and it's my body and health and I have to live with it.
0.440000	The doctors are just for a paycheck and they really dont care about their patients.  It is sad that they dont have a caring heart.  I rather go to a doctor who really cares and not looking at you as money in their pocket
0.920000	My primary physician is a friend who I have known since he was in medical school. He researches constantly and was top of his class for good reason. He knows my health history and respects my personal wants regarding medical care. He also takes time to listen to patients, not just myself, and is always willing to do extra work if need be. 
0.520000	Doctors make extra money by referring to other doctors and by prescribing certain medicines. That is counter to my best interests. I take what the doctor recommends with a grain of salt.
0.600000	A number of statements which people have used to describe themselves are given below. Read each statement and then select the response option to the t.
0.560000	They always explain themselves if i have any medical issues, go over the options and help to find a cheaper solution if i cna t afford the first one 
0.520000	Because hey might mix up my results and Donald trump this year I mean cmon and don't even get me started on Ben Carson like why are they even here please don't ask me this again I have arthritis hard to type I'm speaking into my laptop 
0.560000	For the most part I trust my primary care physician. When other doctors had turned down sending me to a specialist for a condition that I had for several years that still had not been addressed, my primary care doctor sent me to a specialist to get it checked out. Furthermore, some small issues that I had been having over the years she took the time to look into to give me a full and proper diagnosis. 
0.640000	I think that doctors have lots of time constraints so they tend to limit the appropriate amount of time necessary for their patients 
0.520000	Knowledgeable but doctors will rush to see too many patients.  Will not go in depth unless problem is already too far gone. Prevention not a thing with most and don't take their time with each patient.
0.720000	I wonder if there might be something she's not telling me to keep me from becoming upset--not diagnosis-wise, but possible non-serious effects of medicine or activity
0.480000	The Primary Care physician I saw for 12 years moved too far away for me to see him regularly or when I'm sick.  I changed to someone in the same group but closer geographically. It's a totally bad fit!  He goes by the numbers and doesn't really listen to what's going on with me like symptoms, etc.  He refers me to specialists for health care problems he should be able to manage.  He is very quick to write prescriptions for problems that require more examination and assessment. The practice wants patients to use a patient portal to message doctors.  He answers my questions in very short, often, one word answers. I'm already shopping for a new primary care physician.   
0.560000	it seems to work out just fine for me. I find that i can trust doctors pretty easily and have no issue in that regard because i have never had any reason to not trust them. so it works in my favor. 
0.760000	being 71 i always look forward to seeing the doctor asking questions and making sure i understand the answers
0.760000	If I feel at ease with the doctor and they are not trying to rush me in and out, answer my questions and show  understanding and compassion; I feel as though I can trust the doctor.
1.000000	I've known him for a number of years,and I trust his judgement he's caring and I think he gives me good advice that is good for me
0.480000	I don't really trust them and find myself changing and getting second and third opinions all the time. I feel like the doctors don't really pay attention to what I am saying or use their head to think of outside the box ideas. Basically I tell them how I feel and they agree, they don't ask or think of ways or things my pain could be from. I could say that I feel like a horse and they would give me horse pulls.
0.760000	He's been my doctor since I was a teeger. He is pretty blunt about telling you what is going and why. He is pretty thorough in his questions too. But if you smoke or anything, he'll tell you to expect a stroke.
0.680000	The reason why I mostly trust my primary care physician is because he examines and explains all physical circumstances to the best of his knowledge. Every challenge I have encountered rendered very positive results thus far. Although I am also aware that my doctor is not perfect and is very capable to error. This is why it is important to research certain medical ailments on my own as well. Asking plenty of questions are always in order when it comes to my well being.
0.680000	Sometimes I do trust but there are times when I feel I could take other medication that could be more helpful but doctors are so afraid these days of prescribing narcotic pain killers
0.640000	i trust my doctor,it is the insurance cos. that i don't.They are in charge and make the rules they want.That is the framework drs. function within.A tratment must be insurance approved or you won't get it.

0.600000	i trust my primary car doctor because she hasn't made me take anything or do anything that didn't help me. She's kind and knows all there is to know 
1.000000	I believe they know what they are talking about. They take time to tell me things. They let me ask questions.
0.640000	I do not completely trust mankind. The doctor's diagnosis isn't always accurate. I take caution when advised by doctor's. 
0.440000	I have just had bad experiences with doctors in the past. I don't want to go into my persol history but sometimes they don't care about patients. 
0.680000	My old doctor I trust because he would be very open and straightforward with me and he would always make sure I am feeling ok. I am not sure about other doctors but hope they would be as good as him. 
0.960000	I have never had a problem with any medical advice he has given me.He has always listened to what I have to say and answers any questions I have.
0.520000	"I feel that they always say ""no, that symptom is not because of _____"" or just send me away with some blow-off treatment for my symptom. I am very aware of changes in my body and sensitive to them. He might know medicine way better than I do, but I know my body way better than he does. "
0.720000	I don't trust the government which employs doctors. They put stuff in our medicine that makes us worst or sick and these doctors just follow. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I can talk openly with her and she takes the time needed during my appointments
1.000000	They are passionate about what they do and took an oath to uphold a certain code to protect people in every way that they can.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she explains everything in detail. She gives me time to process and makes sure that I understand the severity of a health issue. She also gives me time to ask any questions that I might have and is patient with me as she answers my questions. She is comforting and a great person. All these qualities make me trust her and feel comfortable when being seen by her. When I have questions outside of the doctors office I am able to call her during her work time and she will answer my questions. She is the definition of a great and caring doctor.
0.560000	I am on the fence with doctors because I think to many of them have a god complex and have very little information on how diet can actually affect your health.
0.520000	Because some doctors just don't care about me as a person. For a lot of reason that I know of. And they just don't like me because they think I'm a bad person. But they are wrong. Because I'm as good as I can be.
0.960000	I trust my doctor,because she is looking out for my best intersting i her hand.She let me know what is right,and what is wrong.
1.000000	He is very, very thorough. He is older than me, so he uses alot of old fashioned methods. But that is good, because he takes his time and listens.
0.760000	My primary care physician has changed often lately, so this is more about physicians in general.  For the most part, I trust their decisions:  they are trained professionals with a lot of experience in their jobs, and many are also active research scientists.  However, they do have some pressure put on them by drug sales representatives to recommend one product over another, and I think that there is a possibility of their judgment being distorted by drug and other medical product marketing techniques.
0.600000	 i trust or distrust your primary care physician because he is good and stuff like that and its easy to talk to them openly about everything you need to talk to a doctor about in a situation
0.280000	In the past four years I have been given a misdiagnosis three times because doctors failed to ask the appropriate questions or perform a simple bloodtest.  I spent months in excruciating pain while doctors scratched their heads and did nothing but prescribe medications that did not help and in fact made me feel even worse while my fingers were literally dying.  I could get a shower without literally screaming and curling up in a fetal position afterward.  There is no painkiller that can help that level of pain.  I am quite certain that if they had bothered to check my thyroid levels that I would not have endured a level of misery that makes one question what quality of life is worth living.  I have no trust in the competence of doctors because most are apathetic due in large part to the healthcare system itself.
0.640000	Physicians are people and they make mistakes. They can be persuaded with money and gifts to be biased towards certain treatments. They can have fincial interests that bias them towards treatments, too.
0.840000	I trust my doctor totally    He does what is in the best interest for me and my family   He is very knowledge and dedicated to me
0.600000	She used to be an excellent doctor. Not so much as her practice has expanded. Now she seems to take longer and longer extended vacations.
0.680000	My current physician is relatively new to me, so these questions are a bit difficult to answer. Overall, I feel my doctor has been very sympathetic and has taken my concerns seriously. She has ordered appropriate diagnostics and I feel that she has spent an appropriate amount of time asking follow-up questions. In my experience over the past decade, I have noticed many doctors spending less time with patients. I think the doctor/patient relationship, in general, suffers due to insurance regulations and company policies.
0.560000	My doctor doesn't care too much about me he just tells me a few things and hands me a perscription to go to the pharmacy to get pills
0.720000	I am doing fine and very healthy and nothing wrong with me. I am non-smoker, non-drinker, non-drug, and stay out of trouble, etc. I have one indoor cat. 
0.840000	I trust my care physicial a lot, i have been seei g him for over 10 years and he has always given me the right tips. He knows me very well and tells me the right tgings to be healthy
0.800000	He has been a family friend for many years and is always up front and kind about everything. I've never had an issue where he has not been correct about a medical issue. He treats me very professiolly at all times.
0.840000	I will only trust them if I have previously dealt with them. It takes a few visits for me to be able to trust in a doctor. I have encountered some that are only in it for the money and do not care about the patients.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because for the most part he has been on the mark with health problems that I have had. Once he had an intern from a local school take a look at me. She had difficulty diagnosing me so she went to get him. As soon as he walked in to the room, he saw me from a distance and called out what I had - again from a distance. He was dead right. My doctor knows his stuff and also has a sense of humor.
0.640000	Sometimes it depends on the time spent in the room with me. Or the reason I am there for the visit. They may try to make me take a medication when we have discussed before that it doesn't work it doesn't help. Orsuggesting other tests etc to have more intake, but u don't know. Each doctor is defiNitleu different.
0.800000	My doctor listens to me. She tells me te tests I should get and talks about my weight.
0.800000	 I am new to her practice, I have only been there about 2 years. I have never felt like she didn't listen to my concerns or try to help me.
0.520000	My Father was killed by is Dr.  My Mother was killed by a Hospital.  Dr's in America are trained to prescribe Pills, not cure the ill.  I have a primary care physician, but I take charge of my health.  I am 70 years old and take no prescription drugs.
0.920000	It depends on the profressionalism of the doctor.A doctor that speaks for you and your charts. One that research different treatments but has seen it through their other patients and is ready to venture with you and that is open minded everyone is new.
0.480000	I feel that they don't totally tell me.everything honestly. They are more worried bout money and the pharmaceutical company.  
0.440000	Most of the time, doctors do what is easy, or less expensive. Not caring about how miserable I may be. I have met very few doctors that understand that I have lived in my body my whole life, not them.
0.800000	in the end she usually is right. if I did not trust her I would get a new doctor. so far I have no reason not to trust her.
0.400000	I generally feel mistrustful because I don't think doctors really care that much about people, since they see so many patients and have so little time to spend with each of them. I also don't trust that they know what is best for me half the time, since I know my situation and body better than I can communicate with them or they have time to learn about. I also feel suspicious that they are being paid off, for example, by drug companies to push for certain medications , regardless of the patient. 
0.560000	I think my doctor is quick with my visits and so I've started to limit my engagement with him. He's often brushed off concerns in the past as well.
0.720000	I trust my Doctor because i feel that he geunuinely cares about serving me properly, and has my best interests in mind. He has told me that he wanted to be a psychologist after he finished his Medical Degree, but it is too late now.
0.600000	In trust my physician for the most part, and I say that because although he is a doctor or what not, he does not have all of the answers I may be seeking about a certain condition of how I am feeling.
0.800000	based upon past experiences, I believe he is thorough and has my needs at heart.  If I have questions, he answers without hesitation.  We discuss the issues.  I never feel rushed.
0.680000	PCP is as good as you tell them your issues. In todays medical world they are more of a gate keeper referring patient to specialist as needed.
0.720000	Haven't found a good doctor yet and I'm still looking for a health facilities that have transportation
0.760000	Doctors can be trusted but sometimes I feel they prescribe medications because they get a kickback whenever a patient buys a prescription for a medication they have written a prescription for. I feel that there are alternative solutions for some medical problems that will work just as well.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because my doctor would like the best for me. My doctor would help me take care of my health by telling me what healthy foods to eat. They would also help me by telling me what vitamins i can take.
0.560000	I trust that my doctor would provide me with the best care that they thought was possible if there was a real serious concern about my health. I also feel that my doctor does not always listen to every symptom and she is only trying to get through her day. I think my doctor prescribes medication to easily and doesn't always look to see if the benefits out-weight the side effects.
0.280000	I have been repeatedly misdiagnosed and handed pharmaceuticals that only mask the symptoms, not treat the problem. The doctors often seem so preoccupied with getting to their next patient that they don't care to take the time to properly resolve my ailment(s).
0.840000	I have been given no reason not to trust her. She always has good advice and doesn't push pills as the fix for something.
0.680000	Anymore, I think time is a limiting factor in how effective a provider is. If given more time to spend with patients, I would be much more willing to have total trust. 
0.960000	We went to the same high school. She was always a smart and sweet person. By knowing her background I trust her completely. She has always been good when I visit her at the doctor. 
0.760000	She listens to me. Also I have other family members that go to her and they have gotten wonderful care from her also
0.600000	i suppose i trust them. i wanted to rule out some stuff, try some more their sophisticated tech there,..... 
0.840000	I trust my doctor because, she always seems to have my best interest at heart when every i go to see my doctor for something she always go in to deep questioning into what is the problems i am having, and when she prescribe a diagnosis and or medication she always take the time explain everything i needs to know she never rushes with her patients. 
0.600000	he has a medicail degree so i trust him to take care of me when needed also when im haveing problem with others thi gs
0.600000	"I don't have a current one, but my last one accused me of drinking a ""starbucks milkshake"" before my blood test when I repeatedly answered that I had not consumed anything that morning for the blood test. He also fought with me about my premie status as a baby and whether or not the scar sites were for a heart surgery I had to fix a murmur. I've seen my own bill for my birth, I had the surgery. He then tried to forcefully sign me up for Jenny Craig before I left, which would not be covered by my insurance, and insisted on offering me the flu shot after I declined several times because I already had the shot. "
0.720000	"I do trust my doctor because he ""knows"" my family. He's been through a lot with us and we can talk about it all. That is nice to have someone that is easy going enough to be able to open up. It used to be called a good ""bedside manner"""
0.520000	I've had 2 doctors in my life give me bad information.  So, I'm a little weary. I had one the was obviously getting paid to prescribe a certain pill and he pushed it hard on me.  When I got my second opinion the Doctor told me I didn't need pills.  I do think Doctors know way more than me but I'm cautious now with them. 
0.720000	I haven't been with my primary care doctor for very long, so while I don't have a reason to distrust him, I haven't built up enough of a strong relationship yet.
0.800000	I generally trust doctors and trust their professiolism most of all. I think they have more insight and I don't feel like I have to challenge it or anything like that.
0.840000	I don't know how to treat my self so I would not try and my doctor when to school for it so I listing to what my doctor say.
0.760000	I trust my primary care phycician. Since coming into her care she has always been helpful as kind. I believe she helps me to the extent of her abilities. 
0.840000	they are professional doctor have been to a college and know about the human. theyexpience on a regular basic. bt we know for a fact that god know the human body than we do. men dont have knowledge all knowledge from our creator and our lord jesus christ
0.760000	why not trust someone whose job is to make you better? its their job so i feel like they would want to be honest and help me as much as they can
0.480000	I typically trust my doctor but there are times that the prescribed treatment seems inadequate. It's good to find a doctor that you like and trust. It takes a while but a doctor that is willing to put time in with you could be a lifesaver.
0.760000	:I trust my primary care physician because for the most part, they have always given me reliable information. They seem to be very knowledgeable about the conditions I am facing and experienced with those conditions. The take their time in delivering the best care possible to me.
0.760000	ive know my doctor for years, have had him for maybe 8 years if my life, he has always given me advice and the best of care.
0.440000	My primary care physician is good and better than most.  I believe that, in general doctors have become salesmen.  They are very quick to prescribe medication and refer patients to doctors to patients who refer patients to them.  I do not feel that anyone should completely that in these days of greed and avarice, no one should blindly entrust his/her healthcare to another human being.
0.760000	I trust my doctor, as I have seen him for a while and several of my family members (as well as family friends) go to him too. He is knowledgable and friendly, and is also open to hearing your thoughts and feelings about what's best for your health.
0.480000	Last year, a test result showed I had a chronic condition. The only thing the doctor recommended was a prescription medication. That's it, nothing about lifestyle changes, etc.
0.760000	He's nice and doesn't belittle my complaints.
0.800000	I have only been to my present PCP once, and have not completely formed opinions making it difficult to answer the questions on this page.  However, I was favorably impressed by him and intend to keep using him for the foreseeable future.
0.680000	I am a skeptical person about everything really. I know it's not called for a lot of the time but I just can't help it. I often question whether or not the doctor has my best interest at heart. 
1.000000	I get a very strong impression that my doctor is looking out for my best interests and she is very knowledgeable about my conditions. 
0.720000	I have only had my doctor for a year and have not had any new treatments or diagnosis since being her patient
0.560000	I don't trust some doctors because they are on a higher pay grade and tend to have an eminence of superiority.  Don't get me wrong, some doctors are great, they seem to want to help.  To others I may feel like another cattle being strung along and they don't care if I end up in a dazzling meadow or at a slaughterhouse as long as they get their payment. In my situation (chronic rhinitis) I often have to asking prodding questions to really get any help on my issue.  Everything they have recommended hasn't helped at all, they say the cyst in my sinus doesn't matter, my jaw being realigned with palatal expander/braces doesn't matter, both these things seem like something worth investigating more, but they don't.  Sure I think they probably know better, but I don't count 100% on it.
0.600000	I trust their expertise and their knowledge but I trust myself in knowing my body better than any other person.
1.000000	I trust my PCP because she thoroughly explains everything to me. She asks questions about how I'm feeling/my conditions, and makes sure that treatments and medications are working as they should be without any adverse effects.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she takes the time to explain things to me, answer my questions and have a discussion with me regarding my health.
0.800000	I have seen the same Dr. for 17 years so she knows me well. She's open to my suggestions involving my care and will usually agree. She orders appropriate tests and mess and is available to receive and promptly answer emails.
0.800000	I don't see my primary care doctor very often, but I do see my gastroenterologist on a regular basis. I trust him because I've been seeing for three years. In that time, I've been hospitalized when I was very ill and he made the right medical decisions for me. He's always informative when I see him and explains things well. I have never had any problems during any interaction with him.
0.920000	My doctor takes time to listen to my questions and explains things in simple terms. He is very kind, compassionate and patient.
0.560000	I feel that doctors sometimes have motivation to pursue a certain treatment plan without narrowly tailoring it to my needs.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he does not hesitate to tell me when I am doing something wrong and the risk of doing that and he will also tell me what I am doing right and praise me.
0.680000	They sometimes just give pills to cure a situation without getting to the root of the cause.  They don't have time to discuss a plan that would work for me instead of pills.
0.640000	I usually choose a primary care physician with lots of experience. I based my trust off of his experience and user review online.
0.960000	I trust my Dr because he is very experienced and he knows what he is talking about. I am confident that he has my best interest at heart.
0.720000	After listening to my concerns the doctor prescribed the medication that would best handle my medical condition
0.600000	I trust my doctor because he so far has given me the best care.Plus I have been with the same doctor for years
0.800000	I completely trust my physician.It is important for me to stay healthy for myself and for my family.My physician is a very good person.She is very caring and understanding. She really makes me comfortable.
0.560000	I feel that some doctors are more into trying to get you out of the office after running up your medical bills than they are into helping patients to get better. 
0.760000	I trust my primary doctor because I have no choice but to, and most of the time i think doctors are usually here to help us so why would they not want to do what is right for their patients.
0.560000	It is mostly about making money in the grand scheme of things so it makes it hard to trust. I know that some are there to help people, but it doesn't help the corporate mindset of it in the long run. I wish I trusted my doctors more but sometimes you even question the diagnosis of some conditions.
0.800000	I feel that doctors are for the most part trustworthy. But in general some are in a big hurry to get to the next patient. They sometimes make it seem like  are putting them out to ask many questions. Like you are wasting their time.
0.600000	I  LIKED THE PRIMARY ATTENTION OF MY DOCTOR BECAUSE IS GOD, THE INFORMATION THE HE LET ME KNOW IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND
0.680000	i feel he had lack of interest in me sometimes and rushes me and also does not have the answers i need to help
0.720000	My doctor seems knowledgeable and has gained my trust over the years. My doctor is personable and likeable. I've also verified a lot of his/her comments using the internet, books and other personal research.
0.600000	I think they are very busy and default to common diagnosis.  Seems like it takes a few follow ups before they go into any depth.
0.760000	"I see no reason why my pcp would not be honest with me.  I go to a practice where I am seen by residents and interns overseen by attending physicians.  There are plenty of ""checks and balances"" in place to ensure I am getting quality care."
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician. I've seen this physician for many years and have never had a problem discussing concerns or listening to what to do to be proactive in my health.
0.480000	Dr's are people like everyone else, and people will always do what is best for them. Maybe they are in a bad mood and want to leave maybe they are getting kickbacks for prescribing a certain drug/treatment. My dr has tried to keep me on a medication that there was no real reason for me to be on, when I pressed her on why she wanted me to take it she could really give me a good reason beyond she said so. 
0.920000	I have been going to him for a while and he is great.  He actually listens to you and you can tell he really cares
0.480000	Pharmaceutical companies have alot of doctors and hospitals by the boot straps so if its not something that is paying their bills they are least likely to admit it. Example going hollistically versus a medication to help a small yet consistent pain is not going to come out their mouth much less approve you doing so already yourself
0.320000	I feel that since the practice I go to has switched/been bought by or covered by a certain medical group, the quality of care has greatly declined, and I've noticed several subtle and some not so subtle changes for the worse. I have gone in so many times trying to figure out what is causing my body some negative problems (pain, easily fatigued, etc) and I just keep getting the run around, it seems. I am considering finding a medical practice that hasn't yet been bought out or taken over by the specific umbrella medical group, which has been difficult. I don't believe that prescription drugs that just bandaid a situation are the answer. I don't like to take a bunch of Rx, and would appreciate some direction from my physicians, but haven't gotten much help in that dept.
0.760000	I only have a mild distrust of doctors because of some experiences my mother has had working with them, but on the whole I have had extremely kind and patient primary care physicians. My GYN doctor, especially, is extremely trustworthy. She gives her patients her personal cell number to call at anytime in case of an emergency. 
0.920000	I HAVE BEEN LUCKY DO TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE BEEN SEEING THE SAME DOCTOR FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS, THATS WHY IN TRUST HIM AND OR HER
0.800000	i think my primary care physician is very skilled and is straight-forward.  he is also compassionate (and funny)
0.800000	My doctor has never steered me wrong before. Although he may have been quick with information i have always been able to find out what i need.
0.760000	I trust my doctor, but realize there is only one miracle worker. She does tend to prescribe medications freely, and I don't agree with taking a pill for everything.  She knows when I will not take certain medicines and why.  Leaves the door open if not 100% needed.
0.560000	Some doctors these days do not listen to what their patients are telling them. They are to much in a hurry to get to the next patient.
0.720000	well Trust is, of course, essential to both physician and patient. Without trust, how could a physician expect patients to reveal the full extent of their medically relevant history, expose themselves to the physical exam, or act on recommendations for tests or treatments? Trust promotes efficient use of both the patient's and the physician's time. Without trust, the process of informed consent for the most minor of interventions, even a prescribed antibiotic, would become as time consuming as that needed for major surgery.rust may even have therapeutic value, enhancing the efficacy of prescribed treatment.22 Most importantly, trust in the doctor caring for them is of great importance to patients. Patients who trust their doctors rate their care more favorably, as demonstrated by Keating et al.23 in this issue, as well as by others.20,24 Numerous open-ended studies of patients' views about their care, in a variety of contexts, most of which did not include specific hypotheses about trust, have found that patients spontaneously discuss trust and its importance, adding
0.680000	I trust my doctor because he always gives me all my options in detail and never tries to mislead me. Sometimes though he does seem to push options that are more convenient for him and the practice. 
0.680000	I have only been to this doctor for 2 physicals and I have not had any serious problems so it is hard to judge whether I trust her completely. She seems nice enough and she doesn't force me to do things that I disagree with her about so she seems okay. For instance I have osteoporosis and I have found a very good supplement which is used to treat osteoporosis in Japan and the doctor wanted me to take prescription meds and I refused because of the side effects. She allowed me to go the course I prefer at my own risk. We will see what will happen when the stakes are higher as far as having a more serious health problem ( which I hope does not happen any time soon). 
0.840000	I trust my Primary care physician, because Iam still alive. My always shows patience and kindness while staying professional
0.480000	I trust a physician to truly want wha tis best, but I do not trust that they will pick the best solution instead of prescirbing the easiest pharmaceutical drug or highest paying one.
1.000000	MY DOCTOR IS CARING,AND HE GOES ABOVE AND BEHIND MY HEALTHCARE. HE TAKES THE TIME TO CHECK ON ALWAYS GIVES ME RESULTS ON MY TEST RESULTS
1.000000	My doctor is up-to-date on newest medical treatments and experimental data. She is forthright in talking with me, asks me a lot of questions, and explains everything so I can understand what she is saying. She has a sense of humor. She is thorough in her record keeping, follow-up with me, and treats me as an individual, not a number. She's young, bright, and persoble.
0.680000	I have been going to the same dr for over 30 years. He knows me and all my ailments and quirks so I believe that he has my best interest in mind even if I don't aways agree with him. If anything he is a little over protective. I like the when my husband goes to see him, the dr always asks about me and visa versa when I go to see him. There are times I have had to fight with him to get my husband the specialized care I feel he needs but I dont have to fight too hard and when the office refused to see my husband once because he didn't have the co-pay, our Dr threw a fit and told them they are NEVER to do that again. He is more than our doctor, he is our friend.
0.600000	For the most part I have complete trust in my doctor and his staff. Sometimes money does play a part though. 
0.600000	Seeing so many people, it is hard to have a relationship with a doctor that would be anything more than a routine visit.
0.760000	I have trust in them for the most part. However, I also know my body and don't just simply take them at their word when they say everything is normal or ok
0.680000	Doctors are in the business of making money like everyone else. Sometimes, you'll get one that is more interested in the bottom line than in actually treating a patient. 
0.480000	I've only recently started seeing her. I had an issue wrong and I feel like instead of truly trying to figure out what was wrong , she just sent me out for any test she felt could possibly solve it for her. Then when the tests didn't work, she was quickly done with me and wanted to refer me out. She has also put me on some questioble medications for this without explaining fully the side effects or that I could have a bad reaction to one of them.
0.520000	i know how doctors get kick backs for prescribing certain medications and although I do like my doctor, I still don't trust that they always have my best interests in mind. 
0.800000	I've been with my primary care doctor for a number of years, and feel he does have my best interests at heart... he takes enough time with me at every visit, and will answer any question I have. 
0.720000	I trust my PCP because she is fairly thorough.  When I explain to her that I have a specific medical concern, she does what she can to address it.  If I ask for a test or procedure, she does whatever she can to make it happen, which helps to allay my fears.  She makes appointments for me in a timely fashion, and she seems to actually care about my issues.  That's not to say she isn't usually in a hurry, but I think most doctors are because of a large patient load.
0.840000	I trust them because I know along with experience and schooling they have the know how to take care of me. I have not had a negative experience yet with my doctor so no reason to distrust them.
0.760000	I have been with the same doctor for 18 years.  I trust him to make the right decisions concerning my health. 
0.800000	I have been going to my PCP for over 20 years now exactly for the reasons above. He takes his time with me, asks questions, and is honest about how he feels. That's why I still go to him.
0.640000	the reason why I trust my doctor is because he is always explaining  my health and wellbeing very clearly to me.
0.400000	Be sugar coats a lot. I can tell him how ied and what I'm going through and he tells me it's all in my head. 
0.480000	In American society, doctors are too easily swayed but money. I don't trust them to provide me with the care I need if I don't have insurance or the amount of money that want. It seems so odd that we have to buy our health, like the common man is owned but the powers that be. 
0.840000	I had a stroke last year and the care my Doctor has provided has improved my health greatly.
0.800000	My doctor has never given me reason for distrust. He is always knowledgeable, friendly and professiol.
0.560000	I have a new doctor so my trust hasn't been earned yet.  I did trust my old doctor completely.  My old doctor did all of the things that are listed above.  The new doctor seems to be following some kind of generic schedule instead of finding out what I personally need.
0.680000	I trust them because they went to school for being a doctor or physician I don't trust them because of the reason they push lots and lots of medicine on people when the main thing they need to tell the patient is to eat healthy and stop being sedentary 
1.000000	My primary care physician is the primary care physician for my grandparents, parents, aunt and uncle, brother, and cousins, and my cousin's wife was a nurse in my physician's office for several years. I've known him for more than twenty years, and my parents have known him for longer. He's always done his best with all of us, and he's always been kind and funny. I have no reason not to trust him.
0.840000	I have built up trust with my doctor because I know that they are being honest with me. I have been going to them for a long time and they always seem to have my better care in mind.
0.920000	My primary care physician takes the time to fully explain things to me, because she knows I want to know what I am taking. She never rushes me. She never tries to give me medicine that she knows won't work just because she is getting a kickback from the company. She doesn't over-medicate patients, only prescribing medicine if she really believes I need it. The only times I distrust her is when we disagree on a course of action. But the fact that she allows me to disagree, and talk it over with her makes me trust her more. 
0.640000	WELL THERE MY PRIMARY CAR DOC SO THEY SHOULD KNOW WHATS BEST FOR ME. THEY BEEN A PRIMARY DOC FOR YEARS AN KNOW BETTER THAN I DO
1.000000	i trust that my doctor knows what she's doing and if a problem arises, i know that she will diagnose and help me find the best possible treatment/medication for my needs
0.560000	I distrust my physician because she doesn't put her patients first . She is never on time and does not care about how her patients feel . She goes about her business in a disorderly matter .
0.720000	My doctor seems in a hurry. I think my doctor does not care for me because I refuse treatments for things like the Flu shot. He seems in a rush to get to the next patient. He says things that are contradictory and confusing to me without leaving time for me to follow up on what he said.
1.000000	MY PHYSICIAN KNOWS ME BY NAME.  HE IS AN INTEGRATED PHYSICIAN AND LOOKS AT NUTRITION AS WELL AS TRADITIONAL MEDICINE.  HE LOOKS AT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM NOT JUST A REGULATING MEDICATION. 
0.800000	Typically when I see a doctor, they are a medical resident. I actually feel more confident in this situation because I know that if there is any doubt, they will seek more information through their attending. I would say I usually trust the doctors I see, but I do like to keep myself informed by other means as well, just in case.
1.000000	He is always warm and welcoming, very professional but he smiles enough to not make me nervous. The top reason I'm happy with him though, is because he actually treats me when I am ill, before I had him I ended up with shingles, and my current doctor (back then) told me that I'd have to tough it out. I switched to him immediately and he got me the medication I needed, he even had his office call me to see how I was feeling. 
1.000000	I have had the same Doctor for 15 years and she has never been wrong and always tells me the truth so I trust her.
0.760000	I trust my primary care doctor to an extent; he is fallible just like anyone else. I will do my own research after visiting with him, and if I don't agree with something, e.g., a medicine he recommends or a treatment protocol, I will tell him what I have found, why I don't want to take it, and let's try something else. Ultimately, I know my body best and I do my utmost to take care of myself.
1.000000	I been with the same doctor for ten years at least. She and I are not just patient and doctor but true friends. I know she has my best interest.
0.600000	I wouldn't completely trust my primary care physician or any doctor for that matter. While I have respect for their level of knowledge and expertise doctors are still just people and capable of making mistakes. 
0.800000	I have a doctor who is an older gentleman and he is very caring and thorough with me.  He talks to me, not at me and that gives me a comfortable feeling about him.
0.760000	For the most part, I trust my current primary care physician because her medical examinations always seem thorough enough, and she has always prescribed medications and treatments that have turned out to be helpful and never harmful. However there are a few issues I've brought up repeatedly that have not particularly been addressed. I assume that she believes those issues are not a big deal; whether they are as harmless as she seems to think, I can't be sure since I'm no medical expert. For now I'd prefer to just go along with her advice. I have been seen by some very poor quality physicians in the past, and my PCP is definitely not one of those. I generally don't put a lot of trust in people, but I trust my PCP more than most.
0.640000	I believe most drs are about a paycheck and just want to medicate you so the pharmaceuticals can get a check
0.600000	He's fine for check ups but quick to refer me to a specialist without trying a treatment first.  After I see the specialist, my family doctor defers to them and doesn't stay in the loop.
1.000000	I love my dr. because she is open to hearing what I have to say and is not interested in bossing me or just telling me something to get me out of her hair.
0.720000	I feel like I have a bond with my doctor and i feel as if he has my best interest at heart. I trust his decisions when it comes to my health.
0.840000	My doctor has treated me well. My only complaint is that he is sometimes in a rush and I can sense he doesn't have more than a few minutes to speak with me.
0.320000	i don't trust a doctor that won't directly answer my questions.  i don't trust a doctor that wants my money more than he wants to help me.
0.600000	The doctors these days seem not to care about the patient. They are only interested in how many patients they can see per day and how much money they can make. They don't seem to care about the patient and how they feel.
0.560000	I think they are more into there own money earning then into really helpping me out with my needs. They do help in the way they tell me but with the other needs I need I have to find out my own information since they dont offer it and I think they should give that information also
0.760000	My primary care physician is a nice woman who listens to me. She will direct me to many specialists.  She, however, does not treat very often.  She goes over the records of other doctors, etc.  
0.400000	They don't have the same helpful enthusiasm when you don't have insurance. They rush through the visit, take their time getting to you, and assume you just want drugs. 
0.600000	At times I feel like just a number and a way to make them money. Other times I feel that they are truly co concerned for my well being and my health care. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because she explains everything in depth and uses terms that are understandable. Also she is very comforting and has a good bedside manner.
0.800000	He seemed legitimately interested in now i felt and what u needed from him. He didn't brush me aside or tell me to make another appointment when I had more than one issue to attend to.
0.760000	Well he knows what is best. I'm sure he doesn't want to get sued for doing something wrong. He wants to do the best he can do. 
1.000000	they have taken care of me for years and they know what they are doing when they give me advice or prescriptions
0.360000	Who Sunil Endo shul think to do you  think homophobic to do check bunko stay stuff tho do dunno dunno syrup yup dunno affecting full full full full
0.520000	With the on going battle over the cost of health care, doctors are more frequently making decisions that benefit them rather than the patient now a days.
0.560000	i think they only want to prescribe you medications and other things that make you feel better and come back for more
0.680000	My doctor spends a lot of time with each and every one of her patients. She takes time to get to know them and socialize with them and to explain options and treatments 
1.000000	I trust my doctor implicitly, because I have been going to him for many years, and he always has my best interests at heart.
0.360000	They do not discuss the real reasons for my visits.  They do not listen to my symptoms or how it affects my daily like.  I don't think a 15 min appointment is enough time to asses any condition.
0.840000	I trust my PCP because she is very caring and if I need a referral she gives me one if she feels my condition is something another doctor needs to handle.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very knowledgeable and able to explain to me what exactly is going on and I like her as a person.
0.720000	I have read her background and i trust her. I also trust the organization that she works for. She is very thorough and knowledgeable about womens health
1.000000	I trust my doctor because they had my best interest and heart and always has been honest with me. My has been truthful with me from days one.
0.840000	"The doctor has a very caring way about him, and he has a long history of success as a doctor, as well as the proper training and eductation. He is very open and honest with me. I chose ""agree"" instead of ""strongly agree"" above though, because I don't completely trust anyone who isn't a dear friend or loved one, and I am not a medical expert."
0.440000	Seems to have too much on with practices in 2 locations and not effective support to make me feel 100% trusting.. Feels a little disorganized
0.760000	 I think my pcp is honest about the treatments she is aware of, but being a general practitioner she has to rely on specialists for certain conditions. I trust her decision in treatment unless I have found other information that needs to be discussed first.
0.640000	Don't have primary care physician but don't completely trust doctors because if patients get well doctors out of business.  Also push too many pills.
0.920000	My doctor is very knowledgeable and helpful. She explains everything that i need to know about my lab work and my exams. I feel that I can talk to her and she listens.
0.560000	I don't distrust my doctor so much, I just know that he is a human being and doesn't have all of the information. My doctor has a family so when he leaves the office he is not doing research on new treatments or new information. I like my doctor I just think that he is a little out of date and doesn't take the time to educated himself on new medical practices or even new nutritiol information.
0.760000	My doctor is a great doctor and she truly cares about her patients.  I have developed a good relationship with her and she lets me know that she is always there for her patients
0.640000	I trust my doctor because he's never given me a reason to distrust him.  I don't believe he values me above all else, and certainly he cuts corners/time/doesn't explain EVERY possible option every time, but he always tells me the relevant information I need.
0.840000	My doctor is very verbal about what he thinks is happening. He explains the symptoms and what step should be taken to help cure the problem.
1.000000	My doctor has taken great care of me for years. Anytime something is wrong I get just the care I need.
0.880000	I trust my doctor to know what is best for my health all the time but sometimes i feel that I know my body better and can sometimes make a better decision than the doctor in some occassions.
0.400000	I feel like the physician is more oriented towards actions that would bring the hospital more revenues and comfort.  The physician does not seem to truly listen to all that I have to say and makes judgments and diagnoses before fully understanding the problems.
0.880000	I just began seeing a new physician since my previous one retired. She is extremely intelligent and is totally aware of my medical history and how to treat and prevent any issues that I may have.
0.600000	I don't trust nor distrust my primary care physician because they are simply there to do a job and I'm a customer of their service. Nothing more, nothing less.
0.640000	I trust the medical expertise of the doctor. I do not, however, trust that they are doing the right thing all the time. My doctor's office, like others, is clearly there for insurance money, making us get lots of tests.
0.360000	There have been a few times I have seen my doctor with issues that seemed bad and felt unable to communicate to her how bad I felt. I often feel like she isn't really listening to me. Only to go on to another specialist type and find out she should have known how to help me with this problem. 
0.840000	i just trust my doctor ho when to school and I know she care about her patients. She work for her patients and not just for the paid.
0.760000	I agree for the most part that doctors are looking out for their patients and can be trusted, but I do think like all human beings sometimes they are working in their own interests.  For example, my regular doctor used to recommend removing moles even if they are not a problem (cancerous or pre-cancerous), but when I mentioned that I am on high deductible insurance and these procedures come out of my pocket, she conceded that this mole removal is not needed.
0.320000	I usually go to the poor clinic and the doctors there are terrible. The one I saw the most was checking information on his phone to make sure he knew what to do with me. I had no trust in his judgment I got better by checking Internet and finding a cure myself.
1.000000	I've been with the same doctor for several years and haven't had any issues. Always have my best interest in heart and we discussed everything from medications to procedures.
0.960000	My doctor is very transparent with me, I am only 20 years old so he warns me all the time about certain diseases people my age tend to catch. He is also very interested in our lives like our studies and sports, and that makes me feel more welcomed by him.
1.000000	In the time I've been seeing him he has told me things that I NEEDED to hear rather than what I wanted to hear. He always spends as much time as is necessary with me to make sure I understand my options and instructions. 
0.800000	I have been going to him for over 20 years.  He is frank with m.  he make sure I always no the score.  He does not beat around the bush, and I appreciate that.  
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she always gives a lot of choices and me which one is best for me
0.640000	I wouldn't say I trust or distrust doctors in general. I just believe that they can be wrong or inaccurate at times.
0.720000	He is highly regarded by those close to me. A lot of friends and family use the same doctor, and have high praise for him as well. 
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because he has helped me whenever I went there with a problem. He has always figured out what the issue was and alleviated the symptom. He is also good at making things easy to understand so I would not be confused.
0.640000	I find that doctors are quick to prescribe medication for symptoms that can be maged otherwise.  I feel it's unnecessary in some cases.  When I have spoken to my doctor about altertive or tural medicine, she is quick to deny it's efficacy, but when I use it, it works.  There have also been times I had to self diagnos because my doctors weren't thoroughly looking into my symptoms.
0.400000	My most recent primary care physician was very dismissive of my needs, did not inform me of the seriousness of my condition, and overall did not spend the requisite time with me to inform me of my condition. I am still living with the relevant condition as a result. 
0.920000	I have had doctors I did not trust, and quickly sought a new doctor. To me, it is one of the most important decisions a person can make. I need to feel they are thorough, caring, and aren't just passing over any concerns I have. If I am unhappy with a doctor, I have no problem asking to see a different one. The one I have now is very caring, compassiote, and listens, even if the appointment takes  a little longer than expected.
0.600000	I don't always trust doctors I don't have a physician but if I did I would always make sure what he or she is telling me is true by getting a second opinion.
0.840000	she is very through and knows exactly what my needs are and recommends specialist that I need to see for any problems she knows I need. she follow ups with my blood work to see if my meds needs to change. she ask me if i'm having any problems since my last visit and what is going on with my current health issues.
0.760000	You can trust your doctor to tell you about your condition and what the doctor tell you about your illness
0.480000	I feel the 'industry' of medicine out weighs the care of patients. Profit is more important than caring for and treating the person. 
0.600000	Most doctors are greedy. The money is more important than our health. They perform unnecessary treatments to earn more money
0.400000	I don't trust my primary care physician because she is barely available and doesn't spend much time with me. She doesn't fully listen to what I have to say. Her assistants do most of the intake, if not all of it. She often seems stressed, and she probably is. Even so, I need someone to sit down and listen to me for more than three minutes. Every meeting and exam seems to only cover the bare minimum of a patient's needs.
0.360000	Doctors are human, they are arrogant and used to getting their own way, they are inclined to listen to the powers that be instead of to their patients, and they are often lapdogs for the pharmaceutical industry.
1.000000	He is always up front with me and he explains thing's so I can understand what he is talking about. He really seems to care about my health. If he's not sure what is going on he will send me to a specialty doctor to find out what is going on. 
0.440000	I have had doctor's only tell me information that would make them the most money, or be lazy and not give me all the information, especially if was not convenient for them.  It's hard to ever know for sure if a doctor is telling you everything or not.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing her for over five years and she has never given me information I have found to be false.  She discusses health issues with me and takes my concerns into consideration
0.440000	At times, my doctor seems more focused on generating money than actually treating me. I have had several tests that seemed unnecessary. 
0.760000	i trust my doctor because she is very edicated and have a big experience and all time when she gave me some medication this is work very well
0.720000	My doctor is pretty straight forward is sensitive but to the point.  I must trust he only has my best interest at heart
0.600000	idk
0.760000	I have had the same doctor for 15 years, and he has never steered me wrong yet.  He always treated my grandma and continuously worked to help her as she had dementia and Alzheimer.
0.840000	"My doc. is a very caring and compassionate person, he gives my all the time I need to discuss questions and concerns I may have, he has great ""bedside manners"". He always takes an interest in me and my health."
0.400000	The doctor that I have seen does not have a lot of time to see me and does not (because she cannot) remember information about me. She relies on her notes, which I don't find accurate to the information I give her, even when I have corrected her. For example, she had written down that I started birth control a month later than I had. She also changes her mind about my treatment very often and doesn't seem sure about what's necessary or helpful to me.
0.600000	My physician is quite busy and this can lead him to be curt or even impatient when asked for options or explanations. He normally thorough in his treatment but can get antsy when asked to explain himself or to clarify something he has said. I think he assumes that people will give his schedule as much priority as he does.
0.800000	I trust my physician because of my experience with her. I always have the final decision about my own care.
1.000000	goes in depth with our discussions, goes the extra step when preliminary tests are not within the appropriate range, explains actions and my consent before adjusting meds or recommending actions
0.680000	I trust my doctor because they have never been wrong in my treatment and refer me to other if they don't know
0.400000	I don't completely trust anyone, the doctor is there to make money and they can be easily brought my the pharmacal company
0.640000	My primary care physician can be very blunt but that is because he has a lot to do for a lot of patients. When he speaks with me, I know my health is his only focus. I trust him because he tells me what I need to know, his professional recommendation on treatment plans and medications are trustworthy. 
0.920000	He tells it like it is. He's straight forward no matter if it hurts your feeling or not.  He has always been honest to me and my husband 
0.720000	i've visited my doctor a couple of times and I do feel like they really care about me as a person and want me to be healthy. I've not had any negative experiences with them and plan on continuing to go visit them annually or more often.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because she always cares about what I do and she is very through and I love her
0.680000	I feel like they see so many patients in a given day, that they do not remember you on a personal level, therefore they do not really have a clue what you're really going through.  I trust what they think based on ME having to point out every single little symptom I experience.  
0.360000	I don't trust any human to take care of me.  We all make mistakes and I refuse for their mistakes to be made on me.  The most a doctor can do is tell me what they believe is wrong but it's up to me to fix it.
1.000000	He has helped me in the past in dealing with health issues and he acts more like a friend in our appointments rather than someone just trying to force something and being very indifferent when it comes to our conversations. He actually speaks and you can feel his concern and his understanding. He knows how to be a friend or at least act friendly.
0.280000	"i don't trust someone that i can't understand. i don't appreciate being ""talked over"" because i am not understanding what they are saying. i will not go back to that doctor, unless i absolutely have to because i care about my life and well being more than some stranger with a diploma does. when i find a doctor that treats me like the intelligent human being that i am, i am more willing to listen and discuss my concerns with them. if not, they are plenty of doctors that i will go to until i find one willing to co-operate with me."
1.000000	My doctor was a friend of my father. My father used to be a doctor until his death. He always talked about what a great doctor his friend was.
0.840000	I know him as a doctor for many years and how he feels about my condition. Usually he is correct with a diansis and treatment.
0.760000	Overall I do trust what the medical provider says is true and reflects the best course of treatment needed.  \Than on the other hand I do think that because of insurance cost that some treatment options are delayed or not mentioned at all to cut cost.
0.960000	I've been seeing my current primary care physician for 5 years now. I've had Type 2 Diabetes follow-ups regularly every 3 months for that period of time. The staff in his doctor's office are always very nice, kind, and polite. They're efficient, knowledgeable, and patient. My primary care physician himself is very knowledgeable on just about any condition you may bring up to him. He's always been honest about my health, suggested non-medical ways to address said problem, suggested medical ways to address said problem if non-medical wasn't enough or not appropriate for me personally, and been personable in a professional way. 
0.920000	My primary care physician has been very good for me and too me. I have been going to her since my last doctor retired. The doctors that she refer me to are the one's that she trust with the care of her family members and herself. She is also an affiliate in one of the best hospitals in my area.
0.680000	I am a retired RN so I know a lot about medicine, I know the kind of questions I need to ask to understand my condition and I realize the physician works for me and I'm not intimidated.
0.880000	It took me a while to find my current doctor because I wanted someone who listens and seems to care about me. I completely trust my doctor because he is an excellent listener and cares very much about my well being, he takes his job extremely seriously and I can tell he does this because he truly does care for people.
0.520000	Follow up information is idequate.
0.800000	The reason I trust my doctor it is because I have known him for a long time and is a very professional and caring person. He loves what he does.
0.680000	"I have only seen my primary care doctor a couple of times, but she is someone my family regards highly and who has been very good to them. As a result of their good experiences, I am generally inclined to think positively of my doctor and trust her judgement. I do, however, feel I need more time to develop any feeling akin to ""complete trust."""
0.800000	I trust my physician because he has never steered me in the wrong direction. Every time I had a medical condition he has been able to properly diagnosis it and come up with a treatment option. He always offered multiple treatment options that I could take.
0.720000	I trust them because of their experiences and knowledge 
0.760000	Is open to talking with me, never makes me feel rushed.  Listens to my concerns about potential treatments.  Keeps a level head, and is persoble...not a robot.
0.800000	I don't general have trust in many or all doctors, but in my primary doctor I do.  When I have my yearly physical each year, he doesn't rush me and always listens, and patiently answers any questions I might have. 
0.720000	I Trust them because I go there and they make me feel good about everything and they take the best care of me 
0.520000	I have not had my current physician for a very long time and we are still getting to know one another and my multiple physical and mental conditions. We are still exploring traditional and non-traditional treatment methods to increase my quality of life.
0.720000	I trust my primary doctor because she has also been my parents' doctor for a long time, so I can trust her. 
0.880000	I trust my doctor because I do believe he wants to do what's best for me and really help me. I think that they always wanna do the best thing they can for their patients. They are their to help, and that's what they really try to do, in my opinion. 
1.000000	I think that my doctor takes the time to listen to me . She does a good job going over each problem and giving me options . She will explain each one and recommend what she thinks I should do . She is good with following up . If I feel like there is a problem she doesn't just write me off . She takes the time to explore it and make me feel like it has been addressed . She always gives me as much information as possible . If I am not comfortable with something  she is willing to try another avenue . I feel like all in all she puts me first in my health care . 
0.480000	Always rushed, pushing pills for things even if you don't need them. For example exercise and weight loss can help many conditions, but once you are on medication, rarely taken off. 
0.760000	She tends to go above and beyond when it comes to finding treatment options that specifically help me both financially and mentally.
0.760000	I actually recently switched physicians to a PA. The town doctor the PA works for I do not trust at all because he is an jerk but on my form I have the PA as my primary and I trust him completely. He is a friend of the family and has been working in my town for decades. He is dedicated to what he does and very kind. Prior to my recent switch I had a pediatrician who was wonderful growing up and always steered me and my parents in the right direction. I wish I could have stayed with him but unfortunately pediatricians obviously only work with kids.  
0.600000	depends on your condition and symptoms you might have to make several visits to figure out what the problems are
0.640000	Sometimes I feel doctors in general cannot recommend the best course of treatment for a patient if he or she doesn't have health insurance.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has never given me a reason not to. He's always very thorough and he gives me options when appropriate. 
0.840000	I feel very lucky to have the PCP that I see. She really listens to what I say and answers my questions. She doesn't rush through things to get me out and on to the next patient. She is thorough and I am always provided written documentation about what we discussed and any changes to medications. First thing she does is read the nurse's notes of why I'mâ there and the notes made at my previous visit. I get nervous any time I have to see any of my doctor's, but she and her staff treat me with respect and dignity which usually calms me. I have no complaints.
0.720000	Cool ok yeah I like it a lot it cool fun interest nice storm rainy day cloudy in the sky winter day on the snow of the ocean barn b in the frogs one get rich and horse in the deerr
0.800000	I trust my doctor. If there's ever a time that I don't, I don't have a problem getting a second opinion from another doctor. That doesn't mean that I don't trust him as a whole, just that in a certain situation, I would like to know that he is consistent with another doctor. I feel that I can trust my doctor because he seems invested in me. He know about me personally, and he shows true interest in my life.
0.720000	I've known him forever and he's pretty kind.  We have a generally good relationship we've maintained throughout the years and he helped me get back on track with managing a condition I had neglected due to a doctor that made me feel poorly about myself.
0.840000	I trust my primary doctor because I never usually have anything wrong happen when I go to him, when I explain my problem he is usually able to tell me what is wrong. 
0.640000	I generally trust what the doctor says.  Sometimes I have doubts because I spend so little time actually talking to them I feel like they dont have a complete picture of me and my problem.
1.000000	My Dr is a 38 year old female and she's the best Dr I've ever gone to. She is friendly, caring very easy to talk to, has admitted to me that she didn't go into medicine for the money but wanted to help people. I have complete trust in her.
0.720000	He pays attention to detail.  He recommends another doctor if a specialist is needed without hesitation.  He is in the loops if I need to go to specialist.  He does not horse,around about giving medicine that will do the job.
1.000000	I have never had an issue with my physician, she's always right with her diagnosis. She is also extremely thorough 
0.480000	Being given conflicting information then the denial, can never simply admit being human and making a mistake
0.720000	I personally trust my physician, however I do not trust most physicians in general initially. There are so many different outlets these days urging us to try different medicines, it's hard to know who to trust. 
0.400000	my appendix had burst and my dr couldnt diagnose it
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a family friend and has been looking after us for most of my life.
0.600000	Doctord I see are more interested to get clients moving through their offices. The focus on the number of clients rather than quality service.
0.960000	My PCP has invested time in understanding my medical history and general health.  She is thorough and careful in explanations, such that I believe I have sufficient information to make necessary decisions.  She takes a whole-system approach to health, and will check in with my preferences for, e.g., pharmaceutical vs. alternative treatment for an illness or injury.
0.760000	I have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I have been with this same doctor since I was a child and he has been very courteous and helpful with my medical needs. My doctor is located in a small facility so there are not that many patients he sees in a day. The care is very personal and positive. He has a way of talking to people that is very relaxing and comforting to everyone he sees. There has never been a time that I have doubted the advice or treatment he has given me.
0.760000	In general, I trust doctors as they have a tremendous amount of experience, but they are also sometimes rrow in their views of what types of remedies work. So, I trust but reserve my right to question things.
0.720000	I completely trust my physician. The main reason why I completely trust my physician is because I have been going to the same physician for ten years now. I feel like my physician knows exactly how to treat my symptoms. 
0.880000	"I mostly trust my primary care physician because he is usually right when deciding what is wrong with me. But I do have doubt's wondering if he is always right when deciding what is wrong with me because he has said in the past, ""Try this medicine to see if it goes away and if it's still the same come back."" It makes me wonder if the physician knows what they are doing and if he will be able to help the next time I am sick and know what is wrong with me."
0.960000	My primary doctor is easy to communicate with, she provides easy to understand responses and is thorough.  She is part of a larger medical system that provides excellent care.  She works well with other doctors/staff from the larger system.  I can count on her.
0.600000	trust because they should know what they are doing in there field. if they don't then they don't need to be in the health field
0.800000	I trust my doctor because in the past she has encouraged me to seek a second opinion, she has done what she could to avoid surgical procedures (even though eventually it had to be done), and she always gives the most minimally invasive options.
0.520000	not forthcoming with info and seem to rush through appointments.  Also, don't seem interested in the causes of medical conditions or events.  Not interested in probing further
0.720000	My doctors give me the facts. He or she does not sugarcoat my diagnosis. That makes me trust them.
0.640000	what if a doctor is trying to get you on a medication you dont need  i know most doctors help  people some are in it for the money
0.840000	I have many doctors and i view them as a team. There are 10 doctors i see and i trust them to get it right. I listen and i ask quesrions. 
0.640000	As explained before, my doctor doesn't always have the time or the commitment to explain every single little detail. Perhaps they feel it's unnecessary, and that I should trust their judgment. This is somewhat worrisome for me, as I do not know what potential issues might be going on even if the doctor does. This isn't really to degrade the work that they do, and how they treat me, since I don't believe it is done on purpose. Nevertheless, it reduces my confidence in my treatment, or any medication provided. 
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for 28 years he has never steered mee wrong  I haav aalwa trusted him to do what is right for me and he has never let me down.  Always  on my side not his.
0.560000	I trust that my doctor is doing the best he can. I think he is rushed and overworked though and perhaps could just miss things in haste. 
0.920000	My doctor actually takes the time to listen and ask questions and not just talk over me or assume 
0.640000	Doctors make mistakes, MRI's don't show things correctly sometimes and doctors believe the MRI's more then listen to what I am telling them.  Doctors don't consider that I know what I am talking about, and they just assume I am not communicating the symptoms correctly. 
0.720000	I feel that I can trust my doctor. If I couldn't trust my doctor I would choose another that I would be comfortable with. 
0.720000	Overall, I trust my doctor to give me honest answers to my questions. I can't prove they are 100% accurate, however, I have never had an issue with her diagnosis. 
0.800000	doctors have the education that is why it is not easy to become one. all the classes you have to complete.
0.680000	My PCP means well (and I do not at all mean that as a sarcastic comment) but like most PCPs in the days of managed care plans, he is overworked and cannot take the time to really get to know each patient thus some critical things can fall through the cracks unless I make a point of bringing them up to him.  Otherwise, he just orders blood work every three months and bases his whole appointment with me on the bloodwork results instead of, for example, looking at the fact that as a 60 year old woman with severe osteoporosis (due to my osteogenesis imperfecta) I am supposed to be having annual bone density scans.   I have to bring up things like bone density scans, mammograms, etc. to him myself because if it is not a blood test result, it will fall through the cracks.   In his defense, I will say, he orders thorough blood tests, goes over the results with me to make sure I understand them and when I do bring up something outside of the blood tests, he listens and works with me on it.  He is a good doctor, just overworked.  I don't trust him to be aware of my health conditions.  I do trust him to work with me when I remind him of what is going on with me.
0.600000	I mostly trust my doctor, except when he seems to have more patients on his plate than what he can handle with the utmost care at the moment. Sometimes my appointments feel rather rushed and I know he has not had adequate time to alyze every possible solution to whatever problem I may be dealing with, and that he is simply giving the fastest and easiest solution rather than the best one. I know that he is competent and knowledgeable and has always taken care of me, but I wonder sometimes if better care and more close attention is available elsewhere. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care Doctor to take the best care of me. Primary Care Doctors take as an oath to provide the best care. Primary Care Doctors want a good reputation. Primary Care Doctors have great mal practice insurance.
0.560000	I think most doctor's have the best intentions but are rushed or pressured by external forces (billing, administration, etc) to make decisions that aren't always right.
0.560000	I trust my doctor, because I expect that he has my best health interest at heart. Sometimes, this may not be true which makes it difficult for patients when someone they expect to help them is rather callous to their call for aid. 
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I know they aren't going to tell me wrong they have a phd so I know they Aren't going to tell me wrong 
0.560000	I have never been very close with any of my physicians, and I have had several miserable experiences with medical bureaucracy/billing, so I am more apt to view my exchange with a physician as a business exchange. 
0.800000	 I've been going to my doctor for about 10 years and I feel she knows me well. She has been very caring when I had upsetting personal experiences in my life. I definitely feel she listens to what I have to say.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because she listens to my concerns and provides clear explanations and suggestions on how to overcome them.
0.880000	other than she's my best friend and the smartest person i know. there aren't any more reasons needed
0.600000	I trusted my doctor til she turned me over to a nurse practioner in her practice.  I am not confident with the abilities of the nurse practioner although I do like her as a person.  She seems very kind and sweet.
0.960000	My Physician is very open and forth coming.  He tells you everything and explains things to me. I have never had any reason not to trust him
0.640000	Doctors in general tend to over prescribe medications and are not explaining any of the side effects that they might cause.
0.800000	he has been on top of my care and takes the time needed to understand the symptoms and challenges that my condition entails.  Seems up on current practices and thinking inthe medical world.
0.640000	I trust him, he is very nice and kind and seems to care about his patients and wants what is best for them
0.480000	I believe that the doctor may have your best interest cat heart, but that doesn't mean that the doctor knows everything .
0.800000	My doctor always seems very concerned whenever I come in with a serious problem.  He listens to me & tells me what I need to know & do & is always very cordial & understanding.  
0.880000	I have had the same physician for a number of  years, so he knows me very well, and i trust the things that he tells me in regards to my health and well being
0.720000	I trust my physician to a degree.  However, she tends to send me out to specialists a lot...which makes me wonder how much she is really able to treat.  If I have a cough, sniffle or fever, she's fine.  If it goes beyond that....hmmmmm.
0.640000	I overall trust my doctor but there is so much information out in the world regarding health and sicknesses and treatments that he couldn't possibly know everything that is best for me.
1.000000	I have known her all my life she is my best friend that happens to be my doctor
0.800000	I have seen the same physician for 25 years and he has a limited number of patients as he is in semi-retirement. He takes his time and asks questions and explains things in terms the average person can understand.
0.800000	I always trust my doctor she has never turned me in the wrong direction always explains things and has got my health under control
0.600000	I've met many rude doctors in my short life. It seems like there are may people that become doctors for the wrong reasons. When I find a competent and compassionate doctor it almost seems like finding a rare gem. I think most of them are competent of course, but few have what it takes to interact with patients appropriately.
0.880000	I trust my doctor to explain completely, to tell me what I need to know.  He does not trust alternative treatments very much.  I check with another health professional (whom I trust) about those options.
0.680000	You just go to have Faith in the medical profession. What would be the point in going to see a Doctor if you don't take their advice.
0.640000	I am very new to my provider. She came highly recommended and I felt comfortable the few times I have seen her. But I have not had to use her for anything more than basic check ups.
0.880000	My doctor and I communicate that is the key ð to a good doctor patient relationship she takes her time with all patients and explains everything 
1.000000	he is a personal FRIEND OF MINE SO I KNOW HE ALWAYS HAS MY BEST INTERESTS IN MIND NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH HIM OR HIS STAFF
0.920000	Well, These doctors have been to school for this. I like to walk into a clinic thinking that I will be in good hands and that the doctors know what they are doing.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he has a lot of experience in what he does. He listens to what you have to say and then from a medical stand point he lets you know what he feels is appropriate.
0.600000	dont see them that often but when i see them they are ok they are close by which is convenient thats all i have to say
0.760000	he is a position of trust and its his job to help patients, and has a lot of years learning how to do this job correctly
1.000000	My physician has always been very open about what she thinks I should do about any condition that I am curious about at the time.  She has always been very thorough in her explanation of things and questions me as to whether I have any questions at all.
0.680000	I would generally assume that they are giving honest answers, and given their training and experience it would seem sensible to trust them. They would have little reason to deceive me, although some of it involves guessing.
0.960000	While both my wife and I are under care with the VA system, both our doctors spend the time needed to explain what's going on, why something is happening, and the best path to follow, particularly conserning my wife's ongoing condition.
0.760000	I've never been given a reason not to trust my PCP - Dentists on the other hand: don't trust them!
0.800000	"My Dr. is very attentive and willing to talk to you if you have questions. he never pushes any ""drugs"" and always seems to be willing to help you not come bck to his ofice. He is personalble and isdedicated to huis patients. He once saw me without an appointment (ona busy day) because I had no other day in which I could return. "
0.800000	I like to think they do the job in order to help me feel better. Admittedly, I have felt a little rushed in a busy office, but I have never felt like they were deliberately being careless. I think they have my best interests in mind, even though I have had some unsuccessful treatments. I think this is a problem of specialization, as some GP's do not have the in depth knowledge to treat specific medical issues. I trust my GP with my overall health in the end.
0.640000	I think my doctor is very good but sometimes doesn't have complete understanding of my medical conditions.
0.760000	Because he is always honest with me about my health. I trust him because he is reliable, understanding, loving,and a very respectful person. He treats me with kindness that all doctors should do.
0.520000	My doctor is a bit snobbish, so I sometimes worry that he thinks so highly of his opinions that he fails to consider other points of view that might actually be valid. He has a lot of pride because of his immense experience and impressive education. But perhaps he has too much pride. 
0.800000	I do trust my primary care physician. Mainly because she takes the time to listen to what I have to say. And responds to me as if I'm a friend and not a medical record number.
1.000000	He is very open to answering my questions and spending time explaining things. 
0.480000	Some medical decisions are not 100% safe. And I prefer to do all natural remedies first before having to pump toxins in my body that can cause more harm than good. They have some good options but half the time without tests, they are guessing. 
0.480000	Well i think i have to trust him because he knows what he is doing. I think I'm kind of safe trusting him and his methods. 
0.680000	I do not always completely trust doctors. On simple diagnoses yes, I do trust them but as far as more complex health issues I would rather get a second opinion as well just to be certain that the diagnosis is correct. 
0.760000	I trust my primary physician because he has been my physician for years and he has never told me anything that wasn't right nor treated me in a bad manner.
0.840000	Well, I trust the doctors for their knowledge and their experience and that is the most important thing for me
0.800000	She takes the time to read about my cases and issues before we meet.  We generally has several solution to the problem at hand....but to be honest with you I am very healthy for my age, so I only go to the doctor for an annual check up at this time in my life.
1.000000	I tend to trust the professionals who show a passion for the work that they do. If the connection and relationship between the patient and doctor is not present then I find a new primary care physician. There is no room for mistrust in medicine. 
0.920000	My doctor has never shown me a reason to distrust her. When I visit her, she never makes me wait long, she is timely and responsible to any issues I have. If I call her office for a refill, I never have to make a second call like at some doctor's offices. Her staff are professional and responsive. I am quite happy with my primate care physician.
1.000000	I have been seeing my doctor for almost 20 years now. He knows me and I feel like I am at home there. I can come to him with any problem at all and he knows what to do. He has never let me down once. He know when we can speed through and exam but if I have any questions or need to talk he will stay with me as long as I need him to explain or talk to me.
0.800000	He has been practicing for many years with a very solid reputation. He takes the time to listen. He seems to genuinely care about the well-being of his patients 
0.760000	I believe a doctor can treat me of my illness when am able to tell them what my problems are and also when they are able to diagnose my sickness 
0.440000	he is older and not up to date on a lot of the newer advances in medicine and I feel he prescribes stuff to get the perks
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician because he has a good bedside manner. He is effective in keeping up with medical tests that I need to take. He takes care of my whole family.
0.800000	sometime they give false information and don't know what is going on with you or give the correct answer to you
0.760000	BSECAUSE HE ARE SHE WHEN TO SCHOOL TO LEARN HOW TO HELP PEOPLE. I WOULD NOT GO TO THE DOCTOR IF I DID NOT TRUST THEM
0.800000	I have been going to the same PCP for many years and trust him completely, he has never given me a reason to question his practices or choices with regard to my health care and always puts my needs first 
1.000000	I have been seeing my primary care doctor for over 15 years. He is very honest and down to earth. I have always taken the advice of my primary care doctor with excellent results. 
0.960000	She takes the time to listen to my problems, provides thorough exams and refers me to others if it's outside of her expertise.
0.520000	I don't trust doctors because I think they put a band-aid on the problem instead of solution trying to fix the problem. For example, doctors over-prescribing opioids to relieve pain.  
0.840000	I trust her because she listens and discusses with me any health issues or concerns I may have. 
0.440000	"I distrust any doctor because I have had bad experiences with them in the past.  Ultimately I believe they are interesting in making money and nothing else.  Most of the time they seem bothered by your problems and do not listen to what I have to say.  I've been told before to take antidepressants for a pain in my stomach, which turned out to be a cyst on my ovary.  It took FIVE doctors to get a diagnosis that wasn't ""you're crazy."""
0.720000	I generally trust my doctor.  I know he is looking out for my best interest.  I typically try to avoid the need for any medications to take regularly, and I do believe there are problems with certain medications that are pushed on patients.   
1.000000	My primary care physician has been my primary care physician since I was a teenager and she is the provider I take my kids to. When she has been wrong she has admitted it. She fits us in at the last minute when needed, is willing to try more than one thing when I ask and always listens and take into account what I have to say. I worry about finding a new provider when she retires.
0.760000	"I trust my primary care physician for the following reasons: She is always attentive and shows interest in my line of questioning when it comes to description of symptoms, inquiries with regards to preventative maintenance (i.e. discussing future concerns based on age, family history as it relates to my current health, etc.). I never feel rushed during a routine visit when it comes to discussing concerns and overall health strategies. Overall, I feel that she cares about my well-being. My main distrust point with my primary care physician is the ""physical"" side of routine examinations. I feel like she is less comprehensive during the exam than my prior physician with regards to tests and covering all aspects of the exam. This is an additional concern now that I am older and more susceptible to common problems (e.g. enlarged prostate, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)."
0.720000	It very good thing and I like to go to you doing fine I hope you get back to take care myself, you doing fine I hope you get back to take care
0.480000	I find that my PCP is quite busy, and my time with him is limited.   I also find that the information he (and other PCP(s) I have dealt with) offers is not complete, and that I better understand medical issue(s) by conducting additiol research on my own, and also seeking specialist referral(s) and appropriate testing. 
0.640000	My physician is okay, she seems scattered at times and has made mistakes in appointment times or reading records. But nothing that was critical was overlooked. She is convenient, a female, and although an MD believes in altertives.
0.800000	I have complete faith in my doctor's abilities and believe that my well-being is at the top of their interests. I feel there is no reason to mistrust my doctor.
0.800000	"I'm sure there are ""bad"" doctors but I have only had positive experiences. They have been attentive and seemed to genuinely care. I also trust their expertise."
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she went to school for a very  long time and she knows alot more then I know about anything
0.760000	I trust my Doctor because whenever I felt anxious or had doubts about my medical condition she was always available. She always gave me reassurance when I needed it.
0.880000	I normally trust my doctor but I do have ideas of my own for treatment when I think I can use something more tural vs pharmaceutical. 
0.760000	Based on his performance and advice throughout the years. I feel confident in his decisions.
0.720000	It's the same thing or it's something different all the time it's like you wanna believe then again you don't wann believe because you don't know if it's genuine or not 
1.000000	I trust my dr because after not going to one in 14 years, I filly found one and she makes me feel safe and respected. 
0.360000	I just havent had the best physicians. Ive been wrongly diagnosed in the past so there is little trust when it comes to doctors.
0.640000	I do not know my primary care doctor that well. I see him 1-2 times per year. He is very smart and knows what he is talking about, but that's not how I build trust with people.
0.600000	I haven't been seeing them long and when I do it's short. I get basic stuff answered. It still feels like business. Generally I trust them, because when I do ask questions about risks and side effects, it sounds like they're being honest.
1.000000	Doctor takes the time to explore any and all problems. Gives the benefit of his knowledge. Never hurries an exam.
0.640000	I trust my doctor i have been with her over 20 years and i feel they want you to feel better, if you talk to them and tell then what is wrong they will help you 
0.640000	I trust my doctor because he is a human being and doesn't want to see me suffer; he wants to help.  I do believe that he will give me different options that will make the most money for him though.  As long as it helps me, I don't really care.  There may be some options he won't mention due to the fact that it requires me to go to someone else, thereby not giving him the money.  I do believe medicine is based on money, sad but true.
0.520000	The primary care physicians I have dealt with are overworked and unable to completely focus on one case at a time. That is the nature of health care today for all but the very rich. This is just the way it is. I feel responsible for knowing and researching as much as I can for my own good. 
0.560000	"I think most physicians do care about there patients. I have worked with some who think it is a paycheck and like the ""doctor"" title and pay not the work and it shows."
0.680000	I think in the USA Doctors have to worry too much about the bottom line, that is if people do not have high levels of insurance they will not receive all options available to them since they are unable to pay for them. 
0.800000	My primary care physician is always monitoring my results from lab tests and amends my medications accordingly. She is thorough and likes to be one step ahead and is calling me instantly when she sees any information she finds troubling.
0.800000	I feel that my doctor does all that they can to provide me the best healthcare. I have never felt that they were being dishonest with me. They alwayws are open to my questions and doubts.
0.840000	I'm not an expert as to what is okay for my body. If I thought I was dying, I would certainly think about their opinions of possible diagnosis or treatment that was available to me.
0.960000	I have a high trust with my primary care physician because I have been going to the same physician for a long time. If there is something I do not understand I can ask for more clarity on the matter. Long term relation with my physician have helped me secure my trust in all the things my physician say, and I can tell that my physician cares deeply about me.
0.520000	I think many doctors are merely motivated by the prospect of making money rather than helping others. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I have been with her for years . She knows me very well .She can tell when i'm uncomformable about something she recommends and we talk about it sometimes we compromise .
0.720000	For a majority of my checkups they have constantly been meager issues that normally do not require a giant leap of faith. They are there and paid to help people I do not see how there's any opportunity to be malicious of any sort considering they're paid well, receive salary and must have some sort of love for their career path. Not to mention every single time I've ever gone to visit my primary care physician they have always assisted me no matter what and been effective each time.
0.680000	Again, I think that the main reason is my inability to 'self-diagnose' and communicate my concerns with them. There is also something of a mistrust of the system within which they work as there are so many constraints upon doctors due to insurance coding and coverage. It seems to interfere with their ability to offer care.
0.720000	"In my most recent visit, he dressed me down for not having had a mammogram or Pap smear in a few years...he was right. Time just slipped away from me. I was irritated that he wanted a blood test for my estrogen levels, but he gave me a good reason: he wanted to know whether I was getting the right dosage in my estradiol pills (prescribed by a different doctor). All in all, he seemed pretty straight forward and not into ""woo""."
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician, because she always takes the time to listen to my concerns and my symptoms.  She's willing to take extra time to make sure she understands what my issues are, and she offers different solutions to the problem.  She ultimately allows me to make the final call on what I want to do.  Once I decide, she explains the treatment in depth and makes sure I have a good understanding prior to me leaving her office.
0.600000	Some Doctors care about their patients and other Doctors care about their wallet. There are so many sick patients out here that needs help but their not getting it.
0.880000	I completely trust my primary care physician because I have been with him for years, and we have developed a very realistic relationship. He has always been very honest with me in regards to my health, even if he knows it's not something I want to hear, and he portrays how much he cares during our visits. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because she is very kind and compassionate and always discusses all treatment options to understand what is best for me.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because he has built a repore with me. My doctor is very thoughtful, he makes sure he has done all he can and has looked at every aspect of my health
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for several years, and he has always provided me with great care, and I have never had an issues with any of his decisions/ diagnoses. He has a good record of quality and care.
0.720000	The doctor that i have now listens to my problems and does not just push off what i'm having problems with as it's because of what you eat.
0.960000	I have gone to him a few times in the past couple years.  He has always been diligent and has diagnosed my conditions correctly each time.  He had to do a couple small procedures which went great.  I have gotten better each time and have had no complications when recovering.  He has done a fantastic job.  Takes the time to make sure he knows what is wrong and goes over everything I need to know and answers my questions.
0.520000	I don't see the PCP too often and when I do its for a limited time. I don't think the PCP totally knows whats going on with my case because they have to work and think quickly and each patient in unique and treatment should be individualized. I feel like I'm just another patient. Plus I find it hard to believe the PCP knows everything about every case they see. They could be missing something vital. 
0.240000	when i told her i had a cardiac problem she said i didnt. i ended up in the hospital for a cardiac ablation. she was told by my mental health doctor to check my thyroid, she didnt. when the cardiac ablation was done and bloodwork by the hospital they told me i had a thyroid problem.
0.880000	I trust PCP because I have been a patient of his for over 10 years and I have never got the feeling he has ever been less than truthful with me. 
0.760000	I trust my Doctor because I believe he has been completely honest . He is willing to admit when he doesn't have the answer to all of my health concerns and doesn't hesitate to direct me to other Dr. that can treat my health problems.
0.560000	I really dont care to be honest they just doing their job and making money for their families and hopefully friends who they probably make happy 
0.960000	I think he is great. He takes great care of me. He makes sure I do what I need to to feel better. He always listens
0.720000	I've only had one bad doctor in all my experiences with medical professionals. And he was an eye doctor with his own private practice that strung me along, to get me to keep taking many tests. I ended up seeing optometrists at the mall (eye glasses store) and she fixed my problem after one appointment. So now I rather go to a popular and well-known location to see a doctor, if it isn't a clinic or hospital. 
0.800000	i do this with insane force. this month, can buy some steak for celebrate this victory. Perfect oportunity to see you.
0.200000	because they try to lie to me that im going to be fine when in reality im not fine....
0.760000	I believe my doctor has no reason to lie to me unless it happens to do with trying to sell me a pill of some sort. That does not work for me because I can't swallow pills, so the subject usually moves to altertives or something I can do myself, at home,  to help the problem. I think a doctor can tell who is serious in trying to get well and who just wants attention and/or a prescription of a magic pill to get them well. I am willing to do the work to get myself well, so I get along fine with any doctor I see.
0.400000	I have had a personal, plus three familial situations in which--two if the times, two different family members almost died because if a lack if thoroughness and misdiagnoses. I myself was mid handled during a very high risk pregnancy. Each of these times, I mystery of, was forced to tell the doctors what I felt should be considered it done. I must add, that all three if these instances did not take place at my preferred hospital, UVA, where I wish all three of us would have been treated.
0.440000	The doctor has a quota of patients that he has to see to make a profit for the day. this leads to the doctor spending less time than is possibly needed to fully aid a patient
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has never steered me wrong. He's been great in answering my questions and is quite knowledgeable. He's very intelligent.
0.640000	I dont trust any dr because they just want to push drugs and treat symptons rather than practice preventative sickness or injury
0.840000	I trust that he is doing things for a good reason.  I believe that he takes his practice seriously.
0.720000	I feel that my provider has my best interest in my physical well being and takes the time to answer any questions I may have.
0.800000	My doctor has been my physician for over 30 years and he has always been very upfront and honest with his medical decisions 
0.680000	There is never enough time and he is always running late. I wish he would be on time and listen to my issues.
0.680000	I believe that the doctor is looking out for my best interest.  However, I also feel as though he is trying to make money with as little work as possible.
0.560000	i have used the same physician for 20+ years. in the last few years, he has referred me to an orthopedic doctor who i felt was completely incompetent , he has hired a pa that is not  listening to me, is affiliated with a hospital where i spent 3 days in pure hell (incompetence running rampant.), renewed a prescription and then a month later called the pharmacy and cancelled it( it was blood pressure medicine..i can't believe these things are going on in his office without his knowledge..
0.560000	I trust to a point. Aslso as stated he may opt for expedience and convenience whcih may compromise the outcome and care.   its a mix
0.480000	My primary care physician over prescribes, he's given me so many steroidal medications for simple viral infection, just because I have very mild asthma. He also gives antivirals, orders chest xrays even when I have no noise in my chest. It's too much and too often. He also isn't informed about mental health, I tried to ask for counseling and he couldn't find a list, then when he found it half the numbers on it were no longer in service or the providers didn't take my insurance.
0.760000	I normally trust them as I have high hopes and respect to them.I know if they were fooling me because I can somehow sense it. And i always asked my sister about it.
0.760000	HE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT  ME, IS ALWAYS FRIENDLY AND NOT IN A RUSH TO GET IT OVER WITH. NOT AFAID TO TELL ME I SHOULD LOST WEIGHT AND STOP EATING CERTAIN THINGS
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because they have excellent training in the medical field, and have a wealth of other doctors and medical resources to go to as a backup
0.720000	My primary care physician has been generally thorough and helpful, and when he says something is wrong he is very thorough in providing me with all of the information about treatment options available to me. However, I answered neutral for some of my responses because there was a time when I had a lot of non-specific symptoms and eventually began having a lot of pain, and he did not look much further into it and prescribed me muscle relaxers. I visited again and his PA took the time to do a full examition and determined based on my pain that I had fibromyalgia, which also explained many of my other nonspecific symptoms. In this case, I don't believe my PCP was as thorough during the visits I made to him because he didn't discuss this possibility with me. 
0.640000	They didn't go to school that long and learn nothing
0.800000	I trust them for the most part because they know what they're doing and generally want me to get better. The only thing I dont trust about my doctor is the brands of prescription medicine they push because I know some medication gives them bonuses while others don't so I have to research the medications myself to see which is right for me
1.000000	My doctor has been in business for over 40 so years. And he is due for retirement soon. He is extremely empathetic to my concerns and very friendly when I first met  him. I think his attitude and experience have given me a great gift.
1.000000	I have the most amazing doctor who is friendly and open to anything you have to say. He is very willing to listen when you are talking. He has great values and will give you his honest opinion. I love how good his bed side manner is. He makes you feel comfortable as soon as he walks in the room.
1.000000	As I mentioned earlier, I've had the same doctor for a long time. I almost consider him a friend at this point. He may be one way with other people but with me I knowhe's completely honest and cares about my health over his wallet or time.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she's willing to answer questions. I don't ever feel she's rushing me or dismissing my concerns. If I ask about altertives she gives a lot of facts - I like to hear it all and not generalized statements meant to pacify.
0.960000	I have had the same doctor for 30 years and he is like an extended family member, I feel he cares for me and will always suggest what he feels is the best treatment for me, he is very professional with an excellent bedside manner.
0.640000	Sometimes I feel they are only in it for the money. I feel they might order something that I do not need done or some other added expense for no reason. Usually this is not the case and they are usually out for my best interest but I feel they sneak a few things in there. I can usually trust my provider to get me the help that I need and that they are being honest with me and careful to treat me right. 
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he has never told me information that he could not back up with scientific and medical proof.
1.000000	I have been with my current primary care physician for over a decade now. We have developed an excellent rapport. I have no doubt that when I come to him with an issue, that he will be thorough and thoughtful.
1.000000	he is a good man. he is always there for me when i need him even when he is occupied by patients. n/a
0.400000	I have seen a few different doctors over the past 10 years who have not taken me seriously and blew me off â that is when I came in with a list of things I wanted to have checked out, that had been bothering me over the several years that I had not been to a doctor, the doctor barely looked at the list and then told me I was normal and healthy without even checking the things and by the time I left the office I realized I haven't totally blown off. He didn't care.
0.680000	
1.000000	My doctor is excellent.  He never makes me feel rushed and he always takes the time to answer questions for me.  He is extremely thorough when I have to see him about something.  He also has a very human quality about him, unlike many doctors I have dealt with in the past.  He also sees my young daughter and is extremely thoughtful and thorough, more so when dealing with a youngster.
0.600000	Again, it comes down to the fact that people can lie.  People on this planet have an ultimate goal in mind and that is to make money.  So, if a doctor is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company and are essentially drug dealers, how could you trust that person ever?
0.560000	He always seems busy and I have had him misdiagnose something to where I had to return for a follow up and  different treatment due to him not spending the time initially.  I am currently searching for a new DR. 
0.960000	From the past experiences I have had with my doctor, the care/medicines he has prescribed me has always helped. Also my doctor makes sure & give me the option to choose the medication instead of forcing it on me.
0.800000	My doctor is open and honest with me. He is very thorough in his examinations and he seems to listen to what I'm saying to him. 
0.600000	Physicians are so busy I feel like they do not always take the time to fully listen and give all options. I trust that they would not put me in harm but I don't trust that I'm always given all available options. They are also highly restricted by insurance companies drug coverage etc.
0.480000	They always mix things up in the go so doctor report and most of the time they are wrong and if I go somewhere else they tell me something different
0.760000	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind. At the end of the day he will do whats best for me even if it causes him an inconvenience 
0.560000	My doctor doesn't thoroughly talk about any diagnosis. My doctor also seems to always be in rush. I appreciate though that my doctor does seem to take an interest in being there and providing steps.
0.600000	I think most doctors have good intentions. Why spend all that time in school just to mess people up? 
0.760000	I have been in a situation before that could have been life threatening and he made a decision and did a procedure that saved my life
0.760000	My physician is not perfect, but nobody is. Despite this limitation, I can trust him to competently assess my situation and recommend appropriate actions. My doctor respects my intellect and will discuss the medical situation with me so that I understand and buy into treatment options. Although he is trained in standard care protocols, which are short-sighted remedy-based approaches, I can evaluate the alternative options myself and competently discuss them with my physician. 
0.800000	They have been my doctos for awhile I believe it was when they tell me things. They haven't steered me wrong thus far.
0.960000	Usually my primary care physician had more experience and knowledge than me, and they know better what they give to everyone
0.760000	I trust him, but the things I'll take a neutral position on are things like pharmaceutical drugs. I don't like taking them and I'll always do my own research to see if there are other things I can do before trying them. If there isn't, I'll grudgingly take them.
1.000000	I completely trust my doctor. She takes a lot of time to listen to my concerns and answer any questions I may have. She never makes me feel rushed like a lot of other doctors. She works on a gameplan to treat something with what I am most comfortable with. Most importantly, she was able to quickly diagnose a foot pain I had been experiencing for months which gave me a lot of confidence in her abilities.
0.720000	Doctors today have a lot on their plate. As a result, they are squeezed into a role which makes them sometimes unapproachable. That means they have to rush through appointments to get as many in as possible. As a result, they are not able to spend the time they need with each patient, assess their needs, and prescribe the right treatment. If a doctor takes the time to assess and communicate with me concerning my medical needs and condition, then I trust him or her. I figure that they know more about medicine than I do, and they are willing to take the time to find out what I really need, medically.
0.560000	I do not feel that I have known my primary care person long enough to say whether I trust or distrust her. I would need more time to make a determination.
0.760000	I don't know my doctor all that well, but I believe her sincerity, and that she cares about how I am/feel.
0.880000	the most doctors are very skilled and human, so in this way, all of them are very trustworthy and helpful to their patients, and i have complete and total trust on what they say
0.520000	I distrust my primary care physician because I have family members who works at hospitals and I can see that the doctor only cares about how many patients they can see and donât care to find out the background of a personâs daily life and see what is affecting the person and trying to solve the problem slowly. They would rather prescribe instant medication to stop the problem from spreading but does nothing to get rid of the problem or be proactive about the problem next time. We basically have to solve our own problems then go to doctors to get the drugs. 
0.800000	My primary care physician cannot and does not treat all of my health issues, but I trust him to refer me to specialists who can help me.
0.200000	I donât think some physicians are open enough to modern medicine or understand the muscles and skeletal systems in the body or how we can hold so much internally. Some are more open minded then others.
0.640000	I generally think they are looking out for me and have my best interests at heart. 
0.640000	I trust what is said, but sometimes I feel like I am not a person to my doctor, and he could misread my symptoms.
0.840000	I have complete trust in my family physician.
0.200000	They don't listen to the patient.  They give you therapy before they even xray anything.  Everything is either your dehydrated, to walk, go check your eyes and other hairbrained answers.  I wish old school doctors still existed.  These young ones are terrible.
0.240000	He does not listen.  He does not take my opinions into account.  He focuses on his objectives without considering other factors.  He is uncaring and does not follow standard protocols.  He literally blackmailed me into taking a drug I have serious concerns about, disregarding the threat(s) to my health that this drug creates.
0.480000	You can never trust a doctor all the way good or bad. Some times they out for money sometimes they want the best for you. 
0.320000	I canât get a straight answer from my doctor.  I feel that he is vague and afraid to commit to an answer. It makes it hard to trust doctors in general.
0.960000	I trust my primary care doctor because he has been seeing people in my family for over 40 years. Most of my immediate family go to the same doctor and he is very persoble and a straight shooter. He does not beat around the bush when he needs to tell you something.
0.480000	I feel my doctor is not concerned about me I have health insurance and he is getting paid. I get feel he does not want to touch me.  I am just another number he is rushing out to see the next person
0.840000	I have had the same PCP for about 5 years and she has never made me feel rushed and always asks thorough questions about the status of my health. When I have had any problems she made sure to order the appropriate testing.
0.840000	He has always been correct in the past.  He treats me with respect.  He does not order unnecessary tests, but does order those that cannot or should not be avoided.
0.640000	I think that they will try to keep me sick so that they can make money off of me for as long as they can.
0.720000	I really have no distrust at all. At the end of the day it's still a job. They are helping everybody so you can't care for everybody just find a solution to their problem and on to the next one.
0.800000	I've been a patient of my doctor for some time and we have developed a very good doctor patient relationship. If I do not feel comfortable with something she informs me of then I question it and vice-versa.
0.800000	He always seems to care about my health. He takes time to explain and talk to me. 
0.680000	I mostly trust my doctor but I also know that sometimes doctors have other interests in mind. Example, if a new drug has come out and insurance will give the doctor a bonus for each patient who prescribes to said medicine for a certain medical condition, the doctor may persuade you try it if it pertains to your treatment even if it's not the best course of action for you 
0.800000	My primary care physician has demonstrated competency in his profession to me. That is the primary reason I have for trusting him. The medical problems I've had over the years have been solvable, and my primary care physician has always assisted me in that regard. He also trusts my judgement on my own health issues and will issue necessary prescriptions by phone if he's convinced that I need them.
0.600000	I feel as if some times my doctor is not listening to my whole story. I try to say something and it is sometimes disregarded when I believe it would be important to take into consideration.
1.000000	She is very knowledgeable and experienced.  My Dr. is also very honest and open when she communicates with you. She treats you like a person. 
0.480000	This is more about the doctor I see most often which is my gastroenterologist, he always seems to be pushing me to non-generic drugs even though I like the way my body reacts to what I am currently taking.  I also feel he pushed me into an endoscopy I did not at all need, just to get another year supply of a drug I depend on.  All in all that cost me $2500 out of pocket that I couldn't afford at the time. 
0.880000	she seems to listen and takes time to hear all my questions.  also available for emails.  her staff is also very kind and attentive
0.760000	I believe you have to trust them. If I'm not mistaken they sign some oath to verify they will be honest and forthright with patients, and do what's in there best interest.  Also they make good money, and if it was found out they were being deceitful it would be hard for them to find work.
0.800000	my doctor is no nonsense and to the point. he does not sugar coat things and has never kept anything from me. trust him implicitly.
0.480000	They take oaths I disagree with I know pharmaceutical sales reps who tell me info about drug pushing To many politics with insurance 
0.960000	He is super good the best  I had he give all kind of tests  ask a million questions  my other Drs.  just gave gave out prescriptions.
0.840000	I've known my doctor for a long time. He always takes the time with me answering all the questions that I have.  I never feel rushed.
0.880000	My doctor is compassionate, well trained, well mannered and knowledgable. I trust that my doctor goes above and beyond for her patients.
0.440000	I don't believe a lot of drs continue to study about new medicines and treatments that are available.  It is difficult to have faith in someone when that is the case.  Not only that, how do you really know you dr is a good one?
0.920000	I trust my doctor because she always lets me know the truth. Even though she tries to make me feel comfortable, she gives me the negative effects and tells me the truth about what can happen to me if I don't take care of myself.
0.480000	I don't trust to many doctors because of the reputation they've been given and how they work with the insurance companies.  I believe money and insurance companies have an influence on the treatment a fixture prescribes.
0.800000	He's been a osteopathic physician for many years and takes the time to listen to my concerns and suggest options for treatment.  He's open-minded and not the least bit dismissive.  His judgment is sound and his demeanor is caring. 
0.800000	My doctor has my best interests at heart.  On more than one occasion, she has gone above and beyond what would be expected.
0.960000	She is thorough and she actually listens to me. She wants what is best for me, but doesnt put me through unnecessary testing.  She is kind and follows up. She is quick to answer questions when I ask
0.840000	My physician is caring and empathetic. She doesn't talk down to me when she is explainging or answering a question. She is thorough and takes her time. 
0.840000	My GP knows more about medicine than I do and the only way diagnosis and treatment will work is if I participate and do my best as a patient.
0.480000	Dr Barbie seems competent for the most part but sometimes she ignores information that I give her because it's inconvenient. Once I persist she usually comes through but why do I have to justify legitimate concerns?  If I had any doctors that weren't as arrogant, I'd change, but I haven't. At least, she prescribes what I need instead of forcing me to stair step through options that don't work
0.680000	My doctor is very straight forward and honest but he's not rude about how he explains things to you. He always explains situations to the best he can so that you understand what needs to be done. 
0.880000	First she is a woman, I trust female doctors over male. She listens and even argues with about taking care of myself.
0.520000	too busy and they can't be bothered to sit actually listen to what you have to say. your just a number to them
1.000000	I trust my primary physician because I know that they are professional and here to help in the best way they could
0.640000	I've only been with this doctor a little over a year, she seems pretty good and She had me believing that she knew what she was talking about
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for many years through everything I have been through if she didn't know the answer she would always ask for help or investigate to get the answer I have never had any problems with her judgement or decision.
0.480000	I have been with my GP for almost 20 years.  Over those years, he and I have built a sort of rapport that I have come to trust.  Unfortunately, in the last year or so, something has changed.  He is less tolerant with questions and does not give  you much time to discuss your concerns.  He is more concerned with getting you out of his office and moving on to the next patient.  I am currently looking for a different  GP. 
0.800000	i talk to him ask questions have specific discussions about my concerns i trust him based on researched information and talking with him
0.760000	When it boils down, a doctor is still a human and all humans are prone to error.  I believe they are obviously more educated on health subject matter than me, but I don't necessarily put 100% trust that they know best all of the time. 
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he has always given me good advice. I have never felt the need to get a second opinion. He takes his time and is thorough.
0.800000	Overall, I'd like to think that most doctors have their patients' best interests at heart. Through all of the knowledge they've acquired, their able to help change people's lives.
0.600000	I haven't been seeing my PCP for that long.  For a long time I didn't have one, and this Dr. was one that was accepting new patients.  I find her manner rather brusque and hurried, I actually need to make her stop and answer questions.  I get a lot of my information from the nurses, but i want to hear it from the Dr.  She seems to always be thinking about her next patient instead of me.  I feel like I don't hold her attention for even the five minutes she spends with me.  For that reason, I will be looking for another PCP, it's just hard to find one that will accept new patients.
0.760000	My doctor is patient and takes the time to answer any questions I might have. I never feel rushed in his office. He also never seems pushy, and gives me all of my potential options. He's never pushed a medication or treatment on me. His bedside manner is excellent.
0.640000	i think i trust them because they know alot about me and they are they to keep me safe.Without we wouldnt know what is wrong with us and how to keep up with our body
0.440000	It is my opinion that a lot of doctors are just out for the money and they want to rush you out and get the next patient in.  I do not think all doctors are like that but I do think that when someone is looking for a blocked or to choose they should really make sure they feel comfortable that they're getting treated properly.   Also if you have something majorly wrong with you I believe that a second or even a 3rd opinion is a good idea.   I believe it's called a practice because no doctors perfect and every doctor it continuously learning.  When experience I recently had is I was sent to the emergency room with a stomach related problem the doctors was full and I got sent to the heart floor for an overnight visit.   They gave me an EKG even though I was not there for my heart in charge me anyways even though I disputed it.   I am they're young and have a very healthy heart there was no reason for that.
0.880000	I don't have any reason not to. My parents and a couple of my friends go to the same practice and I know they all like it there as well. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor, she asks good questions and always seems to take the time necessary to understand my needs. She doesn't seem in a hurry like other doctors I've seen in the past. 
0.480000	I do not have a primary care doctor. I rarely see a doctor. In my experience doctors always have bad news so I really don't have much trust in them. When my husband was sick there were a few doctors that were honest and thoughtful but the majority of them seemed disinterested and made the wrong decisions because they did not take the time to get updated on his condition.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he cares about my health and needs hes very patient and understanding he keeps me informed
0.560000	I have neutral trust of my doctor. While I do believe he primarily acts with integrity, he will spend 20 minutes lecturing me on healthcare issues that I'm not there to address, leaving the real needs unattended. Namely, he spends the entire explaining to me that I shouldn't drink at all, ever. In return, I lie and say I don't drink. 
0.960000	HE is very detailed and asks lots of questions and takes his time to answer each question and provide concise answers
0.480000	Not always the case for your on good  to make you better in the long run it so much better life.....
0.760000	He has a lot of medical knowledge, and he cares a lot about his patients.  Most recently I went into see him to get a small internal bump in my inner thigh examined.  After he gave me a physical examination, he determined that it was not cancerous and posed little risk as he thought it was a cyst.  He gave me multiple options:  do nothing, an ultrasound, or surgical removal.  The fact that he gave me multiple treatment options shows me that he cares about my needs, and I am grateful that he puts a lot of the care decisions in the patients' hands while taking to explain the pros/cons of different treatment options.
0.600000	I do not trust anyone off the bat you have to earn that trust is not free in this world it has to be proven
0.560000	"It seems in the last 2 years that my primary doctors practice has quadrupled in the size of patients, what use to be a 20 min wait is now sometimes 1.5HOURS, they seem to put 6 people in 1 time slot - this makes your time with the doctor feel rushed, and then you forget to tell them some of your symptoms which are important. This makes for mistakes in every angle - diagnoses, blood work etc, it is not that I fully dont trust my actual doctor, its the craziness of the practice and the feeling you are on a ""food line"" and they are not really totally focused on 1 patient - so every one loses in the long run - I have had nurses so confused that they were trying to give me a flu shot 2x because of the amount of people in the waiting room and at the nurses lab."
0.760000	I mostly trust my physician because they are a close family friend. They are usually pretty straightforward and honest with me.
0.840000	Just general anxiety from test results. The people I deal with are all very good and do all they can to make me more relaxed. 
0.920000	my doctor is up on everything as he goes to conference. He also knows pharmacolical answersMy daughter who is the hospital CFO recommended him.
0.680000	I went through few primary doctors. Some are trustable more than other. Over all i trust them because i don't know any better than them. Of course, i make sure i understand what they are saying and what they mean. What are the advantage and disadvantage of particular medicine or treatment before i make my decision? If i  have a certain condition and if i don't trust them then that not good for my health. If i am doubtful then i will take the second opinion. But i will not ignore completely what my doctor is saying.
1.000000	I feel that my doctor has my trust because she is always willing to provide me with information as well as make sure I understand everything before I leave, she takes the time to show compassion for me.
0.720000	I think my doctor is smart and knows what they are doing.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because my doctor hasn't given me reason not to. She answers any and all questions that I have.
0.200000	My doctor's seem to be laid back and more concerned with quantity than quality, coming up with treatment's before even fully diagnosing a situation
0.720000	I trust my doctor. However, I recognize that she is very busy, probably over-worked, and cannot take the time she, herself, would like to devote to her patients. It is not her fault how quickly she has to work and I know that she does the best job she can do given the situation. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician based on 4 years experience with her. I receive my care through VA and I know she's always busy, but, hey, she even laughs at my jokes.
0.800000	My doctor is a humble, caring person, who takes the time to go over any and all results of any tests. Also listeners to me when I tell her what is going on with my body.
0.680000	I have been going to see him for about 10 years and he seems to do right by me I can't really say what things he has done wrong as he seems to do me good..
0.800000	My doctor never seems to be hurried and answers all of my questions in depth.
0.760000	the personal treatment they give me gives me a sense of how the physician cares about my health. As though they are more knowledgeable about me than i am. I'm a little distrustful of residents who have not had a lot of experience  because i get the feeling they're just guessing or they're not to confidant of there diagnosis  
0.800000	I have a lot of trust in my primary care doctor. My first meeting with her was a little awkward because it seemed like she was a little distracted and it took a little time for that feeling to go away. Subsequent appointments have been much more relaxed and she has been pretty easy to talk to. She always gives thorough explations and goes over my lab results with me, paying closer attention to anything that has changed since my last appointment. I feel very comfortable asking her questions. She gives me time to ask questions and give me good answers. She also hasn't hesitated to give me referrals to specialists when that has been needed. Overall I find her to be very helpful and knowledgeable.
0.800000	i had a few good doc in my life they were was honest about my diansoses.helped in any way they could.understood my phobias oh i forgot to menction i have anemia too.
1.000000	I trust her because she answers all of my questions whether they're dumb or not. She goes through each problem I'm having thoroughly and breaks it down for me so I understand what she's saying. 
0.640000	my primary care physician helped save my life, he was able to find, diagnose and treat an illness that could have killed me
0.760000	when visiting with him he spends a great deal of time explaining and going over all my questions and advises me of all the wrong things I do and tries to have me correct them
0.680000	i like my doctor because he listens to me and has a lot of experience with different medical problems. he is personable and is smart about medications, side effects, different conditions, and health insurance
0.800000	I feel most doctors are not hands on enough and can began to make stupid mistakes from it further training. 
0.800000	My dr is caring and competent. She listens to me and always is able to pinpoint and fix my problem. I trust her opinion and feel confident she has my best interest at heart
0.960000	I trust my primary doctor because she tells what I need to do and what not to do. I have no distrust in my doctor at all. 
0.920000	My primary care physician has already proven her abilities to me. Three years ago I almost died from an acute COPD flareup that just would not get better. My Dr. took care of me, made sure I understood what was going on and how much danger I was in, hospitalized me and treated me. she then changed my whole maintenance med routine to improve my overall health. At this time she was the ER Dr on duty not my primary care Dr. After that hospitalization I changed her to my primary care Dr. I knew I would never find a Dr more dedicated to my health and I trust her 100%
0.200000	I believe all people only care about themselves and would take care of number 1 before anybody. In general people can not be trusted.
0.640000	I do not have a primacy care physician, but I do feel that not all humans are perfect. As such, not all doctors are going to be perfect either and can either make mistakes, or purposefully mislead a patient for personal reasons.
1.000000	doctors are trained to take care of you they go to school for years to do this most of them are good honest people
0.520000	They seem to care more about making money than patient's care.  They seem to be more like auto service repair people than medical professionals.  They try to offer services that patients do not need.   In addition, they barely spend time with patients.
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician, but have no problem with trusting a doctor with my care, as I have in the past.
0.880000	i trust my doctor totally.......when he prescribes a new med or feels i need test done.......i discuss with good friends and they all agree with his treatment.
0.840000	I haven't had too many experiences with doctors, let alone bad experiences. I trust doctors for the most part and tend to take whatever medicine they provide me with. But if that medicine isn't working, I'll start to doubt my doctor.
0.720000	Most time my health got recover after seem them.  Their got high degree and was well  train. 
0.680000	I think my pcp is adequate. She is nothing stellar and does her job. She sometimes need prodding to complete tasks such as refilling scripts. I need to ask her to look into things that are causing me problems and many times, I come away without an answer or a generic diagnosis.
0.920000	He is the professional with access to studies regarding medications and illnesses.  If I didn't trust in him, then do not know where I would turn.
0.600000	My doctor is getting old a d is probably ready to retire.  Its time to find a new dr but im not one for change
0.720000	Because we are supposed to trust our doctors. If there was no trust we wouldn't be with them. Most doctors have a fairly good patient doctor relationship. 
0.560000	She doesn't act like she is too concerned about my problems. She speaks over top of me. She doesn't do proper testing or know about the specific diagnosis, so smuts hard for her to recommend me to the proper specialist.
0.280000	I do not trust my doctore since when I talk with him alone he is rude and makes me feel bad for my depression. Although when I am with my parents he tries to be respectful and acts very different. I have never felt comfortable around him.
0.600000	they do not want to see you back again in a few weeks so they are inclined to give you better treatment. 
0.440000	I don't trust my doctor completely. I had a great doctor but he transferred and I got stuck with this guy. I want to change doctors but I am still trying to give this guy a chance because maybe he will get better with time. I know that he tries on his diagnosis but have found that I have had to go to a urgent care more than once because he doesn't get it right.
0.480000	They are human and they make mistakes as well. They are not always right about everything.  Sometimes they don't know and they are guessing about your diagnosis.
0.520000	I don't think my doctor has 'bad intentions' towards me or any of the other patients in general, but I do think that It's just a job to him. In a hurry to get to lunch, and in a hurry to get on with his day like anyone else when they work that much.
0.680000	For the most part, my Primary Care Physician actually listens to what I'm saying. Because I do experience anxiety, I've had previous doctors that brushed my symptoms aside as simply anxiety and not an actual problem. My PCP isn't like that for the most part. She has questioned if it was my anxiety but believed me when I told her I could tell the difference and that it wasn't. What I don't like about her is the way that she treats the med students. She literally told one in the room with me to not ask so many questions. That made me nervous because that's how people get killed is by not asking questions.
0.800000	My doctor is a very knowledgeable and personable man with a very good bedside manner.He cares about all of his patients and has a very strong desire to heal.
0.600000	I would prefer that all the information relative to my body be listed and discussed and added to the procedure of what we're going to do with my body.
0.920000	I trust my doctor completely.  She is very up to date on things and knows how to explain in my language.
0.720000	My primary care physician is a resident student so its hard to fully put trust in them because at some point they will be gone.
0.800000	They can get into a lot of trouble if they lie to someone. I also haven't been mislead by a doctor yet in my life. A lot of medical information is easily verifiable on the internet nowadays too, so if your doctor is lying to you it is easy to find out.
0.360000	My primary care doctor never ask me what I want or how I feel about a treatment, she just tells me what to do. She wanted me to remove my gallbladder but never asked me if I was ok with it or if there were altertives. I cured myself with limonene. I feel i no longer need her help most of the time.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she's honest and I feel that she care about me and my family. Ive been going to her for several years
0.360000	I do not think that he like women or respects them as much as men. I feel like he talks to my husband with respect and caring but dismisses me when I try to tell him my mental health issues.
0.960000	I'd be dead without her. Always having my best of interest and making sure I'm fine, physically and mentally 
0.360000	I typically do not trust doctors. They seem to be rushed and not look at people's problems as a whole. I hate when doctors only want to look at one problem that you have and not look at your body as a whole.
0.440000	Like i previously stated i feel that physicians dont listen or care about me but only the masses and fixing a large number of people and not specifically me. So personally i feel alone and afraid because i am the only one interested in my health and well being.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have had him for along time.There is nothing that don't trust from my doctor.
0.800000	I trust that my doctor gives me the best options for my care, and that he considers what I might need or already be taking before prescribing anything.  I do realize that sometimes mistakes can be made, but I feel that he will try and minimize these mistakes.
0.680000	I mostly trust my primary care physician, because I have been seeing this doctor consistently, and I haven't croaked yet.  For the most part, I believe this doctor has my best interests at heart.  However, as a general rule, I do not trust anyone completely.
0.600000	My doctor understands my pain an what I need she talks to me for hours an dose her job right I believe in are 100%
0.760000	I do trust my doctor.  I have been seeing the same doctor for about 15 years and I know him very well.  He always has my best interest in mind.
0.800000	my doctor is there for me when I need him to be - he takes the time to listen to me and answer and questions I might have. 
0.960000	My primary care doctor is always ready to be there when I need to talk to him and if he can't be there a nurse is always available to get back with me. He is available by phone 24/7 and that is a comfort to me. I have been going to him for several years now and also my brother has been going to him too. Makes sure appointments are set up so that I don't miss any. Explains things in a layman's language so that you can understand what is going on with you physically and what you need to do to take care of any health problems that could arise and to keep me healthy. Makes sure that all vaccines are up to date and that I get my flu shot every year. Very happy with him. Also my dermatologist I am very happy with..He is very up-to-date.
0.600000	I've recently switched doctors and only seen the new one once so I haven't formed a real solid opioion yet, but so far she seems nice and interested and takes her time and listens when I talk so far all is good. Time will tell. 
0.680000	I feel that I trust my doctor when they do checkups on me and then review my test results and such, i trust their judgement
0.880000	I have been going to my Primary Care doctor for a few years.  Any concerns I have brought up she has addressed honestly, but in a caring and comforting way.  I am not talked down to and I am often presented with information and options. 
0.440000	I think that a lot of doctors would rather have you get on some medication that might help you some, but would cause side effects that would make you have to continue going to the doctor, rather than really emphasize the importance of changing the things that people eat, so I don't trust them too much in that regard.
0.880000	I think my doctor is a good doctor and a good person who cares about his patients and works very hard. I rarely completely trust anybody because I overly cautious. 
1.000000	because my primary care physician tells me everything no need to know weather good or bad.she dose not hide anything from me and is always in my best intrest.
0.800000	I trust my provider because they are very good at explaining all the options available to me. She takes time to listen to my concerns, even if it isn't very serious.
0.760000	For the most I trust my physician. I do think that doctors need to spend more time with there patients. 
0.320000	I can never get a straight answer out of him. Every time that i go to the doctor feeling bad he tells me i have a virus or just tells me that he isnt sure what i have, but he will still prescribe steroids or antibiotics. Sometimes i worry that i may have a serious problem that wont get fixed because he doesnt put the proper care into figuring out what is wrong with me.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because they always listed, answer my questions, and never seem to rush thru the appointment. If something is wrong, they always make a follow up phone call.
0.760000	I have concerns about certain issues my doctor seems to just not care about or tell me its normal when i know its not normal for me, i dont like the word normal when it comes to health care because nobody is the same.
0.800000	I totally trust my physician because she spends time and talks to me on various subjects and tells me what are all the pros and cons of various disorders. She is straightforward so I guess I am lucky. Whatever I expect from my doctor I am getting from her, be it anything even if I am hesitant she makes sure I am taken care of and I am in good hands
0.520000	I think doctors at times will push what is easiest for them or what they think might be a option that is a little more costly when the risk is not too high. I feel like anything else doctors are out to make money. They may ask you to do unneccesary tests as well at times.
0.960000	Trust but verify, using the popular vercular: Never buy a pig in a poke!
0.560000	I live in a small town and our doctors are not known for having the best track record for getting diagnosis correct.  We usually use our Primary Care Physician as a way to get to a specialist for a true diagnosis.  I do not let my children go to a local doctor, if they are ill we travel over an hour to take them to a pediatrician's office in a larger city.  
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because they're very helpful. They always answer any questions I may have, no matter how silly they might seem
0.680000	I mostly trust my doctor, but sometimes I feel as though the doctor may think some of the things that are bothering me are insignificant.
1.000000	I love my doctor,I recommend everyone to my doctor but it took 4 doctors before I found him,before I found him I hated doctors they did not listen or care what you say my doctor will sit and talk to me for 20 mins he is great and he does not push pills he believes in fixing your self or your diet,he is great.
0.760000	I generally trust doctors to provide a reasobly high level of care with persol integrity. However, I know that as in any field, there are fincial, administrative, and moral/ethical pressures weighing on these professiols. I am sure that sometimes they feel that they must go against their preferred ways of behaving and communicating with patients.
0.840000	I do trust doctors for the most part, they have the education and experiences above my own. I think that the trust I put in my doctors, as well as the research I can do on my own, makes a good team in my healthcare.
1.000000	I completely trust my primary care physician because he has gone above and beyond in handling my illnesses.  There has been times when I have gone in for a routine check up and he sent me directly to the emergency room.  Upon arriving at the emergency room I was informed that my blood level was severely low.  He has recommended me for four surgeries and I have felt a little bit better after each. 
0.800000	He's always been there for us and has had good results in treatment. He hears me and has addressed my needs. So far he has been good at curing us.
0.760000	My doctor has always taken the necessary time to go over any questions or concerns I may have, even if that meant she was going into her next scheduled appointment late
0.800000	My doctor is well-trained and has plenty of knowledge and experience. I have never felt like I was being rushed out the door. They always talk to me with respect, and for as long as I need.
0.560000	I don't really have a primary at the moment. For doctors in general, I feel as if some of them are good and some of them are bad. Some are only interested in themselves and making money and other actually care. Its a toss up. 
0.440000	I do not think I do not trust my doctor, I just think she is rushed. She always has a ton of patients and book them so close together to make money that the care suffers. She rarely has time to talk about any concerns she is more in and out of the room. 
0.880000	I trust this person to provide me with the medications I need to live a long healthy life. Even though they may reccomend a more expensive option for their benefit.
0.680000	I found my doctor because he is agreeable to treating the thyroid with natural thyroid supplements, as opposed to most doctors (who will prescribe only synthetics, which actually harm the thyroid over time.)  My doctor recognizes my copious research into my condition, and works with me, with my suggestions, with the hope to improve my condition.
0.440000	"I've had a bad history with doctors. They tend to condescend to me, to pick on me for my weight until I get compulsive and self-destructive about my eating habits, and give me drugs that wreak lasting havoc on my system and then just shrug it off (""Oh, well, that doesn't happen to most people.""). This one seems good, like he actually listens, but I'm still wary."
0.600000	i trust my doctors to a certain extent but you cannot trust anyone completely. i dont have any specific complaints about my current doctors. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she takes the time out to thoroughly listen to what's going on with me. If she can not find an answer at first  she travels many roads to do so.
0.560000	I have general trust as he has been working for many years and has usually fixed my ailments. However, I do feel that he is getting lazier as he nears retirement and sometimes wonder if he suggests medications due to relationships he has with pharmaceutical companies.
0.920000	i have been seeing my doctor for twenty year now. i trust her with my health and my hubbys health.she takes the time to listen to us. and explains treatment plans to us until we under.she sends us to a specialist if need. she finds the best medicine and treatment for our condictions.
1.000000	I trust my doctor i know that wind i go see them she take her time in doing what she do make shore all my test are up to date
0.560000	I don't have a primary care physician, but I've seen several doctors during the last year.  Two of them prescribed treatment which I agreed to.  One doctor did not tell until after the treatment that I would need to have surgery to have the problem corrected completely.  I would say most doctors can be trusted, but some cannot.
0.480000	I have self diagnosed before I go to the dr. and had to push for the dr to ask for a test . That was contrary to his diagnosis. He then did the test and I was  correct. It was very frustrating !
0.840000	My doctor takes all the time I need him to take to explain everything I want or need to know in great detail.  He respects the fact that I do not like taking pills, and is willing to work with me on lowering my dosages to the minimum effective dose for my condition.  He explains all my options thoroughly, and does not let me leave the office until he is sure I understand them.  He will also squeeze me in immediately if there is a sudden worsening of my condition.  
0.520000	"I am not willing to allow a physician to ""put me on"" a batch of drugs that have  adverse side affects so I am not the type of patient most doctors want.  I will listen to their reasons for the recommendations and then weigh what I may know about a drug and whether my symptoms are bad enough to take the risk of the side effects.  "
0.800000	I have a god relationship with all of my doctors.  They always take as much time with me as necessary
0.760000	my doctor has given me no reasons to doubt his thoroughness and ability to treat me.  I trust he gives me good advice and wants me to be as healthy as possible
0.680000	I trust them with the family and friends and family and friends and family to the hospital and I will be there for a while to get it from the other day when 
0.680000	I trust my doctors in general because they have much more experience than I do and would imagine that would lead them to make or suggest the right options for me in regards to my health.
0.840000	Past experiences in hospital and evaluations,Help given to family and friends,hospital meeting to discuss treatment and future options
0.640000	Sometimes doctors does not explore all the options available and they sometimes treat people differently because of race or status
0.560000	My doctor is pretty conventiol and doesn't explore any new avenues of thinking. Sometimes I have to offer him ideas on what might help me.
1.000000	My doctor is very trustworthy. She takes her time with me and explains everything And also if I have any questions she will taker her time and discuss and explain everything that needs to be
0.600000	my doctor always seems rushed and doesn't always have time to listen to my concerns. I typically get the bare minimum and then look things up online for myself
0.440000	I do not trust doctors in general because I believe they are trained to treat symptoms and not to get to the root of the problem, which, is often related to lifestyle or environment. I feel that sickness is very politically fraught, and that a doctor who was truly honoring the Hippocratic Oath would be obligated to be politically active and to advocate for improved environmental and economic conditions for the poor. Essentially, I feel that doctors and the medical establishment have a vested interest in maintaining people in a state if illness which requires ongoing treatment, rather than helping people become optimally healthy and teaching them how to improve and maintain their own health. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor implicitly. He is more internal medicine, so I have been able to see the same doctor since I was a child. My parents saw him, I even have a couple friends who were delivered by him. He has been practicing medicine in the community for decades longer than I've been alive, and he's always had excellent bedside manner. Everyone loves him. 
0.480000	Doctors are taught to go by numbers or by what testing says.  They do not listen to what their patients symptoms.  I have hypothyroidism and have normal numbers but I still have symptoms.  My doctor insists that my symptoms have nothing to do with my thyroid.  I have done my own research and know for a fact that other thyroid patients have symptoms despite having normal numbers.   I wish my doctor would listen to my symptoms and not my numbers
0.800000	I trust my physician because she has been my doctor all my life and nothing has never went wrong with me while under her treatment.
0.800000	I trust my physician to do what he and I both think are correct in keeping me healthy and protecting my medical records
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctors because he has always been straight with me. He listens to me and answers all of my questions. If he doesn't know he finds out and tells me later.
0.800000	I haven't had him long but so far he is very caring and listens to what I have to say.  I bring a list of questions when I go and he lets me ask and gives thoughtful answers.  Doesn't blow me off like some.
0.640000	I do not have a PCP but I do see a dermatologist. I also used to work with this person so I have seen him give numerous patients medical advice including myself. I feel that after years of practice he is very knowledgeable about what he is doing and I trust the way he treats myself and others. I feel that the longer you are in practice the more knowledgeable you become. 
0.760000	I feel like not trusting a doctor is foolish. It takes an incredible amount of dedication, smarts, and experience to become a doctor. I trust experts in most places where it makes sense, unless something seems off about them. I might be less inclined to trust a doctor where I was not as sure of his credentials, like maybe in a third world country. I do not have a primary care physician to think to but I would like to think If i Did, I would place a great deal of trust in them to give me accurate advice. If I did no trust the doctor, I would pretty quickly find a new one.
0.800000	In the past several years, I have visited and communicated with my PCP for several times. I am satisfied with the experience of each visit. There is no way to complaint at all. I also communicate with other patients and they share the same opinion with me.
0.200000	I do not believe that doctors know much about a lot of problems that have not been discovered and wrongly diagnose people very often with something based on very little research or facts. I also believe they are sales men for pharma company more then they are doctors who want to help people.
0.640000	I trust my primary doctor because he takes the time out to talk to and get to know each patient and ask questions that you can't answer with yes or no
0.600000	My primary care physician tends to present options to me and suggest one of the options based on what he knows about me, such as waiting to have surgery performed for something that is not life threatening but may cause more issues in the future than what it does now. He also listens to my concerns and addresses them in an understanding way.
0.600000	Health system is so costly everyone seems to be able to become easily wealthy on their patients expense. High medical bill, high medicine cost, high everything.
0.840000	I trust my doctor a lot.  Like me, she is a woman, so I know that she has gone through some of the same things as I have.  She spends a lot of time with me and really explains everything.
0.600000	I like my primary physician but she often seems rushed. I'm sure she is honest but not always sure she's thinking very much about what I tell her.
0.600000	"I have a disability and I have found that some doctors will try and say that it may be related to something else, and try to prescribe courses of treatment that are inappropriate and do not work. So some doctors will behave in such an unprofessional fashion, just so they can be credited with ""curing"" a patient."
0.880000	I don't distrust my primary care physician, but I'm cautious in general and if there's room for a second opinion I will always consider getting one. I'm not too trusting either but I trust that being he/she is the one with the medical degree that I'm in the best hands possible and I let them do their job.
0.680000	I do not hesitate to ask questions and make sure they know what i want and what i expect. i do my homework so i am familiar with my options ahead of time. i make sure i let them know what options i am interest in and give them the opportunity to discuss those options with me.
0.680000	It is true that if he did try to explain all of the different medications to me and what they do, I probably wouldn't understand and the meeting would take too long and cost me more money, but for the same reasons, I can't have complete trust in him because there is so much I do not know.
0.840000	I have never had a reason to distrust my physician.  I most often go to see the physician assistant, and have trust in her as well.
0.720000	I have been with the same doctor for 3 years and she actually listen to what I have to say and offers her best remedy and prescriptions to fix what is wrong or needs repaired.
1.000000	I trust my physician because she seems very sincere when were are discussing my health. She listens and does not make me feel like I am paranoid. 
0.720000	So far my doctor has been good to me. When I see him he gives me good advice and tells me the truth about my situation.
0.800000	I completely trust my primary physician because he is aware of my health issues and can suggest me with good care.I believe Doctors always work for our betterment.After God we have to trust God for cure.
0.840000	I have always had a good long term relationship with my PCP. I see him several times a year even when I feel fine. Health checkups, flu shots a vaccinations ...we are always on good terms. If there's a problem, he won't sugar coat it..he'll be direct and honest...I like that.
0.640000	I have a nurse practitioner and trust her and doctors in general. However, I think it's important to educate ourselves on our condition and possible treatments. Doctors and care providers may overlook some possibilities. We have to keep in mind that they are seeing many patients and we have our own health, and maybe our family's, to look after.  
0.560000	I can trust my primary for basic everyday issues like a sinus infection or acne. But she is not a specialist and doesn't habe experience in more unusual issues.
0.640000	They make their choices baswd on their best knowledge. Sometimes they can be wrong. I only put complete trust in God.
0.600000	I've only seen her a couple times but she seems really nice but I'm not sure how thorough she is. They are busy so who know how much they actually think about each patient
0.800000	i trust my physical because if there is any problem at any time of the day, i know she will be there for me. 
0.720000	At times I feel I can trust doctors but there have been times that I have been uncertain with a few doctors.
0.880000	I'm very knowledgeable about health, but I also don't have md behind my me.  I find that being able to colloborate with a doctor works better for me and my health goals.  I have more faith and trust in a doctor who I mesh very well with and can have dialogue with.
1.000000	She is very caring and listens to everything I have to say and takes a lot of time doesn't rush with my appointment
0.600000	He is not very knowledgeable about my condition called hypothyroidism but I have done a lot of research and know more then he does so that makes the matter complicated
0.960000	For one, doctors go through many years of education; they strive and work hard to gain the knowledge needed solely to help others. This career is a selfless one. Also, any health and medical situation I've been in, the advice and/or medicine prescribed has worked efficiently to fix the issues. I've no reason to not trust doctors. 
0.920000	I know him personally, he goes to our church and we have his home phone number.   He is great with our boys, always has a second to talk if we have a concern, is thorough but not overbearing, hasnt been wrong about anything yet and you can tell he genuinely cares about us.
0.680000	It seems to be really easy to trust a physician.  I believe this way mainly because a person who has obtained that level of job and status has dedicated their entire life to getting to that point, and why would they want to be untrustworthy and not provide the best care possible if it were to put their job at risk that they have literally dedicated their entire life too.  However, many physicians may abuse their power or even be untrustworthy because they want to take advantage of you and make as much money as possible. 
0.800000	I feel comfortable talking to my doctor(s), and if I have questions or concerns I don't have a problem asking. Also, if there are side effects I ask about those, or potentially alternative treatments. I have always felt that my doctor was able to explain things in a straightforward way that I understood. 
0.760000	I generally trust doctors as I only see doctors who I have done a lot of research about - to see that they are generally revered in the medical world. I believe if they are that successful and well known, I can trust them. However if it was an ER doctor, I'd be cynical. 
0.640000	The only reason why I have some distrust in my physician is because she is quick to prescribe medications sometimes and isn't the best at explaining all the side effects and that makes me not trust her to the highest extent. She is pretty good overall thats the only issue I have with her. 
0.880000	I trust my doctor to give me the most up to date information concerning my health and well being.She emails me when I need to keep up with my chronic condition appointments concerning my diabetes.I get frequent emails with my lab results and information that my doctor wishes to relay to me.
0.680000	I trust her because she has more knowledge than I do on medical situations. I have slight distrust because sometimes I feel she rushes with patients and just gives the easiest solution instead of taking each individuals health differences into consideration 
0.640000	they do a good job.i trus there work.am happy with there work.why not there here to help us.i will be working with theme for a long time.
0.560000	I think sometimes doctors get more money-minded than how they care for their patients. They have a tendency to sugarcoat whats wrong with a patient. I prefer that they are open and honest with me when it comes to mine and my familys health.
0.440000	He is more interested in turnover than quality care. He wants to get you in and out. He presumed you're an idiot.
1.000000	I trust my doctors because they help me get what I need for my kids and make sure they are healthy.
0.800000	I have found them to be educated, compassionate, trluly concerned, and have my best interests at heart. They take the time to answer my questions and allay my concerns.
0.560000	You  can't  put  trust  in  anybody  to  a certain  point  ,  you  can  weigh  the  many  options  out,  but  you have  to make the  best  choice   for  you
0.760000	She is the best doctor i know helpful concerned and strait to the point always informs me on what i need to know
0.880000	I usually trust my doctor since she is a health care expert.  However, if I need surgery, which is very serious I always try to get a second opinion.  Also, if I am diagnosed with something I always get a second opinion.
0.600000	I don't trust the newbies sometime because there new but I feel like why would a doctor deliberately
0.800000	She is very thorough in her exams and tests for everything. I would rather someone be too thorough and have nothing come up than slack off and miss something. She is very knowledgeable and has not given me a reason to distrust her. She reviews side effects of medications thoroughly and even goes over medications that have been prescribed to me by other doctors. 
1.000000	"My primary care doctor has been part of my life for 26 years! He & I know each other well & have ""grown"" over the years."
0.720000	I truly trust my primary care physician because they always provide me with all of the information that I need to stay up to date with my health 
1.000000	They haven't let me down yet. I trust them because every time i went to them with a problem, they always took care of it. They always manage to give me what i need to fix my problem without any negative side effects
0.920000	I have had the same primary care physician for seven years.  We have mutual respect and trust in each other.  My primary care physician is very credible, highly credentialed, and always professional.
0.680000	I have had concerns dismissed before without a good explanation, which is why I don't have 100% trust in my doctors, however, most of the time my doctor is willing to listen to me and provide the information that I need.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because I would think he knows what he is doing, at least I hope he knows what he is doing. I've only had one doctor in the past that I don't think he knew what he was doing and I found another doctor.
0.680000	he listens and explains things very well.my family has been a patient of his for over twelve years and everyone understands his explainations and plans for treatment.
0.720000	I trust my primary care, however sometimes I feel like she doesn't have all the information and that she's just trying her best. Sometimes I leave feeling confused. I feel like she is honest about all the different treatment options available, I just feel like she doesn't give the correct info because she doesn't know. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she has a calm cool confident professional manner. Asks questions that are appropriate to my condition.  And always answers my questions truthfully. 
0.560000	My physician is currently near the end of her fifth pregnancy and sheâs pretty tired.  I expect things will get better but Iâve been relying more on her nurse practitioner.
0.760000	I have completely trusted my physicians in the past.  We just moved so I am still trying to find a physician I can truly trust.
0.840000	I think they have the knowledge to know what is wrong and it seems reasoble about what they are telling me. I see no reason to distrust them until they prove me wrong.
0.600000	Do not go to doctor. If I feel good, there is no reason to waste mine or the doctor's time and money.
0.560000	Many doctors are too busy to listen to their patients. Some have a horrible bedside manner and it makes the patients feel uncomfortable to ask important questions. If a doctor is to be trusted, they need to listen to the patient. They need to show compassion and understanding, while maintaining a professional demeanor.
0.800000	I have just never had any problems. I've been seeing the same doctor for years and years. I feel like there is no reason to not trust her.
0.800000	Although I do generally trust my doctor there are times when I feel I am seen as a patient and other times when I feel I am seen like one more hurdle the doctor has to get through before his work day is done. Sometimes it seems it is a quick examination and a treatment and throw me out the door. 
0.680000	In general I have a great deal of faith in doctors, but I know they are very busy and there is an intense amount of knowledge they would need to synthesize in order to truly be able to find the best course of action for everyone. I believe they try very hard, but from personal experience I know that often several courses of treatment need to be tried before the right one is found. I don't think badly of doctors for this, nor do I think it is from neglect or mal-intent. I think it is just a result of the complicated workings of the body and the fast amoutn of medical knowledge that exists.
1.000000	If I didn't have trust in my physician I'd find one I do trust.  This is somewhat of an absurd question.  My physician ALWAYS explains things, is upfront, takes necessary time and explains everything 
0.360000	To many doctors only have book smarts. if  something isnt a  text  book case they dont believe in thinking out side the  box  
0.760000	i trust my doctor with the upmost respect as long as i provide him with details on what is going on with my body and he/she can elaborate on my health
0.800000	Because for the most part the have a pleasurable bedside manner. And I am well versed in whatever to malady may be.
0.960000	Well I have known him for a long time and he is a good guy. He has never made a serious mistake in regards to helping me so I have great trust in him. He is also always quite nice. 
0.640000	I guess it is I trust my doctor to make decisions and help find answers. It is the unexplained sickness or pain that seems like all doctors avoid. You always have to see several doctors instead of just a few and that's when it seems like your being pushed through the system. If someone finds something, or another test is run.. I want to know why.. and what the findings are. Some don't let you know anything after tests are done.
0.640000	i trust my primary care physician for their knowledge of medicine.  but you have to ask question about your illness and the treatment you are being asked to undertake
0.720000	Giving me information about my laboratory results in a broad way and explains every detauls whats going on with my condition
0.240000	I was in extreme pain for a very long time when I finally decided to go to the doctor. I told my doctor where my pain was and how extreme it was. At first she treated me for something way off. Of course I was still very sick and hurting. I went back and told her what she treated me for was not right at all. So she sends me home with a bunch of muscle relaxers which made me sick. After 2 months of trying to follow her patient plan I went back. I begged her to refer me to a specialist and it turned turns out I was right and she was wrong.This is why I do not trust doctors. There are several times when they are wrong.
0.720000	I generally trust my physicians, but I'm not afraid to ask questions or challenge their proposed approach if I'm aware of something they may not have considered. If my treatment isn't working, I'll do some research on my own and come back with questions the next time.
0.800000	my doctor is paient, lookinks me in the eye sk me question as well i feel like i can ask my doctor question she tell me what shots , treats, examesi need  friendly, honest, and i feel she has my best interest at heart.
0.720000	I trust him because he has been right on his diagnosis so far.
0.800000	I generally trust my primary care physician because outside of the fact that he's gone to school for a long time to be a medical professional and knows a heck of a lot more than me, he also seems like a good person, who actually cares about his patients. The only reason I don't have complete trust of him, is he's still human, and humans make mistakes. Even Doctors.That being said, even though I trust him, and the diagnoses he may make, or the medication he may put me on. I'm still going to do my own research on the topics at home.
