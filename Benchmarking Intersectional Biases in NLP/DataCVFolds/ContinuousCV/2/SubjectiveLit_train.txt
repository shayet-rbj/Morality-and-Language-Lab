0.750000	I am ok and if I have any questions I can usually have them answered quickly
0.616700	I feel that I have some capacity. Sometimes it is difficult to get or understand the right information. It is also sometimes difficult to get healthcare professionals to work with you.
0.883300	I work in the law field and am comfortable reading dense material, so, generally information that you get from doctors and pamphlets/info is written in a way that most people can understand it. 
0.916700	I feel as though I am quite capable. About as capable as a person can be without actually being a doctor.
0.850000	I feel that I can do all of this in a full capacity. I am a young person who is capable of understanding everything doctors tell me. A background in medicine doesn't hurt either. 
0.783300	I believe I can. It's not hard the basic level stuff. It's other stuff that I'm worried about like super specific stuff like what the drugs are made of and what not. But usually I trust the doctor knows what's best for me.
0.883300	I definitely am of sound mind and ask tons of questions to my doctors, to the point of being annoying. I want to know everything since in the end, I tend to make the decisions about care.
0.733300	I went to college and fully understand basic health information and have access to google.
0.733300	I feel that I have basic general understanding but I feel that I am talked to above what I understand often.  I try to ask questions but I usually remember more questions after I have left, or done more research online to better understand what I was told.
0.872200	I am quite confident in my capacity to obtain, process and understand this information, I am far less confident that medical professionals will give me the correct information or that they even possess the correct information in the first place.
0.627800	I feel like I can understand it at a limited level. If I have questions I usually ask or I take my mom who is a retired nurse and she explains it. 
0.900000	I research stuff on the internet first. I am comfortable talking to my doctors about what I have found and questions I have.
0.916700	I always listen carefully and when unsure I make sure to have them better explain it
0.866700	I think I can understand most of what is happening when I go if I don't then I ask the doctor or call them.
0.622200	Some of it is fine, but most is very hard to understand
0.872200	In person, I sometimes have issues because I'm not always able to process all the details. But after the fact, as long as I have a written summary, I can always look up what I need to, ask follow-up questions, call or email or contact people otherwise to get the information I'm looking for.
0.755600	I think I have the capacity and intelligence to ask the right questions and to understand my basic health information.  
0.916700	I feel that my ability is perfectly adequate. My mental health is poor, but my comprehension is perfect. I rarely need to clarify anything.
0.394400	The drs just kind of talk over me and make it hard to know what they are talking about. they quote numbers of this and cognitive that and things that I don't understand. I sometimes have my mom to help me but we are just simple folk who don't know what they mean most of the time. it's frustrating
0.672200	Honestly, a lot of times doctors and nurses use words that are too big for me to understand.  Sometimes I am able to understand what they are saying but I would say for the most part I am not able to understand much of what they are telling me.
0.783300	I feel like I can ask the right questions, however some doctors seem to lack social skills and have an issue relating to their patients. They give answers that don't mean anything to a normal patient.
0.916700	I have a very good ability to do this.  I'm well educated, plus my wife used to work in the field.
0.888900	I am already a medical student. I have extensive experience understanding more than just basic health information. I am trained to do so.
0.644400	I feel that if there is something that I don't understand then I can look it up on a computer.
0.838900	Having word in the medical insurance and claims industry, I feel well educated on what type of questions to ask, how to research what I need to know, how to read the forms and how to find assistance if I need it. 
0.783300	I feel that I am smart enough to understand most materials handed to me. I come up with my own questions, and occasionally ask them.
0.916700	I believe I have all necessary skills to adequately understand my basic health information.  Furthermore, I am able to make the proper decisions.
0.772200	I feel very confident that I have the capacity to do these things. I am confident in my knowledge of medical terms, conditions and medications. I am comfortable asking questions and relaying the information I need to my doctor.
0.916700	I feel that I am knowledgeable enough about my own health and atomy to understand what doctors are saying.
0.900000	Well, I'm a healthy 43-year-old with no mental disabilities and a good education, so - yeah.  I'm not stupid, I can read, I can make these decisions for myself.
0.916700	I think I can understand most if not all medical information presented to me and if I had questions I am confident I know who and how to ask.
0.900000	I always ask questions if I am confused about something. If there are questions I forgot to ask, I go online and search for the answers on Google. I am always able to find enough information to understand what is going on with my health.
0.916700	I am very educated on health. And if something is new I read up on it and ask questions
0.711100	I feel like I have the capacity needed. Sometimes some terminology doesn't make sense, but I can quickly research what it means. I am overall confident in understanding medical information. 
0.811100	I am very confident.
0.733300	I feel confident in my ability to read, understand and ask necessary questions.  I am comfortable with the reading skills and my listening and comprehension skills.
0.600000	Not a special health decisions
0.833300	I feel like I am very much capable and knowledgeable enough to make basic health decisions. I feel like that because every time I go to my doctors office they always answer my questions and if I have any problems they are just one phone call away.
0.861100	My body is crap - my mind is still 100%. Well...maybe 97%. I have no problems with this.
0.850000	I have been filling out health related information for a long time. Not only for myself but my husband, children, and siblings. I know to ask about what I do not understand because it could be reason for a misdiagnosis
0.611100	I feel that I'm a smart person.  My mind is sharp but at the same time doctors and nurses are sometimes so vague and trying to just wrap up the appointment so they can get their money that I just go along with it
0.916700	I can the capacity to learn anything I need to learn, process, and understand. Whether I fully understand or not it's my right to make decisions on my body whether I want to take something or have a surgery or not but it wouldn't be for a lack of understanding what's going on. 
0.916700	I have everything I need to fill out information and explain and understand medical situations
0.872200	I am quite confident in my ability to do so. I studied medicine in college and am usually quite capable of learning and understanding basic health information.
0.816700	I feel like I can obtain and understand basic health information to make important decisions because I am educated and have no problem handling forms. I don't mind asking questions if I don't know something because nobody knows everything so it is important to always ask questions for clarification. 
0.872200	I feel I can process and understand health information with ease. I've yet to have any significant difficulty. 
0.705600	Yes, I do, however, I don't think Doctors care so much anymore. My grandfather was a radiologist. In those days everyone had a good Doctor and they could afford to see him. My grandfather says his father was a doctor in the depression. People paid him with chickens, eggs and milk. I think barter might be a better way to have a doctor. Now when you say you have no insurance or state insurance they won't even make an appointment to see you.
0.916700	I feel confident about my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. This leads to confidence in making appropriate health decisions. 
0.888900	It's really not me... it's the doctors. I'm sure you've seen that they have 20min, 15min, even 10min appointments... they don't give you enough time to process what they say, to allow you to form questions. 
0.827800	I feel like I know a lot about health sciences because of going to school for occupational therapy and understanding many of the basic medical terms and understanding the basic health needs we should possess. If I am ever confused by something, what I usually do is repeat what they said to get a confirmation of that topic or what I need to follow. I generally am pretty good and understanding how to document everything I need to for my medical history and what not.
0.455600	I feel like I can make decisions confidently.  I just have trouble with all the stuff you got to deal with when you are sick.
0.833300	I'm still mentally aware. It's my body that's falling apart.
0.705600	I think I have an average ability to comprehend everything. I went to school for medical assisting and worked in health insurance claims for years. So I do have enough working knowledge to read basic health information but from time to time I need help to ensure I'm understanding everything correctly. 
0.872200	I believe I can grasp the information I need about my health and if I have a question I don't hesitate to ask for clarity and especially in writing.
0.872200	I have great confidences that I can process health information. If anything is unclear I will simply ask about it to make sure its clear. 
0.900000	I feel confident that I can obtain and understand the information I need. I am lucky though that my health issues thus far have been pretty simple. I have not needed any complicated treatments.
0.805600	I feel I have a good amount of knowledge. Im not afraid to ask questions and often times I will ask too many questions. This allows me to make I understand. I have trusted doctors to turn to
0.605600	I would understand to an extent but may need help with the paperwork.  Or google a few medical terms to help me
0.516700	I feel that I have the ability to obtain it, but I have less of an ability to process and understand it. There have been many times when I've wondered what a medicine was supposed to be doing for me, or times when I struggled to fill out forms (about myself!). I think there should be guides for some of these things.
0.816700	I am confident in my ability to process and understand the information. I always ask questions when I'm not sure
0.827800	I think between my parents, friends, the doctor's office themselves and the internet I have a fair shot at getting all the information I would need. My doctor is very friendly and I have no problem asking her for advice on medical issues.
0.616700	I can understd and process the basic health information.  However, when it comes to specifics with my conditions, I have trouble sometimes.  I also have trouble explaining what it is I feel, and that might be an issue in this too.
0.644400	I feel I am capable but sometimes need help filling out forms.  I often forget the minor details of things and my wife always remembers.
0.461100	I think it is hard because there are so many different factors and what if this choice isn't the best one you don't really know all the health information to make an informed decision
0.750000	I feel like I am capable of doing all of those things.  Sometimes I feel overwhelmed in appointments and forget.  Sometimes there is too much to process and I am not thinking clearly 
0.722200	I think I have a reasoble capacity to understand basic health information.  I do feel rushed sometimes when I visit the doctor, but their offices have been very accommodating about call backs when needed.
0.866700	I feel I have a healthy capacity to understand health information provided to me or asked of me in medical settings.
0.850000	I feel fully confident. I am young and proficient in English and paperwork matters. I also work in healthcare.
0.688900	I feel for the most part I either understand the material or think that I can look up the information that I don't understand.  I feel that I have good judgment for the most part and probably make wise decisions regarding my health, and would if I needed to.
0.872200	I am well educated enough to understand almost all medical information and to process what information is provided to me. My main issue is making sure I advocate for myself in asking questions, especially if it's with a provider I don't know well.
0.594400	I think I can comprehend most of it. There are some big words I don't understand which I usually try to get help with. It it usually easy to understand when someone else explains it
0.888900	I have the capacity to understand and process health information.  I've never needed help.  If I don't understand, I will ask the doctor, nurse or Google it.
0.916700	I am intelligent enough to understand medical discussions. I can read and understand printed material.
0.872200	I do completely. I am smart, educated, good with words and basic science. I understand quick
0.916700	II HAVE FULL CAPACITY. I REFUSE TO WALK AWAY UNTIL I FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY HEALTH. IF A DR REFUSES TO GIVE ME THE ANSWERS I WILL FIND A NEW DR.
0.900000	my doctor has a health portal that i can log into to get info on my meds, conditions and I can contact my doctor through it.
0.850000	To the highest degree I feel that I am capable of processing and understanding basic health information simply because I have family who has worked in the medical field. They have always told me that I should ask and answer questions with honesty because what I do may affect their plans for me such as medication or therapy. 
0.888900	I believe I unstand biology and science well enough to communciate with medical professiols.
0.916700	I have a complete ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information

0.866700	I am confident in answering all questions concerning my health. Also in reading medical papers.
0.722200	I think that I have the capacity to understand and make appropriate health decisions. I have wonderful doctors that I have chosen for the most part. Sometimes I just have to be sure to ask all the questions that I have. I have to learn that they cannot read my mind.
0.811100	I feel like it isn't that hard to get clear information on what I need. Even if I don't bother asking someone, Google is right there to provide additiol information.
0.633300	Sometimes I do. When they start giving probabilities and percentages, I start to lose them though. I prefer black and white explations. 
0.822200	I'm coherent and somewhat intelligent. I feel I have the tools to make appropriate decisions about my health.
0.561100	I feel like I do understand but would rather get a second opinion. I'm not a doctor or anywhere near that field. I'd like to be equipped with the right information.
0.833300	I feel that I have the knowledge and comprehension skills to get what I need from health care providers. My doctors are good about putting it into terms I know and my best friend is a nurse. If I need any additiol understanding, I ask him.
0.888900	I don't really know how to answer this. I'm capable of understanding and processing information, I'm capable of retaining information, and I'm capable of alyzing information and making decisions. 
0.916700	I believe I have the necessary capacity to obtain, process, and understand the information. I am well-educated and English is my tive language. My reading comprehension skills are high and I learn new things quickly.

0.666700	I have a good capacity to obtain information because I have past experience in the medical field and I know where to look. Sometimes, the information seems technical and I would prefer conditions and medications were explained in layman's terms. If I have enough time, I can alyze the date given to me and find satisfactory information in it.
0.844400	I feel like I have a really good degree of capacity to understand health information. I spend a lot of time researching health conditions online as well as feeling fairly well educated myself, so I don't have problems understanding.
0.850000	I have had some medical training (EMT) so I understand a lot of what I'm told.  If I have any confusion, I simply ask.
0.800000	After seeing a doctor for a condition, I am comfortable to look up more information on my own to help me understand it. sometime it feels rushed when I see a doctor, there's only so much time you have to ask questions. 
0.783300	To a moderate extent. I feel like all of the information is available if I know what to ask or look for, but I don't always know what to ask. 
0.655600	I have a pretty good capacity. I make sure to read closely all materials given to me. I also make sure to ask lots of questions to make sure I am making the right decisions. I also research on the internet to make sure I understand.
0.577800	I have an okay time with it all. Not the best but I try and see things through.
0.883300	To a great degree I have the capacity to obtain and understand. I graduated with a bachelor of science so I am familiar with technical information. Anything I don't understand, I can research on the internet.
0.772200	I have the cognitive ability to ask questions and understand the answers to them. I believe that medical professiols try their best to give you all of the information that is necessary so that you can make an informed decision about your healthcare needs.
0.916700	I think that I can understand the information pretty well, I've never needed help filling out forms or anything regarding healthcare before.  The only time I've been confused about something was when I got insurance (for the first time) and wasn't sure where to put the information on a form.
0.872200	I believe I'm capable in all of the above matters. I can comprehend all needed information provided from my health service provider. If I happen to be confused on any aspect of it, I will ask them to clarify. Overall, I'd say I'm totally able to fathom, interpret, and use all given information.
0.816700	I think that I would, somewhat competently. I would probably need a little help parsing written information and organizing it all in my help, but I'd probably be able to do most of it myself.
0.766700	I feel like I can understand 90% of what is being told and explain.  One in a while  I have NO IDEA what they are talking about.  
0.855600	I'm pretty confident I have the ability to ascertain what is going on.  I will usually ask if I don't understand something fully.  My doctors have been pretty good in explaining everything thoroughly though anyways.
0.866700	I work in the research field specifically in mouse models of colorectal cancer. I feel that my background in health-related research has been beneficial in ebling me to identify useful, reliable source for medical knowledge.
0.594400	A basic level of ability.  The forms and all are confusing at times and sometimes I feel awkward discussing things with a doctor that I don't know that well.  
0.916700	I have complete ability to understand all basic health information.
0.916700	I have no issues understanding and dealing with health issues and how to handle them. I am an educated person and have no problems comprehending what my doctors or nurses tell me.
0.688900	I have a basic understanding, however it does not mean I think the process is easy, or understandable by any means.
0.900000	I am completely capable. I grew up with a chronic illness, so I learned to advocate for myself,and ask the right questions.
0.850000	Normally, I have no problem understanding what they are telling me.  Occasiolly, when I encounter someone who doesn't break down medical lingo into easier terms, I do have trouble but don't have any problem asking for clarification.  
0.794400	I am confident that I can obtain and understand basic health information and services. I'm more than capable of seeking out information I need, the issue is moreso that I sometimes don't bother to ask.
0.872200	I feel I am better than average.
0.738900	With the power of the internet, I can find most medical information. Understanding it is a bit more difficult but it can be done if I really want to put the time in. 
0.916700	I don't feel like I have any problem getting information and understanding it.  If there are things I don't understand I am comfortable asking for help or gathering further information.
0.622200	I have a general deal with health field from experience having sick children, my father and myself. 
0.688900	I feel like I know most of what I need to know when it comes to health information. When I don't have information I need, I can find someone that is able to help me.
0.844400	The only thing I have issue with is knowing my family history, and my immunization record - if it's really needed, I have to talk to my mom.  But I have excellent reading comprehension, know how to search for and then synthesize information I want, and know my own preferences well enough to be confident in my judgments.
0.783300	I feel good about it. I've also gotten better at asking questions that I need answered in a way that helps me understand better. It's very important that I know what's going on with my body.
0.916700	I feel that I have full capacity to get the information that I need and to understand it.  If I ever feel that I don't understand something I ask for it to be explained.  Also, I always ask questions.
0.755600	I don't even understand that statement.  Why do doctors go to school for 10 years to learn all this jargon and I'm supposed to understand it with nothing
0.494400	I feel like if I asked more questions and did more research I would be better informed but I put off both as]king questions and doing research for later and then never actually do it, so ivery often don't know the proper info about the prescription meds I'm taking and what I can't and can't take with them.I know the info is all out there but I just get too flustered to do anything about it. 
0.883300	I feel that I am willing to admit when I need help understanding something from my doctor.  If I am unsure of what is being discussed, read, or asked about, I will seek out a source to clarify my confusion.
0.888900	I have a higher capacity than the general population but not as much as a healthcare professiol of any sort (nurses, MA, doctors, etc) because my son was in the hospital for a time and I have to help my mom understand forms about her and my grandmother. I know the questions to ask.
0.883300	I have the capacity to obtain and process any basic health information I require. If I don't understand something, I ask questions of the relevant health professiol until I do, or I google it. I can easily search out answers online.
0.705600	I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I am usually hesitant about health related things and I like to double check my information and sources to make sure I am doing everything the right way. 
0.738900	I feel that this very needed.  It is hard to understand some of the information they tell you because I feel they need to dumb it down for me. 
0.722200	For the most part I feel like the information is available. But often the medical staff or doctor is rushed and they seem impatient and rushed.
0.811100	I think I am as (or more) capable as most people. I always assume that I will need to do my own research because I don't trust that my doctors (and certainly not the insurance co) have my best interests as their first priority. 
0.622200	im pretty confident i can handle it myself 
0.805600	I feel like I can understand basic health information. The only problem I would have is with technical terms related to the medical field. 
0.644400	I feel like I sometimes am able to obtain, process, and understand health information and services to make appropriate health decisions, but not all the time. For example, when it's busy at the pharmacy, the pharmacist isn't always available to answer my questions about prescriptions. And when I visit the doctor for an acute problem, I can rarely get my chronic issue questions answered without having to schedule another visit.
0.916700	I am capable of understanding my diagnoses and seek the medical help I may need
0.761100	I can understand most of the information but sometimes the way it is phrased or written leaves me feeling confused or lost. In the past I have struggled with reading some details. Sometimes I have just skimmed the material and signed even when I don't understand it.
0.855600	I believe I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I research online or talk to trusted friends/family who are knowledgable in healthcare in order to ask the right questions.
0.522200	I believe that I am able to moderately understand the things presented to me
0.661100	I believe I understand enough that with the help of my doctor, I could make a choice. I don't think I could do it on my own, but also don't think I'd have nothing of value to add to the conversation.
0.827800	I do feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information.  There might be times when I feel uncomfortable asking follow up questions or forget or don't think to ask something when I am in the office with the nurse/doctor
0.594400	I believe I do have the ability to access the information but often it comes from outside sources. I often feel rushed or intimidated by my medical staff and do not speak up to ask the proper questions, or I become so overwhelmed by the dismissive or hurried mood they have that I sit quietly instead of taking up more of their time.  Sometimes things don't make sense and I am too passive to speak up and say anything, and then often have to research it at home myself, which leaves me wondering if I am finding the correct information or not. 
0.883300	I feel I have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have no trouble with this. 
0.744400	I think that I understand basic health information when its given by health care professiols. Sometimes I can forget things related to nutrition after I am told, but for the most part I think I have a pretty good grasp on this type of information. 
0.716700	I think if the problem is just basic health, I have no problems. I am old enough to have life experiences that make me understand the basics. It is anything above that level that creates problems.
0.883300	I would ask questions to the doctor about anything I didn't understand until I was satisfied that I knew what they where telling me.
0.838900	I think I pretty much have a good handle on understanding things, as well as seeking out reliable sources for information. As an example, when I was diagnosed as being BRCA1+, the oncologist said to me something like she didn't think she could tell me anything I didn't already know.
0.755600	I can read and understand most of the information and questions, sometimes I have questions about what it says, and how to deal and live with it.
0.733300	There are plenty of ways thourgh the internet to get information or direct contact from the nurse or doctor while its asked. 
0.855600	I speak American English as a tive. I have a college degree. Thus I am able to understand fairly complex and technical material.
0.888900	I know exactly what a medical professiol is asking me. I'm fully capable of understanding the English language.
0.861100	I think I have an average degree of capacity in these areas.  I understand all forms and am able to fill them out.  I do hesitate to ask some questions of the doctor at times but I am able to look up information online instead.
0.900000	My health is important to me, so I always ask doctors and nurses to explain anything I don't understand and I know the importance of letting them know everything so they can diagnose me better.
0.800000	I feel I have the capacity to a decent degree. I was sheltered for most of my life, so I don't understand certain things, but if I need help, it's typically fairly easy for me to get it.
0.916700	My mother was a nurse, technical medical terms were always used in our house and I used to study with my mother. I have a good memory and like knowing about health areas. I have little difficulty understanding health decisions.
0.866700	Usually when I visit my primary care doctor, everything is pretty well laid out.  I generally can understand everything on the forms that they have, and they are good about explaining things to me.  I've had a bit of issues at emergency doctors, since they don't know me as well.  However, most of the time I'm good to go.
0.572200	I feel ok.  It is hard to access healthcare and it is so expensive.  He Internet has helped me a ton in deciding what to do when I need to make health decisions

0.616700	I think it is a low capacity- mainly because I am usually very intimidated and do not realize all the questions and confusion I have until after the doctor leaves. I don't feel confident enough to question them, or to disagree if I think they might be making incorrect assumptions.

0.794400	"I am the type of person that likes to know all the details about any given situation.  So when I am told I ""have something""  always ask a lot of questions and can find answers when needed.  I run into issues when I am told I have the symptoms of something but may not have it.  I have trouble understanding some of this info and how it relates to me: re how can we make this a known situation vs. a maybe.

I would say that it's much more difficult for the average person. 
0.916700	I feel that it is very easy for me to get the information I need to understand the health services  and options I am being offered. I have never encountered difficulty understanding what my physician or nurse is saying to me. If I ever need questions answered or clarified I have always received satisfying answers that I can understand.
0.844400	I feel that I have the capacity to understand better than the average person, given my educatiol background. I have a masters degree in biochemistry and molecular biology so I think in a scientific way. I am also interested in the medical field and so I think that helps. 
0.650000	I have had to seek out people to help me make informed medical decisions. A family friend who is a doctor as well as my brother in law who is a malpractice lawyer help me make these decisions. After consulting these people ad well as my assigned doctors and nurses make me feel confident in my decisions. 
0.666700	I feel confident enough to ask my nurse/dr. all the questions I need to understand. I'm also confident in my reading/comprehension skills to understand written information. I know where to find more information online if I need it.
0.866700	I have the assertiveness to make sure a doctor explains what I don't understand. I have the internet aptitude to research medical issues thoroughly. I have the humility to admit when I don't understand something.
0.850000	I feel like I have a great deal of capacity towards understanding, obtaining, and processing health info. I'm fairly well educated, well read, and I have a great doctor who takes the time to actually listen and explain. Additiolly, I can always look on the internet for information (from official sources, of course).
0.777800	I feel I can make basic decisions because I do not have a health background or a lot of medical problems.  A lot of confusion I have relates to the medical insurance and how and what to do to get coverage or obtain pre auth if needed.
0.805600	I feel that I am fully able to understand and process health information and services.  I make my own health decisions based on the information that I have obtained.  I use my doctor as a resource if I do not understand something.  I also ask for recommendations so that I am able to have a choice of what is going on with my health treatment.
0.550000	I think I have the capacity to understand medical information but much of it goes over my head and I would need to ask for help (after which I should retain that information)
0.888900	i feel my capacity for that is pretty good, because i went to college and i know how to understand concepts. also, i know how to google things i don't know.
0.827800	I feel like I am able to gather most of the information I need to make health care decisions for myself. I often spend time on the internet to research reviews of doctors so I know I choose someone trustworthy, and this makes me trust their decisions for me. I also feel I have enough knowledge to ask basic questions of my doctors and nurses to understand anything I am questioning.
0.600000	I feel that I have a good support network through my insurance and doctors. I have access to my medical information via my insurance website and I am able to contact my health professiols easily through message. I find that this is the easiest method. Writing often helps me clarify what it actually is that I am asking. 
0.850000	regarding the questions i do feel as though i do obtain the basic understanding if the health information and services that are given. I understand this information because the doctors and nurses are always there to help me with my questions.
0.900000	I think I am capable of making the decisions and asking the questions that I need to ask about medical subjects.
0.822200	I believe I can make appropriate health decision as well as most other people. I do my best to stay informed and do extra reading on the internet.
0.916700	I have complete capacity to understand and process all the information that I need to make appropriate health decisions.  I am a fully competent individual.
0.811100	Medical publications are often hard to read and not meant for laymen to process.  I do try to ask questions when I do not understand, but often I do not know that I do not fully understand until I try to explain it to other people.
0.694400	I have ability to understand. Sometimes doctors make things seem complicated on purpose. I understand more easily by doing my own research. 
0.672200	I feel like once I listen to what my doctor or nurse tells me, I need a few minutes to process it and by that point, they have left and I have been pushed out of the room and I now have a million questions I wanted to ask. On my last doctor's visit I left feeling confused and I realized in the parking lot I had no idea what I was supposed to do after my blood work results were going to be messaged to me. I then contacted my doctor, she was uble to respond to me, so I talked to a nurse who read the results and scared me to death thinking I had a disease and then hours later my doctor messaged me saying it's no big deal. 
0.750000	Generally, I feel confident about my ability to obtain and process basic health info. It can be confusing when two different doctors say two different things or even say things in slightly different ways.  Everyone seems to have a different opinion and it can be difficult to ascertain what to follow.  I don't always understand why I am given the prescriptions I am given and if they are really necessary.  
0.788900	I feel like I have a good capacity to do so. I fill out the doctor's forms when I go get a physical and I schedule a physical yearly. If anything came up on a physical I'm sure I'd be able to check it out.
0.872200	I don't have any real doubts about my ability to process basic health information. Obviously I'm not initially familiar with some of the terminology, etc, but the basic instructions are usually fine. The one area I'd say is a little confusing is hearing conflicting advice from different sources, but I guess that situation is present whenever you have professiols with differing opinions.
0.800000	I feel I could obtain basic health info and services pretty well except for my social anxiety that gets in the way. I am often too shy to call to make an appointment, when I'm in an appointment I often just want it over as fast as possible so I might not bring up all my concerns.
0.916700	I am able to completely understand written and spoken information regarding my health. I am fully able to make health decisions on my own. 
0.883300	I feel like i always have all the information i need to understand my health situations and make good decisions regarding my health. 
0.516700	I feel that my Docotor just fills out a prescription form and doesn't really invegistgate if the problem I have still exsists or not. He doesn't ask me questions and makes me feel uncomfortable asking him anything. 
0.833300	I think that I feel competent enough to ask questions, but sometimes I feel that I am wasting their time and I could go home and look online. However, if I did research prior to the doctor's visit, I would ask the doctor or nurse questions that I've had during my research.
0.855600	My vision, hearing and reading are excellent, so I feel I have no issue in getting the information. Occasiolly I might be unsure of a particular word that a doctor has said if it is the me of a condition or medication. Sometimes I will ask them to repeat it, and sometimes, if I don't think it's important to know the exact me, I won't ask. I normally feel comfortable asking any questions of my doctor that need clarification. And if I think of other questions afterward, sometimes I will call the office, or try to research the information online.
0.855600	I have a couple of doctors I see regularly and they usually explain things to me which I seem to understand. But sometimes after I leave and get home I question some of the information because it can be overwhelming. 
0.916700	I believe I have this capacity to a high degree. I am a high level reader and can understand information that is directed toward me, whether through reading or listening. I am also willing to ask any questions that will address any issues I am not clear on. 
0.800000	I feel I can handle most things. If I don't understand something, I will ask the doctor or nurse until I figure out what is necessary.
0.900000	I have had a lot of experience with hospital/medical documents so other than medical terms, I feel confident in determining what those documents say. I occasiolly run some medical terminology past a friend who is trained in the medical field but rarely. 
0.544400	Oftentimes information concerning my health can get a bit complex, and I occasiolly need aid from a professiol health professiol to decipher certain things regarding the information.
0.811100	Because both my kids have had surgeries, one has food allergies and my consulting business often works with doctors, I am comfortable asking questions and feeling like I understand the whole picture by the time the office visit is over. I also worked in rehab facilities and was in charge of insurance several years ago, so official forms don't confuse me at all.
0.883300	Fot the most part. I try to ask the right questions in the room but sometimes find myself having to do my own research online when I get home
0.711100	I know that I have the capacity to understand basic health information. Sometimes I just need a little bit of help to understand medical terminology.

0.822200	I feel confident about my ability to ask and answer questions about my health as well as the health of my child. If i don't understand something, I usually ask for it to be explained again or a different way.
0.672200	I believe that I can understand the basic health information. Although, I do have to ask questions to clarify details. In my experience, medical professiols, such as nurses and doctors, talk over my head. I am more confident in asking questions about things I don't understand, as I get older.
0.666700	If I have the able to google terms I don't understand then I would have no problem. But if I don't I feel stressed  because doctors don't always want to help. 
0.600000	I feel that I have a basic ability to obtain and process basic health information. At times I need help reading about conditions or help explaining what medications that I am on. But when I have a question or need assistance I always find the help that I need from my family.
0.816700	I feel like I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. Unless, the doctor or nurse is rushing to get me out of the office, I usually ask questions whenever I don't know something. This way, I can always be sure that I can make the best decision for my health.
0.811100	I think I've very capable of understanding basic health information. I can read just fine, and have a good understanding of most medical terms, unless it's something very abstract and rare. I ask questions when I think it's needed, and understand the answers given just fine. Between my understanding of things and other explations given (if needed), I feel I make good health decisions for myself.
0.733300	The Internet is full of useful information. There are plenty of official medical sites to read through if I don't get all the information I need from a medical professiol. But, honestly, I haven't even had a cold or flu in the 14 years I've been a vegan, so I don't go to the doctor. I'm a very healthy person.
0.688900	Once I receive all of the information, I am usually able to understand it. Most of my problems come from understanding the fincial parts of my condition. Also my condition affects everyone differently, so that always causes distress.
0.916700	I am entirely capable of understanding basic health information and am confident in my abilities to make health decisions for myself. I am a mentally and emotiolly stable woman in her early 30s. 
0.616700	I have few knowledge about the medical and health.  And I also use the help of internet to get the information about the health decision also.
0.811100	I am confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  When I have questions, I do not hesitate to ask the medical staff for clarification.
0.916700	Its very easy. All you have to do is ask and they will answer. You can also go online and find anything that you need to know. Getting information is very easy.
0.688900	I feel I am pretty competent in obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services. I feel that if there is something I don't understand I make sure to ask for clarification from either my health professiol or family member.
0.916700	Fortutely, I have a good understanding of medical terms and I'm not afraid to ask questions.  Many people are reluctant to question doctors but I'm not one of them. I feel that the patient has to be proactive and take responsibility for getting good medical care.  Doctors aren't mind readers and cannot help a patient if they don't provide all the necessary information.
0.844400	I feel that I have a moderate capacity to obtain, process and understand this information. It's easy to understand information about simple concerns -- like if I go to the doctor with an infection, and she diagnoses it and sends me home with a prescription for antibiotics, that's easy. No problem. But when I get into harder-to-diagnose issues (like the vertigo I've had for more than a decade), doctors tend to under-explain things and make a lot of assumptions that can make it hard to get useful information from them. My vertigo was never diagnosed by my then-doctor despite him running a bunch of tests I couldn't afford that all came back fine; I filly figured out the issue for myself (badly-adjusted new glasses that caused chronic eyestrain I still struggle with). Doctors also tend to brush off my concerns because I'm overweight, even when my concerns have nothing to do with my weight. Behavior like that from professiols can make it difficult and intimidating to make the right decisions for myself.
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to read, comprehend and understand not just basic but most or all health information I read. I'm fully capable of making appropriate health decisions concerning myself and also my family.

0.916700	I feel completely capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed.
0.900000	I think I have the ability to understand basic health information.

0.888900	I feel that I have the capacity to understand obtain, process, and understand basic health information relatively fully. I have no issues understanding written or spoken word regarding my health decisions.
0.900000	Having congestive heart failure has given me much knowledge on this disease. I have been in the hospital multiple times and see doctors quite frequently that I know understand this condition. I have a full understanding of what the disease is, does and what treatment options there are. of the treatment options I understand the ones my doctors use, why they use them.
0.861100	I can read, think, write, and otherwise communicate clearly.  Any issues I have are pretty straightforward, though I imagine an elderly person would face greater challenges.
0.777800	Sometimes my doctor will just scratch the surface when he explains things to me. He will avoid going into detail on what can happen if a test comes back a certain way.
0.722200	For the most part I think I'm pretty capable. If I don't understand something, I'm not afraid to ask. Also, I tend to search for help online quite a bit and often find my answers there. I have enough experience with doctors' appointments such that I think I am comfortable getting and processing information and figuring out how to get help if I need it.
0.866700	I have no problem asking questions, and I have asked doctors to explain in layman's terms.  I also go online a lot to look up information.  I prefer it coming from the doctor though.  I also have a brother who is a doctor and a sister in law who is a nurse.  I have asked them questions before.
0.900000	I can understand the medical forms and processes quite well. I can also process the information given to me by my physician. 
0.572200	It depends on the health condition I may have if I can fully understand it. Things like having a cold or a sprained ankle are somewhat simple to understand as oppose to a stomach condition like an ulcer. I would research online and ask for advice from family if I don't fully understand.
0.833300	I feel like i do have the need to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Because I know the questions to ask when i need information and am not afraid to ask anything like if i dont understand to have them explain it again
0.872200	"I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I usually feel comfortable asking questions when I am unsure of the answer, and whenever a doctor is explaining an issue, I am always thinking ""what's our next step,"" and will not leave until I get an answer to that question."
0.855600	Although I am not a tive english speaker, I've been here since I was 5, so my English is pretty good.

0.761100	Yes, I have basic comprehension of medical questions and can fill out my own forms and understand directions for medications, etc. Some medical terms are hard enough to pronounce, let alone know what they mean so I need clarification on that at times but am comfortable asking questions if I am unsure about anything.
0.850000	I have pretty good health insurance through my company so I have access to any kind of doctor I need to see. I try to read as much as possible so I know what questions to ask. If I have questions, I also go to my mother. She used to work in the medical field, and she also has the same thyroid condition that I have. She has had it way longer then me, so she points me on the right direction.
0.833300	I feel that I have a high capacity to understand, obtain and process basic health information because I have a high understanding of the basic physiological systems in the human body. I have a degree in biochemistry and have a high understanding of the human body from a chemical standpoint.

Its a process in medical terms, but I feel I have the tive skill set to be very good at understanding information provided to me. 
0.794400	I can understand most basic health information, I might have an issue once in a while not understanding some concept. I try to ask questions to doctors and nurses but most of the time I think of additiol questions when it is too late because I already left the doctor's office. 
0.916700	i feel good about being able to find out the information i need
0.866700	I have a decent general knowledge about health and medical terminology. I'm kind of science oriented anyway, and am very curious. I am confident in my ability to research terms and procedures and know which sites to trust and which to make sure to find corroborating information as there is a lot of bad info out there too.
0.655600	I think I could make my own health decisions 
0.794400	I feel that I am very able to obtain, process, and understand health information. If I do not have pamphlets or instruction papers that come with the service or product I am receiving, I will generally easily call my doctor or perform a web search about whatever it is that I need to know. I feel that I am fairly competent and literate in the medical literature and am able to understand what I read and what I am told. 
0.844400	i feel like i have the tools to process basic medical knowledge without any real help. Unless the medical problem is super specific to things i know nothing about.

When the doctor is explaining anything to me, I will make certain that I understand exactly what they are saying, and will ask whatever question(s) I need to ask in order to understand everything.
0.816700	I feel like I have the ability to ask questions and get clarifications, but I always feel like they want me out of there as quickly as possible and as if they don't really care about me. I feel like I'm being patronized and as if they think I'm stupid for not understanding the first time. I also kinda feel like I'm whining when I say something hurts, because it seems like there are other people that hurt way worse and so I'm just being too sensitive.

0.694400	I think I can understand mostly everything. However sometimes medicine information can come off as hard to understand in which case I will ask a doctor or nurse for more information on it. Sometimes doctors and nurses seem annoyed by questions. However I think they should never be annoyed because it's their job to inform us on this kind of information.

0.544400	I feel like I can only understand the most basic results that my doctors can give me. Once they get into how much medication I need to take, what effects it will have in the long term the information just phases out of my head.

This degree covered a broad range of medical terminology, medicil therapies, and chemistry and biological sciences. 
0.811100	I feel like I have an average layman's understanding of health information. I don't think I have more knowledge or anything, but I do think that I can process and understand the information I am given, or information I am searching for sufficiently. Sometimes, though, things are out of my ability to understand, and I will either ask someone who I think is knowledgeable or just look it up myself.
0.811100	I think that I have a decent understanding.  If I don't completely understand it I won't ask a ton of questions because I can turn to Google to look up the information.  Most of the time I do this when they step out of the room.  If looking it up leads me to be confused I will then ask questions when they step back into the room.
0.872200	I have a large capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information when making health-related decisions. I am highly educated.

0.716700	I feel I have a good understanding of health information and typically don't require assistance to understand

0.511100	my mom is a nurse and i grew up with her talking about medical stuff and I was never able to have it all click in my mind.  I don't have the capacity to obtain, process and understand it.  Its like when people talk medical my brain shuts down.  I let my husband explain it to me...or my mom or my niece who is also a nurse
0.677800	I feel like I understand stuff about my own health when it's explained to me. I mostly just have issues understanding health insurance. I think they make it complicated on purpose.
0.777800	I feel I have a good capacity to understand basic health information.  I have had a preexisting condition my entire life and need to be able to understand this type of information.
0.883300	I think I am fully able to do and take care of myself and my own needs
0.761100	For the most part, I think I can understand most of the information.  If I have any questions, I do ask my doctor or after I can call her or one of the nurses in the office. They will always help me. 
0.838900	I have a lifetime experience of dealing with a variety of medical problems. I feel confident in my general knowledge. I come across things I do not understand sometimes. I am not a medical professiol so I expect to be confused sometimes.
0.711100	I think I have an adequate understanding of basic medical terminology to understand 90% of all trips to clinics or the hospital. However, if the terminology gets too technical, I need to get help either from a doctor or a friend help me explain what is going on. Overall, I think I have good capacity to make educated health decisions regarding my health. 
0.900000	Yes I asked the necessary questions if there's anything I don't understand
0.916700	"Most of the health information I have had to deal with has been very well explained to me, and I don't mind asking followup questions.  The doctor's are the experts after all.  One of my favorite quotes/phrases to use is ""Help me understand.""  When I am truly confused or stuck with something, that is what I go to, and I let the doctor know that they can break it down and treat it as if they are telling a five year old.  Most of it I understand, but don't mind letting them know I may have follow up questions."
0.561100	I feel like I'm literate and competent enough to understand things, but I often lack sufficient information because I have too little time face-to-face with a doctor, nurse, or tech.  I feel rushed along and don't feel like it's ok  to ask many questions or to provide very detailed information.
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and understand the basic health information that I need.  I can easily understand the decisions I need to make.  I have infrequently gone online to get extra clarity when needed.
0.794400	I do feel that I can understand most of what is explained to me.  If not, I feel confident that I can find a doctor or nurse to explain what I don't understand.  I can also research issues myself on the internet.
0.883300	I try to get a firm understanding of what's going on. I tell the doctor or nurse everything because I feel it's the one profession you should never lie to. I then listen to what they say and if I have a question I ask it. If I don't understand, I will try to have them explain it further or better. I then get other information on my condition and then I feel I am comfortable making a decision with the information I have received.
0.916700	I fully understand what they tell me and I ask a lot of questions if it is unclear. I will also do significant research on the internet about any medical condition or procedure I may have.
0.844400	I feel confident with obtaining and understanding health information. I have been a caregiver of someone with cancer as well, so I got quite a bit of practice doing so as asking questions was very important.

0.866700	I feel I have the ability process and understand basic health information and services by using the internet. Right now I have insurance so I can obtain information my provider has a free phone number to call to ask medical questions.
0.622200	I work at a hospital so I feel like I kind of get it, but when it comes to major issues I still feel confused when getting the information told to me. I don't think that it is due to stupidity as much as it is due to being confused on what to do. You feel trapped with one real choice and in many cases you want more options to choose from. 
0.677800	I feel like I can understand a lot of things and that I have gotten better at asking questions. However, I am bad at asking questions when they are about a new topic. For example, if I made an appointment to talk about issue A, but I also have issue B, I will only talk about issue A. I also do not understand health insurance information well.
0.666700	I think I may not understand everything on forms or what a doctor says, but I try to ask questions if I don't understand. I don't mind asking questions to understand better. I want to understand and will ask. 
0.916700	I have excellent knowledge of the healthcare field.  I am the person to go to when you need help understanding anything involving health.  I am not a Dr. or nurse. 
0.794400	To a good extent. Sometimes the questions on the forms are a bit confusing and it's hard to put down an answer.  They are also repetitive. I am able to ask the doctor questions about information given to me, but often questions do not come up until after the visit. 
0.916700	I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information about myself and what services I would need to make well thought out, appropriate health decisions for the better of myself. 
0.583300	I know enough to stay healthy by myself most of the time. But I sometimes take medicine. I feel like I'll have to think more about it when I am old.
0.505600	I have problems thinking of a Way to ask the doctor what I need to know. I have a hard time ezpressi g myself in that manner. I also think doctors give me information to quickly for me to process it. I feel rushed when I'm with a doctor and I don't think the exlain everything thouroghly.
0.672200	i think i am okay at it, but i do not always understand some of the big words.
0.883300	I feel that the doctors who I go to are very informative and have provided me with both the pros and cons of the treatments they recommend. They usually also provide me with an adequate understanding of consequences that come with the treatment.
0.611100	First and foremost I have the internet to use when I have a health concern or question.  I will turn to the internet from the start since WebMD and other sites are a great resource to use for general information.  From there, if I visit the doctor I can ask the doctor or nurses questions.  I can also pick up literature in their offices for more information.  I have also been known to consult with friends and family members for advice and information on my health situations.
0.833300	When given when told about a condition or issue the doctors and nurses give me all the needed information and if I need more I will ask for it in writing or do further research on my own.

0.827800	I am able to understand written and spoken health information and make decisions based on this information. There has been a time or two when I received lab work that I asked for more information on to better understand it.
0.688900	I feel like that I have the general capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. If I don't understand, I will ask the doctor or nurse until I do, unless they seemed rushed. If they seemed rushed and unhelpful, I will not ask too many questions. If there is any more help I need, I usually turn to my friend who is a nurse or my sister, who is a doctor. I also turn to Google to find out more information if they are not available right away. 
0.688900	I believe that although the system can be complicated, I am capable of making appropriate health decisions. I can ask for clarification and help with forms and acquire more information about topics and conditions being discussed.
0.850000	Somewhat a little from a doctor. I recently went to see a doctor and their diagnosed wasn't very helpful. They spent less than 5 minutes for a $100 charge. 
0.655600	I think I understand written information much better than what a practitioner says to me. I miss SO much when I'm at a doctor's appointment - I forget what I'm told and forget what questions I wanted to ask, even when they're written down.
0.916700	I am very health conscious, and I am very pro-active about health-related topics. I know a lot of terminology, and I usually have a higher understanding of the information on the forms and on health topics than the nurses. I often have a higher understanding than the doctors on the topics as they relate to lifestyle choices (i.e., food), and have a reasoble level of knowledge about how the various systems in the body work. I am able to understand what the doctor tells me, and I know what I don't know, so I can ask questions on the fly and often come prepared with questions. I usually know enough to begin with to understand the answers, but I certainly don't mind clarifying questions. 
0.716700	I have the capacity to understand and process basic health information. I typically understand whatever doctors tell me when I or my children are sick, need medications or surgeries.

0.872200	I feel like I am as capable as the average person of understanding what a medical professiol tells me. I'm not a doctor, so of course there are some things that require further explation, but I can usually quickly grasp the gist of the situation if the doctor uses layman's terms. I usually ask all the questions I can think of at the time when I'm in the appointment, but every once in a while I'll be too embarrassed to bring myself to ask about something.
0.672200	I feel I have a pretty good degree of understanding and capability of getting help in understanding health information. These days, I can just go online and find information pretty quickly, if someone I know isn't available to help.
0.672200	I'm pretty bright and understand a lot, but a lot of times my doctors or nurses don't really explain things to me in detail about my conditions, lab reports, etc. I also forget to ask questions or clarify things when I am there sometimes, because I tend to get nervous. They're always rushing too so it's not like you get a ton of time.
0.844400	I feel that I'm knowledgeable to understand and talk about ay medical issue that I may have efficiently.
0.694400	I have a good ability to understand basic health information. But there are times that I do have a little trouble that is when I will ask the doctor to explain and help me. They usually do as long as they are a good doctors tho I've had a bad one or 2 and if that happens I find a new one.

0.827800	I do have some background (college, scribe/EMT experience) in medical language and knowledge that helps me understand at least the basics of conditions that may affect me. Likewise, I feel like I am able to critically read relevant informatiol materials and interact with health professiols to address unswered questions.
0.883300	I think I do. I think I can understand and obtain basic health information. It's not too much of a problem.

0.850000	I have always filled out my own medical forms and the forms for my children when they were younger. I have been making insurance claims for well over 40 years as well.

0.694400	I feel that I am capable fo understanding most of what medical professiols tell me. Sometimes, though I feel they do not speak in layman's terms. If they did, it would make me feel better.
0.761100	The internet has made it easier to look up information about many minor health conditions.

0.838900	I took atomy and physiology and a handful of healthcare related science classes as an undergraduate as they tied into my mathematics modeling work. So I feel reasobly well educated about my body and the diseases that impact it. Enough that I can understand the basics and then go research any gaps in knowledge myself or ask the right questions to have a professiol explain it to me.
0.661100	At times I feel that the abbreviations on medical forms are what really mess me up.  Sometimes it takes time to really evaluate what the abbreviations mean, but I usually have the ability to figure it out, if not as my mother who works in the medical field.
0.833300	I am perfectly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding health information. My only issue is that I may not ask appropriate questions at times or withhold information that I don't think is relevant.

My dad was a pharmacist so growing up I could easily go to him with any health issues or questions and he always had an answer or directed me where I needed to go for the answer. Because of that I feel I have a strong knowledge of how to understand basic health information. I struggle a but with services needed to make appropriate health decisions because I hate going to the doctor. I avoid it at all costs so in that area I have little capacity for obtaining services and health information.

0.766700	I feel like I can process and understand basic health information enough to make medical decisions for myself and my family. And if there is something I am unclear on I always ask.

They use a lot of medical terms that I'm just not familiar with at all, and I  have a pretty difficult time compregending them.I also have a hard time finding out where to get this information, or who to talk to, or how to get something specific done. A lot of the time I just don't know where to look.

0.777800	I feel like I have the tools available to understand what I need to know, however those tools are not always connected. For instance, when I am with the dr.

When I look up information on-line, I rarely print the information to take in and discuss. 
0.916700	I feel like I have a good understanding of health and health related issues due to my college education which required me to take many classes in biology and other sciences, including atomy and medical terminology.

0.811100	I have a relatively high level of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.

0.722200	"I feel that I have an ability to obtain the needed information if desired through my doctor or nurse, however, I do not always trust this information as they don't always seem to be the most up to date on new medical procedures, new findings, etc. Many times if I were to ask a question or try to obtain further information if they haven't heard or don't feel it's correct will dismiss it without concern just saying ""it's wrong"" despite there being research stating it isn't. I feel that my basic health needs are not always being met by my standards. "

I also several specialists that I see and I am able to ask questions about my condition and I understand what they are talking about when they explain it to me and when they give me written information about it.

0.900000	I have a good capacity to make appropriate health decisions. I have no cognitive disabilities. I worked in healthcare for 25 years so have a good understanding of the lexicon. My knowledge is somewhat dated so I do have to rely on my provider to give me the most up to date info.
0.805600	Before i even go into a hospital, i google possible conditions and treatments for those treatments, so i can get a decent understanding in laymans terms.

0.633300	I think i have a reasobly good capacity to understand and process health service information.

0.566700	I feel i am confident to fill out the documents myself, It just seems there is alot of red tape in filling out all of these forms.

0.627800	I feel like it's a 50/50 chance I'd be able to do it on my own. The issues I tend to have is I either don't know exactly who to talk to or how to get to the person I need to talk to you.
0.883300	Yes, I believe I can. I am able to process almost all of the information I am given in health situations, and I have people I can ask if there is something I don't understand.

When I have general medical questions, I also sometimes call my brother, who is an internist.

0.811100	For many reasons, I believe I am considerably qualified to understand even the most complex of medical issues.  For over 30 years, I served as a volunteer Paramedic and took advantage of every learning situation possible.  Also, due to significant health issues, (Lyme Disease and Cancer), I was further compelled to be more edified in the entire healthcare process.  And, in my current profession with a dental office, the didactic issues have become paramount when dealing with our patients.
0.916700	I think I am quite good at deciphering medical information and understanding medical terminologies. I have a few medical professiols in my family, so I've been hearing about insurance, procedures, and diagnoses since I was a child. Though I find medicine fasciting, I never went into the field myself. 
0.616700	I think I have enough capacity to process most of what I need to know, but on occasion, I can get a little confused. I don't ask questions sometimes, even when I need to know more to fully understand necessary health information. Some of the information seems pretty daunting to me.
0.816700	I definitely have the capacity to do all o f the above. I am able to discuss with my doctors and nurses what I have issues with and I have the internet to formulate opinions on things and find information and services myself.
0.916700	i am a retired paramedic so health information is not a problem nor is asking questions and understanding answers
0.900000	I am very confident in my ability to successfully vigate all steps involved in being treated medically. However, as I do not have any medical conditions and have only dealt with health care via a check up every few years, I would say that if I did have a health issue I could imagine not being as confident in dealing with the process.
0.672200	I feel I can get most of the information I need if they're brought up. I worry that I may, or the staff may forget to check or mention something that will help my health. I also worry that some of the information is too complicated to understand and the meds prescribed have side effects that are glossed over.
0.916700	I have worked as a Medical Transcriptionist for 5 years.  so, having the basic understanding of medical terms and conditions helps me to have an intelligent conversation with doctors and medical personnel and read and understand medical information.
0.700000	I often have my wife explain to me things when they are too overwhelming or complicated by a doctor or nurse. It's important to get the information from them or I usually end up on the internet looking things up and that is probably the worst thing to do.
0.805600	At this point in my life. I am in control of my own health. And I hope I will NEVER have to depend on medical officials ever again.
0.811100	I think I definitely have the ability to understand and process basic health information. I grew up in a family of nurses, so I am pretty comfortable with medical stuff.
0.727800	I think I have decent knowledge. I would like to have an extra opinion though just to make sure I'm making the right decision. 
0.827800	I think I have a good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I can ask questions to the doctor or nurse if there is something that I need clarified.
0.916700	I feel that I am fully capable of understanding the directives given by my doctor, along with all paperwork given to me. I am capable of understanding almost all information in written form. On the rare occasion I will ask a nurse in the office for some assistance in understanding information or obtaining advice on taking steps to move forward.
0.827800	I rarely go to the doctor, but for the most part, I feel like I understand everything that is discussed between my health care provider and myself.  At least as far as my condition at the time goes.  I do have some problems understanding treatment options and insurance issues.  That is where I need some help.
0.811100	Between asking health professiols in person, and looking up additiol information on the internet, it is easy to obtain the health info I need.
0.916700	I feel like I can do all of these things.  I don't have a hard time understanding things that are explained to me, especially if they involve my health.
0.866700	I am ale to understand most information provided by providers. I am a professiol health care provider.
0.883300	I always try to find doctors, PAs, and nurses who are willing to explain things using non-medical terminology when necessary.  I have switched doctors, as well as asked for different nursing staff, when I felt them to be too condescending, or unwilling to take additiol time to explain things to me.
0.777800	I feel I can obtain, process and understand my health information to a mostly satisfactory degree. There have been some instances in the past where I have had trouble understanding what a doctor tells me. In those cases I will ask nurses for clarification, and I also changed my doctor to get someone who communicated better to me. 
0.827800	I'm pretty confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand information. My largest issues would be that I am generally reluctant to go to the doctor unless I absolutely need to, and that I often don't ask too many questions especially when I'm afraid of the answer. I will generally accept instructions from doctor without asking for explations, which probably also limits my ability to make decisions well. To this point, none of this has ever had a negative effect on me.
0.811100	I feel I understand things written very well, and I am confident in understanding that, but I feel intimidated by medical professiols and sometimes I am hesitant to ask questions. 
0.655600	if i dont understand things i always ask many quistions until i do understand
0.900000	I deal with doctors and forms so much over the last 2 years I'm getting to be a pro at it.. I also don't let doctors walk all over me and not hear my wishes. I live in opioid overdose central so I make sure I know what's going into my body and my doctor isn't just trying to make a new junkie. 
0.833300	I have a working knowledge of several general medical practices and back office procedures in the field. I know what rights I have as a patient and obligations of doctors and nurses.
0.844400	I believe the hospitals and doctor's offices try to make things as easy as possible. I'm able to understand what they feel is important for me to know about a medical condition, which is usually more than I know. They treat everyone the same though, and I wish more time and attention would be given to taking my particular circumstances into consideration. My particular questions could help them treat others like me more specifically, but they don't seem to see it that way. 
0.855600	I feel fairly confident that I have the skills to understand what is needed to make health decisions. To do this I use the help of my doctor and the help of the internet to research information.

0.605600	I am good at reading and comprehension. This means I am good at being able read these types of materials to make decisions.
0.788900	I feel like I certainly have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as well as services however I would always have a little bit of uncertainty simply because you don't want to make mistakes regarding your health or the health of your children. I definitely think for minor health issues I can comprehend everything quite well but as things get more serious I tend to be a little more doubtful of myself.
0.872200	I feel pretty confident, but mostly because I have done my own research. Honestly doctors seem to fly through visits any more. Over scheduled and over worked. I don't blame them, I know it is but a clog in the system. 
0.888900	The doctors I see always explain my condition and my options really well. Whenever I ask questions I feel like they go above and beyond on telling me everything they know to help me understand my illness or whatever I am seeing them for. I also have access to the internet; while not a reliable method for diagnosis, it does have extra information available about practically every illness and condition if I wish to learn more.

0.783300	I feel like I am able to make good health decisions however I rarely feel like I have all the information. It feels like there is information my doctor isn't telling me. I would rather they gave it to me straight with all the information so I could really make an informed decision.
0.900000	I think whenever i ask for any question or information regarding anything , my doctor gave me satisfactory answer. However i am not satisfied the way nurses handle the situation. whenever i call doctors office regarding my test results they never replied on time , and sometimes take more than 24 hours to return my call. 
0.916700	I have full confidence in my ability to read and comprehend medical information because English is my tive language. Aside from my fluency in English, I have been unfortute to spend a significant amount of time around doctors and hospitals because of the health of my immediate family. Therefore, I am competent when speaking with doctors and reviewing medical information.
0.644400	I feel like I do.  I just don't understand some of the terms the doctors/nurses use.  I understand most of what they are saying. It when you are at the doctor you're (at least I am) a little scared so your brain doesn't process like normal. 
0.872200	I have great capacity.  I take care of an elderly person who acts helpless and pretends he can't do anything for himself in regards to his medical care, and I see how annoying this is to the doctors, so I make sure to really take a proactive stance in my own healthcare.

0.916700	I am capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.
0.633300	I think it's difficult to gauge. I mean they have things written out with complicated language that only doctors understand I mean there's a reason they have to go to college for like 8 years. Then when you have a doctor in front of you, you don't know exactly what to ask whether it's relevant or just a stupid question. 
0.566700	I usually have to ask several times and than make them brake it down to where I can understand what they are talking about , usually they use a map of the body to show me how things work , if there are more question I ask , I ask about long term effects

I never feel like I have had enough time with the health care providor. 
0.811100	I usually have all the questions I want to ask read. However I process methodically and they process you so fast,I often leave with all my questions answered but more crop up just a few minutes later.
0.872200	I believe that I have a moderate capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.

0.794400	i think i have about the same level of medical understanding as the average person. i don't think that i have all the answers so i like to ask medical professiols the questions that i have. when it comes to filling out forms, sometimes i get bored and skip parts that i should have paid more attention to.
0.833300	I think I know a lot because I've been helping out others for years and I feel comfortable with what I do. Also when I fill out mine and if I need help to make sure it's right, it normally is and I'm just making sure its right.

I've been to the doctor's a lot when I was younger so I know how things work, and when to ask questions about certain things if they don't explain things as clearly as I would like.

0.838900	I have a science background so I am able to understand the terminology.  I ask questions to verify what I have been told.  However, I feel doctors don't always tell a patient everything that would help in the treatment of certain conditions.
0.883300	I definitely think I can make the proper decisions for myself in regards to my health.

0.811100	I think I generally have the capacity I need. I had a traumatic experience last year that required profession mental health care, though, and at that time I was struggling to obtain the government assistance I was eligible for.

0.616700	I do not think I have enough knowledge, confidence, or resources to understand most.

0.738900	I can pretty much communicate in medical terms with healthcare professiols because I am a medical interpreter. Yet, I would not say that I understand everything about different health conditions and tests. There is a lot to learn even for the doctors and nurses.

0.883300	I feel that I can adequately make appropriate health decisions because I don't always take what the doctor says as word. I look into it deeper, myself.

0.744400	I think that on average I am moderately knowledgeable when it comes to health issues, however I comfortable and feel it is within my rights to ask the healthcare professiols any questions that helps me clarify any information, procedures or recommendations they may have.
0.766700	I do feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health info because whenever I don't understand something I am the first one to ask for a clarification.  I study the info very often with my husband and we collaborate and anything we don't have a grasp of, we set aside time to understand it. So I am more then confident that I can make appropriate health decisions.
0.916700	I've had a few operations and have taken care of a parent with Alzheimer's. While I have a pretty severe phobia of all things medical, I've had enough urgent care to know the ropes and even a lot about interl organs/functions as well as pharma and tural medicine. 
0.900000	I am pretty familiar with medical terminology and how things work.  I am able to successfully google any information I don't know.  I never just take a doctor on their word and do ask questions and do my own research.  Doctors are not always right, whether they are new, stuck in a prescribing rut or have chosen not to be reeducated on current practices for a particular symptom/illness.
0.850000	I feel like I am have general understanding of most of the important health decisions I make based some of my previous professions. 
0.811100	I feel like i have a great ability to obtain and understand basic health information because i am confident with my research and communication abilities. For something i do not understand or need clarification i usually try to research it before hand , get an idea of what it is before consulting a health professiol. By the time i consult a health professiol, i usually have a general understanding of whatever it is i need clarification on.
0.855600	My mother was a nurse and my father was an EMT so I grew up around medical terminology. I am used to hearing medical words and I feel like I am highly capable of processing and understanding basic health information. I often have an idea of what is wrong with me even before the doctor's diagnosis.
0.916700	I like to follow all instructions given to me by my doctor. I like to read everything the doctor gives to me, especially medications. If there is something I do not understand, I am not hesitant in the slightest to look for something on the internet. 
0.916700	I have a fairly good understanding of  medical terminology having worked in a benefits related industry and also what is required to make a proper diagnosis.
0.844400	I feel that I high capacity to obtain, process and understand health information. I took a nursing class in college and while I would not diagnose myself or others with the information I received from taking the class, it allows me to understand a decent amount of medical language. 
0.916700	I am not a science-minded person, so the medical information I receive is not obvious or tural to me. Therefore I like to listen to everything a medical professiol says to me, because I am learning along the way. Since I like learning about new things in life, I have no problem being interested and understanding what they are telling me.
0.744400	I struggle at times to understand printed material, particularly literature about prescribed medicines. Sometimes I have difficulty understanding a doctor's verbal explations, especially since they are always short on time. 
0.838900	I think I would be able to obtain what I needed in order to get a general understanding of a condition.
0.783300	I feel pretty confident in my ability to receive information that will allow me to make appropriate health decisions. I realize a lot of other people lie or omit information when dealing with health care professions and this seems completely counter-intuitive me so I try my best to be open and honest in my communications.
0.638900	I feel I am able to understand and process basic health information because of my education. If it is basic info I can usually follow along or I am capable of using the internet to clarify things I might find confusing. 
0.900000	I am very capable of processing and understanding basic health information. First we have the lovely world wide web and there are A LOT of reputable sources to get information. Just need to make sure it is indeed reputable, like Web MD. I also do not have issues getting information from health professiols when I need it, that's what they are there for.
0.783300	I think I've got a pretty average capacity to obtain and understand health information and services. I don't always know everything I need to know, but I'm not too bad at researching things and can often find things out on my own. I'm not an expert though, so it's possible for me to miss out on things or misunderstand some information.
0.883300	Almost perfectly. I am a good reader, have good reading comprehension,and frequently refer to Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins when I need more or expanded information on my or a friends medical concern.. 
0.794400	I feel like I have a higher degree of understanding about basic health information than the average person and my family.  Because health interests me, I like to read about conditions I have experienced or those around me have had on my own as well as speak to friends who have medical degrees.  I think I absorb what I hear about basic health information really well and retain it because I am so fascited by it.  Also, I have had some family members with serious medical issues so have had a lot of practice having to make choices and ask questions.
0.805600	I believe I understand well enough what questions I should ask pertaining to my ailment. I am sometimes hesitant to ask some questions I deem embarrassing, though.
0.622200	Confident. I feel confident in making my health decisions. I'm still fairly young and healthy. I know yo ask questions when something is important. I forget information, but I know what to do and say to function and survive. 
0.883300	I feel like I have a decent ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  If I don't understand something I ask questions and I usually end up doing research on health related maters online so that I can better understand anything I may not understand.
0.538900	For most of the real basic stuff, I get it. But when it gets more complicated with medical words being spoken to me, I get a little lost. I always have my husband with me in the doctor's office to make sure I don't miss something. 
0.811100	I feel like, given my individual circumstances, I can easily obtain and understand basic health information and services. This is likely due to the fact that I enjoy reading and learning and have taken an interest in the medical/scientific fields in general (particularly in psychiatry, as I have mental health issues). One area that does cause problems for me, though, is that I am a drug addict and I am generally reluctant to tell healthcare professiols exactly what drugs I may or may not be on, due to the stigma attached to my habits.
0.844400	i have no issues filling anything out. i normally have a good idea whats wrong with me due to healthcare websites like webmd and such. it is typically hard to ask questions to a doctor because they usually are running behind and are in and out of the room in less than 5 minutes so they are not always available to answer all questions if i have any
0.916700	I never have too much of a problem understanding what they tell me, and when I do, I always ask questions until I know I understand completely what's going on. Other times I'll research on my own time what they tell me if I'm still not completely satisfied, or if I just want to know a little extra about something.
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand all of my health information. I believe in taking charge of ones own health care, doing careful research and working with my physician to make the best health care decisions for myself.
0.883300	I feel very confident in acquiring information from health professiols when needed. I am also confident in my own exploration of health information on the internet. 
0.833300	I do understand the process of decisions for my health care, and if I am confused I then ask my doctor or nurse
0.861100	I feel I am very capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health info. I make my own health decisions on an everyday basis, as it is. I feel I am a smart and competent person.
0.850000	i think i am about average, i have had some but limited experience 
0.888900	I think I have a good knowledge base and am confident that, for the most part, I understand the directions my doctor and nurses give me, along with the materials and directions given to me afterward. I make sure to ask questions, but I will be honest and say that I often forget some of the things I want to ask before I go in during the exam. I
0.850000	"I feel that I can do all of the above on my own very well. Usually, I would just ask for ""help"" or advice from someone if I have been diagnosed with something they have previously had if I had any questions about it. I was also responsible for my grandma's health decisions and went to all of her appointments with her."
0.916700	A great deal. I can ask questions of the medical person. I can also look up more info online. I use different methods to find needed clarity.
0.916700	I'm not shy. I have no trouble talking to people in normal situations and important matters such as my health I'm even less likely to remain silent. If I have questions I ask. Even at routine medical checkups I have questions for my doctor either about the current situation or some other issue that has been bugging me.
0.744400	I have taken medical terminology I and II and earned A's in both. I have also done some research on my conditions. Because of that, I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I've even taken a nutrition course.
0.900000	I am pretty certain that I am capable to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make appropriate decisions. I mostly do not need help in understanding any information given to me. On rare occasions that I do need to as a few questions to better understand the information, I was always given clear answers by my doctors or nurses.
0.900000	I have enough experience on the matter to know what is being considered. I know what is told me and I know the basic issues. I can understand what is provided and make appropriate choices.
0.916700	I have a lot of confidence in myself to be able to understand and process basic health information. If I had questions after leaving a doctor's office, I would search for information on my prior before calling back. Anytime anyone I've known has had a medical condition, I always research it as well. I have never worked in the medical field, but I do learn quickly and comprehend what I do find on my own.
0.777800	I feel as if I can understand the basics of what is said, but occasiolly the use of the technical terms can get confusing compared to what most people would call a condition. Most forms are very simple to fill out though. 
0.761100	I have the capacity to process basic health information when it is provided. But recent experience indicates I seldom get all information such as consequences and other options, nor repercussions of all options. 
0.705600	At least decent in the form of if I do not know I will ask and I do follow my Doctors instructions. 
0.822200	Even if I don't initially understand all the information, I try to ask questions to help me understand further. I also have a close family member who is a registered nurse who has helped me at times. I try to use good resources on the internet for information.
0.583300	I think that I will need to some research before making a decision. 
0.827800	I understand what they tell me for the most part, but I do get hung up on the science behind it sometimes. If I don't understand the science I research it a bit online to get a better understanding because I'm slow on stuff like that.
0.883300	I believe I have the capabilities to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I know how to ask questions and find help understanding anything that I could find confusing 
0.822200	I feel confident in my capacity to understand health information to make good health decisions.  Sometimes I think I have too much information, rather than too little, since the internet has much information on health these days. Once I've met with clinicians though I do believe they are able to sift through any problems I have in order to give me the proper care.
0.638900	I feel like I know a lot of the information given to me. Many times, however, I only understand the basics.  When doctors start going into the science of the problem I get confused. I usually don't have a problem obtaining my patient information. 
0.816700	I feel like I have a medium capacity to get and understand basic health information. I can fully comprehend health information as I am in school for a healthcare field. It is somewhat difficult for me to ask doctors or other healthcare providers questions or give them all my concerns because I feel like they will think I am a hypochondriac. 
0.633300	I think I am smart enough to realize when I need to seek health care. I also know what questions to ask normally. I think I have good judgement when it comes to my healthcare and my families as well. I definitely do not know everything though.
0.900000	As I am tive to English and I usually speak to English speaking doctors - I have a fairly easy time of understanding what they tell me. Most doctors know how to speak in layman's terms which makes it all easier. Otherwise, I can look up the term and can basically always understand what it says online.
0.866700	I feel I vouch for myself and give enough info to the doctors and nurses when it is time for intake. I feel I am a competent person who is not afraid to ask questions to call the doctor if I feel something is not right health wise. If i did not understand something on a form I always ask for help.
0.777800	I think I'm smart enough to understand most medical information. I find for me on thing that does not help is on the internet you can almost find contradictions to any medical recommendation. Diet, supplements, vaccitions all have opposing views for the general medical advice given.
0.733300	I believe I have huge experience in this field, as my wife is ill for couple years and I'm talking to radio and chemo-therapy doctors. Not by choice, but I think I'm pretty capable... 
0.827800	I think I certainly have the literacy skills. I read and write better than most people I know and have a good vocabulary. But I don't have a lot of specialized medical knowledge, so sometimes I do feel like I don't have all the information I need to make a good decision or to understand what a doctor tells me. I think compared to most other people who aren't doctors or nurses, I'm doing well, but there are still a few times when I wish I were more confident.
0.777800	For the most part, the services I receive are superb, the only trick is waiting to get a appointment, which can sometimes take a month or longer. I feel that for the most part I understand the health system and the information provided me as well as the services, but sometimes I ask for help or opinions and explation when necessary.
0.738900	If I need help I can call the office and ask.  But sometimes I don't ask.
0.755600	I feel I am able to understand most things related to my healthcare if they are explained to me. I am able to understand most simple medical terms. However I do not always feel that I have access to the explations I sometimes need to make informed decisions. Often times I get very little time to speak with my doctors because they have to be with another patient. 
0.622200	I feel that I have a basic understanding of information and to process everything to make appropriate medical decisions, but sometimes there is a depth to these processes that require a deeper understanding.
0.888900	I feel I have great capacity to understand health information given to me, as well as make decisions for myself. If I have any questions, I am usually thorough about asking them to healthcare professiols.
0.655600	I feel like I can answer about all of the questions right. Usually they are pretty straight forward.  They don't use too much jargon that the average person cannot understand.  Very rarely sometimes the questions are worded in a way that you don't know what answer they are looking for.
0.872200	I feel confident in my ability to understand basic health information and make decisions. My doctors are very clear and helpful and always explain in detail if I need further clarification. They also lay out the options clearly so I can make an appropriate decision.
0.916700	I feel like I am very able to understand and obtain health information and services that I need. I have a pretty thorough backing in biology and have taken atomy and physiology classes in college, so that gives me a good working knowledge of anything that a medical professiol needs to communicate to me. I also have good health insurance through my husband's employer, and so have always been able to obtain medical care when I have needed it. I am also in good health and am generally self-confident so I don't really feel intimidated at the doctor's office and therefore have never had a problem asking a doctor or nurse for a clarification or additiol information. 
0.883300	I've worked in the healthcare field for most of my life in one way or another. I feel like I can understand just about anything thrown my way and I can make the right decisions regarding my health and treatment.
0.566700	I need it broken down better into easy to process words that i am familiar with to understand better. I feel sometimes the information is jus thrown at me and i would like it written down on papers so i can refer back to what i have and need todo for it and the medications.
0.811100	I persolly feel I am fully capable of obtaining and understanding the basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision. I am able to accomplish this by questioning my healthcare providers and also reading through materials or seeking additiol information online if necessary.
0.716700	I feel as though I can process most information fairly well. I have had issues in the past with having a lack of confidence in doctors explaining, but never my own understanding. 
0.688900	I worked in a hospital as their accounting staff, that may be the reason why I can understand easily their given information to me. But, I always ask them to read it for me to clarify that my understanding to my medical record is really what it seems to be.
0.866700	I feel that I am able to achieve this to a pretty high degree. Most times my health provider will provide a good enough verbal description of what I need to know and is available to answer any questions. I think what helps me the most, is that prior to going in and seeing someone, I research and look into my issue myself which gives me that ability to have some prepared questions or address any concerns. I have never had a problem following up with my provider with a phone call or email with a question and them not explaining what I need to know.
0.783300	I usually feel like I'm able to get enough information. Certain situations can make me flustered and uncomfortable, which sometimes limits how I interact. I do feel like there are more chances these days to get the information you need beyond the actual care interactions.
0.794400	I think I have a reasobly high capacity of health information.
0.883300	I know that I have the capacity to understand medical documents and filling them out. Occasiolly I have my doctor explain something if I don't understand it but for the most part I do. 
0.883300	I feel like I am very capable in making health decisions.
0.850000	I  do not have any medical training but I can always pick up the phone and  call my doctor and  ask questions 
0.838900	For the most part I understand what I am being told and if they use a term I am unfamiliar with I usually will ask follow up questions.  I will also sometimes search online to find the meaning of some things.  
0.727800	For the most part I feel confident in my ability to understand basic health information, as long as it's just basic. Once medical jargon and terminology starts to be used, I get a little lost. Whatever I do have trouble processing, I can just turn to the internet for answers.
0.916700	I think I have a great ability to understand what doctors and nurses are trying to tell me. I am familiar with some of the language used to describe medical conditions, and I tend to ask questions in areas that I'm not strong with. 
0.916700	I feel that I perfectly competent to make basic health decisions. I am a tive English speaker and routinely complete medical information forms by myself without help.
0.761100	With all the doctors and nurses help I feel like I can make adequate decisions in my Healthcare.  Doctors and nurses are always really helpful and I feel like I can rely on them  
0.750000	When a doctor or health professiol is there in front of me, I am usually comfortable asking questions and finding out answers. In this case it is usually pretty easy and straightforward as these people are usually able to help. However, when I do not have one of these people, finding the answers to my questions is much harder. I usually use the internet to find my answers but finding a reliable source on the internet is not always easy. 
0.838900	To a certain degree. I can understand most of the basic health information but decisions are a little bit difficult to make.
0.822200	I feel pretty confident. I have taken some medical classes in the past and that has really helped with explaining and being able to break down medical terminology  I also have a nurse for a mother so it makes it really easy to get answers to questions or if I don't understand something.
0.883300	I feel as though I can understand everything a doctor tells me in order to make decisions. If there is something that I don't understand, I have no problem asking the doctor to explain.
0.555600	I don't have obama care, so I don't feel I have access
0.738900	I feel like I'm pretty god at understanding my medical conditions and history. I'm young enough that I don't have a ton to deal with.  I will ask the doctor when I visit if I don't understand something.
0.705600	I think I understand medical information about myself fairly well. If I ever have any difficulty, I can just ask my husband and he will help me figure it out. If he is uvailable then I would ask the nurse or doctor for clarification of any information I don't understand.
0.838900	I feel that I am able to comprehend what I am told by my doctors. While I sometimes have a hard time understanding the insurance benefits I do understand and am able to fill out all the necessary forms and documentation. I normally understand what I am told about my health and treatments.
0.516700	I think that I have the capacity of the average person to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. At times, I do need assistance filling out forms because I am afraid that I will do so improperly and they will not have all the information needed because I misinterpreted a question. Also at times, I try to process the information they give me and am afraid to ask questions so I then go home and search on the internet for further information. 
0.838900	I feel very comfortable. I have no issues talking to doctors. I will tell them anything. I don't worry about holding anything back. I usually understand everything they say, and if I don't I ask questions. 
0.855600	I feel like I have all appropriate knowledge and information. I can obtain all necessary info and feel good talking with medical professiols about my health.
0.916700	i can do research and ask questions
0.750000	I think I am well equipped to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have been seeing a doctor regularly for the same issue for decades and I understand the information. However, this was not always true since years ago I had a lot of trouble understanding-- since then I have read a lot about my issues so it is no longer confusing for me.  
0.705600	I feel semi-confident in my ability to understand basic health information and services. I do find difficulty when attempting to get answers from health professiols. I generally notice that health professiols automatically assume that people have a general understanding of all aspects regarding health but I don't believe this is the case. This makes decision making more difficult. 
0.916700	I have full capacity to understand all the basic health information and services because I have experience with the medical field. Not only that, I am fluent in English, so I am able to make deductions based on what I already know. 
0.872200	I don't feel I'm lacking in any of these areas. Between what the medical practitioner I usually see (a PA) tells me and the ability to fill in the gaps with information I can find on the Internet, I feel like I'm able to keep myself pretty well informed with what I need to know. That said, I don't currently deal with anything overly complicated either. When my dad was diagnosed with a rarer form of blood cancer, the learning process they went through was not as simple.
0.805600	I feel like I am completely capable of understanding information given to me by health care workers.  Although I don't always ask questions like I should, I know that I am able to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.750000	I'm quite capable of understanding what doctors are telling and reading medical documents. I have a background reading in scientific research, so understanding the technical side of things is quite easy for me.
0.805600	I feel like I can obtain and process basic health information effectively. It's only when there is a complication that I don't always get the information I need or follow up material to make an informed decision. Or sometimes I don't think of  question till long after I have left the doctor's office.
0.722200	I think I do have the capacity to deal with the health information that I get. I am always sure to not leave the doctor's office or hospital with unswered questions. I try to search on the web first and I make a list of all the things I would like to ask so I don't leave details without answer.
0.916700	I understand everything any medical professiol can tell me and ask questions if I don't.
0.816700	"I think that the doctors who I am a patient under are generally capable of explaining my problems to me. The forms are also easy enough to understand. The problem starts with me and my disconnect between doctors. I don't speak the language of medicine, and I don't know how to properly express symptoms. So there is a moment when the doctor asks me if I have any questions, but I say I do not. I only come to find out days or weeks later that I should have asked certain questions when I run into problems. For instance, I never used to consider the side effects of medications until I started suffering them, and when I did start to talk to doctors about them I could not just say ""tell me about the side effects,"" because they would only discuss the most common ones. If not for the fact that I suffered rare side effects, I would not have known that you have to push the issue in order to learn about the effects doctors feel aren't worth mentioning."
0.916700	I have no problem processing health or health related information . I am a retired Paramedic and my wife is a nurse
0.888900	COMPLETELY
0.744400	I PRETTY MUCH UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION BEING GIVING. HOWEVER, SOMETIMES THERE ARE CERTAIN TERMS I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND. I JUST LIKE MAKING SURE ABOUT MY HEALTH, WHAT I CAN AND CANNOT TAKE OR DO AND THE AFFECTS OF THE MEDICINE I TAKE. A LOT OF MEDICATIONS CAUSE SERIOUS SIDE AFFECTS. I LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT I KNOW WHAT I AM GETTING INTO.
0.627800	I'm not confident at all that I obtain what I need to. A lot of the blame lies with me I guess. I am a nervous person, and I usually want to get away from people ( especially medical people) fast. If they seem busy or annoyed, I fell like running away. Fortutely I have a very nice DR. who usually explains a lot of what I need to know without me asking. 
0.916700	I have no problem understanding what is said by my doctor or on written forms. I am capable of asking questions about anything I do not understand, but since I have no problem understanding what I am being told or reading, this situation does not come up. Anything I am not sure of, I do my own research on.
0.672200	I have good common sense, so therefore I can understand things that are common. When it comes to the technical terms and jargon of the medical profession I like to get help just so that I do not misunderstand anything
0.727800	To an extent, I understand what they say.. But there are times where I need the doctor or nurse to better explain what's going on especially if there are decisions on treatments and etc.
0.900000	I have taken human atomy and physiology in high school and I have taken a health class, so I am aware of a lot of basic information that they would tell you. Most results I have obtained in the past few years are online, which usually give you more information than you need.
0.694400	I feel I have the capacity to understand and ask questions, but I rarely ask or mention everything I want to. I usually think that the medical professiol will think I'm wasting their time, and don't speak up.
0.583300	I am completely capable to understand basic health information . I sometimes have trouble understanding the medications and how they explain things on a piece of paper. But i always ask them when i have a doubt about something and when explain it i completely understand.
0.844400	From my experiences and helping others, I know that the best way to help yourself with medical issues is to research and figure out issues mainly by yourself. So I feel very confident in my abilities to research and figure out problems even before seeing a doctor. By doing this I have gone in with knowledge and correctly diagnosed an issue that the doctor got wrong even. 
0.755600	"I feel like I have a pretty high capacity to obtain and process health information. Thankfully, I've lived a very healthy life and haven't had all that many interactions with healthcare professiols. But I owe that in part to my interest in health, exercise, and nutrition on a hobby level. I've studied a variety of health topics simply because it interests me; over the years I've read dozens of books on health and nutrition, disease, and pharmacology. I'm a curious person that likes to know how things work, and the human body happens to be one of those things I like to learn about. I read a number of health related blogs, occasiolly listen to health related podcasts, and have even dug in to scientific papers in medical jourls before. So I have much more background information than the typical person - nowhere near that of a medical professiol of course, but I can ""talk the talk"" better than most on a variety of health related topics, I believe. If anything, I'm more confused by the bureaucratic side of things. Insurance plans and coverage, law and tax related issues etc. are about as complex as the human body itself these days. I can't quite get myself as interested to learn more about that, but I know if I needed to research details of my plan or my options, I'm confident I could find and process that information too."

0.822200	I have a basic knowledge of some of the medical jargon that has been used around me when it comes to my body.

0.683300	I know I have the capacity to understand and retain most information fed to me by doctors and nurses.

I trust my primary health physician as he has been right in the past and has helped me get over a few things with no complications and fairly quickly in all instances as well.  He goes over any documents or directions with me before I leave so I can ask questions and so he knows I understand everything.

0.866700	I feel like I can understand basic information because I try to ask as many questions as possible. I am a very anxious and paranoid person, so if I don't ask questions I'll regret it later and have to call or go back to get them answered. I'd rather look a little ignorant  by making someone reiterate something to me, then be completely in the dark. 
0.888900	While I don't know much about medical or health related information, I am generally a smart person. I can figure most things out myself with a little research. If there is something that I don't understand, I have family who I can ask to help me out.

If I have any problems with reading information that I'm given, I feel confident that I can ask the doctor or other professiol and they will give me a good explation. I also do a lot of reading and research on my own about medical conditions I have and what I can expect in the future due to these medical conditions. I do reading and research online and I also ask people I know who have the same medical condition(s) as me about their experiences. Using all this information, I feel really good about the questions I need to ask my doctor or areas where I need further explation and information. All of this also makes me feel confident about any decisions I need to make about treatment options. 
0.750000	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information.

0.883300	To some extent- whatever I don't understand, I just ask questions. 
0.900000	I self diagnosed my self as a hypochondriac. I often visit the doctor for every ache or bump despite having nothing wrong with me.

I feel I have a lot of experience with going to the doctor and asking questions.

0.650000	I think that when you are in a position to have face to face time with a doctor or nurse, you are usually not thinking clearly and things go rather quickly and then when you can't think of what you want to ask right that minute they leave and as soon as you are home you start thinking of questions you should have asked. You can alway call and wait for them to get back to you but that always seems like you are bothering them. The internet is usually a good source to do you your own research to get a better understanding of whats going on, assuming you fact check and don't just believe something because some random person said it was true.
0.872200	I feel as though I could get the information that I need and process it to a great degree. I tend to bring notebooks with me to the doctor to write down questions I have and what is said to reference in the future.
0.850000	without understanding i can spoil my health mor so first of all understand the problem well then correct  treatment
0.850000	If the issues that I have are basic I feel that I will have more than enough capacity to understand and obtain the information needed to make the correct decision(s) for my benefit. If the issue is something of higher significance I may than need more assistance. 
0.783300	I am very confident that I the ability to obtain proper medical and health decisions. If something isn't clear, I can always ask and find the information I need. I feel confident in my doctor to give me all the information I need.
0.783300	I believe I'm very capable of understanding most medical information. I feel with the doctors I have had explain much of what is going on with me in plain english. However when I have had doctors in the hospital particularly that were very unhelpful and didn't speak in plain english. So i find the more of the emergency i have been in the harder it has been to make a the high decisions I have to be very trusting. 
0.777800	I feel like I am capable of understanding basic health information. I have not had an experience where I did not understand most of the information given to me. I also am in college and planning on going into the medical field, so I would like to say that I should know more than the average person that takes this survey.
0.833300	Although I don't often understand the big words that are used and have had to come home and look some of them up on the internet, the doctors at the clinic I usually go to are pretty good about answering questions and putting it into terms that I can understand. The nurses at the clinic and the hospital are also willing to answer questions to help me understand. And even though I sometimes have felt that I am not sure about making the right decisions I trust the doctors to help me make an informed decision.
0.744400	I feel that overall I do OK. I do a lot of research on my own and try to prepare for appointments in advance. If I don't feel a doctor is helpful and really listens to me, I will switch to someone else. 
0.800000	I due tend to understand most medical information, and info presented to me, if I dont I can find a way to figure it out.
0.866700	I think that I am able to understand the instructions fairly well. If I have any questions I ask my doctor directly or I follow up with the office after I leave.
0.572200	I am very confident in getting all the information that is needed. The reason is very simple I do not trust anyone or anything. By having that believe I always make sure  thing goes smoothly.
0.755600	I have the capacity to obtain and process but the problem is, in my opinion, that there are so many conflicting claims about treatment, about the quality and efficacy of medication, and then loss in meaning when dealing with doctors/nurses who don't speak your language as a first language, that getting through the health care system these days is almost an active minefield.  Or a crapshoot.
0.761100	I know I have the resources to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I may not be able to do so immediately, but with the help of the internet and my wife who is a nurse, I am confident I can understand just about anything I may need to go over with a doctor (non-specialist). Most people can't answer all their own medical questions and I don't think it's fair for anyone to be able to answer medical questions without being given adequate time to look into the questions.
0.883300	I feel comfortable seeking medical information and discussing health topics with professiols. Usually can read in office information, talk to health professiols, and/or research information independently.
0.733300	WHEN I GET THE MEDICAL ANTTENTION
0.872200	I believe that I can understand basic health information well enough to be able to make appropriate decisions.  I believe this because I have the ability to comprehend what the health professiols are telling me, and if I have questions I will ask them to obtain the answer.
0.550000	It all depends on the wording. If it is placed in simple english then it is easily understood if they attempt to use many weird medical terms then it is different
0.811100	I have a university education so I'm not too concerned about not being able to process or understand basic health information and services needed to make health decisions. With ease of access to information online through a smartphone and being open with medical assistants and practitioners, I believe I am able to understand everything being presented to me. Excessive legalese or use of scientific mes/terminology may give me pause, but I am confident I will be able to find a means of getting layman's definitions for them or convince medical personnel to simplify anything that I might find confusing.
0.833300	I feel that I have superior capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions. I tend to do my own research before making decisions, sometimes compiling positives and negatives and balancing them to make the most optimal decision.
0.850000	I feel like I can understand most of what is told to me; I also act as another set of ears for my fiance, who has had a number of health issues lately. I make sure to ask questions on anything that we're not completely clear on, and know when to get clarification when needed.
0.777800	I have a basic understanding due to a few courses in school. I took emt training etc
0.750000	I am perfectly capable in obtaining, understanding and processing basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have never needed any help when dealing with these issues.
0.811100	I feel I have a high capacity for understanding health information. I am college educated and have worked in health care for over six years. This gives me an understanding of some basic health knowledge and knowing how the process works.
0.816700	I make sure I am explained in layman's terms anything I should know about any conditions or symptoms or medicines I need. When I leave the office I am confident I understand throughly and am able to make informed decisions. 
0.916700	From the various tests I've taken in my life I've been judged to be in the upper levels of intelligence. I'm aware of nothing in my experience which do not support those results. Overall, my reading and understanding of English and the ability to comprehend all types of information is more than adequate. 
0.850000	I think I have all of the resources needed to make appropriate health decisions. First off I have a great doctor who is more then willing to answer all questions that I have and he explains information well. I also have the internet of course including some resources there that my doctor has recommended. Overall I have had very few problems and when I do my questions are usually answered satisfactorily. 
0.916700	I have always been proactive regarding my responsibilities as a patient.  A nurse once told me that doctor's don't remember everything so keep them on their toes.
0.916700	I am the son of a doctor so I am very aware of my health needs and how to read documents. I know what is good for myself and my body and I am able to understand how different procedures affect different outcomes and make a ratiol decision based upon the facts. 
0.850000	Well, I have the good fortune to be a fluent speaker of English in a largely English-speaking country and, while I am a pretty low-key individual, I am not afraid to ask a question about something I don't understand.  I am not afraid of looking foolish- it is much better to be properly informed.  While I have a bad tendency to not think of a question fast enough while I'm at the doctor's office, my main physician lets me e-mail him and has answered many of my belated questions that way.
0.777800	I feel pretty confident in my abilities to obtain and process medical information given to me. Occasiolly I will come up with questions after I've already left the office and I'll need to get in contact with them again.. sometimes that causes me anxiety but I can push through it to get the information I need.
0.661100	I have a good capacity to get the information and services I need.  I have enough insurance coverage to get health services.  I have good doctors who provide me with the information I need.  I can also use the internet to get some information.
0.844400	Completely comfortable with understanding health information and making an informed decision based on it. 
0.661100	I believe I have a moderate capacity. The issue is that I have a very limited knowledge of many parts of the body and how they should function with one another properly. It's sad to say but it's true. So it can be difficult and I can require extra explaining when something is wrong with me.
0.911100	I used to sell health insurance so I do not have problems filling out the forms. I understand most of the paperwork. When a doctor is talking to me, they sometimes us terminology that I do not understand but I do not have a problem asking them what that means.
0.600000	Mostly I can figure stuff out, but there are still a lot of questions that go unswered sometimes.  Although they try to explain things to me I still sometimes have a hard time remembering or understanding them.  Doctor information to me is often complicated.
0.444400	I always ask my husband to accompany me to my doctor's appointment because most of the time I can't remember everything the doctor tells me and I can' understand most of the medical terms.  My husband is a nurse so he always go with me in my appointments.
0.855600	I believe that I am quite confident in understanding basic health information and services about my health decisions and other medical conditions that I experience.  I like to do research online and read articles, if not even medical jourls about specific conditions that I experience, or at high-risk for.
0.827800	There is nothing that prevents me from understanding basic health information. I have enough experience with the medical system that I can understand the common terms used in writing and expressed by my doctor.
0.900000	I feel that I am completely capable of obtaining, processing and understanding health information if I need to. I have no defects of vision, education, memory or any other disability that would impair my capability to acquire any information or to understand it.
0.883300	I feel confident enough to make health decisions.  I have been hospitalized numerous times for Crohn's Disease and partial bowel obstructions along with several surgeries to make me comfortable enough to understand what the health providers have told me.  I also do a lot of research online to understand my conditions and what will happen and what kind of treatment regimen I will take along with the post hospitalization recovery period.
0.794400	I think that I understand and am capable of understanding most of what a doctor or nurse is explaining and if I don't I can ask them to go a little more detail. I feel comfortable asking about things that I'm not quite certain about without feeling dumb.
0.883300	I usually have a good understanding of what is being told to me.  I ask questions when needed and also may look up something about it on the Internet. Then I can make the best decision based on what I have learned about my condition.
0.900000	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic information from my doctors. I generally feel like most doctors want their patients to understand what is happening and they speak in a way that things are clear and when they don't I don't mind letting them know.
0.827800	I feel that I have had enough experience and education to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services I need to make decisions. I have had college courses in biology and health, I have some familiarity with Latin and Greek, and I regularly read science jourls to keep up with discoveries and developments in health sciences.
0.583300	I have to ask questions again if I do not understand.I often have a family member come with me so I do not miss anything.
0.850000	Well I'd rather know than not know so I'm not afraid of asking hard questions and will press if I'm not getting answers that I fully trust or think they might be holding back.  I also think I'm quite capable of understanding my options when explained to me properly as well as of course being able to research my options myself.  All in all I feel quite capable that most of the time I can make good decisions about my health.
0.861100	I am highly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have a strong educatiol background in health and medicine so I understand what I need and expectations for the services should receive. 
0.916700	I feel like I have the capacity to understand health information.  If I ever have any trouble in understanding, I am not ashamed or bashful to ask for further information or a more clear explation from the doctor or nurse.  My husband can look over my paperwork and if he has any questions he will ask me or even call the healthcare professiol.
0.805600	I don't have any trouble understanding materials that are given to me regarding healthcare, but I don't always read everything. I'll read the parts I think are most important. Face-to-face communication with any healthcare provider is difficult because they are usually in a hurry. If I have questions I know I'll want to ask, I'll write them down ahead of time, but there's not time during appointments to discuss anything.
0.916700	I feel that I am of sound mind and body and am more than capable of making decision in regards to my health. I usually don't have issues with taking medications as prescribed, always have a good understanding of what I should and shouldn't do for my ailments, and have the capability of seeking out information I don't have. 
0.511100	It's hard to say. It often depends on what it's about--if it's psychological, I can understand things a bit better, but with most GPs and such it's not something I'm well versed in
0.916700	I think I have a good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I've never had a problem understanding my doctors or forms before. I do not think I need help with this.
0.916700	I am fully capable of processing information from a health professiol.  I am also good at looking up symptoms and I usually am good at figuring out what is wrong.  (For example, my husband had a blood clot in his leg, but I looked it up before he went to the doctor and told him it looked as if it was a superficial clot, and it turned out that is what the doctor said.)  I know that I can go to the doctor for more information when necessary and I know I can get second opinions with serious health concerns. 
0.833300	i feel fairly confident, most persol information is straight forward. Most questions can be asked and understood in the office and i can always do some research on the internet.
0.916700	I have no mental problems that prevent me from understanding the written or spoken word.  I am nearly completely deaf, but my doc speaks louder and it is not hard to hear him.  And if I do not understand something he or the nurse says, I ask them to repeat themselves.  Same goes with any form I am filling out.  If I do not understand the question, I ask.  So, I would say I have 100% capacity to understand information, get information, process said information and make the necessary medical decisions.
0.838900	I feel I have the skills required to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I have proficiency reading and writing in English, which all of my health information is presented in.  I work in the sciences, which helps me to understand more complex terminology as well as have the ability to look up what I don't understand.  I ask for help when needed, and am always open with my doctors even if it is about questioble or embarrassing issues. 
0.800000	I believe that I can understand health information better when told in person rather than reading a pamphlet or brochure. This also offers the opportunity to ask questions so that I'm sure to understand something I may have initially missed. 
0.761100	I feel absolutely competent in understanding and processing basic health information to make decisions about my health. However, finding or obtaining information that will truly be helpful to my health is difficult. Intense research is often necessary for basic information. 
0.833300	I feel I'm able to follow and comprehend medical information farely well. Especially, since you can research much of the information online.  I'm pretty good at doing my due diligence.  
0.916700	I feel I have a full capability to process and understand any medical or health information given to me. I know the basics of how the body works, and anything beyond that is not too complicated for me to understand. I feel completely comfortable vigating the health care system.
0.727800	I feel sort of confident to be able to process the information that I am given by the doctors. I do wish that I had a better way to understand the results  of the blood work and xr and mris.
0.772200	I am fully capable of understanding and processing basic and even advanced health information but sometimes I may need things to be explained fully to understand certain points.
0.855600	I feel strongly that I have the capacity to find the resources and ensure I understand basic health information and services with regards to myself. I feel I am able to find the information needed and reach a high level of understanding which ebles me to make the proper health decisions needed.
0.805600	For most basic issues, I feel very confident.  However, my experience helping my mother sort through terminology and different specialists for pancreatic cancer taught me that there are definitely areas that I struggle to understand.  Often the shock of whatever was just told to you shrouds your ability to even realize you're not understanding.
0.900000	I feel confident that I can understand what is being explained to me.  However, if there is something I don't understand, I ask them to explain it further.
0.866700	I have complete control over understand what is said or written to me. If I need help, then I ask. But that is rare.
0.622200	I understand basic of the medical term.  If I still not fully understand at the office, I will do more research or asked my sister for help. Because she is an nurse too. 
0.855600	I feel like I am pretty informed and do ask questions about health care options. There are times that my doctor is uble or unwilling to address certain questions (i.e. supplements versus prescription meds; treatment side effects, etc.) and questions go unswered.  But I generally understand information I am given or I am able to find competent online sources to read further and understand.
0.916700	I feel confident answering questions freely. When I ask enough questions I feel more trusting of the doctor or nurse. I also feel capable that if I felt unsure I could seek out other sources to come back to the doctor and further the discussion.
0.827800	I feel I am quite knowledgeable about my health problems and can understand what is said to me
0.805600	I feel like I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions. Regarding forms, I sometimes have difficulty remembering family history and accurately describing symptoms but I try my best. Regarding doctors/medical professiols, I try to prepare questions in advance and ask for explations for anything I don't understand. Generally the most difficult part is getting the doctor to answer some basic questions before rushing out. I don't think they're rude, just definitely in a hurry. If there's still things I don't understand, I'll use google or call and talk to a nurse. I might not fully understand everything, but I trust my capacity to make appropriate medical decisions.
0.900000	Yes I am quite confident that I can ask the right questions plus plenty more they probably don't want me to ask. My knowledge comes from many years of using tural methods of healing over traditiol methods.
0.900000	I'm pretty confident with my understanding and basic knowledge of the health information, and I do rely quite a bit on online information, if I didn't understand something even after I ask my doctor, I spend a considerable amount to research more online. It also helps that I have a couple doctors in my family as well as a good friend of mine who is also a doctor (in addition to my own doctor) so I talk to them quite a bit whenever I have questions, although sometimes it can get confusing to get multiple answers from different people at the same time (one may say I need more meds for my cholesterol, another says i don't need that much, etc).
0.722200	I feel like I know my health. I ask what I need in order to understand. I feel adequate enough to explain any problems or deficiencies that I may have.
0.916700	I can understand the materials that are given to me by a  doctor and I fully understand what they tell me about any problems that I may have. If I don't understand something, I always ask the doctor to explain it to me. Any forms that I need to fill out I can usually fill them out all by myself without any help. If I have a question about a field to fill out on a form I will ask the receptionist about it. I will then fill out the form completely. I don't make any decisions without knowing the consequences of those decisions first.I always ask the doctor of my options, so I can fully understand what I need to do.
0.833300	i feel that i am very capable to make my own health decisions. i only have a difficult time when the paperwork gets into legal matters. that's when it gets a little confusing for me. i am quite knowledgeable about medical terminology and procedures. but if i have a question i always ask and if i feel that i need a second opnion i will go and get it.
0.883300	It's easy for me because I'm obsessed with health and fitness (tural bodybuilder since the age of 16). I have no illnesses and pretty much never get sick, so I seldom have anything to process. When the occasion does arise, my tural interest and passion for health causes me to exert more effort to understand and assimilate the information, that's a large part of why it comes easily.
0.916700	I have strong abilities to understand medical information and research things I don't understand so I can ask my medical providers informed questions without wasting their time or mine. 
0.761100	I believe I am knowledgeable enough to understand most basic information. However, I do tend to ask a lot of questions just to make sure I get everything right. Especially when it comes to your health, it is always good to get more information and clarification. 
0.850000	I think I do pretty good in all those areas of health decision making, with one exception. When I am not feeling well, I do sometimes ask for help in understanding the health communications from my doctors and nurses. This was an issue two years ago when I had a fall and a concussion. So I got a lot of healthcare information then, but I was suffering from concussion which made the understanding difficult by myself. Then I had to get help.
0.572200	well fortutely there is the internet,and i can search for more information about the things i dont know enough about.without that i doubt i could find the info easily.
0.900000	I am a fluent English writer and speaker and I can read very well.  I am very aware of what the Doctor or Nurse is telling me and I clearly understand what they are saying. 
0.883300	I feel like I am well prepared for interactions with health professiols. I can understand most that is to,d to me, and I am not afraid to ask questions or request clarification regarding the items I don't fully comprehend. 
0.777800	My doctors and nurses tell me what to do, give me the phone number and explain to me what will be done and when it needs to be done.
0.850000	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Occaisiolly if there is language or benefits that are worded in a confusing manner I can call my benefit provider for clarification. 
0.866700	I listen to the doctor, I sometimes take notes. I ask if I have any questions before they leave the room
0.750000	i think i do but sometimes it is hard to understand what some terms mean but i always find the answer if i dont understand something 
0.750000	I feel I have adequate ability to understand basic health information and services in regards to using it to make intelligent health decisions. My introverted ture makes face-to-face conversations awkward and I tend to avoid them. But I am usually offered ample written material that I can read on my own.
0.916700	I have a good relationship with my doctor.  He is very down to earth, understanding and easy to talk to. I feel comfortable sharing information.  He is good at explaining information.  I have a lot of trust in him and this helps me to make appropriate health decisions.
0.838900	I feel I'm well informed on most medical matters that affect me. When I have questions I usually search the internet first. I view several sites and read a couple articles to get a consensus. 
0.644400	I feel I have a basic understanding of health information that is provided to me by my doctor.  If I am confused by information I will look it up on the Internet for clarification. I believe with my knowledge and the Internet I came make informed decisions. 
0.838900	As far as past experiences go I have always had the capacity to understand.  I feel somewhat confident that I would always be able to do so, however, if I developed something that was out of the ordiry, I might find myself uble to understand.
0.855600	I think my ability to understand is good and I also have the ability to research answers from places like Mayo Clinic online.  But sometimes I do find it hard to talk to doctors and hard to be able to assess if they understood 'me' as opposed to me understanding them.  I think I'm capable of making appropriate health decisions.
0.850000	I think I clearly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself. I am quite intelligence and have never had a problem understanding health information and if I din't, I knew where to find the information to explain it.
0.866700	I feel that I'm pretty good at understanding health information and for the few instances where I'm not completely sure, I ask the doctor questions. So I think that I have a really firm grasp of what I need to know to make a good health decision.
0.833300	In my opinion, I have a high degree of capacity to obtain and coherently process my health information. I've thus far accurately understood my treatment plans and executed effective decisions that have had great outcomes.
0.538900	I feel that some doctors could be better at explaining medical conditions in a way that normal people can understand it. Sometimes it's difficult to understand what they mean, but occasiolly I am too embarrassed to ask what they mean exactly. In that case I will look it up myself later. I realize that it would be better to actually ask the doctor, because the internet is not always the most reliable place to find information. So I feel that I do have the capacity to get the information, but I don't always do it because I feel intimidated by some doctors.
0.844400	I feel quite confident in being able to understand basic health services and information. If there is anything I'm unsure about I ask my doctor. If it's after I've left the doctor's office, the internet can be a helpful tool in better understand certain services or diagnosis.
0.755600	I don't need accommodations or help to obtain or process basic health information. However, when I need some specific information usually I find it difficult to obtain it.  Medical pamphlets are general and vague, doctors and nurses are busy.
0.850000	Overall I am confident in my abilities here. The greatest worries come in areas where there is a great deal of conflicting information in circulation, such as on appropriate macronutrient balance for diet. Then I feel I have to fall back on my own judgment rather than that of my own doctor, which is risky.
0.916700	I feel like I have a great understanding of getting and processing the information I need regarding my health. I have no issues.
0.833300	I am very attentive to my Health and always ask questions about different situations when I don't understand. And when it comes to finding additiol information on a particular subject I am either on the internet or ask my doctor if I am not sure.
0.916700	I am a fully confident in my ability to understand basic health information. I can rely on online resources like Google to help me obtain the information I am interested in.
0.611100	YES BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T ASK YOU WILL NEVER KNOW ARE UNDERSTAND 
0.672200	When I have to make important decisions or feel a little uneasy, I make sure I bring someone with me to help. So if I don't fully understand they can help me.I have no problem asking if I do not understand something.
0.838900	I can understand health information and make health decision as long as it's not made obtuse by using technical terms or covering pages with legal talk. I can process medical info about as well as any other info. It's just in the medical field they often talk about things that need to be expanded on to fully understand, the mes of medicines and illnesses are not easily understood by regular people, so given a more thorough explation, I'm very confident in my ability to make health decisions.
0.866700	I think I can read and understand most information presented to me and If I have any problems I usually just ask somebody.
0.883300	I feel that I have a high capacity to understand health information. If I need clarification, I have no problem asking a health care professiol. 
0.744400	I feel very confident that i can find and understand the information and  needed to make appropriate health decisions. At times when i am home and unsure about certain health related problems, i use trusted health websites or books. Also if i still find it hard to understand i ask my doctor when i see him or consult my friends who are doctors.
0.794400	I think I have this capacity to a high degree. At least on par with others. I also don't hesitate to ask health professiols to explain anything that I don't understand.
0.761100	I am confident that I can process most of the health information. Before I make an appropriate health decision I usually ask at least two different doctors for opinion. I am really confident that I can make an appropriate health decision because I process the information carefully and with help of specialists.
0.688900	Whenever u go to the doctor,  i make sure to ask questions.  If there is anything I don't understand or papers i don't understand  i always ask for help to make sure i receive the help needed.
0.733300	I think that my understanding of medical terminology is better than average.  I try to do a good deal of research before a doctor visit, and I will ask appropriate questions when there.  
0.866700	I have no problem with asking questions which make me feel comfortable about understanding basic health issues.  Sometimes I get uncomfortable with trying to process information becasue some types of ambiguities are usually involved.  I don't try to understand too much of what I am told because I trust the health professiols that I am dealing with.
0.838900	To some degree. I do feel like healthcare professiols are able to answer my questions when I see them. The trouble is being able to afford to go to the doctor very often.
0.916700	At one time, years ago, I studied biology, Latin and Greek. If I find my understanding of a document or information is uncertain, I look it up. The internet can be a good resource for information. So is a library.
0.588900	When it comes to basic health information, I would like to think I know as much as the average person--I at least possess the capacity to understand said information. If worse comes to worse, I can Google it later--after years of practice, I am quite adept at Googling and finding information that I can understand myself.
0.861100	I am quite able to process medical info if it is free of medical jargon, chemical mes, latin mes, and what i call medicalese which is like legalese.I don't retain info when in pain so well, that is when I bring an extra pair of ears so to speak.
0.766700	If I don't understand something I ask questions.  I would rather talk with someone than read about instructions or explations of my care.  I feel that after asking questions I am well informed to make decisions for myself.

When filling out paperwork if I do not understand something I will ask questions until I understand.
0.511100	I think I am starting to understand important health information.

0.650000	I feel comfortable enough understanding health situations where I have to make a choice on behalf of either myself or my kids. Our doctors are generally pretty good about explaining things, which makes us feel comfortable asking questions. I think that a person's capacity to process and obtain health info like this does largely depend on the doctor's ability to explain things in a way that makes sense to a patient/caregiver, and our doctors are very solid in this area.
0.944400	I think i hav no problem with any of that
0.666700	I think I can understand the basic health information and services for the most part.  But sometimes the language used I will need some help with.  I don't need help all the time just some of the time.  I think that for most of the time I can do it myself.

0.794400	I feel like overall I can articulate my needs and get the help I need/ understand the basics of the medical care I receive.  I do more often than not withhold some information from my doctor because I didn't want to get a lecture. For example, i am on the keto diet,  which has done wonders for my labs,  weight, etc. Yet when i mention it all I get is how bad it is... It's really frustrating. So i feel like the communication is not there and i often feel rushed and just put to the side in terms of the concerns I have. I'm very information literate and able to understand studies and research results,  so I'm usually mostly put of by my physician's ibility to consider other options or opinions. 
0.761100	I can understand most things concerning health, but rarely ask for help when I do. That is a bad trait on my part.
0.822200	I have access to online information.

0.900000	I majored in biology so it's easy for me to understand health information.

0.644400	When the information is basic and in lamens terms I can understand it enough to have an idea of what is happening. Most of the words they use to identify medical issues are confusing and even the internet doesn't have a clear answer that I can understand. I sometimes ask my nurse friends if they can help me understand it too. 
0.794400	I feel comfortable reading complicated documents and sifting through insurance information, policies, and procedures. I sometimes lack the confidence to ask the doctor all of the questions I have because I feel bad taking up too much of their time. That is something I need to work on.

0.733300	Sometimes when i see a doctor, i have a hard time processing the info. i can't ask the questions necessary to understand what is being told to me, my spouse has to be with me in the room. I believe it is because i am nervous being there, not because i don't understand them.

Sometimes, however, I feel rushed and don't think of questions until after I see a doctor or nurse. Other times I feel like I just don't know what questions to ask.

0.900000	I can talk to my doctor about anything that is related to my health and I know how to ask my doctor questions.
0.722200	I'm a smart guy so I have A basic grasp of what's happening but it's always better to be completely sure and not make any foolish mistakes.
0.866700	I have the ability to do so, and usually feel at ease enough with the process. I sometimes am confused, but do my best to seek answers.
0.916700	I think it's all pretty standard stuff that doesn't need too much help understanding. They usually do a good job of explaining the important details to you. If I have any issues I'll speak with them to clear it up right away.
0.872200	I have the capacity to do all of that, as long as it's out there on the internet. Medical office people usually are rushed or too busy to answer all questions or at least not to the detail I want.
0.650000	I'm kind of confident about my capacity to obtain, process and understand the basic health information and services.

0.722200	i will ask a doctor for anything that i need to know regarding documents that i need to sign and anything else that is needed to know or explain. 
0.883300	I persolly believe that I have a high capacity of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services needed.   I do read them all and ask questions if needed be.  Seemingly when I do ask questions, I rarely get an answer to my questions.   
0.788900	I have a pretty average capacity to obtain and understand health information. I see a pulmonologist and a regular doctor regularly and always have questions that usually either get answered or I get referred to the appropriate doctor. There are a few conditions I have that I have a hard time explaining and getting an explation about from my doctors. Why it sometimes feels like my heart is beating harder than it is, for example.
0.766700	I usually have no problem understanding, processing, and obtaining basic health information and am very able to make appropriate decisions.  When I am in need of medical help, I usually make the appointment needed at a local clinic and the P.A. I like to go to is very good about explaining things, and making sure medical information is understood, as well as provided.  I also feel comfortable asking her questions. 
0.866700	I think I have a very good capacity to understand. I have studied medical terminology and I'm comfortable researching on the Internet.
0.833300	Reading and understanding health information and services is a full time job!. have trouble understanding words used in health care. In some instances, a word may be totally unfamiliar. In other cases, a word may be familiar, but the i may not understand it in a health care context. For example, upon hearing âkeep your glucose in a normal range,â people know what normal means about a person, and they may have a range in their kitchen, but they may miss the intended concept in terms of health care. Even people who understand the concept may need more information than the phrase provides. They need to be told what glucose measurements are considered normal.
0.866700	I like to think I have excellent reading and comprehension skills.  Most problems regarding the subject at hand have to do with the fact that much, if not most, of the material available is written for those who do not.
0.883300	If the information is written in a way that an average person can understand, then I will be able to understand it. If there's a lot of medical jargon, I'm going to have a problem understanding it.
0.788900	I feel like my medical professiol usually answers any questions I may have, but in the event that there is something I need explained to me in more detail, I never feel too hesitant to ask.
0.850000	I feel in most cases I have the sufficient capacity to acquire the necessary information needed to understand health information. I believe I am capable of obtaining meaningful and detailed information of any and all information relevant to my needs as related to health issues. This includes relevant resources such health care professiols for particular medical conditions.
0.644400	I will do more research and ask the questions next time when I visit them.  Therefore, I will be fully understand. 
0.900000	I think that I have a decent understanding of basic health concepts. If I happen to have a question, I do ask my doctor, if I happen to be in his office. I also look up information online on sites such as WebMD. 
0.916700	I feel completely able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. The language of health information material tends to be in the simplest form possible while still accurately conveying the necessary information. The great majority of health care professiols that I have dealt with make a point of assuring themselves that I understand the information necessary for decision making. They also invite questions. 
0.583300	When I do not get all the information that I need I usually go to the internet for any missing or additiol information I might need. The health industry has gotten a lot more complicated in all levels of health. From making simple appointments to diagnosing, to the right health care needs and all of the complications with insurance , how to pay and how much health care cost. The healthcare industry is overwhelming and that is an understatement. If someone needs an example of a broken system all they need to do is look at the healthcare industry. 
0.811100	I feel like I can handle health information  pretty well.  I have been to hospitals before though with others  mostly, and am usually the one who reads all the paperwork.  I also know where to look for more information.
0.900000	I can understand what I'm told to me by a doctor but when they use terms that I've never heard of before I get them to explain it to me in terms that the everyday person understands. I can understand all the basic info they tell me.
0.800000	I've only got a college education, but despite my setback, I DO understand basic health questions that I'm asked, and can explain what I'm feeling to a medical professiol. The only real problem lies in actually communicating my issues, instead of just passively letting them go unmentioned. However, I certainly know how to fill out forms and talk to doctors and nurses, and I can read the abbreviations on my prescription labels. 
0.511100	I do not have the full capacity to do those things. I have a caretaker that helps me with these things. 
0.488900	Reading health information is scary and understanding the services offered is so confusing because for one symptom or one health condition different doctors take a different approach so since it not universal we get confused. So I always go on trustable sites and view the health condition in detail.  I also consult my family doctors whom I can trust to ankle appropriate health decisions.
0.700000	I have basic knowledge of health issues, but I have difficulty understanding complex concepts and advanced language about health issues
0.883300	Fortutely, I have very few to no health issues. However, I'm very web knowledgeable, and also have friends / relations in the health industry. I have no reservations about finding any needed material.
0.766700	I think I'm perfectly capable of understanding anything a doctor tells me, but sometimes I need to have them clarify the information for me.
0.883300	I think, that I have the capacity to get all the health information I need to make the right decision. I am capable of getting all the info and to understand what is needed in my case.
0.855600	I feel like I am about as well equipped to handle medical information as anyone who is educated but not in the field of medicine. I am a college graduate so I understand complex things. I think I can pay attention, and of course it's important so I value knowing things about my medical condition.
0.716700	I feel I have a decent capacity to make health decisions. If I need help or advice, I can ask friends or family. I can also look up information on the internet, search through forums, and research what others have done when in similar situations.
0.783300	I am confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information when making health decisions. The doctors I see are very helpful and competent in explaining things when I do have questions.
0.788900	I feel almost always I can understand the core concept. Usually, when I'm reading on my conditions and come across a word or phrase I don't fully grasp, I break it down to the basic components piece by piece until I understand it. From doing this awhile ago, It has become easier to pick up on things about my health.
0.916700	I feel I am able to understand basic health information very well. While I may not know all of the medical terminology I understand what is right and wrong
0.916700	If I don't understand something, I will seek out an answer, preferably from the doctor directly if involving medical situations. I may seek out a second opinion, do independent research, and talk to others. 
0.838900	I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make an appropriate decisions because the information I receive from my physician/nurse, I usually take that information and do my research. I not only research information that is pertaining to my condition in the US, but in other countries.
0.916700	I always prepare ahead of time before seeing my PCP. I take my notes with me and she always asks me, at the end of our time together, if I have asked all the questions I want to ask. I feel secure in my ability to understand my doctors instructions, her answers to my questions, and I feel secure in making health decisions for myself. However, If I have any doubts, and certainly before I make any major decisions such as possible surgery, I always consult my oldest daughter, and if necessary, my other children as well. 
0.655600	My doctor is very good about answering all of my questions in the most simple way possible and is very patient about me asking a ton of questions, so I very rarely feel like I don't know exactly what's going on. 
0.850000	I feel I have a good understanding of medical terminology, and when in doubt I always ask my medical practitioner, or do some online research. 
0.655600	i just need  Basic or simple consent entails letting the me know what i would like to do; giving basic information about the procedure; and ensuring that i patient assents or consents to the intervention.
0.594400	I think as long as the information is simple I can understand it. I hate when doctors give you the medical term that I cannot pronounce or spell. I try to ask as many questions as possible.
0.883300	Basic health information is easy. Some of it is common sense. The technical stuff I can get from the internet. The doctor's recommendation is just opinion until I can get it verified. 
0.572200	I think i have a fairly good capacity to retain information. Hearing it from a Doctor, Nurse or even my wife is my best way to get the information. While reading it i often get distracted and lose focus. Same goes for writing and filling out forms. 
0.916700	I feel I am excellent at obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. If I have a question after I leave the office I know who to call for answers. I always ask questions of the nurse or doctor while in the office if I feel I do not understand what is part of the treatment or medication. I read medication leaflets and call the doctor with questions.
0.777800	I choose a doctor after going through online reviews. I make sure that the doctor is an expert in the corresponding field of medicine and has many years of experience. When the doctor prescribes a medicine, I make sure to understand the purpose of the medicine. Also, I go through the leaflet that arrives with each medicine to understand the side-effects of the medicine. I also ask the doctor whether I can heal without the medicine or whether it is mandatory that I take medicine to recover from an illness. If I feel that the doctor is being dishonest, I don't bother to buy the medicines prescribed.
0.827800	I think I have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. My medical practitioner often explain any health reviews or concerns to me in a simpler form. Anything I truly don't understand, I would ask for an explation right away. Sometimes there's medical information that I don't mentally process until later, which leaves me with many unswered questions. When that happens, I can utilize the internet, speak to my mother or best friend (they're both nurses), or call the clinic the following day to gain more information. I have many options to help me feel secure.
0.822200	I don't go to a doctor very often so I am unfamiliar with their processes. I have a pretty good grip of English so I understand most of what they are saying and usually figure out the rest.
0.883300	100%. I'm completely comfortable in these areas. 
0.822200	I feel very confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I sometimes have issues remembering to ask something, or asking something that I worry will not be understood as I do not have knowledge of medical terminology.
0.883300	I feel like I can  understand basic health information to a very good degree, once in a while I may come across a detail, I need  better clarification 
0.900000	I have the capacity to obtain & understand the information unless there are some medical jargons or procedures that need further explation from them.
0.766700	I feel somewhat confident.  Some doctors have accents or use medical jargon, which makes it difficult to understand what they're saying.  Sometimes I have to ask a nurse to explain things thoroughly.
0.777800	these days I feel that I am more educated about health information, as I am seeking the information before and after I visit a doctor to get a better understanding of my case and to integrate the information I get from the doctor with what I can do to help myself as well.
0.766700	I am a graduate student, so I think I have a fairly high level of comprehension and am able to quickly research answers whenever I am unsure of something. However, as I come from a family with a lot of medical professiols, I often second guess things way too much and have difficulty actually making decisions without consulting others.
0.766700	I am quite literate. I ask physicians questions, instead of being nervous in a medical office and thinking I'll ask someone later. I ask questions about how behaviors could possibly lead to conditions. My mother has worked in the medical field so she helps me. I look up terms online.
0.872200	I am old enough that there aren't many surprises when it comes to my health or in-care services. I routinely do a lot of research when something new comes up.  I have a lot of experience in forgetting to ask the right questions until after the fact.
0.600000	I understand the basic medical conditions and the basic forms provided for medical purpose but when not explained clearly make it difficult for me to understand. I need to discuss then with someone who clearly has the knowledge of it to make me feel better about what was expressed. 
0.866700	I feel I have a full understanding and capacity to process and understand basic health information and I also can make appropriate health decisions. I have been in many medical situations where I had to fill out paperwork or even having to deal with doctors and ask questions and have then explained things to me .I believe I have perfect understanding to these situations due to associating with it very closely 
0.916700	I have no doubts in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed.  I make all of the decisions regarding my health.
0.866700	im young and i have the patience and the knowledge to be able to deal with anything medical related 
0.888900	I have a family doctor whom we go to for any health issues and medical checkup. I will consult her if I need help in understanding the information. If the information is not too complicated, I will google and read more about it to get further information.
0.750000	my father big brother and uncle are pharmacist so i have the environment to understand basic health information at home. i usually ask question to them so i think i have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions.
0.661100	I feel I'm well versed and educated enough to ask the questions necessary to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  The issue that comes up most often is an unwillingness to ask the necessary questions; or at times it is difficult to recall all the details of my own medical history given that I do not hold all of the relevant records and information.  My medical history is either held by my doctors or in some instances by my mother. 
0.883300	I think that for the most part i understand what the doctor tells me concerning information about my health, sometimes if something is written down it could be hard to understand because of the hand writing and then i would ask  to explain to me what is written.  
0.900000	I have access to  most if not all the information I need .. my health care  providers have always answered my questions.
0.805600	I think I am highly capable of making appropriate health decisions.  Even when doctors are not clear always clear to me, I am able to ask for more information when I feel that it is important that I fully understand what I'm told.  Doctors often spew a lot of medical terminology that not everyone can understand so I often do my own research after and later ask for more emphasis or for advice from friends who are also in the medical profession.   Once I fully process what I need, I then make the changes needed to feel better and healthier.
0.900000	I feel I understand it quite well. If I have a question I don't hesitate to ask someone. Some of it can be confusing at times, always ask if uncertain. So far in me life I have had no problems understanding and processing health information.
0.900000	I believe I have a good degree of competency to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services as to making quality decisions. Having had some prior medical conditions, I am somewhat experienced to the scerios described in the prior questions. Overall, I am pretty confident dealing with various sources of health information and services but will certainly ask or research myself for better clarity/understanding if something is unclear or I need information about how something should be properly done. 
0.588900	I can do my best.  I know english obviously however there are ideas and concepts I may be missing out on.  An experts time and input is appreciated.
0.794400	There is an Internet to search for the information (i.e. medical terms, conditions, symptoms, ... etc..) and knowledge to read and learn. My physician will explain my illness and the treatments options when the tests results came out. Of course, I may ask any questions to my doctor. There are plenty of doctors to let you have the second opinion. I believe that most of people can make appropriate health decisions as long as you have a clear mind and know how to read and write because everyone concerns about their health conditions very much unless they give up.  
0.644400	I have limited capacity to obtain health information because it depends on others. I can process and understands basic health information especially if provided in layman's terms.
0.866700	I feel I have a pretty good capacity because I know how to look up what I don't know and ask what I don't know and in college I took many biology related classes that helps me digest some medical terms.
0.800000	I am really good at understanding information but I am not good at asking appropriate questions because I feel like I do not get good answers.
0.844400	I'm fairly confident that I have the capacity to understand basic health information. Sometimes I get anxiety when trying to talk to health professiols so I may not ask everything I want to or clearly explain things.
0.916700	I feel that I have a high capacity to understand my basic health information.  Unfortutely, I have had a chronic illness for many years so I have learned a lot about basic health information.
0.672200	I believe that i have access to any type of resource that i need in order to obtain information to make medical decisions. There are a lot of ways  can go about this such as asking a loved one, asking a pharmacist, asking the doctor, or calling in to the doctors office and speaking to a nurse. 
0.900000	I like to read about medical issues so I am used to the medical terms. I don't need any help.
0.583300	I believe that i have enough understanding of health information to make a judgement or decision concerning my health. If i do mot understand something i will either look it up, or ask questions about it
0.844400	With the internet, I have so much access to information that I feel like I could always find a source that made sense to me.  If one trusted website is a little over my head, I'm sure I could find another that made more sense to me.
0.855600	if i dont understand something i usually just pull it up on my phone. i dont try to look for anything other than what it means, i then if i dont know exactly i ask the doctor or look for more indepth info
0.705600	I ask anything I do not understand. My doctors and nurses are informative and helpful.
0.916700	I believe I have a high degree of ability in regard to basic health information. I understand quickly, feel comfortable asking for clarification and am able to research on my own if need be.
0.788900	I think I can do it just fine. I am a native English speaker and I also currently work for a company that provides health services anyway.
0.577800	I think I can process the information fairly well, I'm not a doctor but I do like to know the medication I'm receiving and I will do research about it online.
0.850000	I always fill out my own information. I do a lot of research on conditions I have so that I am educated. I have PTSD and fibromyalgia. I fill out a lot of forms. I also am a Therapeutic Support Staff so I do a lot of paperwork involving data collection and personal information so I have to know what I am doing.
0.833300	I believe that I have a great deal of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as I have learned a lot from my wife(she is a nurse), I always ask questions from the health provider if I don't understand something. I also have the internet to find out the meaning of something.
0.900000	I am perfectly capable of researching my own health conditions and being fully prepared to deal with them with a doctors help. I have questioned my doctors diagnoses before based on my own research. And it turns out I was correct. 
0.883300	I am able to understand my condition because if I have any questions, I will ask them. I will look to a doctor's treatment plan as a recommendation but not as the only option. Once diagnosed with something, I will research the condition on my own and see all of the alternatives. I will search for cases very similar to my own and look for information about how others treated this condition most successfully. I will not just follow what a doctor says without researching for myself. 
0.916700	I have the capacity to listen carefully and to try my best to interpret what the information means to me personally. If I do not understand I will ask to have it explained in more detail. I also am in touch with reality and what is or is not possible as far as medical treatment. In other words I tend to keep unrealistic expectations in check.
0.883300	I feel that I can read basic health information just as long as it doesn't involve very technical terms that a normal person wouldn't understand.
0.650000	I am a person that tends to read a lot about health issues. Not only do I talk to octors but I also o my own research that way I can understand at least the basics when it comes to meical terms. That way I can make better decisions.
0.916700	I am an intelligent and discerning person capable of understanding medical explanations, I have a mature understanding of biology, physiology, and medicines, and am highly confident that I can learn and utilize my skills to obtain any pertinent knowledge that I should have regarding my own health and diseases.
0.827800	I think I have the basics pretty much down. I can understand most concepts, I am able to fill out forms without anyone else and I make sure to clarify with the doctor when I need to. I am confident in my ability to make appropriate health decisions
0.872200	Overall I feel pretty confident. However, sometimes I don't think of the best questions to ask the healthcare professional while I am meeting with them. Sometimes I dont' think of the best questions until after I have already left.
0.883300	I'm experienced enough that I've accumulated significant knowledge already. I can always access my health providers website or ask my doctor if I have questions. There are also thousands of websites providing an abundance of information. I have watched many hours of medical television and have become familiar with medical terminology.
0.916700	I think I'm capable of understanding what my doctor says, reading provided information, and asking followup questions as needed. I'm also capable of doing internet research and asking my doctor questions about the relevance of what I found. Overall I feel I'm able to make appropriate health decisions.
0.866700	I think I can do this very well. I have done it in the past to great success. I think if I had any trouble grasping it, I could get clarification from a professional or online myself. It wouldn't be too hard to get obtain, process, and understand basic health info. 
0.916700	I feel i can relate symptoms to known conditions and input my own variables into the equation to make sure everything is correct. I also sometimes rely on stories from people with similar conditions and things that didn't/did work for them.
0.916700	I think I have a pretty good capacity to do so. I can easily read and understand most medical literature and I know what information to seek out and what questions to ask. I also feel confident about my ability to conduct independent research online or anywhere else.
0.850000	I am willing to do whatever research is necessary to make sure I fully understand the situation. I fell that when I make a decision it is based on the best information available. 
0.855600	I don't really have issues with this. I have relatives who work in the healthcare field so if I do have questions, I just ask them. I am confident filling out forms and almost never have to ask for help.
0.872200	I feel very capable of locating any health-related information I desire. I have been using the internet since the mid-1980s (yes, it did exist at that time but was mostly available only to certain companies, government agencies and universities) so I have a lot of experience with it. I am also VERY willing to rely on my own research to question my doctor's advice or even disregard it in favor of something that I think makes more sense.
0.627800	I think I have just about average ability. Sometimes the information is overwhelming. Sometimes when I ask logical questions about things that do not make sense, the answer I get it medical science does not work logically. I question and read about what my health interests are but in the end chose to listen to the doctor even though I may not agree as they are the experts.
0.844400	I think I have access through friends, the internet, and acquaintances in the medical field, to get help understanding most situations I might encounter. I think that while some of this information might not be totally accurate it may give me some more context when seeking medical information.
0.827800	I feel I have quite a capacity. Ultimately, no matter how professionally trained a doctor is, your health is your own responsibility and no one will care about it as much as you. Given this motivation, it isn't hard to believe that I would do the requisite research. 
0.916700	I feel extremely capable of understanding basic health information because I have done a lot of research throughout my life about various health issues so most of the information is not foreign to me. They are things that I already have a small amount of knowledge on.
0.811100	I think that I have a good ability to do this. Both me and my wife are very good at doing research online. We are also very open and up front about asking questions and being very thorough. By using all of these traits and skill I feel that I am very equiped to get all the info I need to make health decisions.
0.916700	I know and am confident I can understand everything health related; if there is something I do not understand, I have no problem asking a health professional to explain it to me
0.916700	I think I have the intelligence to handle any medical terms. I'm also good at researching, so anything I don't understand I will look up. I don't hesitate to ask questions. I will also get a second opinion on whatever my GP tells me from a close friend who is a doctor in another state. I will also question him about anything I'm not clear about.
0.833300	I can understand health information. I research anything I want to know on my own and I find that most doctors are just crap shooting and don't really know or care to help. I make decisions on my own based on what I feel is right for me. 
0.916700	I feel like I am fully capable of making appropriate health decisions. 
0.677800	I have a good understanding on basic health information and feel that I can make decisions to make appropriate health decisions. I normally have a good understanding of doctors and nurses and can get what they are saying.
0.883300	I have a good understanding of my health conditions and will research anything I need additional information on.
0.883300	I have lots of resources to understand the health information I need. I simply ask my medical providers questions and they tend to answer them in depth. I tend to do research on the internet before a doctor's visit and I write down my question in advance. I also signed up to have access to my medical records/lab results online. I have researched my lab results (numbers) to get a better understanding of my health.
0.738900	I have the internet. It can help me understand anything. 
0.827800	I feel that I have the capability and if I am struggling, my mother has a health background to provide additional needed information.
0.761100	based on prior research i think i can properly understand the basics.  i feel that my doctors and my own research helps me with this endeavor
0.827800	I feel like I have a high degree of capability to obtain and understand health information. There are an array of different resources available, in addition to being able to speak with my doctor or get a second opinion. 
0.794400	I consider myself a pretty intelligent person. I always make sure that if I do not understand something I ask for clarification. Your health is the most important thing in your life because without it you are miserable. 
0.883300	I think I have enough of a knowledge base to make informed opinions about my condition after doing some research and consulting with my doctor. If I have questions when my doctor is explaining something I make sure to ask them. I usually do my own research and ask the doctor what they think about my conclusions. 
0.655600	I feel like I have an above average capacity to understand basic health information but I need help occasionally with prescriptions. Lymphoma is more complicated than a google search, so I have to ask my doctor how to deal with it.
0.822200	I started to get my own medical records because I wasn't getting all of the information that they were writing about me. So it helped me understand what they were thinking of me, and what I needed to do to get them to understand. I do have to google a lot of the wording on copies of MRIs because no one really tells me what came up on the scans.
0.844400	I studied Medical Office Technology in college which included classes in medical terminology. I had to learn a lot about different medical procedures and afflictions. I've always read about my level, and I read rather fast. I know I can understand what I read. If I can't, I know how to get online and look up what I need. I also know a few medical personnel I can call and ask to explain something to me.
0.733300	I think I can process basic health information for basic health decisions. But more complicated stuff probably not, I'd just have to trust whatever the doctor said. 
0.638900	I feel that I have a medium capacity to obtain, understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel comfortable with my basic medical knowledge and problem solving skills to make the correct health decisions on my own.
0.644400	I have had a grandfather who had a lot of health issues and helped him with his forms and dealing with the doctor. I also have a couple of health related issues that I have had to deal with so I understand most of what I learn.
0.916700	I feel completely confident.  I'm reasonably smart and understand some of how the world works.
0.777800	I think I am pretty capable of understanding basic health information. There are many resources online that can help clear up and misconceptions with medical terminology.
0.900000	I can look up symptoms online and hazard a guess but I understand that I can't do much more than guess. Information given to me by doctors and nurses I tend to trust but if I'm still not certain I will look up further information for myself online. I wouldn't have access to any specialized machines to try to diagnose myself so for that at least I'm completely reliant on health professionals. Things like blood tests, urine flow test, cultures etc.
0.900000	I think I am able to obtain a good deal of information on my own.  Searching the internet can be scary when it comes to health topics, but I do feel it is useful in getting broad ideas.  I also am not afraid to ask questions of health professionals.  I do know that not being able/willing to ask questions has been an issue for others in my family.
0.711100	I think that I have what it takes to understand the information given to me by my doctor. But there are still times when it is a bit cloudy in trying to understand all the variables. When I don't completely understand the information, I either go to an online forum or ask a friend. 
0.916700	When I became an adult I never needed help filling out forms. My mom always helped me when I was younger understand what information on the forms meant if I had a question. 
0.811100	I think I have a pretty good capacity to do this. I'm competent and can research things I'm not familiar with. 
0.844400	I understand most and if I don't, I will google it and look up information to be sure I get all in the information i need and want and make sure I understand it all.  I will always research any kind of medical issue I may have and will question my dr. if my research and their opinions differ.  I want to be sure I get the best medical care I can with all the information I can gather about medical/health issues.
0.888900	I feel that I am informed enough, and I feel in tune with how I feel with my body. I am always asking questions If I feel I don't understand something, or want to know more about a respective issue. I feel certain I can care for myself.
0.916700	I'm fully competent in deciding what is best for me pertaining to my health 
0.888900	I think I'm educated and knowledgeable enough to understand the health information given to me generally. I'm health conscious, exercise and take supplements which I look into. I think my knowledge through experience and that I've picked up through life is sufficient.
0.572200	I have everything ready available for me online. I do also have  my doctor on had close to me to help me understand information.
0.900000	I have good ability
0.872200	I am mentally capable. I research more than the average person on medical care and medications.
0.916700	as a nurse, i feel i have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself and my family.
0.783300	I think I can obtain the most extensive information from my personal doctor. I fully trust him because he has been my doctor for my entire life. 
0.872200	I think I can make appropriate health decisions because I'm always willing to ask questions and if I don't personally agree with a treatment option, I challenge it or get a second opinion. It's my health, and I have the right to ensure I'm getting the best possible care. 
0.361100	iTHINK BASED ON THOSE QUESTIONS that I can make a good decision regarding my health. Bring it on!!
0.566700	I would consider so important information and some people advice 
0.844400	I have no problem understand what my doctor tells me. But he like pills, and i don't so we disagree but I still take what he tells me to
0.900000	I have no problem understanding complex information.
0.900000	i feel confident about it. mostly because i also research my symptoms before going to the doctor, so i have a general understanding of what it might be.
0.900000	The internet is my main source of health information and tracking as I do not really have reliable health care. I feel I'm fairly lucky with my health, all things considered
0.916700	I feel that I have the knowledge base and critical thinking skills to make heath based decision, in part because I am a part of the profession
0.844400	Health topics are something I research all the time on the internet. If it is something that directly affects me, I have a tendency to do a lot of research on the internet about the subject. I will consider alternative medical treatments along with what the medical establishment recommends.
0.616700	I think I have a better ability than most to learn about my illnesses. I have been chronically ill with several rare diseases for years now and I tend to have to look up medical studies on my own time to get more knowledge about how to help myself heal. 
0.755600	I am very capable of understanding. I like to ask questions and know what is going on. I don't go to the doctor often, but when I do I find out everything that I possibly can. I like to ask about medications and if I should take them all the time or not. I like to go for physicals and have my blood drawn and tested. I like knowing the results of my blood work and if something is wrong I ask questions.
0.844400	I eel that I am very well capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information. Perhaps it's a mix of my intelligence and the knowledge I already have mixed with having good luck in the information being explained to me in an easy way. 
0.633300	While I am reasonably confident in my abilities to understand, there are times when doctors and health care professionals speak with too much complicated jargon. It is helpful to have someone with me to ask the questions that I don't even know I should be asking.
0.650000	I can make basic decisions on my own. However, it is good to get reassurance from the nurse and doctors. Basically being able to use common sense is how I would approach it. 
0.916700	I feel that all of the forms that you have to fill out are pretty self-descriptive. I've never had any kind of problems understanding anything - they almost over explain things on the forms so you know exactly what you are getting into or what you are diagnosed with.
0.794400	I think I'm okay at it. I am sometimes quite distracted because children come with me to several appointments and my main focus is usually on them. Beyond that, I'm confident enough to ask questions to make sure I understand things. 
0.833300	I believe I have perfect capacity to obtain basic health information and services that I need to make decisions.  I am a literate person that is not shy about asking questions.
0.916700	I know that I can ask questions of my health care provider and that they will answer me. If I am unsure if something I will ask them to clRify. I also know the terminology in medical papers enough to understand what I am agreeing to. I am in control but I must ask the questions.
0.550000	My parents raised me to understand things that I read. I am very educated and I can learn to do things on my own without other peoples help.
0.866700	I feel like I have all the tools for my basic health information. I can call to obtain, and I can also go online and access a lot of my medical information. I think it's so easy to access this information.
0.572200	I feel I am still young and healthy, and my health problems are not yet complicated or severe that would be hard to understand. I am also very smart even though im not overly familiar with medical topics so that helps 
0.811100	"I would give myself a ""B+"".  I understand just about everything, but when they start using very medicals terms / lingo I may start to not understand as well.  Sometimes I do not like to ask because I think it may make me look stupid, but I should not care because it is my health we are discussing."
0.466700	I feel like with the terms and complicated medical lingo, I am not exactly sure what some of the meanings entail. Such as If I am diagnosed with a certain condition and need medication X, I don't know what that medication does, what the alternatives are, I don't even know how to pronounce some of these names. I feel like I am able to ask the doctors but can not fully grasp the magnitude of the situation without looking at the whole picture which is difficult to have someone explain to me in one visit. I feel like I need  a step by step diagnostic, of why this happened, what I can do, what the consequences are, what some definitions of the disease are, etc. 
0.788900	I have worked on the administration side of healthcare for about 10 years. I work with medical terminology on a daily basis so I feel quite comfortable and have people to ask. 
0.916700	"I've been with my doctor for about 10 years and I trust him completely. I feel very open and honest with him. I tell him everything and do not fear judgment when I ask a ""stupid"" question."
0.861100	I've never felt like it's been a problem. I haven't had a lot of issues filling out paperwork for various things, but I haven't needed to all that often (knock on wood). When I did, it was pretty straightforward. I'd leave things blank if I had to.
0.883300	The doctor I visit is clear in anything he tells me. Any questions about medications or symptoms are answered in a way that I can understand.  I have not run in to a situation where left the office being confused about something.
0.605600	I believe that I have the capabilities to make health decisions for many reasons. First off, the internet is so big today and full of information that anybody can go there to get valuable information on any topic.
0.811100	I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. If I don't understand something, I ask for help. I also research online to figure out any questions I have.
0.488900	I feel very unconfident. It's an unfamiliar environment and unfamiliar forms to me. Often I'm nervous anyways about being sick and my health declining so I do not think of questions I should ask at that time. I would want a friend or family member to accompany me or have assistance from personnel in filling out forms and documents before seeing the doctor. Often I'm in a rush to get in and get out so I don't take time to ask questions
0.850000	I feel I have a pretty good grasp on understanding the various aspects of healthcare. I make sure to read materials thoroughly and, like with contracts, I always make sure to read fine print and ask questions about things I do not understand. The internet allows me to do basic research on things I might need to ask or clarify. I trust my doctors to provide me with the proper information and I trust them to explain things to me in terms that I can understand.
0.733300	I think I can easily fill out the health forms but it's difficult finding a doctor that is covered by insurance and affordable to get the answers needed, so I always feel like I am doing the bare minimum to maintain rather than actually getting help.
0.866700	I feel like a have a high degree ob ability to obtain and understand the necessary information. Occasionally my memory and reading comprehension will be much lower than average, and I require some help to get through things.
0.833300	With the internet these days it's usually not too hard to figure something out if the front desk is too busy. I had testicular cancer a few years back and practically lived at the Urologists. I figured out what most of their doctor words meant pretty quickly. 
0.850000	I feel very comfortable when dealing with my own medical concerns and obtaining the correct information. I have studied Exercise Science in college and spent a lot of my time during college going to the doctors on my own so I learned quickly what was expected of me and of the doctors to make sure I understood everything and took care of my health properly.
0.705600	i think that i do. i graduated college and i have known english all my life. i have taken many english courses
0.827800	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information. There are times when doctors may use terms, medications, procedures, etc. that I don't understand, but I always ask them to please explain. 
0.850000	I think I am able to get all of the information that I need, although sometimes I can not think of what to ask until after the fact. Also at times, I may not completely understand what the doctor or nurse is saying, but I trust their diagnosis and directions for the most part. 
0.816700	Throughout my life I have had to deal with medical professionals due to two auto-immune disorders that I have had since childhood. Therefore, I feel as if I am able to understand medical documents and explanations better than some . 
0.888900	I've been in and out of hospitals my entire life, having numerous medical conditions since I was young. I've been filling out and reading medical forms ever since I was able to do so (around 16 or 17, I believe) If I ever don't understand something, I simply ask until I do.
0.722200	When it comes to just myself I am confident that I can make the right decisions. Sometimes I may forget my insurance plan numbers or something else but I can definitely ask questions without issue. So even if I am unsure or confused I have no problem making sure I understand before I leave. 
0.883300	I feel I have all the options and services I need to make appropriate health decisions.  I often ignore going to the doctor because they don't value my time and make we wait too long in the waiting room
0.900000	I feel that I am above average at processing health information.  I know what to ask when I am unsure about something.  I have a degree in nursing, so I understand almost everything that I encounter related to my health.
0.716700	I think with technology the way it is now, I have much better access to information that can help me understand what i need to make decisions.
0.850000	I feel I have the capacity to do all of that to a high degree. I do not think that it is very complicated at all. I have confidence in my ability to handle all of the above with little to no trouble. I think I would be able to handle it at any given time.
0.738900	I feel I know enough to assess my health. I do a lot of research, and I seek info on things I don't understand. Any sudden changes to my help usually prompts a call to my doctor. I have a great doctor; she explains everything in great detail for me. Usually it's no big deal, but she appreciates the concern I have for my health.
0.672200	I feel that If I am unable to figure something out than either my wife or possibly a close friend who is a registered nurse is always there if I have questions or flat out just don't understand what I am looking at
0.777800	"I think that I do have the capacity to process and understand basic health information.  Sometimes it gets very confusing and I'm not sure what questions I should ask in order to be fully informed.  I often find that the doctor is telling me information and I am just nodding and saying ""ok"" because I am not sure what other information I might need to know in order to make the proper decisions."
0.888900	I am able to understand most health information and am confident that I can research and learn things that I do not already know when it comes to health information. It is all well within my ability to know.
0.527800	In order to get the good health it would be very good and nice of it.It would be very good getting a good health is very important one it would be very important in life fo it
0.772200	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand health information to a significant degree. This confidence comes from the availability of almost anything I need to understand health conditions via the Internet. I can read about health information through my insurer, my care provider, and third-party sites. 
0.883300	I feel like I am adequately prepared to understand and assess all of the information that I am presented with. I am not afraid to ask questions or to let people know that I don't understand what I am being presented with.

I also feel that most health professionals in our area are competent and have the patient's best interest in mind.
0.655600	I think I have a pretty good idea about it, but with the issue of insurance, it makes the whole process a lot more harrowing.

0.850000	Although I don't know much about the medical profession, I am typically able to grasp articulate explanations regarding the medical aspects pertinent to my well-being. If I don't understand something, I either ask for clarification or research it myself. I'm pretty bright most of the time.

I am eager to learn and the health and medical fields have always interested me.
0.827800	I believe that I have the mental and physical capacity to obtain, process, and understand the information and services for health decisions. However, emotionally, I often feel that I don't have the capacity, as I am often stressed when visiting a doctor's office and either forget questions or feel ashamed to ask them.

0.866700	I believe that I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  I try to stay fairly well-informed, especially when the information pertains to my own health or the health of someone in my family.

I try to take the time to think of all symptoms, instances and relevant information.
0.794400	I feel like for the most part I can read and figure something out.

0.827800	I am confident that I can understand written information. However, my people skills are below average, and I often don't ask the questions that are in my head because I don't have much confidence in how they will be received. When I do ask questions, I understand the answers, but I often go reading for follow-up information because it is easier to me. 
0.583300	I feel fairly unconfident in understanding medial lingo. A lot of the terminology is really hard to take in. Especially if I'm already worried about the procedure or the test results. 
0.594400	I feel I have an understanding of how to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. The issue I face is extracting that information from the healthcare professionals. I am very often left to google information on my own.
0.650000	I think I would have a basic understanding on what procedure or task I would need to do obtain the information required.

0.750000	I think that I have the knowledge to understand and make the correct health decisions. I am confident in the choices that I will choose to choose.
0.916700	First of all, I don't get sick that much.  I usually only have bronchitis and seasonal allergy so my condition is pretty simple. If at any given time I don't understand I will try to ask question or research it afterwards. For myself personally, I don't have any issue.  On the other hand I have to care of my love one and sometimes I could come into terms that I do not understand then I will request the health care provider to give me a simpler explanation.
0.844400	I generally understand what is said to me. If I need extra help afterwards I search on the internet to find information.

0.738900	For the most part, I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I prefer to have my husband with me at all times to help fill out paperwork and digest information. This is just because it is better to have two sets of ears hearing what is going on and processing the information. We are then able to talk through the information later to make sure we both understood everything. My husband is also a lot better at thinking of questions to ask in the moment, whereas I need to process information before I can think of questions.
0.677800	I believe that in general, I am capable of comprehending basic health decisions. I agree that I may need some assistance in understanding the technical mumbo jumbo. If I do I more often than not am capable to understand what is being stated to me afterward.
0.822200	After eleven years of life with type one diabetes and various other endocrine fuckery, yes, I feel I have the capacity to look information up, verify it by checking the references, and ask my pharmacist and doctor for help. I've had a lot of practice. Unfortunately at this point most of my questions are beyond my doctor and I dislike the endocrinologist available to me, so I depend on my own research skills and online communities of people with my conditions to do further research -- but that's a point beyond 'basic health information'.
0.883300	I am a reasonably intelligent person, so I feel equal to the task of understanding health information provided to me by my care providers. I also make sure to get clarification of anything I donât understand. I ask lots of questions, and listen intently to what my care providers are telling me. I said that I often give my care providers all the information they need to assess my health, but I do some times hold back information that I find embarrassing. This is not often the case, but I do so on occasion. Also, I am perfectly capable of interpreting the literature provided to me by pharmacists, nurses and doctors, and very rarely have to have someone help me read and interpret. 
0.833300	I feel like i understand the health information pretty good. I have kaiser so i can get help very easy they are just a phone call away if i have a question i can email my doctor very easy and have an answer pretty much the same day.
0.844400	I feel pretty confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have been living with an auto-immune disease for almost 14 years and needed to do a lot of research on my own because the doctor who I was seeing when I was first diagnosed did not tell me anything about the disease. After I did some research on my own, six months after being diagnosed, I found a doctor who explained everything to me and knew how to treat my disease. 
0.916700	I feel 99 percent confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information given to me to make the right health decisions for myself. I feel comfortable communicating with my doctors and always ask them to clarify anything I'm unsure of. They're always reachable by phone. And anything I want to know more about is always online and I definitely do my due diligence in researching health related issues to give myself as much information as I can find to grasp what's going on. 
0.866700	Sure I understand, usually basic information and I usually research something in the library or online before I even talk to a health care professional about it.
0.838900	I can completely understand and process any basic health information that I am given. My only issue is that sometimes doctors do not plainly discuss information and seem to be guessing, or at least being noncommittal to their answers to my questions. Doctors also do not seem to like to admit that they do not know something to be certain, in my experiences. 
0.811100	I feel like I understand most of what doctors or nurses tell me. I feel there is enough time for to me have them clarify anything I don't understand, or I can go online afterwards to find out more details myself.
0.533300	I think I have enough information processing ability, but sometimes health information can be pretty complicated so I am not confident enough in my ability to understand complicated information. I think I will need things put into simpler terms so that I may not only understand them better, but also commit them to memory and actually learn about the information. I also have trouble making decisions for myself so I need help filling out forms and deciding how to proceed with medical decisions.
0.872200	I have a strong educational background, am motivated to understand my health needs, and enjoy speaking to experts. If I need additional information, I'll research it.
0.855600	My doctors are always to me by phone throughout the week and they do not mind answering any questions or concerns that I have. I also have a local pharmacy with knowledgeable pharmacists who are willing to answer questions and concerns about my medications. 
0.744400	I feel that I have an above average ability to understand all of the information that is needed to make health decisions. I have an interest in health topics and do quite a bit of reading. However, it can be difficult to trust my own decision because I am not an expert in the field.
0.900000	I believe that I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I am an educated professional that works in social services so I understand the best ways to advocate for myself and ask questions in order to get the most complete information.  I am also very direct and have no issue asking questions if I need to in order to better understand something.  I like to do my own research as well.
0.916700	I am a Registered Nurse. So I am more than familiar with most things I would run into. I would not have any problems understanding
0.838900	I feel very capable of understanding health information.  I struggle sometimes when I feel rushed asking all the questions I need to get all the information I need.  Often I think of questions  after I have left a doctor's office that I forgot to ask.  I try to make lists when I know I have an upcoming appointment.
0.833300	I was involved in my mothers healthcare. Dealt with doctors and nurses and hospice. I had power of attorney over her healthcare. The american Cancer Society was very helpful. Still have lots of information, pamphlets and newsletters.
0.566700	I feel that i have most of the information that i need. I am usually pretty confident when filling out forms or making recommendations to my doctor. I feel that we work well together to keep me healthy.
0.916700	I feel 100% confident I can get the information and services I need since I grew up always fending for myself and when I didn't know something I'd goto the library and figure out myself or look it up online. I have no problem asking for help or more information if I can't figure it out for myself.
0.622200	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to a good degree. The basic amount I would assume is average.
0.866700	I know I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand the information and services that my doctor is providing me because I have experience at work to know the things that doctor explaining to me. Sometimes I google it and make sure that I fully understand all the terminologies that was provided to me
0.844400	I feel like I am comfortable enough with my primary care physician at this point to basically say anything or ask any questions.

0.916700	I'm extremely confident. I've got a background in both clinical psychology and i'm a certified professional educator in the state of Florida with certifications in teaching Biology and General Science on the high school level.
0.916700	I feel that I can understand what they tell me without additional help, because I have a pretty good memory. Also, if I wanted to find more information, I would trust the internet more than a single doctor to tell me specifics.
0.866700	I feel I am fully capable of understanding basic health information whether it be something I read or what questions to ask. If I am unsure I will ask or look up online if need be.
0.600000	I can understand some information, but the finer details are hard. I don't know some of the terminology and body processes.
0.527800	I lack confidence when trying to process information related to health and wellness. I find that the words and techniques are in a language that only people in the medical field can understand fully. There is a lot of technical jargon contained in the materials that average people usually cannot understand. I usually have to rely on speaking directly to my doctor or nurse to make sure that I understand what is being said. There are only a few websites that are dedicated to explaining medical terminology and even these can be complicated to understand.
0.883300	I am very confident in my abilities to help myself and to help others. I have no issue standing up to medical professionals and advocating for myself and others. I research things quite a bit on my own. 
0.916700	i have a very high degree to obtain, process, and understand basic health information in order to make health decisions.  Through  my employer, i have a very good health care plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield.  I can see a personal care physician or a specialist if i have any problems.  I can also visit the emergency room should it ever be necessary.  I process the information given to me well as i speak english fluently and tend to pick up on things easily.  I have a master's degree in economics which has helped me process new and somewhat complex information.  I can also use internet websites in order to verify information.
0.811100	I feel mostly competent in the basic health information interactions, but once in a while may ask family for advice/help.
0.644400	I feel slightly capable to do asses the information and services needed to make health decisions because of the access to the internet and access to nurses that can explain difficult medical terms or other bits words that I canât understand, So on my own I canât understand too much because of the medical terms but thanks to the internet and nurses they help me understand 
0.705600	I think I have a basic knowledge of what is required by a layperson to evaluate, and determine if someone needs to seek medical attention.  I have two small children and would take them to the doctor or call if I thought one of them was in need of seeing a doctor.  While I do not have medical training, I can tell when someone is sick.
0.888900	I think I'm pretty competent and well informed about my medical stuff. My doctor is open and honest and I don't feel ashamed asking questions. Sometimes I forget but whatever I don't ask at the appointment I can google when I get home or email my doctor.
0.733300	I feel like I am capable of understanding basic health information, my main issue is when doctors or nurses use medical school grade vocab and I have no idea how to even spell what they said to look it up myself. Or they will push a certain product or treatment (ie the HPV Vaccine) when I do not want it.
0.883300	I think I have a good understanding on how to read and process health information. I always ask questions and sometimes I have to go home and go online to get a better explanation but I get the basic gist of what is told to me.
0.538900	Most of the time I feel like doctors and nurses are too rushed and I don't want to bother them with things that they seem to think I should already know. Many test results are too complicated to understand anyway and I feel like I could just look them up later instead of wasting their time. 
0.811100	I feel I have an above average capacity to obtain, process and comprehend basic health information because my significant other has worked in the medical industry all of her life (her father is a doctor, she is a nurse) so I have been exposed to and actively consulted medical professionals throughout my adult life.
0.700000	I have most of the time the help to get health information from doctors. But I rarely go to hospital and see doctors. It is not appropriate to judge from my experience.
0.811100	I work for a health insurance company so I have a little knowledge on how to complete forms and probably have an above average idea of what information is needed to complete forms.  My major in college before I changed my mind was pre med so that also puts me at an advantage over most people.  I feel that I can either complete most forms and understand basic health information at a reasonable comfort level or I know which questions I need to ask to be able to.  I am not afraid to ask if I do not understand something because this is my health and I am not taking any chances when it comes to my health and my livelihood.
0.605600	I am pretty sure I have the basic knowledge to understand health information. There are times when I need to go to the internet to look things up further but then when I do that, I still have a hard time understanding at times.
0.700000	I can understand the basic information given, but feel like there is a lot that could still use explaining. I usually have to make a list of key phrases that the doctors or nurses say and then google them on my own.
0.772200	I feel that I am able to comprehend most medical information, however I feel my anxiety and fear of judgment at times keep me from asking questions.
0.688900	Generally speaking, I can process what the doctor or nurse give me, after a consultation. If there is something I can't grasp, I ask additional questions.  Most of the times, the health professionals speak in plain English, so there is usually no ambiguity. 
0.716700	I do feel that I am capable to obtain, process and understand basic health information, but not always. There is a good amount of health jargon which I do not understand. I think me asking questions allows me to have a better grasp of this information. With this I am able to make the appropriate health decisions. If I was not the type of person to ask questions, I would most definitely have a more difficult time. 
0.861100	I feel that I am reasonably able to comprehend and obtain the basic information to make appropriate decisions regarding my health.
0.622200	I have had GERD and issues with my stomach for the past 5 years and have seen a number of different stomach doctors who have conducted a lot of different tests and tried a lot of different pills on me. This survey is really hitting home because I think doctors and their staff need to do a better job of using normal terms and explaining things better to non-doctors. I ask a lot of questions but a lot of times think of them after I have left the office and am forced to google the terms and wind up on webmd!
0.861100	I believe that I have all the resources that I would possibly need for healthcare questions and information. I have a solid healthcare team who have helped me every step of the way.
0.483300	I feel like I have the basic understanding but I find it difficult to get things done because of outside forces that I have no control over, it is kind of a pain in the ass to be perfectly honest. 
0.733300	I feel that I have somewhat of a high level to obtain, process, and understand basic information and services needed to make the right health decisions. When I don't understand something, I will usually ask questions but a majority of the time, I am able to process the information given. I feel that if I don't understand then I definitely need to know. That's very important and should not be overlooked. 
0.744400	I understand written material very well, but I sometimes get confused when I am given a lot of information and especially if I  have to cross-reference it with one or more other bits of new information. I don't retain new information relatively well either. Also I have a nurse in my family and have her further explain issues sometimes.
0.688900	Because medicine is a complex area, it is sometimes very difficult to understand exactly what they are saying since it is all comprised of jargon. The doctor or nurse could try and explain it in layman's terms, but sometimes it can be lost in translation. 
0.722200	I feel like there have been times when I have planned ahead what to ask my doctors so I can be informed about my health.   But there have also been times that I feel like I have not asked enough questions and things were not explained thoroughly enough to me.   Luckily I have friends and family I can turn to in order to help me understand. 
0.872200	I studied a lot of science in college so I have some general knowledge of many of the medical terms so it's not so hard for me to process everything.

0.583300	Obtaining information is not difficult.  The process and understanding is difficult sometimes.  This really is evident when it comes to cost.  More often then not, healthcare providers have no idea what a procedure or condition will cost. 
0.750000	I feel I understand everything most of the time. There are times, mostly when I have to make a decision between two treatments or something similar, that I become confused because I cannot decide which is better and I'm not sure that I have all the information necessary
0.777800	I have a high degree of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information. I have worked in the healthcare industry for years. In addition, I have a large network of clinical professionals who I can reach out to. My network includes physicians, nurses, medical staff, and clerical staff. I think after years of working in the healthcare industry and working with patients, diagnoses, services, CPT codes, etc. I have more confident in understanding the materials that are presented to me. I also understand what is being told to me by a medical professional. I sometimes still struggle to ask specific questions. 
0.916700	At this point in my life, I feel that I am capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make decisions appropriate to my health care.

0.872200	I feel that I can express myself in such a manner that health professionals will understand my condition.

0.888900	After going through a serious medical issue within the past 2 years, I feel like I am completely able to comprehend basic health information and make an informed decision.
0.822200	Usually, when I have difficulty understanding certain health information,  I search online for answers.  If I still couldn't make a decision or have difficulty understanding the situation,  I make sure to ask my doctor the next time I visit him.  My doctor is a very nice person and would explain everything in simple terms. 
0.716700	I feel like im very capable to get all the information I need to understand all my health information. Either if its from someone else helping me or asking the doctor questions
0.900000	I completely have the capacity to obtain, process and understand written and oral communication regarding my health. I know how to ask questions and to ask for clarification when needed.

0.777800	I feel like for the most part, I am capable of handling my own information and understanding it in the medial field. But there are times that I have had some pretty confusing paperwork. And I don't know if it's because I'm stupid, young, or sheltered that I have a hard time comprehending some of these things. Usually its just things like medication contradictions, or confusing information about test results.  But I certainly know how to call my own doctor and obtain my own health records, and to get help, etc.
0.855600	In general, I have no trouble reading and understanding health-related information. I am sure the fact that I am a psychologist (PhD) does not hurt. It is also helpful that my wife is a doctoral-level nurse with 46 years of experience. When I need to select a specialist, I rely entirely on here, as she can learn in 5 minutes what would take me much longer. Who would know best about which doctor to select than a nurse with access to other nurses who know.
0.855600	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information if it is given to me in a way that I can understand. Some doctors are not very good at relaying things in layman's terms which can cause some confusion at time. If this happens, I try to remember to ask any pertinent questions that I do not feel were addressed adequately. Overall, I feel that I am very capable of processing health information given to me. It can at time, however, be overwhelming.  
0.844400	I feel I can understand most if not all of the material I receive from doctors and pharmacists. I do find that I sometimes forget to give doctors important information about my condition, and I sometimes forget or don't quite understand the information they tell me and feel like I don't want to waste their time by asking follow up questions. I do feel I have someone to help me or go with me if I am confused.
0.844400	I have college degree, a lot of biology and science classes.  I have access to internet if have some doubt about any topic.  I always ask the doctor if I don't understand some term or procedure.  
0.916700	Ive been to the doctors a lot growing up, so I have a lot of familiarity with terms and some conditions. I know how the process of paperwork and forms works, so I feel comfortable filling them out now.
0.783300	i have no problem making health decisions for myself.  I was diagnosed with choroidal melanoma 2 years ago.  It is still hard to comprehend sometimes the magnitude of future treatments and what is required.  The doctor never discussed long term percentages with me and i am afraid to ask.
0.844400	i feel like i have a good knowledge of the body and i have no problem understanding complex topics, or things that are explained to me. 
0.583300	I feel I slightly have a good capacity to understand basic health information, as well as to obtain and process it. I've had to figure it out on my own and family hasn't been that helpful. When I go to my health insurance page, it doesn't explain things that well, so I have to make a decision on my own again. And when I do go to the doctor, which is rare, they intimidate me and I don't ask questions. I also don't bring up medical things due to worry over extra tests costing money.
0.916700	I feel confident in obtaining and processing basic health information. I try to research as much as possible prior to going into the doctors office.

In addition, I am capable of researching any issues online to learn more about my medical conditions.
0.872200	I think i can understand most of what is said. If not i research online to gather more information. That tends to lead to more question so then I call the doctor to get clarification.
0.738900	I have the full ability to answer, process, and obtain basic health information. I sometimes get confused because the medical jargon can be such that it's difficult to process, especially be pregnant - there are a lot of terms I'm unfamiliar with.
0.866700	Well, I have a background in Healthcare, so I feel quite competent. I realize some of the terminology can be tough even for me, so I can't say I'm 100%, but I'm close.
0.866700	I feel confident about my ability to obtain and understand any medical information that is presented to me. If there is anything that I am unsure of, I would be sure to ask my doctor or nurse. I am usually apprehensive about medications, so I would be sure to ask my doctor every question that I might have about side effects or alternative treatments. If anything seems to complicated about the information, I would use internet resources in order to answer any questions that I might have. I am confident in my ability to locate accurate medical information from sites such as WebMD.
0.638900	I am able to understand all information that is told to me or discussed with me.  I love brochures or printouts that they give me to help me understand further.  Finally, I absolutely prefer to see nurse practitioners and other providers who take the time to explain things to me.
0.827800	I am intelligent enough to understand basic medical terms and do not have any problem asking for things to be repeated or explained again using more basic terminology and vocabulary. I have seen a specialist once who didnât wish to explain things in an understandable way, and actually seemed to enjoy talking over my understanding, I didnât go back to that doctor and found another instead.
0.722200	I think depending on how the doctor explains it I can usually understand it. If they use strictly medical talk I will have issues understanding it but if they put it in a way that myself as not a doctor would understand then it would be easier to comprehend. For the most part I usually have no issues understanding what the doctor is telling me and if I do then I ask questions.
0.616700	I broke my humeru last year and the doctor recommended surgery, but I declined because I don't have insurance.  I basically kept my doctors visits to a minimum to keep medical costs at a minimum.  Because of this I do feel that I missed out on a lot of feedback that would have been helpful.
0.777800	I think i have sufficient enough intuitiveness to understand most relevant health questions posed to be by my medical health professional and pharmacists.
0.900000	I feel as though I am mostly competent concerning medical conditions. However if i'm unsure I have no problem getting verification, and then following up with my own research.
0.777800	I think i do pretty good understanding these things. At times, I do need my husband's help when I do not understand a question or cant remember the answer to it. 
0.727800	i have dementia so sometime i can understand whats being told to me, sometimes im in a daze and have to have my daughter explain things to me. i most of the time understand, it depends on my day
0.883300	I believe I have fared just fine in understanding health information. I generally don't need any help filling out forms. If I do run into an issue then I asked either the doctor or the nurses for clarification. 
0.872200	I feel I have the capacity  to make appropriate decisions. I am of sound mind and judgement. I cam understand information presented to me without difficulty.

0.805600	I feel that I can make the right health decisions because I listen closely to the doctor. If I can't understand what he said I ask him to repeat it. If I don't know what to do about something then I ask questions. I fill out all of my medical forms myself and if there is anything that I can't understand I get a nurse to help me.  
0.900000	I have a background in science and engineering and I've taken courses about health and stuff so I feel very confident about my understanding. Doctors are people who are very considerate and can explain things in ways that I can understand anyway.
0.883300	I feel that I fully have the capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information.  I have been going to the doctors for a condition for over 20 years and have had to do all of my paperwork and question asking.  I have no one else to depend on.  I have to also do my husbands information.
0.916700	I believe I fully have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make health decisions. I am always open to more guidance and learning, but I do not require more assistance than average.
0.738900	In some regards I feel like I can ask my doctors questions.  However, to access second opinions and where to go for my children and what the waiting lists are like are very difficult to understand.  Especially for mental health care and education for children with disabilities and mental giftedness.  I've had a very hard time to get any information out of anyone as to where you can get adequate mental healthcare for an extremely gifted child without compromising their education and future career options.  This is extremely frustrating.  As well, wait times in ER's for children's mental health access is very discouraging as we've waiting 24 hours to get transferred to a mental health facility with a gravely ill child having mental health problems.  Why is there the disconnect? Why isn't mental health acknowledged and it passed off as a non-medical issue and labelled a behavioral issue as well.  Who can explain that to me?
0.827800	I think overall I have a good capacity to get and understand the information I need. I'm not scared to ask questions but I do sometimes worry I might forget to ask something important. I also sometimes wonder if my doctor gives me enough information. 
0.866700	I feel have good capacity to obtain and understand such information.  When there is something that requires further clarification I find it easy to get additional information from a number of different sources.
0.583300	i have a pretty good knowledge base and i am fully able to undersand the basics of health information and services .  So i all in all i feel i am pretty good at this. 
0.616700	Yes, I feel confident that I can obtain information on health services and medical conditions. It is easily accessible on the internet and thru my health insurance provider (via phone or live chat on the provider website).
0.916700	I feel it's relatively easy for me to understand everything in medical documents. Usually the only things that I need clarification on are technical medical terms. If it's all in plain English I can understand it fully.
0.916700	I have no problems understanding health information.  I read and process information at what I would consider to be a normal rate of competence.  I haven't had any problems so far that I know of. 
0.866700	I can comprehend almost all written instructions unless their are way too technical. I can hear very well and can drive to various medical facilities to have tests performed when necessary. I have ongoing back issues and have had numerous test performed and everything has always been explained very clearly. I deal with the VA for health care so one can imagine the red tape and mumbo jumbo that is associated with them.
0.844400	"I feel capable enough to understand everything that is given to me, and sometimes go beyond the materials that are given to me by my physician, as I feel that sometimes these materials are ""dumbed down"" for the general public, and I prefer to get more scientific, in-depth information about health and illnesses."
0.750000	I feel I have more than average knowledge on healthcare and related services. I look up all procedures and medication before they are done or taken. If I need clarification on something I will ask a professional or search online. I will often try to find someone who has gone through similar health experiences to get their insight. It is also to my benefit I have a relative that is in a medical field that is informed on a lot of topics. 
0.461100	Sometimes when I have a condition that send me to hospital I don't feel confident enough to tell the nurse or doctor about it because sometimes I feel that not everything that I'm feeling right now is not related to the condition.
0.755600	I feel I have the neccessary capacity to understand what I am reading in order to fill out paperwork properly.  If I am not well during an Doctor's visit, however, I may not be able to retain everything that was said by that doctor and sometimes will bring someone to the visit with me to help listen.
0.900000	Overall I believe I can get the proper answers.  While I haven't gone to the doctor often for myself, I have to go regularly for my children for many different conditions including multiple medicines with different doses and times.  I've been able to read the instructions given and understand what I need to do. Furthermore I tend to doublecheck by asking the medical specialist for confirmation.
0.916700	I am perfectly capable of understanding anything the health care professionals tell me about my condition at all times and I do not need any assistance with any of the information I have been given.
0.783300	In most cases I feel that I am able to find the basic information that I need regarding my general health, either from my nurse or physician or by consulting online literature. It is the bureaucracy of insurance and the corporatization of medical forms and requirements that cause me the most headaches. Much of the stress of dealing with a medical situation has to do with things that are not related to any ailment itself.
0.916700	I'm well educated on health and medicine via my schooling, having looked things up online regularly, and having discussed health issues on a regular basis with my friends, family, and doctors. Since my mother is a doctor, I can also ask her for help with any medical-related issues I may have. 
0.850000	I feel competent when it comes to obtaining, processing, and understanding health information and I feel competent to make the appropriate decisions for me. I am quite well informed on a multitude of health information, and I spend time online doing my own research. General Practitioners are very useful, but I feel responsible for understanding my own health problems and researching them as much as I can. I have disagreed with a prognosis before and ended up being right. It pays to be vigilant. 
0.561100	I always make the right decisions and the necessary ones, therefore I feel that I have a perfect capacity to make all kinds of decisions
0.700000	I usually go online and look for further explanation on things the doctor or nurse covered that I didn't understand. This helps a lot in determining what the best route for care is for me.
0.616700	IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT I WANT TO ASK WHEN I GO TO MY DOCTOR, EVEN WHEN I WRITE IT DOWN.  MY DOCTOR DOES NOT SEEM TO WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH ME. JUST LOOKS AT HER COMPUTER THE WHOLE TIME.  I FEEL LIKE I AM BOTHERING HER. WHATEVER MY PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE, SHE WILL GIVE ME A PILL FOR IT.
0.916700	I absolutely feel I have my full faculties when I am making health decisions. I am able to fully understand basic health information. If I don't understand the doctor's jargon, I ask them to explain it in layman's terms.
0.900000	Whenever I've visited any health professional in regards to my health I've always had the option to seek out any health information that's necessary. Almost every single time they have always given out a few sheets of paper with a brief explanation of everything as well as always constantly asking me questions if I have any. They always have constantly made me feel as if I have the opportunity to understand and obtain the information with relative ease. 
0.855600	I think that I am generally well equipped to handle the information I am provided. I have solid reading skills, but my greatest strength is in my ability to ask questions. I am good at asking for information and paraphrasing what the physician says. My biggest complaint with my previous doctor is that he was in and out of the office so fast that it did not give me time to process information and formulate questions. My current doctor is much better about that and is excellent at communicating information.
0.916700	I have no problems reading or writing English. I always understand medical information and the informational forms that need completed. I've never needed anyone's assistance filling out information and I make sure that I ask the Doc/Nurse any questions that I might have before I leave.

0.855600	I think there is adequate information available for me to understand, process, obtain basic health information and services. I think I could always check online for more information or ask the persons. 
0.744400	"The problem is a lot of information is put into pamphlets to look good or really be read by people who already have a good understanding of medical lingo. I dont need a word that uses every letter in the alphabet twice. A lot of stuff uses too much lingo and can make you feel inadequate. Makes you not want to ask the question because ohh this person doesnt know what ""dnkfnepehdnlopidkodnghineocian"" means. Why are you wasting my time if you dont know that. If I cant pronounce or read the word then I am not going to ask about it at the office."
0.722200	I generally feel like it is somewhat difficult to obtain enough information to be confident in making decisions about my health. Medical information can be difficult to understand. When talking with doctors it can be very difficult to remember everything they have discussed with you. And there is always the suspicion that doctors are biased towards giving treatment when it probably isn't necessary. 
0.844400	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand basic health information to a good degree. I can read health related documents easily and can comprehend them to their fullest. I can make proper health decisions most of the time and have no problem comprehending what is required of me. 
0.900000	I believe that I have the resources necessary to obtain and process information regarding my health, and the health of my children.

0.866700	I believe I have a high capacity to obtain, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.

0.805600	I feel pretty confident that I have the ability to understand basic health information that's given to me and to make decisions for myself. I don't always feel confident that doctors are giving me the right information though or that they have taken the time to understand my issues.
0.744400	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information to a great extent. I am a nurse, so a lot of medical things I understand. But even being a health professional myself, I find some of the information is hard to understand, and I realize working as a nurse a lot of it is even harder for someone who has no medical background. 
0.783300	I feel I have the capacity to understand most things I receive, my issue is that medical professionals either don't listen when I ask a question or if they hear it, they half answer it or rush through the explanation. A lot of the time, I find myself going to Web MD after a visit to try and get more detailed information. Medical professionals are often too busy to take the time and answer you thoroughly and I can tell they are trying to hurry me through the appointment. Some written material I don't read, as it's repetitive and the font is like 1/2 point.  
0.866700	I have some medical issues, and I am a caregiver for my mother. I have NO problem asking questions and giving information to make sure all needs are understood and met. Sometimes I give more information than necessary.

0.638900	I believe that I can understand most basic things, but if it was more than basic, like maybe tests or a diagnosis, I would need someone to explain it to me. I don't understand a lot of medical terms, like names for tests. I also do not know pretty much anything about medicine. I have to pretty much completely trust my doctor's knowledge. I leave the doctor's office not knowing enough. I don't think to ask the right questions when i'm with the doctor. That or the appointment is so rushed that I don't have the chance to ask. I have to Google stuff a lot when it comes to medical stuff. 
0.661100	I feel the for the most part I have the capacity and understanding to fully grasp what is going on. Still, there are many medical terms that I just don't understand and it's very difficult for me to know 100% what's going on.

0.594400	I am a very good reader. I read a lot of information a day on eating healthy and some diseases and the ways to get rid of them. I always try to spread as many information and help as I can.
0.655600	I think I have the capacity. Sometimes I don't understand everything that is given to me, however, my father is a nurse and can usually explain these things to me. I do usually get shy about asking further. Sometimes I don't realize I misunderstood until I get home and will just inquire to my father. 
0.900000	I feel like my capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information is generally very good. I feel I can advocate for myself and make sure I understand all my options before making decisions. 
0.827800	I'm quite literate, so I have a lot of confidence in my ability to interpret medical information.  I can read at college level and have a wide vocabulary.

0.833300	I have had a diagnosis of Anxiety and Depression for over 20 years so I pretty much understand all that is related to that. I have only in the past 3 years finally been diagnosed correctly with Bipolar Disorder and started treatment. I have had to learn a lot about the diagnosis as well as the new medications, and side effects associated, in these last few years. I am at a point where I understand the basic information regarding the disorder and the medications and have no problem asking my psychiatrist questions about such.
0.916700	I believe that I can understand the information I receive because, if I don't understand something then I make sure that I ask the doctor or nurse to explain it to me. That way I can confidently make good health decisions.
0.861100	I am confident in my ability to understand written information. Information communicated to me verbally is sometimes lost because I have an auditory processing disorder. In addition to this, I sometimes have a difficult time asking for help due to social anxiety.
0.916700	I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions?, I would make sure I have enough information from the doctor and follow up literature.

0.844400	I have the benefit of working at a hospital so i have ample resources available for me, especially on our internal systems. However, if I didn't have tat access, I'd feel like the amount of information I had access too is limited, unless I google everything.

0.866700	I have been sick for many years with CKD, and have had many experiences with doctors and hospitals therefore I believe I have a broader understanding of medicine than your average person.
0.850000	I have Congential Adrenal Hyperplasia and Dystonia as two of my more problematic medical conditions.  Both cause me severe medical problems with far bigger repurcussions in my personal, social, and work life.  Because of the lack of support and understanding ever found a other than lies to weaken I have learned to fight for myself.  My first and core victory is never giving that up and second is seeking informed treatment while assuming others are always negative.
0.855600	I am confident that I can understand any health information I am given.  I have never had a problem in the past understanding information.  I know how to get more information if needed, so if there was something I didn't understand I'd be able to learn more.
0.916700	I haven't had any issues obtaining or understanding any of my health information or issues.  I asked appropriate questions to medical staff.  I research online to ensure I ask questions that I may not have thought to ask if I did not read about the subject and educate myself.
0.822200	I believe I have the resources to do so. I can always ask my doctor important questions concerning my health. I feel like I can go on the internet to obtain certain information.
0.888900	I feel very confident that I can easily understand any basic health information and services that I come across. I fill out health documents for myself and also work in the healthcare industry; it is a field that I studied in college.
0.761100	I usually don't have trouble with the paperwork but when it comes to talking to medical professionals I feel that they are always in such a rush and ask the same brief questions repeatedly so there's little time for me to ask my own questions. I had an experience where I was given a prescription and I wasn't even able to see what the name of the medication was until I was at the check out so I couldn't ask the doctor at all about it, only the receptionist.
0.722200	I can get alot more information on my own.  I just struggle sometimes really knowing what is relevant in my situation there is so much info on the internet, its hard to know.  Doctors always seem in a rush and I try my best to ask all the questions in a visit but sometimes forget or think of things later
0.916700	I'm completely capable of understanding all of the required information. If I have any questions, I am not ashamed or embarrassed to ask. If there is still something I do not understand, I am capable of looking up the information online.
0.866700	I have absolute ability to understand, and if I don't, I will ask questions until I do. I read a lot and have common sense, and any information that falls outside of that I will look on the internet to get the right answer. 
0.811100	I feel like I have a higher than normal capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I do a lot of research whenever I come up to something I don't know.  So, I have acquired a lot of knowledge on health when dealing with insurances, babies, etc.
0.761100	i usually understand what is being told to me by doctors or nurses. sometimes though i just need an afirmentation of what is being told to me. sometimes think they said one thing but they mean something else because i do not pay attention, because i am nervous 
0.811100	I think I have the capacity to understand my doctors information and to read about it online. But I think in the moment at a doctor's appointment I forget to tell them everything and so I worry they do not get the whole story. I also think that appointments themselves are expensive and I don't have the means to go to a doctor or get the tests I want done. I also think that health insurance policies are written in a confusing way where it limits what I do because I am not entirely sure what I can do. This narrows my health decisions a great amount.
0.605600	Sometimes I think doctors don't explain everything outright like they should in laments terms. They don't always give adequate resources and it feels like you're taking up too much of their valuable time if you ask too many questions. 
0.838900	With the advent of the Information Age came with it the ability to research many things independently.  For example: A terminology used in a diagnoses can be researched through the internet.  This can be essays or articles that are written in plain English, or robust biological analysis.  So to answer the question.  I feel I have absolute and total control, as long as we have an ethical and strong education system that can share their knowledge on the internet.  All can be informed about almost all things.  One only needs to learn the tools.
0.772200	I am fully capable of understanding most health related information. I have nothing to prevent me from visiting a medical center if I decide that I need medical attention. I am also fully capable to decide what is the best health decision for me, regardless of what medical advice is given to me by the hospital staff.
0.900000	I always fill out medical information by myself and rarely need help.  I always ask questions if I need to and I try to be as honest as possible when speaking with a doctorl
0.716700	I generally find that I am able to understand the basic concepts regarding health decisions. Sometimes I do need to clarify and get more information on things like, for example, diabetes and what needs to be done to control that given my risk factors. The one thing that completely flies over my head though is insurance. I can never tell if something is covered or not and it's a pain to have to try and figure that out so you don't end up paying a fortune if there is a generic that's cheaper somewhere. In my experience the Doctors and staff I've seen have always been kind, patient, and attuned to my concerns and willing to take a few minutes to explain what they suggest and why. That's really an important part because they don't need to go into all the technical details...just give me an idea of my options and a basic understanding of what they're trying to solve.
0.777800	I feel like I can review my health records well enough. When I was in the military, I used to review my records occasionally since they were available online. Sometimes, I didn't understand things and would ask. My sister is a nurse so I am able to ask her about anything I need. My best friend's father is also a Neuro-surgeon. If I have questions about anything, I ask them.
0.794400	I think that I'm perfectly capable of understanding any basic health information. If I had any questions I'd probably just look them up online so that I could get answers from multiple sources so I don't really ask that many questions.
0.783300	Asking many questions help me understand most health information. I also often check what I heard with research on internet. And most of the time when I have a certain condition I research the symptoms on internet even before I go and see a health care person so that I already know what questions I should be asking.
0.800000	I think I have good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. For some complex information, I may need advice from an experienced professional, but I am a curious person and I like learning about things. I think that I have slightly above-average intelligence, with an average amount of experience, but no expert knowledge of the medical field.
0.772200	I BELIEVE I HAVE A GOOD CAPACITY TO MAKE APPROPRIATE HEALTH DECISION. HOWEVER, SOMETIME I NEED A CLEAR EXPLANATION FROM THE DOCTOR.
0.644400	Being in the medical system can be difficult and confusing. There are quite a lot of forms to fill out and its difficult when you are sick. I feel like i need more resources and information in order to make the appropriate decisions with my healthcare. The standards of care vary and some medical professionals recommend things that others do not.
0.850000	I think that I am pretty capable. It helps that I have a very good primary care physician who explains things very well. My network also allows me to email my doctor, in case I think of questions later or have anything that I do not understand. But, most of the time, I fully understand what my doctor is telling me and what I need to do before I leave his office.
0.777800	I feel like I am pretty capable however there are somethings that can be confusing which I need help with. I can usually find this help from family or on the internet
0.766700	I believe I have the capacity to obtain and process health information and services needed to make health decisions.  Sometimes it is a matter of understanding the language and complexities of health care that makes making decisions difficult.
0.883300	I feel that I have a strong capacity to understand health information that is presented to me. I ask questions when needed, and do additional research on medical websites afterwards if something remains unclear. 
0.916700	I feel fairly confident that I can ultimately get the relevant information I need   through any necessary direct questioning of the medical professional. Further, I will ask if have I questions about any written material that I might be given. I am not averse to seeking help from close friends nor researching an issue on the internet (though I rarely do this.)
0.866700	I feel that I can obtain, process and understand basic health information services needed to make health decisions.  In fact, most of the time I look up the conditions online and read books about them so I have a better grasp of what I'm dealing with.  It's important for me to understand these things completely since I have really high anxiety and I am completely uncomfortable if I don't understand what's going on with me completely.
0.855600	I feel that I do have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health info and services that are needed for the right health decisions. I do feel that some of the answers given to me by doctors is very ambiguous and vague. I feel it's becoming more and more difficult to get a definitive answer and treatment plan by many doctors. In this way, I do find it difficult, because there seems to be a lack of concern in what I'm asking about in certain situations. I often have to rely on doing a lot of research myself, which can be difficult when trying to discern certain medical journals. 
0.900000	I feel that I am quite capable since I consider the scientific research method to be the basis for my reasoning. When I receive information from a medical professional, if I do not possess a complete understanding of the information, then I research the information that I require to understand it. I, then, discuss any concerns I may have with the medical professional.  I find that this methodology works for me.
0.916700	I feel I am fully able and competent to get the information I need, ask the questions I need answered, and understand the answers. I have never had a concern getting information, using it, filling out forms, or anything of that sort.
0.900000	I feel very confident in my ability to read and understand the paperwork regarding my medical conditions.  I am also confident in my ability to understand basic health information and I am not afraid to ask questions regarding my care.  
0.633300	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basci health information and services. I usually refer to google but in the event that I need to get help for a medical personnel I would. 
0.755600	I mostly can. It is just knowing what questions to ask. When reading materials, it is hardly ever written in a way that someone who is not a medical professional can truly understand. 
0.916700	I do not have a medical background other than basic first aid and cpr training but I have always been fascinated with health issues in general. I try to keep current on health topics. I have a fair amount of experience helping relatives with their medical information and decisions. I have learned a lot through helping others about what questions to ask and how to make the most of doctor visits. I feel very confident in my abilities to do the same for myself.
0.916700	My two passions when I was young were science and writing, which led me into journalism covering the sciences.  I have worked around scientists for years.  I am comfortable reading technical material and do not hold doctors or scientists on any type of plateau.  Yes, I do have the capacity to make decisions
0.916700	Well, I am 65 now. Currently, I have the mental capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I go to the doctor when I need to or when I have a scheduled appointment. I get all my prescriptions filled. If the doctor tells me I need to have a test done, I will follow through and have the test. 
0.827800	I believe that I am capable of understanding health information that is given to me. I also feel comfortable looking for information online to help me understand better.
0.727800	I believe in understanding documents and filling out forms I find it easy to process and understand. It is when I need more information and have to ask the questions where I do stumble and or tend to ask the wrong things or word it weirdly. I have horrible social anxiety which does not help one bit.
0.916700	I am very capable of retrieving all the information I need. I can ask questions to the nurse and doctor when I am not clear on any issue. 
0.722200	I feel fairly confident in my ability to obtain and understand basic health and services information. For advanced cases or something I didn't know about I would be less confident. But for average issues I think I have a good ability in understanding medical information.
0.816700	It depends on the day. If I'm having a good day, with no cognitive impairment from various and sundry sources, I'm pretty confident in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information, so I can make appropriate health decisions. If I'm having a bad day, and I'm experiencing cognitive impairment, be it from a physical illness, a chronic condition, a mental illness, or one of the medications to treat everything, it's anybody's guess. That's why 99% of the time I'm dealing with medical personnel, I have my primary caregiver with me.
0.866700	i believe that i can reasonably understand information presented to me in clear terms, that i can ask questions to clarify what i do not understand, and that i can get help from family, friends or other professionals to read and decipher written information.
0.783300	I think that on the whole, I have a good ability to obtain and understand basic health information.  More of my personal barriers involve my comfort in communicating with doctors and nurses clearly and honestly.  There have been some occasions in the past where I have needed assistance in understanding medical information and have had to consult several sources to get the answers I needed, but this is the exception, nor the norm.
0.683300	"I don't feel that I have enough understanding on my own. When I visit the doctor or a hospital, I usually am worried that I haven't explained everything sufficiently. So I'll will ask the doctor or the nurse a ton of questions. I don't want to be driving away and then think ""Why didn't I remember to ask about that?""."
0.738900	I feel i have a great ability to obtain process and understand basic health information and services need to make an appropriate health decision. I struggle when it is something that is not basic sometimes, but i can usually look up something online and quickly gather a basic understanding of most things. Also, my mother-in-law has worked for a doctors office for 30 years and has a higher understanding of most of the things that i struggle to understand.
0.916700	My mind is still perfectly sharp. If I don't know something, I can easily look it up online. I don't hesitate to ask medical professionals for more knowledge- it's their job. In another lifetime, I probably could've BEEN a medical professional..but oh well..
0.833300	I feel as though for the most part that Iâm capable to understand most of the health information provided to me. There have been times over the years that I would need further explaining of certain things and my health professionals have been able to effectively explain things to my understanding. It has been very rarely that Iâve not fully understood something but being too embossed to ask for further explanation of said conditions I have left and researched things on my own whether using the internet or talking with family and friends to understand it better.
0.811100	I feel I can comprehend many of the basic health information given to me from doctors and nurses. Ive never had a problem with understanding any fallow up documents that were given to me either.
0.722200	For the most part I do feel I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions while I am well. However having multiple conditions like MS, RA, Epilepsy when I am I'll I become extremely overwhelmed and nervous during visits and don't always get the info I need.
0.783300	I believe that overall I have a pretty good ability at obtaining and understanding basic health information and services. I have a doctor that I fully trust, and who I am always comfortable asking questions to. I also now have a pharmacy that I use, whose workers are also always willing to answer any slight questions that I may have. I have access to these physical people, as well as the Internet in order to gain information about anything else that I don't understand. I'll use it sometimes to check basic drug interactions that I can't remember, such as Tylenol and Aleve, or other such over the counter medications. I also have my parents that are always willing any questions I have concerning medical history when I have to fill out forms. I'm generally a nervous person, but when it comes to my health I do the best I can in order to receive all of the information I need, and not allow myself to feel bullied into making choices that may not be right for me.
0.838900	I believe that I currently have the basic information I need regarding my overall health, but I am also confident that if I were to have a question or concern, there are databases and reference centers that would help me to understand.
0.750000	I believe that if I don't get the answers I need from a doctor or nurse, I can always get further information online and I can use Google or WebMD or mayoclinic.com.  I an always call back the next day and ask if there is something I don't understand. I also have medical encyclopedias in case I want to look something up that I am unsure about.
0.916700	My main hobby is reading, and I prefer thought-provoking non-fiction articles. I read all I can on exercise, nutrition and prevention, plus have kept myself as mentally sharp as possible. If I am sick or have any kind of health problem, in addition to seeking help for it, I read everything I can about it to self-educate.
0.772200	I believe that I have the capacity to understand basic health information and services if they are communicated to me by a health professional. Once they explain the service, and I have asked all my questions, I believe I have the information to make an informed decision.
0.916700	I understand everything I am told perfectly, and will take notes if need be. If anything, I ask more questions because I want to know exactly what I'm doing.
0.783300	I believe that I have sufficient skills an knowledge to accurately read and understand basic health information. I also know when I do not understand what I am being told and when to ask the questions I need to in order to fully convey what the practitioner is saying. Being able to do both of these things allows me to make appropriate health decisions.
0.811100	I feel like I can understand and make basic decisions regarding my health but may need assistance with more complicated matters or forms.
0.888900	I think have the capacity to read, listen and understand all that the doctors or nurses tell me. If not, I would probably ask questions until I understood
0.822200	I feel I'm well equipped to obtain and understand health information. That doesn't always mean I get it from the doctor or his staff though. Often they seem so rushed and impatient it's easier just to find out what the diagnosis is, and use the internet to obtain any additional information I need.
0.711100	I feel that the jargon used on official medical documents needs to be dialed down to my level of understanding. There is often too much redundant information.
0.916700	I feel very confident in my abilities to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I believe this is because I am a medical student, so I have a better idea of what to ask. 
0.838900	I think I can understand health informagion to a great extent, based on my previous answers and my experience in hospitals before I only miss the medical expressions otherwise everything is understandable 
0.888900	I am well educated with a good vocabulary, so I feel that I am well equipped to understand health information and make decisions. Further, I am a scientist, so I have an understanding of medical terms. When I do not understand health information I have the resources to figure out what it means without asking another person.
0.900000	I feel very confidant with my ability to obtain, process, and understand health information and services I receive. I ask a lot of questions if I want to know something or need more information. I have never had a problem understanding anything my doctor or nurses have said in the past, and I don't see any change in the future. I have done what they have wanted me to do for health reasons, and i have understood why I should do what they ask me to do.
0.722200	I feel like I can do an okay job at it. There are definitely times I dont understand certain medical terms but I usually just ask questions and that clears things up
0.872200	I believe i'm 75% capable of reading and processing it because i like to read up and ask questions so at this point i''m pretty up to date on medicinal info 
0.844400	I feel that I have an above-average understanding of much health-related documentation.  I have grown up with parents who worked in the healthcare field so this helped me develop a basic understanding of many terms at an early age. Overall I would say I am above-average intelligence so this helps me grasps things with relative ease.  I have all of my abilities such as sight and cognition to understand documentation as well.
0.822200	I feel confident in expressing my Symptoms to my doctors and nurses to get the necessary test and treatment needed. My doctors always make sure I have all the knowledge to understate my diagnosis and the proper medicines. They also make sure I understand the medicines and how to take properly and how to maintain my conditions at my house.
0.855600	I have experienced a health catastrophe in which I suffered through the treatment recommended by Western medicine (actually, I avoided the most recommended treatment and am not a cripple today, or dead, as a result).  I'm a lawyer.  I read and understand complicated documents for a living.  That's not to say I like it.
0.916700	I do not feel that is a problem for me at all. If I don't feel like I understand completely what they are saying, I make it a point to ask for clarification. I also always make sure that they are understanding what I am trying to tell them as well.
0.888900	I am 100% certain that I can obtain and evaluate all of the information I need to understand my health conditions and make appropriate decisions. I have a bachelors degree in anthropology and focused on the biological side, taking several pre-med courses as well. I also went to an excellent college that focused in reading and writing, and developed the ability to research and process large quantities of information. I am skilled at getting information from the internet, recognizing reliable sources, discarding the nonsense, and using what I have learned to ask educated questions from my health providers. I see connections and understand the logic of cause and reaction.
0.861100	I feel I have the full capacity to do so. Understanding the scope of health problems is not an issue for me. i have one life and understanding my body and my health issues is important, and thus fully grapsing and listening to and comprehending doctors is something important and neccessary for me. 
0.900000	I believe I get all of the information I need from my doctor.  If there is something I'm later confused about or forgot to ask my doctor I usually turn to the internet and can find my answers there.
0.800000	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I find it really helpful, however, to have someone else read or hear at the same time to make sure that I think of or consider everything.
0.883300	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process and understand my basic health information and services that are needed so that appropriate health decisions can be made.  I know how to ask questions if I do not understand and I know how to call or email my doctor also.  I also know that I can ask a loved one to get their interpretation of material that I might not understand.  Also, I can ask my doctor if I can record information so that I can listen to it again in case I miss something. 
0.855600	I feel I have the complete capacity to to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am in no way physically or intellectually compromised in such a way as to hamper my decision making abilities. 
0.916700	I believe I am 100% capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I can read and understand written material more than competently and understand verbiage just as well. I anticipate no problems in my near future also. 
0.666700	I believe I can fairly easily obtain basic health information.  Processing and understanding the information is usually a little harder but with the help of the internet, friends, and family I can usually figure out what I need to.  
0.783300	I feel somewhat confident. At times, because I am afraid of the answers, I don't ask the questions I need to ask, and I terrify myself further by reading google. But, most times, I know what I need to know.
0.683300	Some papers are really to hard to understand.  They need to either simplify the forms are have someone readily available to speak to someone and make them feel more comfortable.
0.811100	I think I have a good understanding and capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needs to make appropriate health decisions. When I have questions about certain topics pertaining to making my appropriate health decisions, I ask questions to ensure I understand the situations between my situation and the health assistance that I am receiving. 
0.383300	I feel that is very important for me to understand what is happening to my health and what is happening to my body. Sometimes nurses are not qualified enough to help me understand my condition. Also filling out formalities can me very difficult at times as they are very complex and often list out diseases that I don't know about. 
0.761100	I feel that I do have the capacity in that if something is unclear to me, I either ask for a simplified explanation or find a way to have it put in terms that are clear and that I can understand. If there are terms mentioned that I do not know, then I usually look them up so I can understand what they mean. 
0.544400	I don't appreciate it when documents that I need to read are in medical jargon.  I need help understanding what is actually happening to me, and that frustrates me.  
0.900000	I feel that I can understand pretty much everything that is explained to me  or that I try to find out. If I don't happen to understand everything, I am always sure to do my best to find out everything that I need to know before leaving or getting into a situation where I can no longer get help or assistance. 
0.838900	As far as basic information goes I'm fully confident I have the ability to understand what my doctors tell me. However if there's any serious issues I'll typically do my own research at home on the internet about the condition. Sometimes I'll have questions after I leave the doctor that I didn't think about while I was at the doctor, and I'll look up information online. This helps me fully understand it to a greater extent.
0.888900	I have a firm grasp of the English language and I'm reasonably intelligent and well read.  If I have questions about health information, I'm capable of finding a source that will answer my questions.
0.916700	I try and get all the information I can when I am facing, or if a loved one is facing, a health problem.  I read, I research, I listen to the doctor and nurses (especially to the nurses as they are hands-on,though my doctor explains things well). The written material is not too big a challenge normally, even when  not clearly written - I do ask when it's indecipherable because I need to understand things.
0.850000	I believe that that I am more than capable. I have read a good deal about health related topics, and I ask a lot of questions. If I needed any help, I am able to get that help easily.
0.811100	Most of the time I understand what is happening with my health, therefore my level of capacity to understand is reasonably high.  I do, however, tend to skip the minutia in RX documents as it is not written in layman language.
0.783300	I feel like if I use my knowledge and information collected from credible websites, I usually have a good idea of any conditions that I currently have BEFORE I ever see my doctor or nurse, and so I know which questions to ask when my appointment rolls around. One major issue is that medical professionals tend to ignore or downplay questions and concerns by patients At least that's been my experience and I truly resent it because I'm not some unintelligent yokel, I have a genius-level IQ and I'm obsessive about researching things, so it angers me when people talk down to me or dismiss my concerns because they have a piece of paper hanging on their wall.
0.783300	It is someone difficult to ask questions to medical providers. I often feel rushed when I'm at doctor's appointments and it's hard to think about what I need to ask. I like getting written information at the end of the visit because it is easier to understand and remember the information. 
0.722200	I have  the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions on my own. Most of the time I do not need assistance from others.
0.883300	I feel that I am quite capable of managing and comprehending basic health information for my children and myself. I consider my knowledge of health matters to be above average and I know how to research reputable sources when additional information is required. I also have a great rapport with my pediatrician's office and know how to call for information if needed.
0.766700	I think that I have an ok capacity.  I can read just fine but sometimes the medical wording confuses me.  I'll usually do some research once I've gone to see the doctor and been given some medical advice and that usually causes me to get further confused because there is so much information.  I'm also not confident asking questions so, I think that hinders my understanding a lot.  Also, like many others, I fail to tell my doctor everything and I know that it doesn't help my situation and can really hurt my health decisions because by keeping things from my doctor, I'm only hindering my diagnosis.  
0.816700	I believe that, in general, I have the ability to obtain and understand health information and that I can be informed enough to make educated decisions. I feel that I am diligent when it comes to asking questions when I do not understand something.
0.672200	I am able to understand the medical information that is pertinent to me because I inquire what I do not fully understand from my doctors and nurses. Everything is simple enough to read and comprehend, but sometimes the medical jargon can be confusing to incorporate, so I would simply call them or setup a meeting to ask them face to face questions.
0.688900	If I dedicate the necessary time, I can usually figure everything out that was presented to me either in paper or verbal form. My biggest hangup is when it comes to billing from hospitals or doctors since it seems like the breakdown of charges is so detailed that it is easy to lose track of what expense was for what aspect of treatment. I do find myself not always able to ask the questions I would like to though when visiting a doctor because of how rushed it always seems. The doctors (any doctor) arrives after I have waited in the waiting room as well as in the examination room, and I know the doctor has other patients who are also waiting.
0.900000	I feel confident that I can understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I have never had a problem understanding information given to me by a doctor in the past. If I an unsure about anything I will ask questions until I fully understand. 
0.872200	I feel that I am quite literate enough to understand and process basic health info.  I am healthy and physically fit.  I have a science background so I do understand scientific jargon.
0.850000	I feel that when the doctor/nurse/health practice employee explains things in simple terms I clearly can undertstand my information.   Specifically, if they relate the information to my temperature, weight, blood pressure, air flow, and examine my blood for sugars, iron and cholesterol.   I start to have problems when things get explained through the technical terms since I have not been trained in the medical field.
0.888900	I believe I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. When I don't understand something completely, I am sure to ask, if not right away then later through email or a telephone call. Sometimes health professionals use abbreviations or jargon that makes sense to them, but not to the average healthcare consumer. So when I don't recognize a term or need explanation, I ask.
0.916700	I believe I am competent enough to process and understand health information and services needed. I have the capacity to make smart decisions regarding my healthcare. I know what is right and wrong when it comes to my health needs. 
0.838900	I am old enough and been through enough to feel comfortable with health information provided to me to make health decisions.  If there are questions that I am not comfortable asking at the time or just dont ask, the information is often readily available on the internet to find.  There is no reason I should not have all the necessary information when I make a health decision.
0.888900	I an very interested in alternative health treatments so I am very familiar with my health issues and possible treatments. I am constantly trying new herbal supplements and other nutritional supplements to see how they affect my body. I am well versed in how the human body works and what it needs. I constantly give health advice to relatives.
0.855600	I like to read up on conditions before I go to the doctor, so I like to think I'm pretty well informed.  I usually have some familiarity with things before I go in.
0.850000	I have basic knowledge and confidence to answer, process and obtain health information. If there's something I truly don't understand then I'll definitely ask questions to my nurse or doctors to get further explainations. 
0.833300	I think I have a fairly good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services I need to make the right health decisions.  My biggest concern is I am not always able to find the right information.
0.461100	I don't thin I am that good at it.I have major epilepsy and because of that I do not take new information on very well.It is very hard for me to understand new things that are told to me sometimes. Especially if they are in words I do not understand.I even have to wright down all of the medication I take & all of the questions I have a few days ahead of time to make sure I have everything I need to tell my Dr when I go in. 
0.638900	getting the information is reasonably easy, once you are able to contact your provider, thats the biggest headache that takes the longest, Actually speaking to a doctor or nurse is difficult and it time consuming. My doctor is however very good at explaining everything, causes,syptoms, treatments.
0.883300	I believe I have above-average capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic information. My capacity to obtain services would improve if insurance did not impede the process.
0.822200	I usually do research before I visited the doctor so I know what I'm up against.  If the doctor brings up something new and I don't understand it, then I will ask.  I want to know what is going on with me.
0.744400	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information and make decisions about my health.  I can usually understand any material that is presented to me and if necessary I can research on my own to gain further understanding of medical information. 
0.777800	I think i am able to understand basic medical information. i generally am ok with asking questions when i don't understand something, but only if the nurse or doctor i am speaking with is approachable. Some doctors are not approachable or they talk down to you and make you feel stupid and intimidated. In those cases if i don't understand something i won't say anything, i will just try to find the information on the internet later.
0.861100	I feel I have a high degree of proficiency when it comes to the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. When situations arise in which this is not the case, I am not afraid to voice my concerns and questions and be persistent with medical staff until we can reach a mutual understanding of the information being presented.
0.794400	I have a good degree to obtain and process basic health information. If I need help people with be around to assist me.
0.883300	I am very competent in filling out medical forms. I may have to get someone to write for me if the forms are small because of a lost nerve at C7/T1. Most of the time I don't though. I am well aware of my medical conditions and explain in detail what is going on with me to the doctor/nurse. 
0.472200	I have a difficult time asking the doctor to clarify when I donât understand.  Sometimes I am intimidates or feel rushed.  It is hard to reach the office one I leave.  This has led to me discontinuing care and leaving the practice.  I can research basic information online, but when dealing with a complicated matter itâs not as easy. 
0.916700	I have a full understanding of the best way to take care of myself: be honest with health practitioners, ask the hard questions and answer ones given to me honestly, keep up with check-ups, maintain a healthy lifestyle. I do not need help taking care of myself when it comes to the medical aspect of my life because I'm mentally capable and emotionally capable of doing so on my own. 
0.916700	I am pretty confident in myself with health decisions. I understand things easily and have no problem understanding or asking the appropriate questions when needed.
0.783300	I'm fairly confident in my ability to understand basic health information because I passed 8th grade English with no problems whatsoever.
0.844400	Whenever I have any kind of health issue, I heavily research the symptoms online, as well as all treatment options and medications, before I even go into the initial appointment.  I feel that it is very important to be informed.
0.805600	I believe I am capable of understanding basic health information. I have the capacity sufficient to make the necessary health decisions on my own.
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to make any decisions regarding my health. I have never had any trouble comprehending anything my doctor has informed me of, and i don;t make decisions without being informed.
0.855600	I think I have the capacity to fully understand basic information and services. Sometimes I ask for better clarification when something is a bit more complicated, but it's not that often. I've also been lucky to have doctors and nurses that explain things in detail.  
0.700000	Sometimes hospital and health lingo are really hard for me to understand and sometimes my health problems are difficult to understand. I try to ask my doctors to tell me about every detail of my health and I ask for recommendations to improve my health or to maintain my health. I don't know what it is but it's like a mental block when I try to understand my health situations and how problematic some of my problems can be about my health. I feel helpless sometimes when I ask the doctor to repeat whats been said to me for the third time but slower. Filling out my forms aren't hard but confusing at times.
0.727800	I believe I am very capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. I understand the body's normal processes and I can understand when something is wrong. However, when medical terminology is used, I sometimes need it to be explained.

0.638900	I feel somewhat confident in my ability to obtain information, however, processing and understanding it can be difficult. Oftentimes, I like to have someone with me (e.g., my husband) at my appointments with me to make sure I am properly taking in everything I need to know. When I am on my own, I have left appointments several times realizing I don't fully remember everything or perhaps have forgotten to ask certain questions.
0.822200	I feel very confident that I can understand basic health information. I haven't had any recent issues or bad experiences with understanding medical information nor have I had any issues in the past.

0.800000	With the Internet it is easy to do research and become familiar with basic health information; while it isn't always accurate, it helps me become more informed and able to ask questions.  I can understand the basics and I make a list of questions to review with the professionals.
0.916700	I believe that I can fully understand all health related information I get. I process it all very well.

0.822200	I think I have a reasonable understanding of what it means to make healthy life choices. I understand the requirements involved and am willing to remain compliant.  It also helps that my mom is an RN.

0.572200	I think i can understand it somewhat however somwtimes whe the doctor is talking to me i really do not know what they are saying or taking about 
0.588900	I read the bottle labels to understand what is asked of me when i take the medications that i have.I have a bit of understanding from previous medications that i have taking in the pass because it seems like all medications are close the the same 
0.844400	Well I believe getting the best care comes down to my ability to efficiently use Google. I mean nowadays that's just a default resume skill, but it's actually relaly good to have.

0.822200	I feel I am pretty good at understanding the information I have been given.  I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and have also had major ankle surgery so there are times when I am not sure on a specific topic or instructions.  
0.833300	I feel that I am more than capable when I need to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  If I am unable to understand something, I will ask for help whether it be from someone else or a medical profession.  Given the right circumstance, I may research it as well.
0.794400	I think I do have the ability to ask and understand health information if I so do so. Sometimes I might opt out of asking question, purely because I would find it embarrassing to ask such a simple question.
0.833300	I work in the health care field and Iâve had 9 surgeries so I have a pretty good understanding of what medical terminology means and I know how to obtain my information and my records.
0.777800	I believe I am capable of understanding the information that my doctors talk to me about. I always make sure to ask questions and sometimes I'll even write down questions ahead of time before the appt to make sure I don't forget.  There does always seem to be some things that are more difficult to understand just because some doctors do not take their time to make sure that we really know what he's saying to us. 
0.766700	I am fairly confident in my ability to understand what I am told by medical professionals. However, sometimes I am bad at thinking of appropriate questions in the moment, such as clarifying questions about what I am told. I also need to put a lot of effort into being organized before an appointment in order to make sure I say everything I need to about my symptoms. When it comes to written documents I am giving after an appointment explaining my diagnosis, I am generally confident in my ability to understand, and that anything unclear is easily researched online if not.
0.777800	I feel I am capable of understanding the health information given to me by health professionals.  If I have questions I usually can ask a family member such as my brother or my wife.  Also, I see numerous doctors, I am sure they would assist me in understanding.
0.883300	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process & understand basic health info in order to make decisions about my heath care. In addition, I keep a list of questions or problems to bring up before each appointment. I sometimes do research on the Web, but always discuss the research with my doctors.
0.750000	I feel like I can communicate with a doctor about any health problems I might have, but my issue comes in with trying to understand everything.  Also sometimes you get materials that you can take home with you to read, and I feel like those materials just make me more confused.  So while, I may not understand everything, hopefully the doctor knows enough to properly evaluate and treat me.
0.777800	I have the utmost ability to do what I must to understand every facet of any health related issues I have, before I go to a medical professional I tend to make notations of questions I might have on my smartphone memo app for reference during consultations/visits. I also ask for any external resources online that I can review/read to help me understand, also I am not concerned about asking the same question to different specialists/medical professionals in order to ensure I have obtained accurate information. As well as needing help with forms/directions/instructions there are usually a myriad of staff members who are always read to help.
0.872200	I feel like there are enough resources out there to gain the information needed if I don't know something. I can search something on the internet, or ask qualified staff in person. If it's basic health information, I feel like I should have no problem understanding it.
0.716700	I think I have an average understanding about basic health information and services when making health decisions.  For me, it depends on the doctor and whether they take the time to explain in layman's term the information they are trying to convey.  I usually ask questions if I am not sure or now I use the internet to get further information if I do not have someone I know who can explain it. 
0.633300	I feel I am capable of understanding basic health information, especially if the doctors take it down to layman's terms. I search the internet when I don't know certain things
0.844400	I feel that I have the capacity to fully understand the information that doctors or nurses relay to me. If I don't understand or I need to obtain additional information I understand how to acquire it.
0.827800	I feel that I have a decent grasp on basic health information. I can usually understand what my doctor is saying or asking me. However, I tend not to ask enough questions because I often forget what I wanted to ask once I see the doctor. 
0.888900	Understanding health information is no different than understanding anything.  Read thoroughly, and ask questions on areas that you do not fully understand.  And, in you free time, do some research.
0.727800	As a person who takes care and pays attention to my own health in general but specifically physical health, I am very confident that I can understand basic health information because of the research I have done throughout my years of living as a person who's very careful.
0.650000	I feel like I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I can figure things out by simply googling them or having someone who has been in my position explain certain things to me to make sure I understand what is going on. I am pretty on top of my health and am healthy to begin with so it isn't too difficult to keep it all straight. The only issues I really have is remembering my family medical history. That kind of messes me up in terms of telling doctors what is determined by my genetics, etc but for the most part I can understand basic health information.
0.900000	I feel that I have the capability to understand the written material that is given to me when I go to the doctor. Although there are a very few times that I don't understand but I seek help, usually at the front desk of the doctors office and they explain to me in detail. It is very important to me that I understand all the medical papers about my health because I want to make sure I take the correct measures in case of an illness. I would not want to misunderstand and later on deal with a worse health issue. I would rather ask even if it means asking a lot of questions.
0.850000	I have a solid understanding of basic information needed to make good decisions. If there is something I don't understand, I ask or do research to make sure that I do understand or can at least form good questions to get the information I need. I have had 4 surgeries, 3 of them major, and my doctors were happy to answer the questions I had and explained everything in detail as I requested.
0.844400	I understand most forms, occasionally i don't understand whats being asked of me. I normally understand what doctors are telling me as long as its in lamens terms.
0.833300	I feel that I get the information I need to process the information the doctor or nurse gives me by asking questions.  I also take someone with me to aide me when having a really important appointment so that I don't forget anything the doctor says or any questions I had originally that I may have forgotten to ask.  But all in all, I feel like get the information I need to understand what the doctor or nurse has said.
0.833300	I feel that i am completely able to understand. I feel this wa because i never had a problem in the past
0.916700	I feel that I have the needed mental and emotional and physical capability to fully understand my health situations. I am comfortable with my doctor, ask needed questions and understand fully what I am told. If I don't fully understand something, I will ask until I do.
0.916700	I am a former medical school faculty in biochemistry. I helped teach and train doctors. I can listen to, converse, and understand medical jargon. As a former biomedical researcher, I often know more about the molecular mechanism of disease than many of the doctors I associate with, and I have no trouble asking questions and hearing recommendations.
0.722200	I think I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to a pretty good degree.  I am still somewhat young, so I haven't had a lot of occasions of going to a clinic or hospital on my own.  I am still pretty used to going with my parents.  I do, however, believe that I have the capacity to be able to gather all the information needed to make appropriate health decisions when needed.
0.855600	I believe that I have the capacity to understand and obtain basic health information.  I do sometimes have issues understanding a doctor when they explain a diagnosis, and I ask questions, but often when I get home, I think of more questions that I need to ask.
0.655600	I am college educated and consider myself a smart person but lots of the medical information provided or asked to provide can be very confusing. I find myself turning to Google for feedback as it's generally easier and faster than reaching out to a medical provider.
0.916700	I am able to understand written or oral information without any trouble. I am able to search for information online, make appropriate judgments about the quality and reliability of the source, and understand what it says. I have no problem asking questions of doctors or other providers if I do not understand something or want more information.
0.916700	I write down symptoms on a piece of paper. I give the paper to my doctor.  I research online for matters related to my health issues.
0.883300	I feel that I can understand most thing told to me by my doctor. Sometimes I do forget to ask questions that I wanted to ask. For the most part I am happy with my doctor explaining things so that I understand everything.
0.916700	I am able to understand just about all of the information I need to make appropriate medical decisions.  I ask a lot of questions if needed and also research information about any medical subject that I am interested in.  Again, if there is something that I don't understand I feel comfortable asking someone who I know will be able to answer my questions.  I read all information that is given to me regarding my health status.  
0.900000	I have full knowledge in basic health information. I have a degree in a healthcare field so I do not have to ask tons of questions at appointments.  
0.827800	I believe I have the capacity to get the health information. The big reason is that I do my research. I use reputable searches to garner information about health conditions. I also come prepared to dr appointments, I bring a list of questions. I make sure to ask all the questions I have so that I can find out what I need to know. If something is not answered I will call or email the dr to ask. I can process written information well. 
0.900000	I do believe that I have the capacity to understand everything. The key is to ask questions from the doctors and nurses and read everything carefully. I also try to research any relevant information via the internet, not to necessarily make decisions, but to understand things more clearly and put me on the right track.
0.672200	I have the ability to obtain the information I need about health services and decisions. Anything that I don't understand I am able to gain more understanding of by asking doctors, nurses, or pharmacists questions. I have never had any issues gaining additional knowledge from these resources. 
0.844400	In general, I believe I have the capability of processing my health issues accurately. The only thing that needs to be worked on is my willingness to speak up if something is unclear, or if I just don't want to feel like I am talking too much. I may miss out on needed information that way.
0.833300	I do feel i am capable of understanding basic medical information provided to me. Hospitals are very scary in my opinion but i believe doctors are really good at breaking down information and explaining things. Also refering you on topics to research to get further information.
0.900000	I feel that I am able to deal with medical situations and information well in the vast majority of situations. Anything out of the ordinary simple needs to be asked about and I am confident enough to do so when I am unsure. I feel that I am better than average at making appropriate health decisions based on the criteria. 
0.811100	Before I visit my doctor, I usually call and tell them on the phone, why I need to make an appointment with them. When I get to the doctors office, they also give me a form to fill out. On the form, I have to fill in information regarding why I am there to see the doctor, what kind of symptoms I am experiencing, and for how long.  
0.844400	i truely understand my disorder and what i was diagnosed with.im trying to eat better and im trying to have less stress easier said then done.my mom was like a caretaker she did my errands because im homebound.she pastaway but my b/f of 27 years helps me with that.im disabled get so little to live on .i suffer from depresscion phobias etc dont have my meds due to meds running out dont like crowds  i was on cartia,  bllod pressure pills 250 mg albutreol inhaler advair disc inhaler,zeprexa 5 mg buspur 20 paxil 20.alprazolm 3 mg. hope things inprove.my rescources ar e scarce.my mom was all i had to help me finacialy ty for letting me do this hit

0.916700	I feel that i have all of the resources I need in order to obtain information regarding my health, and understand what is told to me. 
0.705600	Generally doctors just need enough information to know whats wrong with you so that they can help you as best they can, but it is pretty easy to know what is wrong with yourself and maybe a doctor isnt necessary. I have pretty easy access and I've been through lots of doctors, but I usually just use them as a second opinion.
0.800000	Regarding the information that I obtain from medical staff I usually understand the process I will be foregoing and I understand health information. Being I have heart issues that are chronic I try to listen very carefully.
0.916700	I feel I am 100% able to obtain, process, and understand the basic information and services I need to make appropriate decision on my health. I recognize that help is available should I not fully understand, and I reach out for that help when it is available and when I need it. 
0.855600	I've looked up most of the conditions I've had in the past, and the unfamiliar terminology. So when a doctor or a nurse is explaining things to me about it, I'm sort of familiar with what they're saying and if I'm not I ask my brother-in-law who is a doctor.
0.716700	I know that I have to ask more questions to understand the information given to me by my doctor.  I don't always advicate for myself
0.722200	based on my prior experiences with doctors, hospitals and clinics that I can make  informed decisions regarding basic health information and services.
0.783300	I feel that I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make health decisions because I tend to use research online. When I have follow up questions I will look for scholarly websites and articles explaining what I need to know. I do find it hard to ask the doctor a question after I have left so I take the learning in my own hands.
0.794400	my wife helps do this since she is registered advocate. i her registered advocate as well. we are both in our late 60 so we help either all the time. 
0.716700	I am really certain that I can get the information that I may need to understand what health decisions that I have to make. 
0.838900	I feel fairly confident in asking doctors, physicians, and nurses about anything that I'm unsure of when I'm receiving medical care. I think of medical staff as partners in my journey to retain good health, so i feel it's necessary to ask clarifying questions and to make sure I'm fully aware of everything that's happening with my health.
0.822200	I feel like I am usually capable of understanding all of the information that I am given by my doctor and I am confident enough to ask questions when I do not understand it. 
0.827800	"When I go to the doctor for something more complex than a cold, I always make sure to prepare questions ahead of time. I also usually bring a notebook so that I can write down the answers and do further ""research"" or ask follow up questions if needed"
0.900000	I grew up in a family where a large portion of the women in my family were nurses or had worked in the medical field. So this environment allows me to have a somewhat decent understanding of health information and understanding medical forms.
0.605600	I have a bit of trouble understanding the terms of some health conditions and what certain things mean. Otherwise though I don't really find it to be too much of an issue and I typically can ask for help from someone whom works in the office and understands the process better.
0.827800	I think that I am fairly able to do this all by myself. I think I am capable to ask the needed questions. I would need very little or no assistance to get the information that I need.
0.900000	I understand all basic health information given to me. If I need services performed on me, I understand the services advantages and disadvantages. I can comprehend every detail regarding any medical conditions I encounter.
0.883300	I feel confident that if I'm comfortable (meaning they're helpful and nice) with the doctor/nurse that I will ask all of the questions necessary and make sure they explain it to me in terms I can understand. Usually with paperwork, if I'm confused by something, I will always ask for assistance from a receptionist, etc. 
0.900000	I have been through some major surgeries, and have some chronic health conditions that I have been dealing with for many years.  When these conditions first arose, having no previous knowledge of most of the information that was given to me, it was somewhat daunting to try to understand everything presented to me. I had excellent providers then, and all the information that I needed was provided by someone in the process.  Currently, I feel that I am experienced in these situations now to know enough about my situation.  I  also remain very confident in the information provided to me by professionals.
0.822200	I don't go to the doctor very often but when I do, I feel confident that I can understand basic health information and when I don't fully understand something, I can usually do some research on my own to better understand it.
0.688900	I think I do a pretty good job of obtaining, understanding, and processing the information presented to me by medical professionals. I try to ask questions to ensure I understand, though sometimes I do find myself regretting that I didn't ask certain questions or forgot to after the encounter is over with.
0.800000	I ask many questions during the office visits. Then followup with phone calls to doctor or his staff if needed after doing additional research. I often will seek second opinions on more serious medical issues. 
0.838900	I do my best to make sure before I leave the DR office that everything is explained to me. I do not have a problem with asking questions. They always help me make sure I understand. Most of the time I do understand what they are saying. I had some experience with questions and trying to understand things when I took care of my parents.
0.722200	I make sure to ask the doctor as he is explaining it to me, there are times when I feel like I am asking dumb questions because of the face the doctor makes. So I will just give up and wait to ask the nurse just before I leave the appointment. 
0.744400	I feel that I am confident that I can get basic health information.  I think if I can't get the answers by asking questions I can look in other areas to learn the information.  
0.738900	I feel that I have the ability to process the information that they are giving me. I like to get stuff in writing as well so I am able to refer back to what was said to me at a later time. Having the information in writing also helps me to do some research on the topics when I am at home after the appointment. I will also ask questions in person whenever possible so that they can explain things further 
0.788900	I feel that I am capable of digesting most information.  I'm computer literate and I do look up terminology that I don't understand and my daughter-in-law is an RN and works in the ER and she's a good resource for me.  I use the patient portals corresponding to my doctors and these have helpful information as well.
0.916700	I have the ability to process and understand information about my health. I also have the ability to research what is instructed to me by health professionals.
0.816700	Generally speaking, health documents are intimidating to approach but are understandable through repeated readings; furthermore, assistance is generally available if needed. I feel any decision related to health concerns are met with enough understanding to be properly accessed.
0.694400	If I go online and do my own research I feel that I can get answers. I don't feel like doctors, nurses, or pharmacist are able to answer questions. I have had many cases where I've been told things I have discovered to be inaccurate or simply not true. Doctors/nurses/pharmacist often repeat to you what they have read or been told. I can read it for myself online first hand.
0.900000	I have a scientific background and rarely have trouble understanding information or instructions given by medical professionals.   Hopefully this helps in asking the right questions.
0.722200	I feel I have a very good grasp on my capacity to understand my basic health information. I have always felt that I've made appropriate health decisions given my health status. My doctors and psychologist all agree that I should attempt the way i choose to treat myself and if I need further help, they have offered to be of assistance if I require it.
0.916700	I believe I take my health seriously, and that I have the resources and knowledge to understand all the basic facets of health information. I am able to make decisions about my health, and ask questions clarifying anything that I need more elaboration on. It is not difficult for me to research health information either. 
0.866700	I believe i can process almost all medical information that is relayed to me from medical professionals including doctors and nurses.  I can understand what is told to me, and I can give and solicit medical information during doctor visits.
0.866700	I am always quite confident in my own ability to either find the necessary answers or ask for help when it comes to health. I have had to make doctors and nurses re-iterate things or clarify but there isn't anything more important than your health so I make sure to ask anything i need no matter how dumb i feel.
0.861100	I feel like I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I know how to read information given to me by doctors and nurses, and if I need any help, I know who to ask.
0.738900	I feel that as a college graduate with a biomedical degree I'd like to think I'm pretty capable of the above, obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I think my ignorance is in the wording of some things, especially on forms as was mentioned earlier. 
0.844400	I feel confident in obtaining and processing basic medical information for myself. I do not have trouble understanding my doctors. I do not always agree with my doctors,but I am able to understand what they are telling me. 
0.688900	I'd say that I'm moderately good at doing this but this is also due to recently becoming a lot more independent than in the past so I now do all of this stuff on my own. I make sure to ask questions and go to my doctors regularly and consistently so I can stay on top of my healthy and learn to live a healthy life. The thing that's hardest for me is healthy insurance because there are so many variances based on the type of doctor I see and what's covered and what isn't but that is a learning trend not associated with my health information directly.
0.916700	That stuff is pretty easy to understand and I make sure to ask my doctors or nurses everything I'm unsure about.  After I leave the office, like when I'm reading about any prescriptions, if there's anything I need help with, I just search for more information online.  I have no trouble understanding it.
0.766700	I am not afraid to ask questions when I'm uncertain about a medical situation so while I may not understand right away, I will get answers. In addition to asking a medical professional, I go to as many resources as I can to find out about the condition. That said, I would say I'm slightly above average in terms of understanding basic health information.
0.811100	I feel I am capable to read and understand health informaton and if I cant understand the health information I can ask my husband doctor or pharmacist to help me understand the situation at hand. 
0.872200	I believe I have a higher capacity to get and understand basic health information and services because I have a degree in Health Information Management and I have worked in the medical insurance and billing fields for several years.  Some of the information can be hard to comprehend when dealing with foreign accents or the complexity of the issue, but can normally be understood after asking additional questions.
0.916700	I feel I can obtain and understand all basic health information and services needed. I can make my own decisions about healthcare services, and sometimes it is not what the doctor recommends.
0.650000	I feel like things can be complicated on papers and forms, it can be hard for me to understand. I've come to realize that sometimes nurses will be able to give you better information than some doctors. 
0.688900	I feel like I understand most of what they are saying but sometimes the terminology they use or their writing is not able to be understood by most people including myself.  They sometimes need clarification.
0.850000	I feel that I have a pretty good ability and capacity for these things. I can understand most of it and if I don't I can find someone who can. Sometimes it is a bit hard to find someone but I make sure that I do. 
0.688900	I would say I can understand the majority of the information given to me by my doctor and do occasionally need further explanations and advice when making a decision. Often times some forms aren't written well or are not as understandable as others and give me a hard time when filling them out. The use of medical jargon also confuses me sometimes when filling out paper work and when my doctor explains my results or condition.
0.838900	I feel like I have a great degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I regularly visit my doctor and they frequently explain any and all tests and treatments, as well as answer every question I have in an easy to understand way. I also know what websites to use for additional information.
0.844400	I feel fairly confident. Sometimes though I don't feel like I have enough of the doctor's time to ask all the questions I want or to receive all the explanations I need. Some things I need repeated because they're complex but I don't always feel like there's time for notes and repetitions.
0.816700	I have a good general knowledge of medical procedures, medications and facts.  However, there are occasionally topics that I'm sure I know something about that I'm wrong on.  Because of this, when I'm interacting with my doctors, nurses and pharmacists I will clarify by repeating what they said to me to make sure. If I'm unsure I'll ask for more information. If I'm not at the office or pharmacy and I'm unsure about info I've called the doctor's office (or pharmacy) and asked for clarification.  Just last week I called the nurse online to help me decide whether or not to take my son to urgent care.  It was very helpful. 
0.588900	I feel that my education which included anatomy, first aid, and a health course perhaps puts me on a slightly higher pedestal than an average person. I know a fair bit of terminology, symptoms, solutions, and of how the body works, but I am by no means an expert. The bureaucratic portion of the forms needed at doctor's offices were done by my guardian until I was 19. Because of this I feel that I have had very little time exposed to them, and as such need extra help usually on one or two sections, never the whole thing however. I feel it is harder to obtain than to process and understand as many doctors are very busy.
0.900000	I think that my skills in getting and processing this information is fairly good or at least as good as the average non-medical expert.
0.916700	I believe I have the full capacity to obtain, process and understand health information and services. I am able to search for information I don't understand or ask to assistance in having it explained to me.
0.838900	I believe overall I can understand what medical professionals tell me about my health. Sometimes though I need to get them to repeat information I didnât fully understand the first time they explained it, especially when a lot of medical terminology is used.
0.827800	I try to think logically when talking with my doctor. I ask myself what information will be most useful when explaining my problem and what I'm expecting to get from the doctor. I make sure to ask questions I have even if some questions might be common sense.
0.916700	It's simple, whether it's the doctor, dentist, therapist, or anyone else, I follow a policy of never agreeing to procedure unless I feel like I completely understand it first. So if they can't answer all my questions satisfyingly, I say no.
0.916700	I believe that I am capable of understanding basic health information. I am a pretty smart individual. If I need help with something, I will just ask. If nobody is available, I will check the internet.
0.866700	If I don't understand something I ask questions about it until I feel that I understand what they're saying. Sometimes they can get rude about it but for the most part doctors and nurses take the time to make me understand. 
0.766700	When I was insured, I generally felt like I did; I could ask my doctor to elaborate about particular health related concerns and follow his advice. Now, though, I can't afford insurance, and I cannot afford to see a doctor in any capacity, so any health information I need has to come from the Internet. I can't get anything from a face-to-face conversation with a medical professional.
0.722200	I recently had surgery and I felt like after every appointment (which were significant, including MRIs, physical therapists, anesthesiologists) I had to Google everything that was told to me. I would forget what I should ask when I was in the room, because I was too busy trying to process what the doctor or nurse was telling me. I know they're busy people but I wish I had more time to process and then ask questions.
0.694400	I feel that I understand basic health information to a pretty good extent. I usually only go to the hospital when it is completely necessary. The only other times I go to the doctor is for my routine check-ups. Things like flus/stomach bugs/general sickness/etc I can handle on my own and do at my house with over the counter drugs. I have a good grasp of what makes my body sick and how to take care of it.
0.827800	I am a fairly intelligent person, becuase of this if I do not understand something, I ask a question.  No shame.  Medicine is not my chosen profession.
0.794400	I feel ok in most instances when it comes to my health and any health related questions I may have.  Generally I ask the upfront questions of my medical care people but then I also rely on research i do myself to fill out that information when I have questions.  It's sometimes frustrating having to wait on test results and, generally, I feel,that's where the communication breaks down between patient & doctor.  Every time I ask 'When will X be ready?'  I get the answer that goes from tomorrow to next week with no definitive time line and that is incredibly frustrating to me.
0.833300	As a nurse I have a good understanding of heath information and this has helped me a lot when ever I have needed to seek help regarding my health. I usually understand what a doctor is telling me regarding any heath problems.
0.844400	I feel like for the most part I can obtain, process and understand information and services related to my health to make decisions. the only thing that would stand in my way is that sometimes there are details that you don't want to share with your doctor, that make you uncomfortable. Also sometimes the doctor makes you feel uncomfortable by asking questions, so it makes it hard to totally understand what they are saying.
0.844400	I have some medical training so I'm able to understand most things.  I don't really have any complicated health issues but even if I did, I think I would be okay.  If not, then I would ask my medical professional.
0.644400	A lot of the time I don't quite understand what doctors and nurses are saying about certain things. When it comes to basic health decisions, I can usually make the decision, but a lot of the time I just want the doctor to tell me what to do. If I'm unable to understand something and the doctor and nurses weren't helpful I usually ask my sister, who is a nurse.
0.900000	I feel that I have the capacity to process and understand basic health information. I choose medical providers that are good at communicating things to me and do not get mad or annoyed when I ask questions. I feel that if I am paying a doctor for medical care, they should be happy to answer my questions.
0.483300	As a type 1 diabetic with a diagnosed learning disability I have spent a great deal of time getting medical documents transcribed to me. Thankfully my wife who is a social worker and deals with medications in her field is always able to help me. 
0.833300	I feel as if I do have the ability to retain information given to me about my medical conditions. I ask frequent questions, and also do research on my own. Any questions that I have I feel completely fine bringing up with my doctors and they are wonderfully helpful. 
0.811100	Somewhat. I generally know where to look and have some decent knowledge of it, but often it seems that the information requires you to already know quite a bit about medicine or human biology to be able to understand it.
0.766700	I think I have the ability to process basic health information. I am not an expert by any means but since I have not had health insurance for 10 years, I've had to rely on my own research top determine my ailments. Apart from that, I've done my own research about medicines and read news about the latest things going on in the science world.
0.738900	I feel like I've usually understood what I've been given. I don't have much experience. Nowadays, my brother's girlfriend is a doctor, so if I had any major questions, I could ask her. 
0.888900	I am fully confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand health information about any condition I have in order to make appropriate health decisions. When I visit my doctor, I always make sure to mention any health problems I'm experiencing. Sometimes, I forget to mention something or ask questions that might be pertinent to my doctor, but recently I've begun writing down talking points I want to mention in the days leading up to my appointment.
0.872200	I feel like I have plenty of ability to process and understand information. I have had some bad experiences with local doctors not giving as much information as they should though.
0.866700	I feel I have full capacity to make health decisions.  Sometimes the only thing that confuses me are questions regarding my health insurance.  Otherwise I have an easy time understanding medical information and directions.

0.916700	I feel confident in my ability to understand the information given to me regarding any medical concerns, issues, etc.  I am also comfortable processing the information regarding any prescription medications. I very infrequently have to call for more information, but when I do I usually do not have any difficulty getting in touch with somebody that can be of assistance.
0.461100	I feel like I do have the capacity to understand. I do feel however that health practitioners don't assess me on an individual level. I have a long history of being medically different,  certain tests and advice are not applicable to me. I have taken medicine that has opposite side effects on me not disclosed on the medicine brochure. Doctors usually don't believe the side effects I explain to have. 
0.761100	As an academic who lives close to a hospital, I feel that I am uniquely fortunate in my ability to obtain, process, and comprehend basic health information because I have research resources at my disposal to help understand concerns and experts to consult nearby.
0.700000	I believe that I do have the ability to obtain process and understand basic information, but sometimes the way it is conveyed is difficult to understand, and they use too many âdoctorâ terms that normal people do not understand.
0.900000	I feel that I have a complete capacity to understand and obtain health information about myself. I have a BS in biology, pre-med. I am not senile and I can read and understand English veryl.
0.850000	I feel capable of understanding the information needed to proceed in any cases. Basic health decisions and stuff like that. If you are in doubt just ask someone so you can take the best option
0.705600	Before going to the doctor, I look up symptoms to give myself a self-diagnosis. Then I will get the doctor's opinion. I am very capable of reading and understanding health forms and information given by my doctor.
0.866700	I feel I am able to obtain and comprehend basic health information and services. My decisions are usually made with my husband so if there is some misunderstanding on my part he helps to clear it up. Otherwise my doctor and nurses are very willing to help.
0.722200	I have a pretty good understanding of the basic health forms given at the doctors. At times, when it comes to insurance mostly, I have trouble figuring out what they mean by what.
0.827800	I feel like I am competent enough to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed. Sometimes I may forget to ask pertinent questions while there. I may look the information up online or contact the doctor's office to obtain any additional information I need or am unsure about. 
0.744400	I find myself more than adequately intelligent to understand most scientific/biological issues, but the problem lies in the paperwork. I'm never certain as to how to fill it out correctly. The only time I go to see a medical professional is in an emergency due to my lack of financial resources, so it's very intimidating to be VERY ill and be slammed with unfamiliar paperwork.
0.616700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, understand and process health information and services to a certain degree.  When they start using heavy medical jargon then I know it's time to get someone to assist me.   It's very important for me to understand what's going on as far as my diagnosis and treatment.  It's not difficult at all to get assistance but it is critical as far as making appropriate health decisions.
0.700000	i feel most timesi have the ability to comprehend and obtain information and services i need but like with anything there is those  situations and instances i do not have to ability to understand and pricess 
0.888900	I believe that I have the ability to understand the basic health information needed to make good health decisions. If I do not understand right away, I can ask questions or look up the information online.
0.866700	I believe I am able to do all of this.  I feel that I am fairly intelligent.  There have been times when I have been reviewing a medical report of mine where I didn't understand the language.  In that case I googled the information or asked my husband to review if the Dr. was not available.  I ask a lot of questions to my doctor in person, so I don't leave a lot to figure out for myself
0.761100	I believe that for the most part I can understand any basic health information so long as it is explained to be correctly. Anything I fail to fully understand I can look up the information myself until I get it correct.
0.561100	It really depends on who is speaking and how they are approaching me. If they are rushing I will miss everything. Sometimes when everything is translated in me it sounds like jargon. Mostly because I am anxious and cant think clearly. 
0.705600	I feel like a lot of doctors don't listen and just brush you off. I understand basic information but if I need more detail, they act like they don't care or have time to explain. I am going to try to get pregnant soon and my OBGYN just brushed me aside when I had concerns about not having a period after being off the pill for 6 months.  That's a big deal! hello???
0.916700	At this point in my life, I believe that I have all the skills that I need to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I believe that having three kids has given me an advantage of being able to understand health information more. I was a stay at home mom for a long time so I was the main parent that was in charge of taking my kids to the doctor and taking care of them. If it's something basic, I know that there are resources online that I can easily access to find quick remedies to certain ailments or injuries. I also know that there are phone numbers that I can easily call for more serious conditions like being poisoned by some kind of liquid or being bit by a poisonous animal.
0.688900	I can understand and maintain most of the basic health information on my own. Although sometimes I need a little more explaining from the doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. If I donât understand things I will usually ask a question
0.766700	I think that I am able to obtain the information that I need the majority of the time. There have been times when I took my daughter to the doctor and they wanted to give her shots and they don't want to explain what they are really giving her. I ask questions and they don't really want to give me a detailed explanation about what is in the shot. I had to look it up on my phone one day because they didn't explain it well enough. 
0.844400	I think I am fully capable of understanding basic health information.  I often think of questions in advance so I remember to ask them. On occasion I think of a question after the fact that I wish I could know the answer to.
0.850000	I feel very strongly that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions
0.866700	I feel that I have an understand to fill out most of the paperwork  what I dont know I always ask for them to explain it to me better so I can understand better
0.711100	I'm confident that I'm able to understand basic or even complex health information provided to me, as well as information regarding health or other services.
0.883300	I feel that I have the capacity to take care of most of my health related stuff on my own but I do wish that doctors would be more precise and explain a lot more about the medication they give me. I understand basic information though, just not when they use very technical words or medicine names. 
0.827800	I feel that I am fairly competent when it comes to understanding basic health information and services. I have had a chronic illness since I was a child and spent several of my teenage years very ill. It took several years for doctors to realize what was wrong with me so I spent a lot of time doing research of my own, asking questions, and learning about my health and my condition. My mother has also had lupus my entire life and as a child I was educated very well on that and how her condition was treated and I often went to the doctor and hospital with her.
0.738900	i feel that I have at least an average capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I've never had a major issue attempting to process said information, and any minor issue has been quickly resolved. 
0.811100	I feel like overall I'm well equipped and capable of obtaining and understanding any basic health information I may encounter. I am a fairly healthy person and rarely visit the doctor, so my exposure has been minimal up until now. However I think I would overall be able to navigate what was thrown at me unless it was some crazy rare condition
0.772200	I think that I am fully equipped to understand my basic health information and services. Especially since I have many medical professionals in my family I can ask. However, how it pertains to insurance is where it becomes very complicated, because things like what is covered and what they pay and so on.
0.722200	I think for the most part I can handle basic health interactions. I rarely have trouble filling out the questionnaires, but I don't always remember questions I have for the doctor until I'm back at home. I think especially when they catch me off guard or there is a problem that is discovered, my mind sometimes blanks and I just don't have time to process that information and think of questions until later.
0.783300	I feel like I have the ability to be informed about my health decisions. If the doctors can't explain it well enough then I can always look it up online.
0.844400	I feel I am able to comprehend what doctors tell me. Although many times I forget some of the details because I always feel rushed. But I am able to look things up on my own.
0.583300	Talking to doctors is almost always beneficial to me. The typically find a way to explain medical terms to me in a simple way using common language. I do not have much of luck when talking to nurces.
0.900000	I'm quite able to ask questions that I might have about my medical needs and understand what is explained.  If there is any other questions that I have, I don't hesitate to ask.  Also when I get have time, I research online the information that I was given and if there is another option, I bring that up with my doctor.
0.794400	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information however my problem is I get extremely nervous at the doctors office. Many times I won't speak up to ask him questions.  I often think of questions after I've left the appointment which I usually look up on Google to find the answers.
0.688900	I am very capable to understand all that is properly explained to me.  I am not that familiar with many medical terms but if they are properly explained, I understand.
0.766700	"I work in the healthcare industry so I feel that I have adequate knowledge on it. I work with patients and with doctors so I am that ""translator"" for patients that may be confused on medical terminology"
0.900000	In general, I feel I have a sufficient capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information, services needed and make appropriate health decisions. I am comfortable in a relative sense in these situations and also do not have a problem seeking out help/resources if needed.
0.872200	I don't have much of a problem understanding medical terms and health information. If it is basic knowledge then I usually understand what my doctor is talking about. I also know more terms from taking college science classes in university. With obtaining the information I have no problem going to my doctor whenever I need questions answered about my health. Like asking why I get a pain in my chest occasionally. My doctor had no problems asking me more questions to be able to find out the cause of my problem. Now when I get that pain I worry less about what underlying illness it could be and now I know how I can get rid of it.
0.844400	I am fairly young still so I don't have a ridiculous amount of pills or supplements that I need to take a day so that is one thing I do not have to worry about. However even at my young age I have spent a good amount of time in a few different hospitals. Two times because of an injury and once because of a personal health problem. I never really had any trouble understanding what exactly I needed to do in order to prevent any further injury. The doctors explained to me clearly what I needed to do and even if I didn't understand something I had no trouble asking them directly what to do.
0.916700	I'm of sound mind, I understand everything that doctors tell me and don't have any problems comprehending any written material I'm given regarding medical conditions. The only problem I might have, and it's new, and a minor one, is trouble reading really tiny print that you might find on medication bottles, or pamphlets, without reading glasses.
0.833300	I have great capacity in obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I think that I am entirely capable in taking care of myself and communicating to my doctor the things that I need to do to maintain my health and safety. I am confident in my abilities.
0.872200	I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and make appropriate health decisions. I am proficient in reading and writing in English and feel I am of high intelligence. I do, however, feel nervous often in medical settings and sometimes avoid asking additional or clarifying questions regarding the information I am receiving. 
0.816700	Although I do not have a background in health, I feel that have the capacity to fill out health forms, understand health conditions, and process basic health information.  Generally I know enough from the outset, but when I don't am comfortable asking my physician questions, and I think I have a good grasp of the sources that I can trust online.  It's rare that I can't find a good answer to a pertinent health question on the internet.
0.872200	I have never had a serious issue filling out medical paperwork or dealing with medical staff when I needed information. I don't always think of every relevant question when I'm at a doctor's visit, but if I do have questions after an appointment it is never a problem to phone my doctor's office and ask one of the nurses or have the doctor give me a call back. We also have access to an online interface for asking questions and viewing test results, etc.
0.677800	I feel that I understand most of the information and forms that are required of me. I take the time to understand what information is needed and anything that they need to know about me, my conditions or any issues. I have a state of mind of getting a task done and filling out any health information.
0.916700	I am literate and highly educated.  I am able to obtain and comprehend basic health information and services needed to make my own health decisions.  
0.866700	i think i have the capacity to obtain,process,and understand heath information because i will ask a doctor or a nurse, or i will check online for any information i might need to make appropriate health decisions  for myself or any family members.i have not had any problem understand health information in the past. 
0.777800	I feel that I am intelligent enough to understand enough about health information and services needed to make decisions related to my health. It is things like health insurance that I struggle understanding completely. Sometimes I don't think of proper questions to ask when I'm in the room with my doctor -- it's once I actually leave the room and think about it more that I have additional comments or concerns. 
0.900000	Though I am not a doctor or a nurse, I worked in an environment related to medical, and I learned some knowledge by myself, so I am very confident to make appropriate health decisions.
0.866700	I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. When I'm talking to my doctor and don't understand, I ask questions until I do. Alternatively, I do research on my own as well. 
0.650000	I believe that I have the capacity to process the basic information that a doctor or a healthcare professional tells me. I do not think a doctor would just leave you blindly, they would help you understand what is going on. And even if they do not give me all of the information I will still have a decent understanding of what is happening to me. I am no where near educated as a doctor is but I have taken quite a few medical classes, such as medical terminology so I have at least a basic understanding of what I would need to know when a doctor is breaking the information down to me.
0.916700	I feel that I have total capacity to obtain, process and understand any and all health information given to me. I am very capable in making medical decisions for myself and for my children.
0.883300	While I have no specialist knowledge, I an very good at understanding health information.  I come from a family in the medical field so that has helped.  I am also very good with language and have the skills needed to process this information.
0.588900	I believe i have capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions to a moderate extent. I know i can always look up symptoms and remedies for any health concern online and if it appears more severe i can contact my doctor or a healthcare professional to fully understand and take the correct approach to any issues.
0.838900	I am very confident to understand basic health information and services. I have a lot of experience at hospitals and doctor's offices. 
0.900000	I believe I am 100 degrees able to understand, process, and obtain basic health information. I have filled out my own forms for years. And for the last 9 years I have also filled out my children's. I also have my medical office assistant certificate which also helps me. 
0.750000	I feel very confident in my ability to understand most basic health information and services. My doctor is always good about helping me to understand what is said and I try to write down questions I may have before going to the doctor so I remember them.
0.850000	Yes, I can still understand and process all the health information that my doctor or nurse give to me. If there is something I don't understand, I ask. I know how to use my medical and dental websites and all that entails.
0.655600	When i am with the doctor or nurse i ask as many questions as i can. I want to know as much as i can know before i leave their office, because when i get home  it is so hard to find accurate information regarding a medical condition. I can look online but the internet has to much or incorrect information. Asking a friend or family member to help is not always the best information and mostly can be biased i think. It almost like every form needs to have an instruction book to come with it.
0.900000	I completed and passed the courses and tests required in my state to become a licensed vocational nurse.  Since I have completed this course, I have a much better understanding of the medical terminology used by doctors and nurses.  I am also more aware of what questions need to be asked so that any questions that you may have will be answered in a way that you can understand.  Typically, my family prefers me to be there with them during medical visits because of my better understanding of medical terminology.  
0.833300	I feel that I am competent in reading basic health information.  I take an interest in my health so I am fairly versed in general things. 
0.611100	i could like to be very open to every individual so as whenever i will experience a problem, i will have somebody who will be willing to help me. i will stop beaing fearful because it will never give myself courage to ask what i will be needing about understanding my health status.whatever questions i will be having i will be so much free to the nurses and doctors so as to be efficiently helped
0.694400	Both of my parents work in the medical profession and help explain medical terminology if i have a query. I also have google to help explain stuff to me when i'm confused on a certain subject.
0.872200	Iâm your average adult so I think Iâm doing a pretty good job at understand things related to my health and communicating and understanding health professionals. 
0.633300	I think that sometimes I do not know what to ask doctors, nurses, or pharmacists. I do not know what I don't understand sometimes. I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information, but sometimes I think I lack the underlying mechanisms and understandings associated.
0.816700	In general, I feel I have the capacity to obtain and process the info needed to maintain good health.  But I feel like I've had specific instances in my life where I had a medical condition and even after going to more than one doctor, I still didn't know what was wrong or how to solve it and researching things on my own online only added to my confusion.
0.600000	I feel very accomplished in reading or assessing medical instructions it is just sometimes the professional answers are closed off due to they can not admit or deny what i ask since it is something they are not willing to discuss
0.794400	I think that I generally understand what I am told about my health and various health services, but sometimes there is fine print or things that I have some confusion about. Or things that are not written down and just told to me, so I forget. 
0.261100	I feel like there is too much information and too many words. The font is also really small with little space to write. I also hate it when I have to rewrite things that I have already written. Why can't it be easier? 
0.900000	I usually have no issue in understanding things told to me by medical personnel. I studied nursing before becoming a teacher so many terms are still identifiable to me. If I don't understand I have no problem asking questions until I fully understand.
0.744400	I feel like I do, but I get nervous when I talk to a doctor or nurse. When that happens, especially if they tell me that something is wrong, I get flustered and forget to ask what it is and all the questions. Then when i call I cant get them or they wont answer questions becuase they are too busy.
0.794400	I believe that i have the ability to get all of the info i need about medical conditions from by doctors, and nurses, and also the interenet is something i can use, and take adnvatage of in order to make sure i have al the information that i need about any medical visit
0.872200	I am highly literate and not unknowledgable. I usually never have a problem asking questions relevant to my situation or understanding what is being explained to me.
0.916700	I know where to obtain basic health care information and services. This includes forms and documents. I know how to fill out the forms on my own and understand what information the forms are requesting without receiving any help. I'm able to understand forms and documents that provide basic health information and services in order to make informed health decisions that are appropriate for me.
0.916700	I am confident in my abilities to understand what has been given to me to read and know how to obtain additional information if needed. I also do not hesitate to monitor my own lab values and to ask any health-related questions to which I feel I require additional information.
0.716700	I believe that I have the capacity to understand the majority of things given to me. If not, then I have family that would assist or even looking online for more information. What I find to be confusing is at times, one can get different recommendations or advice from the health field, as in getting a second opinion, etc. I do my best in making healthy choices in my life though.
0.827800	I think I am extremely competent to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I usually have no problem understanding what doctors and nurses are explaining to me and if I don't I will ask questions to make sure that I have a full understanding.
0.772200	I believe I have the capacity to understand and complete medical paperwork. Sometimes it is hard to understand what the doctor is trying to tell you because at times it seems like they don't actually listen to all you. Lots of time I'll tell my doctor that have certain symptoms for a certain amount of time then the doctor turns around and says something to make me think he did not listen to me. There are times that he can tell me things and I have no idea what he is talking about because he is using medical terms that I'm not familiar with. Example, I had a full panel blood test and when the results came back in a nurse called to tell me that everything was normal but I had no idea what exactly they are testing for and what it means now that the results were normal. 
0.916700	I know how to analyze data properly. Also its very basic just listening skills not really much to explain there, so not sure what you are looking for with this. 
0.916700	I feel I have a great understanding of what I need to make good health decisions. I don't get shy or nervous about asking questions when I feel I don't understand something. Part of a doctors job is to educate and explain things that you may not understand or fully grasp.
0.661100	I really like my Dr so getting the information I need is pretty easy.  The issue is sometimes remembering everything that was said.  He does give me the results of blood test so that helps. Remembering why and the importance of what he said is the issue.  I can always call the nurse however at any time and get a brief run down on the visit too if needed.  I feel like my Dr knowledge is what helps me make appropriate health decisions.  Plus he breaks it down pretty good.  
0.916700	I understand my medical conditions and have done a lot of research on health issues.  I do research before I even go to a doctor if it seems a new health issue has popped up.  I have also studied medical information and terminology to help out my parents with their medical conditions.  I try to be as informed as possible before any doctor visit.  I have always been able to absorb and understand medical information easily.
0.866700	I feel I am capable to obtain the information I need to make my health decisions the majority of the time.  My mother was a nurse so I was exposed to medical terms at an early age.  I am also a college graduate, English is my native language and i read and comprehend well.
0.916700	Having come from a family that is involved in the medical profession, I know that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.872200	I feel that there is sufficient explanation and help sources when it comes to understanding basic health information. The key really is keep it simple. Avoid big medical terms. I will check the internet also before making a decision.
0.822200	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand my basic health information. I do utilize the internet to look up questions I may have about symptoms and diagnosis. I will also ask my doctors if I do not understand or if I have more questions. Also, I ask my doctors so I can confirm what I have read online.
0.850000	I consider myself above average when it comes to understanding basic health information. I can read and comprehend, and have no qualms about asking for additional clarification when needed.
0.900000	I feel that the doctors and nurses do a fine job helping me understand, obtain and process my health information. Health care coverage is completely confusing (even for the people providing the coverage), but the actual information and services are always more than sufficient for me to make decisions.
0.855600	I believe I can find most information on the internet. I think I can also ask for a second opinion from a professional if need be. I have had documents mailed to my house that explained my coverage very well. 
0.744400	I am able to process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions without difficulty. My problem is, I am hard of hearing and have trouble collecting all the information the doctor provides. I always take my spouse to my appointments so she can later relay any of the things I may have missed.
0.888900	Pretty well. If the doctor tells me something i make sure to keep it in my mind or even write it down. Health is not something to joke about and i have any questions i'm sure to tell him. But overall i understand why i need to take something or do somethin.
0.744400	I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions based on my own health curiosity and a detailed family tree of health issues. 
0.916700	I have the appropriate knowledge regarding my past health to be able to fill out any and all forms presented to me before and after any appointments. Should I ever have any questions, i do not hesitate to reach out to a nurse for assistance if there is any confusion. 
0.633300	I believe that I understand most of what the doctor is saying but when it comes to results of blood work or test like the MRI or Cat Scan there is little to no explanation given. I usually have to do additional research online to try and correlate the issues that I have with the test results that are given. The doctor most times comes in and seems rushed. By the time you are on the table, undressed and being poked you have forgotten all the important information that you need to obtain in specific. I have access to my records online so it helps a bit to review and then try to process the information. However, there is much that I do not understand and wish I had more assistance.
0.883300	I have the capacity  to understand this information and services on my own.  An example of a rare time when I would need help would be if I were in the hospital with a high fever or head injury that confuses me.  I would say that I am almost 100 percent capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding the given information alone.
0.916700	I like to think that I am easily able to comprehend a doctors diagnosis. If there was any obvious question that jumps out to me, I always ask it. If anything is unclear I will be sure to have any advice/instruction clarified. On the off chance that I think of a question afterwords, I can usually read up on the subject to gain further understanding. My wife is very often with me and behaves similarly. If I was in a position that I could not fill out paperwork, I am sure she could handle the task.  Lets hope that doesn't happen though.
0.900000	I usually find it not too difficult to understand medical terminology.  Thus I don't have a problem with understanding what is being told to me in medical situations.
0.844400	I'm no medical professional, but so far, I've never had to fill out more than basic forms, so I rarely need help with anything.  The only sticking point I've ever had was trying to remember the name of an antibiotic that I've taken before (I didn't know that there was more than one at the time).  When I did find out the name, I couldn't spell it.  Luckily, there was a co-worker with me who studied pharmacy and spelled it without a problem. For the most part, I don't have any problems, though.
0.527800	I would say that I do have a pretty decent understanding once something is explained to me. But if I have to make a decision without any knowledge of the subject I struggle. Health insurance especially is very difficult for me to understand.
0.794400	I can get easily overwhelmed with new information at appointments. I often forget to ask questions during appointments, and think of them later. This makes it difficult for me to make decisions when I am asked to make decisions while AT the appointment. Also, I don't always know that I am not being offered all possible options when being given options, and I don't always think to ask if I am being given all possible options. I think I have too much trust in my providers to actually do that. 
0.916700	I feel extremely capable of coming up with good questions, asking those questions, doing independent research, and understanding information I receive in order to make good health decisions for myself.
0.694400	I think I can understand basic health information. I probably can process health information if it is not too complicated, I ask the right questions, and the health provider is willing to give me thorough answers. Obtaining health information is something I can do by researching online, but obtaining health information from a doctor would be difficult without health insurance coverage.
0.883300	I believe I have a very thorough and deep capacity to obtain, process, and properly react to medical information. First, I rarely have difficulty making some connection with the medical professional (or professionals) with whom I am working. So, I can usually formulate a question in such a way as to permit the professional to make an intelligible, intelligent answer. Second, I believe that the internet and other library sources have material which can aid me in understanding medical situations (yes, there is also much misinformation out there, but there are also reliable sources).
0.838900	 I feel that I have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, probably better than average. I say this because I do have a scientific background and enjoy reading and learning about diseases and medical conditions, so if I am told something I don't completely understand, I feel capable of doing the research and filling in any gaps in my understanding. I will also ask a doctor or nurse to clarify what they tell me if something is unclear to me.
0.883300	I'm an educated woman, and intelligent, so I have a good grasp of basic health and medicine issues and the ability to understand a doctor's explanations.
0.705600	I believe my understanding of the English language helps me to understand most forms. If I do receive information that I cannot clearly comprehend then I ask the assistance of friends and family who work in the medical field to make sure I can get the language in a more simple form. Luckily most of the medical forms I have had to fill out are made so that people can for the most part understand them. I am usually 85 percent confident that I can fill out and understand most forms
0.916700	I think I have a great capacity to understand basic health information and make appropriate decisions. If I do not understand something I am not shy about asking my provider to explain it in a different way. I am very apt to ask questions or to clarify when things are not clear to me. I also have the internet to look up things I am not so sure about.
0.727800	I think that for the most part I'm comfortable with making health decisions. I'm wary of doctors and I think people give them too much credit in their ability to diagnose people and prescribe the right medications. Mostly I like to have raw test results and with that I can research on my own and try to understand how to reverse engineer a physical problem I'm having and why it occurred. The body is very mechanical in nature and as such, most problem arises for very good reason. We're a product of evolution so it's best to look at our distant ancestors for clues on how to live healthily and without ailment.
0.733300	With all the changes that occur on a daily basis, I think it is not realistic to expect the public to keep up with what is right or appropriate when it comes to medicine.  I believe I can process the basic information but I know that to do things correctly, the basics do not always take care of everything that we need to know.  Obtaining the right information, now thanks to the internet, is easy to get you just have to make sure that the sites that you go to are reputable. 
0.661100	i believe that i can comprehend most of the medical documents i only have a problem when they require signatures and also when they use medical terminology to describe things that could be put simply. 
0.827800	I feel like I am mostly able to understand basic health information that is given to me. I occasionally feel too intimidated or uncomfortable to ask my doctor certain questions about my health, depending on the provider and the situation. Besides that, I am usually able to obtain the information that I need about my health.
0.866700	I think I have a good capacity to ensure I can understand the information, provide input to my healthcare professionals, and ask the questions I need to in order to make decisions and follow directions when needed. I often have a list of information when I go in, questions I want answered, and other ideas prior to walking in and try not to walk out without feeling comfortable with what I've learned.
0.588900	I think I obtain at least somewhat of a basic understanding of the health information that was provided to me. I wish there was more explaining however, because they are times where I do not understand what is going on in some aspects of the application.
0.633300	Health information is very hard to understand and needs to be simplified. They have to remember doctors are not the ones reading the information. Its the patient.
0.916700	This may sound a bit pompous, but I have a fairly easy time understanding health information for two reason. First, I work in healthcare. I have worked in healthcare for 12 years. I'm also just smart. (See? Sounds conceited, but I don't mean it that way.) I am the one that every one of my family and friends come to for medical help or advice. 
0.855600	I have all the knowledge I need.  If there is something I am unsure about I have the resources available to me as I work in the health field.
0.655600	sometimes it gets tough to cooperate when ready books before going to bed. I need lots of light and a activity around me.
0.916700	I am adept at reading medical reports. I remember all the medicines that I take and their dosages.If I don't understand something, I can usually ask a receptionist or a curse. I am fully versed in all my diagnoses.
0.900000	I feel that, within myself, I have more than adequate capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services I need to make appropriate health decisions. Whether or not the information and services are actually available and of a quality that will help is another matter.
0.838900	I have a biology background and a little bit of hospital lab experience.   I feel like this gives me an above average ability to process and understand what doctors are saying and to research.  I will still ask questions though if there is any doubt.
0.872200	I feel like I have a decent enough grasp of medical terminology and my health conditions that I can make good decisions by myself in consultation with my medical team. I rarely ask for help understanding medical information given to me or filling out forms.
0.850000	I feel that I can make my own decisions up to certain appoint, until I might possibly receive some bad news about my health, then I will turn to my husband to help me make those difficult decisions as to where we go from there. 
0.855600	I feel very confident in my ability to read and understand medical info presented for laypeople. There's a lot of information available in a lot of places and I can usually tell the wheat from the chaff, and when I'm talking to professionals, I know enough to understand or ask about what I do not. 
0.672200	I can understand basic health information. Only what I do is have a reading of my blood pressure or oxygen. Then I will ask a nurse questions about my reading. What was my reading for my high blood pressure? Is that good or bad? I will ask if my oxygen level is go or not. If it is a little low I will ask what causes it to be low. I try to learn what is good and bad about my health. I also try to learn as much as I can online by looking what I am curious online.
0.844400	I feel that I have a basic understanding of health information.  I am well read and and always seek out more information to give me a better understanding of things.
0.644400	I believe I have the understanding to make basic health decisions. However, in the cases where there are specific issues (such as dermatology), they quickly explain the condition you are facing and prescribe some medications (trial and error). Often times, they expect you to remember everything they say in the office. In the slight chance they write something down, it is often only a few words.
0.866700	I make lists of symptoms I have when I'm not feeling well as well as a list of questions to ask the doctor or nurse. Very rarely am I unprepared going into an appointment for an ailment or sickness. Today with the internet makes it really easy to prepare as well. You can practically diagnose yourself and also make a list of possible problems to speak to a doctor about.
0.527800	I FEEL SOMEWHAT LIKELY REGARDING THE CAPACITY TO OBTAIN ,PROCESS, AND UNDERSTAND BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICES NEEDED TO MAKE APPROPRIATE HEALTH DECISIONS.
0.888900	In my experience all of the health care professionals I've worked with have done a very good job explaining any relevant information to me, and given me whatever choices are appropriate to my situation. I also have a degree in Biology that maybe helps me further understand some of the general information presented to me about health and anatomy. 
0.883300	I ask questions and read the information I'm given.  I have also talked to friends or relatives that have had the same or similar problems.  I had 1 minor and 3 major surgeries and lot's of tests last year.
0.916700	I have had an interest in medicine since childhood, having grown up in my father's pharmacy.  I am the gatekeeper and knowledge authority for my family's healhcare and am fully informed on all their medical conditions.  I have a kong0-standing open relationship with my primary care physician and the specialists I see.  I have also been the primary caregiver for my mother when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and advocated aggressively for her care.
0.633300	I feel like a have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I say this because besides medical professionals explaining things verbally, they can also give you information/papers to take home. There is also a plethora of information available to those who need to look up information online, given that the people looking up things online does take their research as a self-diagnosis.
0.772200	I feel I am pretty competent at being able to understand basic health information. There are times where I run into things that i don't quite understand how they work or why the doctor has to do them. I think I can feel out a health form pretty well though. 
0.883300	pretty much completely. Prescription drug information that is written by the manufacture is needlessly complicated as well and the info about clinical trials though.
0.838900	I feel confident that I am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  If I have questions, I could speak with my doctor or nursing staff to find answers.  If the answers were too technical, I would feel comfortable asking for clarification.
0.916700	I feel I am 100% confident in my health information and choices that I make.  I am in good health and hopefully I will remain that way for awhile.
0.788900	I think depending on the person explaining things, I can grasp the concept. And when I need more information I will ask for more.  I don't feel confident that I know the right questions to ask though.
0.855600	I think I can understand health information well enough to make health decisions. I am familiar with making health decisions for myself and my kids.
0.777800	Depending on which people I interact with I am mostly capable of doing this. There have been certain doctors and nurses I have run into that do not listen, do not believe what you say, and act like it is beneath therm to explain things to you that you do not understand
0.766700	I used to work as a nurse, but it has been many years and a lot of health related treatments and information has changed since then. Many times I can research a topic online before visiting my doctor to find out questions I may need to ask. Often I find that times have changed and new information is available that I didn't know about.
0.916700	I believe I could interpret just about any health information given to me on my own and take actions based on my understanding and comprehension. I think if I had trouble understanding any of it, I would be able to ask appropriate questions of a provider and get answers I could use to understand it better.
0.916700	I feel I'm at full capacity to understand and comprehend any medical information provided to me.  I've had 100s of appointments throughout my lifetime with little to no misunderstandings.
0.750000	I can usually comprehend and understand most of what a doctor or nurse says. I try to have them repeat anything I don't understand. A few instances, I did not accept their evaluations or diagnoses.
0.688900	I think that what I would really need is a friend to help me.  I would probably have to repeat things back to the provider.  I'm not fully skilled.
0.677800	I believe I have a very good grasp on obtaining and understanding medical materials regarding my own health, whether I need help with it sometimes or not. In addition to having people around who could help me, I feel rather comfortable asking my doctor for help and if I still need help, I'll either research online or ask others.
0.655600	I think I am a pretty intelligent person and I can usually infer what people are trying to communicate with me. Sometimes the technical words confuse me a bit.
0.711100	I believe that I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel that in most situations the information is easy for me to understand. There have been times when I needed more clarity on forms and medical terms or diagnosis. The times when I needed clarity I usually turn to the internet first before I turn to a doctor or nurse to get the information I need to make it more understandable. Getting a hold of a doctor or nurse on the phone usually is a long process that I like to avoid. I like to get my information rapidly and not have to wait for a call back from a doctor or nurse. I think in my case it really helps that I took courses in college dealing with anatomy and physiology and disease. This makes it far easier for me to understand the information the doctor is telling me. I know in my own family there is often a lot of confusion over understanding health information. So I think it is a matter of having had exposure to certain terms and subjects in healthcare.  
0.816700	I have experience in some areas of health because in college I participated in health studies and read a lot of literature.Nowadays is easier to get new information about a specific health-related topic on the internet. 
0.866700	I feel pretty confident in myself. I am pretty young for an adult still, but I believe I am pretty competent and confident enough to understand what needs to be done pertaining to my doctor and my health.
0.816700	I often have to ask a few questions for clarification but generally understand everything ,my Dr. tells me. This includes written information and pamplets as well. I have also done online research regarding my lung disease to gain a better understanding overall. Generally my Dr. is very good about explaining things and answering questions I may have so I leave her office fully informed. If anything at times she is redundant and repetitive.
0.711100	I feel like I have good understanding of how to make an appropriate health decisions. I feel confident that I understand the basic process of obtaining the information I need to understand the health information and services.
0.900000	I feel confident when I go into a doctors office that I will get as much clarity as is possible from a provider. My mother and sister are doctors and I am an occupational therapist, so I took several years of physiology, anatomy, neuro, etc.
0.855600	Even though I don't have a medical (or even remotely Science) background, I believe that I understand basic information and services to make suitable health decisions. The only time this gets confusing is when there is something new/totally unfamiliar.
0.605600	I think I can understand and process a lot of the information given to me by health professionals, but sometimes I need to get an extra opinion to maybe help explain it further to me. I also like to talk things out and I could have missed something so it's always good to have someone else look at the information and try to explain it to you.
0.666700	I believe that I am very capable of understanding my health information and services. I am able to make appropriate health decisions. I would prefer to have a second opinion or confirmation from someone I trust if possible, just to be sure that I understand correctly. 
0.861100	I believe I have a high degree of capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am able to read, discern, and listen to the information that is being provided to me by my doctors. Additionally, if I don't understand something I will tell my doctors my concerns and listen to their opinion in order to make the best decision.I would also read about it using reliable sources.
0.844400	I feel that I have the capacity to understand the information that my doctor gives me. I also have the capacity to fill out medical forms.
0.888900	I feel very capable regarding all health related information. I do have a degree in Nursing, so that gives me a great advantage. There are still things that I have questions on at times, or do not understand.
0.844400	I feel like I can understand the services and basic health information without any issues. My reading comprehension has always been pretty high, so I've never needed any assistance. 
0.766700	I feel that I have a good grasp on the basics of how the human body works. As long as it pertains to one of the systems, IE respiratory, circulatory, it is fairly easy to understand. When the illness in question gets deeper than that, to the smaller functions of the body, is when it becomes difficult to understand.
0.677800	I sometimes feel I don't understand the terms and descriptions that the nurse/doctors are telling me.  A lot of times I get off the phone or get home and feel confused about the information I have been given.  I end up thinking of numerous additional questions I should have asked.
0.750000	"I am very bad at talking to my doctors because a I often don't want to ""make a fuss"" or I just assume that there isn't really anything they can do so I let it go. "
0.883300	I am in the medical field so I have indepth knowledge about medicine. Because of this most of my professional that I see speak to me as equal and not dumb it down. 
0.916700	I feel I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself.  And if there is something I don't understand or am not clear on, I can either ask or get answers from a different source.  
0.705600	I feel as thought sometimes I understand the information 100% and other times I feel completely lost. When I feel as thought I understand everything that the doctor and nurses are telling me, it's because I did my own research before I even stepped foot into the doctors office. When I'm told something I know nothing about, it's hard for me to understand completely because I know nothing about the medical field.
0.866700	well I know abit about the terms and all that from biology and medical classes in school, so I know a bit about what they are talking about even if its in latin. figuring out all the insurance stuff is actually the biggest hassle i've had 
0.916700	I am very capable of answering the questions that the medical doctors ask me. I am able to process what they say, and if I do not I'm not afraid to ask them questions. 
0.650000	I feel that I have a good capacity to understand health information and services with someone assisting me.  I think that it is always good to have someone look things over and help you through the way.  There is so much to consider and such complexity that I like guidance through someone who can help me clearly understand.  
0.694400	I usually understand everything that is in a medical document that I must review, understand and sign. However, occasionally I am in a situation (such as when I was diagnosed with prostate cancer where I did not totally understand some of the information I read or that was explained to me by the physician). In cases like these sometimes my wife does a better job of explaining the issue to me in clear terms that I understand. However, in general I usually am able to comprehend everything that is being discussed with me in the doctor's office.
0.655600	When I have an issue I always try to do a lot of research. When speaking with a doctor sometimes it is more complicated to understand. I sometimes feel a little insure when trying to be so accurate about the information everyone needs to help diagnose.
0.883300	I feel i am above average in my understanding of health care and health care related issues, also i have a decent understanding of some basic biology which makes understanding a lot of issues more intuitive. I like to ask pertinent questions and try to challenge the doctor when i am experiencing an illness, and usually by the time i am talking to a doctor i have a list of questions i have derived from my own research before the appointment, many times my guess to the diagnosis proves to match that of the doctor. Sometimes even when the doctor disagrees and offers his own diagnosis in the end my guess proves to be correct after some trial and error.  
0.800000	It it not the hard nowadays to understand medical advice or diagnosis. This is due to th wide ranging information available on the internet
0.900000	I feel VERY confident that i am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am not yet of the age that any dementia has set in and I feel i have full mental capacity to obtain and process that information
0.855600	I AM CONFIDENT IN MY ABILITIES TO UNDERSTAND BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION. I AM 48 YEARS OLD AND HAVE HAD NOT ONLY MY OWN EXPERIENCES OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS BUT ALSO ABOUT 20 YEARS OF DEALING WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CONCERNING MY 3 CHILDREN.
0.738900	I think I'm a capable person when I go to the doctor.  When I have questions I follow up with whoever I can.
0.816700	I believe I do have the capacity to effectively obtain, process and understand basic health information. I believe I can make appropriate health decisions with my own knowledge supplemented by the knowledge of healthcare professionals whom I consult with. I am confident that far more often than not, I can come to the best possible decisions regarding my health when using an approach that adequately takes into account all information and data that I have.
0.916700	I feel completely capable of understanding basic health information, and I'm confident in my ability to make appropriate health decisions.  Health is my hobby.  I have spent countless hours reading information from a wide range of sources, from blogs to medical journals, to better understand my body and how it operates.  In terms of literature from medical professionals, I've never had a problem with it.
0.883300	I feel that I can get basic health information when needed.  When I go to the doctor, I make sure to have all my questions and concerns written down so I do not forget them.  If there are any issues with medical forms, I am sure to ask a secretary for that information.  
0.916700	I feel very confident of being able to fill out and understand basic health information forms and other things.  I am a pretty smart person and my health is very important to me.  If I need any help I can ask and get the help I need.  
0.816700	Plenty and what i don't know i would ask the appropriate people to help me out with it. Doctor, nurse etc. I feel confident though that i could do it on my own as i already have access to my health information through my drs. portal.
0.694400	I think that I am cable and understand basic health information and services. If I need help with anything I try to look online and then ask a professional for their opinion.
0.733300	 While I have some familiarity with medical terms from working in a hospital while going to college that was many years ago. Some of the new diagnostic terms are new to me and I must have them explained by a health worker or doctor. In particular tests present a challenge when I try to interpret the results. If a battery of tests are given to me I need an explanation, not just of the normal parameters but, of how the results as a whole relate to my health. I have very little difficulty taking my meds as directed but sometimes, if I miss a dose or take too much, I must call my medical practitioner for assistance as to what to do next. 
0.744400	I feel like I am able to adequately obtain, process and understand basic health information.   Often I need to research these things but I am good at using things like the internet to research and filter the good information from the bad so even if I need to look at mutiple sources I am usually able to find a source that makes things easy to understand.
0.833300	I worked in a medical related field. Usually, i understand the terminology used by doctors or nurse. If i don't understand then i don't hesitate to ask them. Its my body i have to take care of it. If i still don't understand then i ask my closed friends or relatives. Most of them are in the medical field. For whatever reason i still need more explanation then i search on web and read about it, understand it and then make educated decison. Sometimes it does happend that i can't read doctors handwriting then i call their office and clarify it with their nursing staff, usually they are very helpful. 
0.900000	I feel I am more than capable to understand the information my doctor's give me as well as the ability to seek out any additional information I may want or need. if u don't fully understand anything I am confident that if u ask my doctor's will have answers for me.
0.816700	Regarding all the questions I just answered, to what degree do you feel i have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is basically enough understanding some situations can be harder to process
0.688900	I believe that I have enough knowledge to answer my basic health questions. If I go to the doctor and it is for something that could be serious or something that is complicated that I might have a hard time understanding, I usually take my mother with me because she is a retired nurse and she can help ask questions to the doctor that I might not think of or know to ask.
0.661100	I feel fairly capable of understanding basic health information. When that information goes beyond the basics it is a different story. Anything I am still confused about I will usually search for online.
0.777800	I know I have the ability to process and understand basic health information because I have a degree in Biology, so I've taken some classes that help with that. However, it's still hard to fully know what choice to make on some health decisions or what some things mean. I would say I have an above average ability but some people are significantly better at it.
0.900000	I absolutely have the capacity to make my own health decisions. I'm very familiar with medicine and healthcare and am very comfortable understanding jargon and no problems with the settings. Even if I wasn't, I'm well educated and more than equipped with handling what comes my way, including managing and understanding health information.
0.900000	I feel extremely confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information about my personal health, as well as services available to me. When I visit a doctor I make sure that all my questions are thoroughly answered and that I understand them before I leave. I also understand completely how to request visits for services, as well as fill out any information that may be needed. I also understand the importance of providing the most up to date and honest information in regards to my personal health, to the best of my knowledge, to my physician.
0.650000	Sometimes I feel the need to research information outside of what the nurse or doctor provides. They're not always thorough when they explain conditions or health concerns. They're especially vague about medications. I don't feel it is enough to just explain how and when to take medication. I should be thoroughly informed of possible side effects before it is prescribed. Once a medication is prescribed the doctor always seems reluctant to change the prescription regardless of the side effects. Many times I have to choose between continuing a medication that has terrible effects and is sometimes ineffective to treat a condition or discontinuing it altogether. When that happens the doctor thinks I am simply not following their recommendation when it is really due to bad side effects that I cannot live with. I am capable of understanding and following the doctor's instructions but sometimes they don't understand why I am unable to continue with their recommendations.
0.816700	Getting and understanding the information is the easy part. Having the money to pay for the services is the hard part. I usually understand what I'm being told without asking a lot of questions. That's just me though: way back in high school, my biology teacher asked me if I learned by osmosis because I did well in class but never asked questions.
0.872200	I'm pretty insistent on getting questions answered. On the other hand, I have found doctors and nurses to be kind of vague sometimes and rushed. So on my end, I'm pretty confident in my ability to ask the right questions, but not always confident that I will get clear, decisive answers. 
0.816700	I am 41 years old, and also a parent to 2 children.  I have had to take myself and my children to the doctor many times, so I feel confident in understanding basic health information.  On top of that, I lost my mother to cancer, and have since had to accompany my father if necessary to some of his appointments.  My brother is a nurse, so sometimes I ask him for medical advice.  If I am not sure I ask our doctor to clarify anything I may not understand.
0.700000	I have been able to make good choices so far in life.  I expect that I will continue to make good choices.  If I doubt myself, that's typically when I ask for someone else's opinion.  If I do not understand something, I typically would call my doctor for advice, or use the internet to expand my knowledge on certain subjects.
0.827800	I think my abilities are pretty adequate in regards to this scenario. I have a good vocabulary- and I know a smattering about many medical conditions. However, I am nervous in a medical setting- and just draw a blank on questions I should be asking during the course of an examination, or probable diagnosis.
0.833300	I feel I am 100% capable of understanding, obtaining, and processing basic health information and services. This is because of years of experience handling my own medical information with no help. 
0.816700	Every time I am finding myself interacting with the medical situations I make sure I ask the physician all the necessary questions. I listen carefully and make sure I have things written down. I also make sure to get everything what's needed from the front desk, such as follow-ups or appointments.
0.900000	I am always the one in my family (even with my husband) who goes over the medical information about each family member. I was there every step of the way and made all the decisions when my husband was in and out of the hospital two years ago. I think I have a pretty good understanding of how the health information and services work and how to make the appropriate health decisions for me and my family.
0.738900	I feel like I have a good capacity to understand health information, since I am going into a health field. I sometimes find it difficult to tell doctors everything I planned to
0.811100	I believe that i am more than capable of obtaining and understanding information about conditions that i have had and basic information about medications that i need to take. I have in the past asked for additional information about prescriptions and uses and side effects of them at time
0.611100	i think every time when i visit doctors office i probably understand them about 50% or less, most of the time when i come back home i ask my wife to explain more in details or i start looking online for explanations 
0.872200	Firstly, I am a retired registered nurse so should be able to effectively read and understand medical information.  But, as any patient, I sometime don't want to give all the necessary information to my provider (silly, I know), but it's human.  Sometimes also, because of my medical background, I don't ask questions I want to because I feel the provider thinks I should already know the answer.  I sometimes have to remind the providers that they can't assume I know something about my medical condition because I am a nurse.  There may be new information I don't know or I may have forgotten the information.
0.872200	I feel like I have all the capacity needed to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have not found any situations through any of my medical needs (a couple of surgeries, procedures, and just normal every day needs) when I could not clearly understand the information given to me or get my questions answered. 
0.761100	I think that I need to learn more to understand clearly the medical terms and in that way to have a broader perspective of the diagnosis to evaluate each possibility and obtain more recommendation as far as my health is concerned.
0.722200	At times I have a little bit of brain fog that keeps me from comprehending things immediately. Iâm not sure where this comes from. Usually, if I re-read things a number of times I will comprehend it. It helps if I read with a pencil so I can underline, or make notes. Most doctors visits go ok for me, but if I think it will be an important appointment I will take my wife with me to help me think and ask questions. If I donât bring my wife I often forget everything that was said in the appointment after about five minutes.
0.883300	I have a high degree because I am of sound health of mind and have resources to back me up. I have people close to me who are MDs and know how to find information by myself.
0.661100	Sometimes I struggle with diagnosis and medications given. Sometimes I feel like the medical decision is black and white no gray. They donât give you a chance to explain your side that already have their mind made up about you food intake and weight
0.888900	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions to a great degree. On the rare occasion I don't understand something, even after asking for clarification, I reach out to my mother who is a registered nurse. 
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have access to the information I need and can make informed decisions. Once in awhile I will have a hard time remembering some information I've been given or I'll forget to ask the doctor a question, but it's rare.
0.883300	I feel that while I am not a health expert I do have the ability to listen to what the doctors say and I can understand what I am told so that I am able to understand what I am being told by them.
0.672200	I feel that most of the time I can understand medical information if it is explained to me in broad basic terms that can be understood by a normal non medical person.  If the information is written in complex medical jargon I might need someone who understands it to explain it to me.  Generally when I am at the doctors office generally they will speak in basic terms I will understand them, but If I am presented with some medical terminology then I might ask the doctor or nurse to elaborate.
0.866700	I feel that I am fully capable of both understanding and knowing how and when to ask question so I do.  I work for a hospital so I am very familiar with a lot of the instructions.  I also always make sure I understand as I do not want to have to come back later.
0.838900	Yes, I understand the basic issues. I do know that I may not ask all the right questions. My wife does, though. I feel like I should just deal with things. I know that isn't the best way to handle health issues. But that is why my wife comes with me.
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information because I have a degree in the healthcare field. I also obtain knowledge by asking the important questions of my doctor. I also go a step further to research information provided to gain further understanding. I feel it is important to obtain a doctor that doesn't mind taking the extra time to make sure you understand the information they are providing. 
0.761100	I think there is a lot of information on the internet.  I also know enough people in the medical profession that I can get clarification on anything that I didn't understand.  
0.705600	I usually have little issue understanding most medical information my doctor or medical staff tries to pass on to me. On the occasions I do I have my wife explain everything to me in layman's terms as she is a medical assistant and can generally give me a good enough understanding to be able to launch further research if needed.
0.600000	I have been going to the doctor for my health issues for a while now and I feel I have gotten pretty good at filling out all the proper paper work but I do notice sometimes if I don't right down questions too ask I will become overwhelmed and forget to ask those questions the problem that I find id a lot of doctors and nurses are in such a hurry they make you feel very rushed and it feels like they are not listening to you that is why I always bring someone with me to help me remember everything
0.844400	I feel I have the (mental) capacity to obtain, process an understand medical information presented to me and I possess the ability to ask questions of medical personnel when needed.  Additionally, I have access to medical sources online and I have a niece who is local and is a certified nurse.
0.827800	I feel like I have decent capability to understand health information enough to make decisions about my own health. I try to ask my doctor about terms and diagnoses that I have difficulty understanding and see what he thinks it will mean to my future health decisions. I do research about about my health issues online as well, but mainly to help further understand medical terms and such, not as a primary source of information.
0.711100	I have an issue especially with most doctors hand writing. It's generally not legible. Secondly, medical staff are not always available to answer all the questions I may have. As such, I feel not very sufficiently equipped to understand basic health information.
0.916700	Whenever I speak to a medical practitioner, I generally take notes. In between visits, should a question come up, I write it down and keep it in my medical notebook so that I remember to ask. I am not afraid to ask questions regarding my health, but I feel that sometimes doctors or nurses are so overwhelmed by their duties that they don't give much, or very clear, information. I have no issues retaining the information, it just needs to be given.
0.766700	I feel that I am completely competent because I ask for insight regarding medical terminology that is confusing to me. I think it is important to ask the necessary questions with healthcare providers because they may feel that they are being understood. Thus, when I am in doubt I seek help from nurses, doctors, and pharmacists to provide me with information regarding any health concern. Additionally, my courses in speech and hearing and my medical terminology course have helped me to understand some basic health information. 
0.816700	Iâm pretty confident of being able to do what was described above.  So far my medical issues have been minor and doctors have been able to explain the information to me.  If I ever need to deal for more complex information my father has had plenty of experience.  And I frequently look things up on the internet. 
0.733300	I feel like I have a decent understanding and comprehension of basic health information and services. I have gone to the doctor a handful of times as an adult on my own and thanks to a very helpful reception, I feel very capable of making choices and filling out health forms.
0.916700	I believe that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. My education is in Biomedical Science and I have some insight.
0.655600	I have a great capacity to obtain basic health information. There are many different sources that I can use to get an opinion. I have a good capacity to process and understand basic health information and services, but it could be better. I could ask more questions to have a better understanding but I sometimes do not ask when I should. 
0.850000	I think that most of the information I'm given is fairly easy to understand. If I don't understand something I will ask the Doctor or Nurse to explain it to me as easily as possible.
0.855600	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand issues regarding my basic health. I am able to read and understand documents and instructions given by my doctors. 
0.666700	It depends on the information, I need help understanding it sometimes when there is a emergency my mind just does not process the information and get confused on trhe details of it.
0.588900	I have some capacity  to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Sometimes I feel like i would need some help from others.
0.750000	I don't feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process the health information I need. I always feel rushed at the doctor's office. I get nervous and forget to ask the important questions I should ask. I get my blood taken every 3 months because I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I take medications to control these conditions and both are hereditary based. My understanding is just okay at best. Because it is hereditary and not based on foods I eat, it is difficult to get a full explanation of what I can do differently other than changing my eating habits and daily exercise. I want to know more about my risks and they really don't go into that. 
0.883300	My father was an M.D. as was my maternal grandfather. I was raised to become an M.D. I chose physics. Regardless, I grew up surrounded by medical discussions and spend a great deal of time with health-care professionals and as a consequence am extremely comfortable with them, asking them questions, and challenging them. Obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information to make appropriate health choices is something I'm very comfortable with.
0.688900	I believe that I can understand most information that doctors tell me but sometimes i ask family members who work in health care so they can advise me. I also look up information online and then I make the decisions.
0.700000	I feel like I have a moderate ability to understand things on my own immediately.  But, there are many times that I will have to get on the internet to do the research so that I understand things completely.  I am the type of person that needs to make a list to take with me so I don't forget questions I have, and to list symptoms.  Sometimes though there are too many choices and I feel like I want to do the correct thing, and wonder if I will.  
0.816700	I usually understand everything medical professionals tell me, and I try to do research on the internet before a visit so that I can speak with some degree of knowledge. Still, it's not like I'm a medical professional myself, so I mostly give the symptoms and leave it in the hands of the professionals to decide how to proceed. Results vary from doctor to doctor.
0.866700	I feel confident I have the capacity to understand, obtain and process basic health information and services needed regarding my health decisions.  I am able to focus and retain information and I when I don't understand something, I do not hesitate to ask the provider.
0.850000	I feel very capable. My husband handles all the paperwork for my family, though. So I don't really have any recent intricate experience with that.
0.916700	I have been reading about health my whole life. I am very interested in my health so I try to obtain as much as I can to make sure I stay healthy. When my doctor tells me something I listen to make sure that I stay healthy.
0.661100	I feel that I often have the capacity to understaind and obtain basic health information and services, but sometimes I feel rushed and leave not fully understanding what I need to do or what is going on.
0.644400	I think I have those capacity at least the same level with average people.If there is something I really don't understand even if I ask to the doctor, nurse, or pharmacist, I can ask her/him to write down or spell out so I  check on the internet and will understand most of things and be able to make appropriate health decision.
0.400000	I really never understand most of what the doctor is saying about my condition. I feel really stupid for asking questions about it because when I do ask questions I get the vibe that the doctors think I'm stupid. I sometimes will ask a few questions but by the end I am shaking my head like I fully understand when actually I have no clue. 
0.650000	I feel I have the full ability to understand what ever medical problems I am dealing with. Any traditional diseases that I can come across I have learned about and am pretty sure that I will have the necessary knowledge to know what I'm dealing with
0.722200	Yes, I do think I could understand basic health information and services to make good health decisions. I know at my age now, I would not have a problem at this time. When I advance a little more in years, I might need more help.
0.866700	I feel I can handle basic health information between me and my caregiver or doctor.  What can be confusing is dealing with actual health insurance forms and questions.  Dealing with the health insurance companies can be a real pain sometimes as things are not always in clear cut, understandable terms.  Between me and my doctor, if I don't understand something, I always ask for clarifications.
0.733300	I think I can make appropriate decisions but I have lost faith in the health field as far as being understanding and taking the time to hear you and then fully explain diagnosis. I've had a specialist prescribe me medications with telling me the name of it and cut me off and walked out of the room when I had questions. I have to rely on the internet to get info I need
0.672200	I usually don't have issues getting advice or finding help when I need it. The problem lies within the words used. I have to ask a nurse or a doctor often to get clarification on things. I can some times call a hotline to ask but I prefer in person explanations.
0.883300	I feel I can communicate well with medical staff.  I Don't have problems reading or understanding things, an I make sure I ask questions about anything I don't understand.
0.816700	I feel like I DO have the capacity to get information between asking people and going on the Internet to start of the search for info
0.844400	I do.  I feel confident in my ability to understand what a doctor says to me and also in my ability to research health topics on my own.  I also feel that I have access to people who are more well-informed than I am.  There are several nurses and doctors within my social circle who I could ask for guidance if I needed it.  I do have a slight amount of distrust in the medical community because of my experience giving birth in the hospital versus giving birth at home.  This makes me feel like I need to do a little research on whatever has been told to me by a medical professional.  
0.722200	I have the capacity to understand basic health information but because I have severe anxiety, sometimes I don't catch things the first time they are said or my thoughts are so jumbled I have a hard time asking questions I should ask. 
0.888900	I'm young and don't experience any significant mental impairment that would impede my ability to comprehend information presented to me, health-related or otherwise. I am in fact diagnosed with a mental/psychiatric condition, but it does not impact my capacity in that regard. I have always been able to independently seek out and obtain any necessary health-related services without an issue.
0.705600	Even though I do not pretend to know everything about my health prognosis and course of action, every time I go to the doctor's office I make sure before leaving that I have a minimum understanding of my current overall status, the next course of action and desired results. 
0.761100	I am an intelligent person who unfortunately has had to deal with health issues, info and services for many years. This required me to become a very pro active patient. I keep abreast of everything to do with my health issues and am up to date on everything including medication and treatment options and services available to me.  And when I have a question or concern I consult with my physician or my husband who was in the health care field for 30 years.
0.888900	I believe I have a strong capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and to make decision regarding my own health. I don't have too much trouble processing my health related information that I get from healthcare providers
0.872200	I feel very confident that I can obtain and understand basic health information.  I usually feel comfortable asking the needed questions to better understand my doctor and if there's any suggestions to improve my health.  I am willing to try what my doctor thinks is best, and use whatever resources are available to me.
0.883300	I feel that I have a big ability to fill out required paperwork and if there is room questions about my health. I also feel that I can ask health personnel any questions to clarify anything I need clarification on.
0.633300	I understand somethings that are presented to me but my problem is when they use big words. It's hard to understand some big words in the context they have it in
0.744400	Sometimes I get confused by the jargon and procedures. But in general, I can go to doctors appointment by myself and be fine. I can communicate and get the help I need. And doctors are usually good about explaining the important facts. If there is medicine or procedure I'm not familiar with, even after asking about it, I'll look it up online when I get home. 
0.916700	I am an intelligent person. I am not bragging when I say that. I am able to understand mostly anything that is told to me regarding medical information. If there is something I do not understand, I ask the proper questions until I am fully comfortable that I have received and understand all the information I need to have.
0.811100	I recently went to the doctor's a few days ago, this was my first time going back since I was 18. It's been nearly 6 years since my last visit, and I was given so many forms and documents to fill out, with some ambiguous questions that could mean this-or-that and I didn't want to make a mistake. It was slightly difficult, and kind of nerve-wrecking.
0.616700	When I go to the doctors or hospital, I feel there is a lot of red tape that we usually have to through with paperwork and our insurance information. Our health insurance cards sometimes are not updated in the system or our deductible is not what the card says. If you want to your chart or personal information, you always have ask like it is a big secret. We rely on the healthcare officials to assist us if we have questions.
0.850000	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information. I am an excellent reader and can comprehend most things I read. 
0.538900	Sometimes health questions and health forms are a little hard to understand. I feel as if i can fill out my own forms they are just sometimes hard to understand
0.694400	I feel that I have the knowledge to understand about 75% of what is presented to me by doctors and nurses. They typically ask if I understand but to be honest typically when first presented with complex information it takes me a minute to process it.
0.711100	I'm pretty good at absorbing information, as if my brain were a sponge, especially when it comes to my health or the health of others. I am quite confident that I'd be able to process and understand basic information regarding health because of this care that I have for other people and myself. Therefore, I'm confident that being able to understand this basic health information and services, that I'm also confident I'd be able to make appropriate health decisions.
0.616700	I have really bad anxiety, especially about my health. Unless my husband is in the room with me, or it's something routine like my psychiatrist appointments, I usually forget everything the doctor said right away. I'm always too scared to ask questions. 
0.916700	I think I'm able to process medical info fairly easily. I've had a lot of hospitalizations in my lifetime and I studied bio and psych in college so I can capably read my own cbcs and most of my test results without needing much explanation. 
0.733300	I feel like I am able to handle myself at a clinic appointment.  At times I will need help on where to go and how to schedule folllow ups.
0.533300	I do understand somethings when it comes to the basic health information we receive, but donât really understand some terms they use for explaining what it really is. My wife is some what in that feels so she explains a lot to me.  Based off the little I know and my wife knowledge I feel that I will make the right decisions.
0.900000	I feel confident in my understanding. If there are any times when I am unsure, I do not hesitate to ask.
0.833300	I am certain I have a lot of the information. With the advent of the internet as a resource, I can always google for more information on specific terms. My main concern is what the doctor thinks and what, if anything I should be doing for preventative care. That's just as important as understanding the medicine I've been prescribed.
0.627800	I feel like I somewhat understand basic health information. It really helps when I ask questions and they answer it clearly. There have only been a few times when I truly did not get the help I needed.
0.883300	I am an educated person with no mental deficiencies; at this point I feel capable of getting the information I need. However, I find it very difficult to navigate medical insurance issues, possibly because the industry seems to make it deliberately difficult for the consumer. And I am not confident that I will be able to function in the same way in my old age. 
0.783300	I feel that I am moderately capable of understanding medical things. I do not feel overly confident in my knowledge, but I have always had the ability to ask questions and get clarification if there is something that I am unsure of. I feel like doctors often use big words that are complicated to understand, when in fact it can be simplified in a way that can easily be understood. Often if I do not understand those big words, I will ask them to dumb it down for me. 
0.705600	I understand some of the medical jargon they spit at at me. I know my body and my medical needs. This makes it a bit easier to understand what i need.
0.783300	I think I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. When I dont understand something I utilize resources to help me.
0.866700	I feel very competent in making decisions regarding my basic health services.  I have a chronic disease that requires constant utilization of health services.  I have gained a lot of experience in dealing with my insurance company and the health professionals that treat me.
0.916700	I feel  like I am well educated enough to fully understand everything I need to be able to obtain, process and understand all the basic health information that is provided to me by any medical practitioner that I would potentially visit. 
0.744400	I often re-read the medical forms to be sure I am answering them to the best of my ability but I find myself holding back questions for doctors because I don't feel comfortable in my own abilities in sounding educated. I am in constant pain from fibromyalgia and have had difficulty in finding a doctor that won't just give me some pills for depression and send me on my way. 
0.811100	when ever i go to see the doctor, i ask questions over what i am not clear about and they take their time to explain to me and make me understand everything i need to know. so with that i can make all the decision i need.
0.883300	I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make my own health decisions. In the past I have never had problems concerning such health decisions and am positive that in the future I continue doing the same.
0.816700	"I feel like I have no problems reading, understanding, and processing basic health information provided to me when obtaining medical care/treatment. I'm able to understand and have enough medical background that I don't have many problems at doctor's offices/hospitals.  Pharmaceutical information can be trickier, but it and other complicated medical information which is harder to understand can also be ""googled"" nowadays, which I have confidence in."
0.783300	I feel like I am well-prepared to obtain, process and understand health information. Nothing in particular prevents me from understanding information and I do not mind asking questions if necessary. I don't really need help in this area but am confident I could find someone to assist me if needed.
0.916700	I feel that I have complete control over the health and Medical services I need. I have a primary doctor that I see several times a year and I am completely comfortable asking him any questions I may have concerning my medical condition.
0.827800	I think I have the the capacity to understand basic health information, but sometimes I don't think of the right questions to ask until I'm home and I realize I should have asked more questions while I was there.  Then it's too late and I search the web for information which is maybe not as good as getting information specific to my needs from my doctor.
0.900000	I feel like I can adequately understand health information and necessary services. If I don't understand something I will ask questions.
0.888900	I feel as though I very much have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I understand a lot about my medical conditions and can read and understand information very well. 
0.705600	I think that I am able answer any and all questions but I know I need assistance in understanding some things mostly because I don't know the technical terms but I know what is being spoken about in common English.
0.427800	I know that I have the full capability to understand health information given to me by medical professionals, but I often don't take the time to process it, or ask questions so that I can gain the full understanding.
0.872200	Extremely confident.  I have a basis in A&P/medical in high school/college so i understand most things.  If i don't, my doctor or nurse is always willing to further explain to me.
0.833300	I feel as though I have the capacity, or ability to deal with my basic health information, services, etc. I have been able to do so for most of my adult life, with minimal difficulty. Occasionally, I need a hand understanding something technical, etc, but by and large, I get by just fine. I feel that I have, and will continue to make appropriate decisions regarding my health and well-being.
0.766700	I think that i cam reasonably understand what is being told to me by health care professionals.  My dr is very good about taking time to clearly explain things and make sure that i am understanding what is happening before moving on.  Occasionally if i have questions i need to call back in to talk to a nurse to clarify something but that doesnt happen too often.  I also have a biology degree so i can understand a bit more behind the concepts that he refers to than the average person might.
0.783300	I feel that I have the knowledge, vocabulary to understand basic health information. I might at times need some help with unfamiliar terms but basic stuff is not a problem.
0.838900	I feel I am capable of making correct decisions and understanding what is being told to me.  I also have no problems asking the doctor to elaborate or explain in simpler terms if I do have an issue. 
0.866700	I feel I do a good job asking for clarification on any points that I don't understand when it comes to basic health information. I try to make sure we cover all the bases and want to always do my best to provide a good informed decision when making a health decision. 
0.850000	I feel confident in getting information on most things at my healthcare providers location and over the phone. The biggest complaint that I have is with billing. My bills are never up to date (on their end) and so I never know what is going on.
0.844400	I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information and services.  The challenge comes in when the doctors assume that all is understood and speak/move quickly.  Most of the time I am assertive enough to stop them and ask my questions, but at times I don't even think of the questions until I am out of the office or the doctor has already left the room.  Bedside manner isn't always top notch either. 
0.527800	If your goal is to get a degree without paying for it, itâs highly unlikely youâll be able to do that. However, online sources, schools without walls, and external degree programs are becoming increasingly common, and will only continue to increase in our digital world. Many colleges, even some of the best, offer online courses you can take for free, or, if you pay for them, you can get college credit for taking them. For instance, the University of Massachusetts (Amherst) has a University without Walls program that offers online courses and grants credit for experience. However, youâll need to pay for your credits. Even Harvard offers a number of free (non credential) and paid (credentialed) courses.
0.838900	I think for the most part i understand well.  Sometimes the medical jargon is confusing and sometimes prescriptions are contradicting, but all in all i understand well enough to know what i am being told. 
0.855600	"I believe that I am 95% competent in regards to obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services when needed. I reside with a nurse so most questions I have can be filtered through her.  Anything she is unaware of she can research to gain a broader understanding of the information needed and I go from there. If there is anything that neither of us understand, then the problem is generally past the point of ""basic"" and a specialist needs to intervene.  The only time I ever had issues obtaining and processing information about my health and the services rendered was when I was in labor with my child. To be fair, I was a bit preoccupied with the pain to really understand what was going on around me at the time."
0.916700	I feel like I am competent enough to ask the questions that I have to the medical professionals. If I don't understand the answer I will ask them to explain it better.
0.794400	I feel like I can understand the information given to my by healthcare professionals, however, I still find it nerve-wrecking to ask all the questions that I need.  Sometimes I feel like the physician is in a rush to get to the next patient and thus, I feel like I'm being a burden by asking too many questions.  The physician seems unwilling to truly find out the source of my issues.
0.788900	I feel somewhat confident i have the capacity to obtain,  process and understand basic information and services with regards to making appropriate health decisions due to the access of information provided by internet and other media outlet.
0.872200	I feel I have a good understanding for the most part when it comes to health information and services. I try to ask questions although sometimes I am uncomfortable and do not ask my Dr. them. If I don't ask the Dr. I always go home and look up further information online. I always read the info that the pharmacist gives me and feel pretty competent. 
0.855600	I feel like I have full capacity to grasp and obtain all of the needed information. I also have full ability to research on my own. The thing I struggle with sometimes is trying to absorb all of the information when the doctor is talking to me. If they rattle off a bunch of values from my bloodwork, for instance, sometimes I have trouble remembering what they said an hour later.
0.816700	I think that I am smart enough to grasp most concepts and information I to obtain in regards to me health.  More importantly though I know when to ask questions and seek information I do not know.  That means asking a nurse or a doctor, or seeking the information on-pine. I am not afraid to ask if I do not know.
0.705600	When im not sure about a medical term I go online and i get as much information as i can. Before i would go to a medical appointment without preparation . As soon as i was in front of my doctor i would forget everything. Now i take a notebook write down all the symptoms i have, in addition, i write down all the questions i have. Lastly, I believe my basic knowledge and what i can gather from online and what my doctor tells is what gives me the knowledge to make health decisions for myself.
0.916700	Yes I do believe that I can handle any information that I am given by any medical professional or any professional at this point in my life. I am intelligent and can grasp the content of any discussion.
0.677800	I feel that most of the time i am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information by myself. But sometimes i need the help of a medical assistant to help me.
0.900000	I have the full capacity to understand basic health information because I know how to read the information given to me and compute it as well as answer any health related questions that are needed of me. I also have the ability to ask questions if anything is unclear or confuses me 
0.866700	I feel like I've gone to the doctor enough that I understand how to communicate with them. I've had to present questions before or ask for clarification and I think gotten better at it/gotten more confidence as time goes on.
0.916700	I am smart aware person. I don't have any mental issues that keep me from understanding instructions given to me from a doctor or nurse or any medical professional. I feel like a competent person who can handle anything.
0.838900	I have asthma and over the last 20 years I have learned to be an advocate. I read and learn and when I am with my doctor, I ask very concise and direct questions. I want to know about better medications and any side effects. 
0.916700	I believe that I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding information regarding my health. I have a hearing loss and occasional difficulty understanding professionals with strong accents, but will make sure I have a thorough understanding before leaving the appointment. The internet is also a valuable tool and I have reached out to professionals by phone as needed. 
0.888900	I can understand as well or better than most people what medical conditions or treatments are described by doctors and nurses. I will ask any questions needed to clarify diagnoses, recommendations or treatment options. I have a pretty good understanding of how the human body works and what can go wrong. I do not need any help reading or remembering directions and instructions regarding medical care.
0.805600	I feel like I do have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information and use this to make health decisions. However, I didn't always, and I feel as though the fact that I am constantly reading things online and that I work in the medical field (not clinically, in marketing though) helps me understand a lot of things in a better way.
0.672200	I would begin with educating nurses about using a universal precaution approach. Always use plain language when speaking with patients. Nurses should use plain, jargon-free words when discussing medical information. Individualizing the teaching by using words the patient is familiar with will enhance a patientâs understanding. All patients benefit from the use of plain language. Assess patient's understanding of the information provided.
0.655600	I often have troubles with the doctors information and procedure explanations. I understand about fifty percent of what they tell me. Often a nurse will help me understand. I also go on the internet for more information. 
0.827800	I understand as long as it's explained in layman's language. I tend to think of questions after it's too late to ask them.
0.833300	Since I come from an applied science background (engineering), I feel that I am pretty good at sorting through actual medical literature, research, etc. regarding conditions and their treatment. However, I'm much less confident dealing with the administrative side of medicine and health - finding the best providers, ensuring that all billing and payment go smoothly, etc.
0.883300	I am almost always capable of understanding health information, but when I am not, I quickly resort to my smartphone to research any and all information necessary. I will also be sure to write down any questions I may need to ask.
0.838900	I have very little medical knowledge, but I am able to understand and process what a doctor or nurse tells me as long as they take their time and define medical terms.  When I know I have a procedure coming up, I take a notepad with me to the doctor's office so I can write down the process I need to follow - such as blood testing, pre-admission testing and so forth.
0.916700	I believe that I possesses an adequate ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I don't recall ever needing help understanding this information as an adult. 
0.916700	I feel totally confident in my capability to obtain ,process and understand basic health information.As someone who is highly educated, having obtained a Masters degree , though have never been in the labor force I do think I have the proficiency to the needful.
0.672200	I believe that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, especially when my daughter is with me to help me fill out certain forms and explain certain things to me. I have needed her help many times, especially with documents with small print.
0.916700	I feel like I am capable of understanding and communicating with health professionals about my healthcare.  I also feel confident about making appropriate health decisions for myself.
0.900000	I completely understand what my medical professionals says to me because I am always asking questions throughout the whole process so I clearly understand what is been said and I generally go over the main points with the professionals at the end of the conversation so we are all on the same page when I  leave and if something is still not clear  when I get home I call and get it clarified
0.827800	I have the capacity to get information but I don't necessarily know how to interpret it. I also don't know some medical terms.
0.777800	Most of the information that I receive from my doctor is directly explained to me without any problems. My doctor is very understanding that I may not understand MD's talk so she explains it to me more easier. I feel there isn't a problem and that I get all the information I need.
0.705600	I think that in general I am able to get the help that I need in understanding health information and services. At the hospitals that I go to, quite often the information that the doctor conveys is backed up by written reading material. My main trouble comes with pharmacy medications. It is not always clear how to go about taking it - for example, suppose I want to switch from taking something in the evening to taking it in the morning, can I do that? Additionally,  suppose I suspect something is a side effect of pill X, then i hate going online to figure it out because its just not the same as seeing a doctor. 
0.883300	I have trouble understanding technical jargon that some health professionals speak. When I do not understand I have the abilities to ask questions that result in the health professionals explaining these issues so I can understand. 
0.916700	I am absolutely confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself. I always ask my doctors all questions I feel I must ask in order to fully understand any information I was given during medical visits. 
0.872200	I feel pretty competent in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.661100	I think that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. This past year I have had to sign up for health care four times due to job changes and it really made me understand what I am getting and paying for. And how messed up our system really is. 
0.916700	"Although I've made a few trips to the doctor, and my children were delivered in a hospital, I primarily manage my own health. After dealing with chronic, and ultimately fatal, illness in both my parents, I was motivated to educate myself on proactive means to maintain my health so I don't need to see health care professionals. This has worked very well for me for 30 years, and I hope it continues to do so. But yes, I have a lot of knowledge about the current western medicine, to the point I had one of my mother's doctors ask if I was a medical professional. I said , ""No, but I guess you could say I am a 'lay' professional. :-)"""
0.672200	I have zero difficulty understanding, processing, and obtaining appropriate health information that concerns myself. I have confidence in myself to figure out what I need to look up and how to go about obtaining the information or services .
0.761100	When it comes to processing and understanding all the health information that pertains to my own well-being, I believe I am confident in my ability to understand most of the jargon. However, since I'm no expert, there is some material which I will not always fully understand, and I am usually confident enough to ask doctors/nurses to give me some guidance.
0.677800	I feel as if I generally do understand everything that Is being said to me. At times though some things do get confusing and having anxiety I am sometimes scared to ask questions if I don't always understand what is being said. I feel I am very capable to make decisions without any help though. 
0.661100	I am fairly confident that I have enough information, but there are times when the doctor uses terms that I don't understand.  During a hospitalization, there were many doctors talking quite a bit in medical terms I did not understand.  They would use acronyms and abbreviations which I had no idea what they were.  I had to have a cardiac catheterization and was pretty confused by the terms they were using.  
0.516700	I think I am average when it comes to this kind of stuff. But there is some things that I just do not understand. So I ask for help when needed, even if that is often.
0.883300	I am fairly educated and can grasp a large amount of information relatively easily however some medical information is provided in such a way that A medical professional is needed to translate into layman terms.
0.916700	I feel I have the full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am a registered nurse and have been volunteering and also working in health care as a medical scribe prior to becoming a registered nurse.
0.588900	I feel that I think I know what i am doing, but it is hard to be sure that what I think I know, is actually correct. I think this is done on purpose.  I think the forms should be written in a way a high school graduate could understand. Alot of the material on these forms are overly complex and does not make sense.  Help is hard to find . 
0.916700	Yes. I am confident in my ability to understand the information provided to me and then using that information in order to make healthy and well educated decisions. I also do follow up research myself, to verify any information given to me.
0.511100	I think I feel more comfortable if I have help from someone else when going over these things regarding the process of obtaining and carrying out various things concerning health care. I understand the basics and how they relate to me personally, but anything beyond that I usually ask my mother since she has dealt with these types of things for her entire life and she is very knowledgeable about them.
0.711100	I think I have the ability to process and understand basic health information given my background in chemistry and biology. For terms/concepts I don't understand, I tend to Google the information to learn about it. 
0.761100	I believe that I am capable, perhaps not highly, to understand basic health information and to what degree I may not be I use the internet to seek further information and guidance. This has helped me greatly improve my knowledge of various health issue
0.855600	I feel like I am pretty good at obtaining and understanding health information. I have an English degree and teach high school reading, so I am more proficient at the English language than most people. When I do not understand something, I generally Google it to find the answer. I often know exactly what the doctor and/or nurses will tell me before I even go in because of my own research.
0.833300	I read a lot of content outside my field of expertise. I've also had experience interviewing various artists and technicians about subject I'm unfamiliar with. 
0.805600	i'm not senile. i just turned 56. now i know how old people feel. i think i'm able to get and understand health info as well as anyone 
0.900000	I always make sure I read any document medical or otherwise that requires my signature completely thoroughly. I read quite a bit in general, and do so at a practiced leisurely pace to ensure I process what I am reading. Medical information especially is extremely important to understand everything pertaining to what you're getting involved in the moment you step into a doctors office or hospital. Health decisions are some of the most important decisions we make in our lives, considering these decisions literally do directly effect our life and livelihood. I know there are a lot of people who don't tell their doctors enough information, and don't read enough into the pros and cons of medical decisions for many reasons, but I know that I'm not one of those people. I am still young and health is important at every age.
0.488900	I feel like I have a general knowledge of how to take care of myself, but I find doctor's visits awkward and tend to feel rushed and without time to ask questions or get explanations for what the doctor is doing.
0.811100	I feel that I am very capable of processing the information and making informed decisions.  However, I find that I often forget to ask pertinent questions that I later think of at home.  I may also do some more research at home and find that I have more questions.  There have also been times where my doctor was unable to provide me with a satisfactory answer to my questions.
0.883300	I have no problem understanding my condition when I talk to my doctors or nurses. If they use a term I am not familiar with I would ask them to explain it to me in a way so that I could understand. When I am confused or unsure I always ask questions until I get a clear picture. I don't mess around when it comes to my health since it's one of the most important things I value.
0.777800	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information in a high degree, it's better when a doctor or nurse talks to me about the issue and tells me what should I do and medicines I should take, I rather to receive this information in a conversation, I can understand written prescriptions but not perfectly and sometimes I struggle with it.
0.883300	I feel very confident in my ability to communicate my symptoms and concerns to the doctor and then ask questions to clarify my understanding when they give a diagnosis.  I ask a LOT of questions and then I go home and do a little more research online.
0.677800	I am of sound body and mind right now so I don't need help supplying basic health information.  There are periods that sometimes my mind draw a blank and I might need just a little push in the right direction.
0.916700	I feel very confident in my ability to understand basic health information, and to obtain services if I do need help understanding what information is given to me.
0.722200	I feel fairly confident that I understand most basic health information. I don't always remember everything so I like to have things written down so there is no confusion.
0.855600	I feel confident, but most likely because I haven't had to deal with any major health issues yet. I find that the internet is a very vast source of information, that can supplement a medical professional's advice in terms of what to do regarding treatment or diagnosis. I feel as though I have ample access, as well as everybody else living in the modern era, to access vast wells of knowledge whether it be via the internet, through word of mouth, or through the expansive network of medical institutions which seem to be always open. Even if you can't get an appointment right away, there seems to always be alternate options.
0.800000	I feel that I am well informed about medical situations that I am in or my children are in. Often I will research information before going to the doctor so that I have an idea about what we will be discussing. Usually, if I am struggling to wrap my mind around what is going on I will ask questions until i fully understand so that I can care for myself or for my child in the best possible way.
0.833300	I definitely have a decent understanding of medical information that pertains to me when it's presented. Occasionally I'll need a little bit of help or extra information from the doctor, especially when it come to steps I have to take in order to control my condition.
0.866700	I feel that I am very capable of being able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services I need to make appropriate health decisions. I make sure there is clear communication between my health care providers, and do what I need to do to become literate as possible to maintain a healthy life.
0.794400	I obtain information most of the time, although I may have to study and ask questions to completely understand what I read or hear.  I usually need the doctor to take the time to explain everything and to take the time to answer my questions.
0.866700	I feel that I am able to understand nearly all of what the nurse or doctor says to me. The only exception is if I start to get anxious I get a little bit cloudy, but other than that I feel nurses and doctors explain things in an easy to understand way. Also, I have some medical knowledge that helps. Filling out paperwork I typically find easy as well.
0.772200	I feel that I have the overall capacity to obtain and process my health information but the emotional and time pressured environment of healthcare appointments impedes my ability to do so. For routine care it doesn't matter so much, but when there is a problem with your health or someone you love and you only have 15 minutes to discuss it things can get overwhelming and confused.
0.833300	I'm very resourceful when it comes to my health. Either information from my doctor or researching online, I can obtain the majority of what I need to know.
0.916700	I think I can understand health information very easily. I have no problems going to the dr. by myself and understanding what I need to. Now my mom on the other hand likes me to go with  her when she goes so I can explain things to her.
0.888900	I have full faith in my abilities to understand my health information and what services I require. I am of sound mind and judgement to take care of myself in these issues and any concerns regarding my own health.
0.900000	I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Although I am not a medical professional, I am intelligent and educated. I'm pretty good at navigating difficult situations like the health area, even though I don't have an insider perspective.
0.638900	When I am meeting a doctor or health professional face-to-face, I feel fairly comfortable with obtaining and understanding health information as it applies to me.  This normally involves me asking several questions and occasionally asking for clarification.  There are also times when my doctor (who I've established a relationship with) will give me examples and scenarios as that is more in-tune with my learning style. When I am reading health information on my own, I often find the information overwhelming and hard to process as I can interpret the details in many different ways - or might find the text to be vague and hard to understand in general.
0.633300	I think that at least half of the time I can obtain all of the information I need to made appropriate health care decisions.
0.866700	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed. I am very adamant about understanding before I leave and if for some reason I don't or forget a question I meant to ask, I will call to ask it.
0.688900	I am fortunate enough to have a father who was a paramedic, one brother who is a nurse anesthetist, another brother who is a physicians assistant, and a fiance who is attending medical school. I have opportunities to constantly get in contact, ask questions, and have multiple opinions on a single matter. This being said, I utilize this perk often, as many times I do not understand or get proper answers from medical professionals at offices, hospitals, and urgent care centers. There are times that I feel as though words are purposely being used to go over my head about things, to avoid detection of a unsure opinion. I don't normally have problems understanding material and pill descriptions, just on occasion, problems with the professionals themselves, and their explanations. 
0.772200	I feel like I am decently well-informed at the basic level about health information and services and I do feel reasonably confident in my ability ask my PCP or other doctors I've seen to clarify instructions for my care. I'm also somewhat of an outlier in that I have several medical professionals in my family (physicians assistants, registered dietitians) so they are always available to help me understand anything my doctor may miss.
0.755600	I feel I need to ask most of the time about a small part of the forms when filling them out but most seems fairly easy. If I have questions they are always helpful in answering but I do feel at time I need to ask. I also have others I can ask and do research for myself. 
0.916700	I feel I have a high degree in understanding these things myself. Ive had to make important medical choices by myself including surgery
0.838900	I am generally able to understand information that is given to me, but sometimes there is a lot of information given all at once, and verbally, and it is hard to process it all at the time, particularly under the stress of being ill, so questions may not occur to me until later, or I might forget some of the details when there is a lot of information given at once.
0.900000	I feel like I can read and understand basic medical information.  I feel that I can do this on my own, without any assistance.  And, I believe that I understand what is told to me or give to me to read well enough to make my own medical decisions.
0.850000	I have some experience in a health-related career. I feel fairly well-equipped to understand common terminology, as well as some of the more common services that a provider would recommend.
0.855600	I am quite capable to ask all of the needed questions regarding my condition while providing my doctor and nurse with the details necessary. So far , in my life, i have not had any incidents of not understanding something.
0.866700	I feel I have a very good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  When things get beyond basic and into more complicated subjects, I may need a medical professional to help simplify things for me.  If I read things enough times, I generally catch on to things.
0.805600	I feel that I am completely able to read and understand basic, moderate, and even challenging health information. I can say that I am not good at asking questions or probing further for fear of wasting time. But, I have never had an issue with the explanations or information given me. I also have no problem understanding or filling out medical forms. I have the awareness and knowledge to make health decisions regarding myself that I understand and am comfortable with. In fact, I don't find most health forms, diagnosises, or health information that complex actually. So, to answer the question I am completely comfortable in this regard. 
0.900000	I do understand my health record because I do write and speak English. I am also a nurse so I can understand my record with no problem. I understand when the doctor talk to me about my health issue.
0.916700	I consider myself to be intelligent, inquisitive and self-aware.  I always did well in science and was in advanced placement classes in biology in high school.  I research any and all health conditions that I've had, as well as those health issues my family and friends have experienced. Once, a medical professional commented to me that he thought I worked in the health field.
0.738900	I feel like for the most part I am able to make the appropriate decisions . If there is something that I do not understand I make sure to ask questions to fully understand it . If it is a bigger decision I take all the information I can from the doctor . I then go home and google and read as much as I can about the problem . I also talk to any and everyone who has went through the same thing . If I am still lost on what is going on I go back and talk with the doctor . If something doesn't click for me I keep asking till I fully understand it all . 
0.777800	I feel that i have a basic understanding of medical knowledge. A lot of times I will need help understanding things regarding medical terms if it's something that I'm really unfamiliar with. It can be hard remembering all the information they throw at you at once so sometimes I like to have another person there with me to help out with that.
0.827800	I think I understand everything doctors or nurses tell me about my health. If I don't I usually ask lots of questions until I understand. Understanding the information about my (or my son's and husband's) health is very important to me
0.900000	I am confident that I have the capacity to understand health information that is shared with me, and the ability to make appropriate decisions based on that information.
0.861100	I feel like I never have any issues when I am given instructions or information from my doctor. I would say that the only issue that would keep me from telling all of the information behind something that is bothering me is having a lack of comfort with the specific doctor or nurse I see that day. This usually only happens during urgent care visits. I always ask questions even if the doctor does not seem interested because, as the patient, I deserve to know exactly what could happen to me. Health is something that people should have a blasÃ© attitude towards.
0.666700	I believe i have 100% capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information because i have a voice and during my appointment with my doctor i can ask the questions that concern me the most. There's always someone,either family or hospital staff who could help me make the most appropriate health decision.
0.750000	I feel like I have a good understanding of basic health, I'm also not afraid to ask stupid questions or ask a question more than once or ask it a different way so that I understand what I am hearing. My mother in law is also a nurse so if I don't understand something she can usually break it down into something i understand.
0.722200	I feel that for the most part I feel that I have the capacity to do all these things. If I have any questions, I can call my doctor's office and speak to a nurse to explain things. I could google any questions I had (regarding things like filling out forms). I could also ask my parents, who have much more experience as far as health services go.
0.861100	I have no problem  processing information, understanding health information, and to make health choices. I can obtain health services quite easily myself.
0.916700	I am educated enough to understand written material as long as it is not too technical or in this case not too burdened with medical terms.
0.644400	Yes, If I don't understand I ask as many questions as needed till I do understand. I am very concerned about my health.
0.916700	I feel i understand things completely but doctors dont listen and just recommend things based on the massive consumption of what they see and i am a number that is not listened to. Although good intentioned doctors are overwhelmed with inputting info so as to not get sued. This is a shame because all that school and minimal output from fear and bad information.
0.916700	I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand the information I need to make health decisions. English is my native language. It is easy for me to read and understand information.
0.738900	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain and understand and process most basic heath and serviced in order to make decisions. I do have a background helping out in a doctors office for a very short time so this probably does help my understanding a good bit. I usually have doctors that inform me very well and explain stuff even when I do not need it explained. 
0.777800	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions. I also know that it's not always easy or something you can accomplish in a timely manner. Health centers and hospitals differ, as do health professionals. I have a primary care doctor who is unfortunately overworked and somewhat difficult to speak with to the extent that I need to. On the other hand, when I had a fracture almost two years ago, all the specialists I saw after I left the hospital were very forthcoming with help and information, and they listened well. Their assistants were superb. However, my experience in the ER was terrible. Really terrible, especially while being in the midst of trauma. So I feel that my capacity to obtain what I need has been very uneven.
0.838900	I don't have extensive knowledge of the medical feild and services, but I do think I enough of the basic knowledge to make good decisions in regards to my health.  I do know that if it is something I know nothing about,  I am not afraid to ask for assistance from people who I know are much more knowledgeable.  I also will do any research I  can to obtain a better grasp of the situation.  
0.822200	I pretty much am able to obtain, process and understand basic health info and services to make health decisions.  Since I'm not in the medical field sometimes it hard to follow what the doctors are saying, especially if English is not their first language.
0.811100	I feel like I can get the info from the Doctor. If I have any further questions, I'll ask health professionals I know, call my Dr. back,  and/or do additional research online. 
0.916700	I feel that I have a great understanding of medical terminology. I have worked in the medical field, as a secretary and now a billing coordinator,  for many years. I have a clear understanding and health information and the services that are needed to make appropriate health related decisions.
0.844400	I can see and read perfectly fine. I don't like it when the Dr. doesn't give you time to respond to any concern that have arisen while he is talking to you. I almost always feel rushed. And uncertain what was even said. I have had so many come in and start going on about what needs to happen or what is going on right away. They don't give you time to process anything. You might have a question early on and the not hear anything said after that. Or else completely forget the question you had trying to comprehend what is being said. 
0.861100	I feel like I have a capacity to understand what information I am given when it comes to my health. If I do not understand, I know who to ask to help me to understand the information.
0.794400	I feel fairly confident in my understanding of basic health information. At times certain health lingo may need to be put into layman's terms by the doctor or nurse when asked but most of the time I understand what I am told or reading.

0.522200	I feel like when the time comes and im actually in a doctors office, I freeze up. Its like taking a test, I get really nerbous. I dont know what to say.

0.916700	I am a doctor's daughter and grew up around medical terminology, so it is very easy for me to understand a medical practitioner when they are explaining something to me. I am also adept at finding reliable information on the internet before going to a medical appointment and generally know what questions to ask in advance. I am also able to use medical portals to ask any questions which may arise after my appointment has ended.
0.916700	Yes, I have been in the medical field of work for 20 plus years and I have a good understanding of all situations involving medical care. I ask as many questions as I need to be fully informed. 
0.850000	I believe I am able to understand the basic information to make the right health choices. I am also very confident in asking for help to understand and make my own decisions.
0.766700	If I dont understand what a doctor is saying I can research on the internet. Services are dependent on my finances, so if I have the money I have the services. The bedside manner of a doctor matters too because if I feel like their agitated then I wont want to ask questions or share health information.
0.850000	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision to a high degree. The few times that I do not completely understand any medical information I am comfortable and confident in asking questions so that I can obtain a better understanding.
0.655600	I feel like I can understand some health information, but a lot of it is confusing because of all of the medical terms and the way medical professionals talk.
0.550000	I feel like I have a basic grasp of common medical terms but the medical industry has gotten a lot more advance and complicated and they're are many terms that I am unsure of and don't really understand. 
0.611100	I think I have a good understanding if the information is broken down in a way that's easy to understand. The basic information is easy to understand but the complicated stuff needs to be broken down for me. When it feels like it's becoming overwhelming, that's when I start asking questions. 
0.533300	I feel that I can get the information I need, but not form doctors or nurses.I can all the information I need from the internet. I trust it more than some doctor who may no keep up to date to what is happening in the medical world
0.850000	I feel that I can easily find information I need. I can speak to a doctor, a friend or google anything I'm not sure about. My doctor is someone I trust so I feel comfortable speaking to him openly, even concerning someone else. Whenever I become aware of a diagnosis given to a friend or family member I research it.
0.866700	I feel like I understand basic health information very well. It is when the big fancy words come in where I need a little understanding.
0.900000	I feel that I am perfectly capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services need to make appropriate health decisions.   As a leukemia survivor, I have lots of practice taking in medical advice from doctors and doing my own research to make decisions.  
0.900000	Based on some poor health care experiences in my teens and twenties, I rarely use doctors except for acute situations (i.e., where I need a prescription for antibiotics). When I think I need a doctor, I collect the symptoms, figure out my best guess for what's wrong with me, then go to the doctor with a careful explanation of what's wrong and what I likely need. Doing my own diagnosis to then get it confirmed by a doctor is a pain, but it has resulted in a lot better health care for me. I believe I can competently obtain and understand health information. I have also been successful in obtaining the few services I need. I make a point of trying to manage chronic conditions (such as obesity and obesity-related issues) without pharmaceuticals. Drugs, in my experience, are best used for acute problems. Change in behaviors, such as eating, are usually necessarily for chronic problems.
0.816700	I feel to a high degree that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Usually, I will ask pertinent questions and try to find out as much info as possible to make educated decisions about my health care. Moreover, I do online searches to understand as much as i can about the health issue. 
0.916700	I do try to keep abreast of medical information, and am in the habit of asking my doctor questions. I feel that although he is the professional, it is my life and he works for me.
0.900000	Besides my own level of education (the equivalent of a BS, MA, and MSW), I grew up in a family of physicians and have been around the medical world for my entire life. I frequently get advice about my health decisions from family but I feel comfortable in my ability to understand the information and access what is needed. 
0.855600	I think i do not have an issue with basic health information. The more difficult things or if it is my first time with a new medication I might need a little assistance figuring out how to take it but other then that I d not find it difficult.  
0.688900	I believe that I have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information in most situations. Most of the time if you don't get lost in random jargon the point is clear. From time to time doctors and nurses say stuff that makes sense to them but doesn't to a normal individual that doesn't work in the medical field. 
0.588900	I feel at times I have little problem filling out, and understanding material but, at other times I feel I have difficulty understanding and comoleting certain forms or material. I also feel I am usually required to complete documents at invonveniant times.
0.522200	i don't really know that much about health-related things. my wife and kids usually help me out. i really don't like talking about my health, although i'll go to the doctor if it's something serious.
0.855600	I'm pretty confident in answering and understanding health related questions because most of the time, I'm able to diagnose and help myself. Everytime I visit a doctor, I'm able to understand what he is trying to say, and I make sure that everything is clear if I don't understand anything.
0.916700	Most times when I am given medical information related to my conditions or the prescriptions that I may have to take I usually have a good understanding of what I am told. However, when I do have questions I still like to ask general questions in case there was something that was omitted or missed accidentally. Usually when I have an ER visit I definitely ask questions because it seems as if the doctors only care about getting you out as fast possible unless your in need of life support.
0.705600	I think I have a good capability to engage in the health care process. I have no problems understanding information that medical professionals convey to me. I understand what they are looking for when they ask me questions and I'm able to be a good patient as far as my volunteering information. There is some stuff that I hold back, especially if I'm embarrassed about it. I don't tend to ask questions at the end of the encounter, but I am able to look up information online and understand it well.
0.888900	Having gone to 90% of the Doctor/dentist visits by myself I have learned to fill out all the info and ask all the questions I need to. The only time I have needed help was when I was coming out of surgery and had to have my mom sign paper work.
0.916700	I got no issues with asking questions or getting info. I have a really good memory and that helps with remembering all that is said during medical checkups.
0.883300	I can easily obtain, process and understand basic health information, I am very open and don't mind asking any questions about things I do not understand and have never heard of. When it comes to my health I want to be well informed about anything pertaining to any sickness or issues I may have. I like to know if there is anything I can do to reverse the issue at hand or if there are any treatments or not.

I also am unsure frequently how to judge the accuracy of the information I am receiving or otherwise said the quality of the medical care. 
0.772200	I feel basic medical information is easy to process, unless it is something that you are not aware of. Say for instance your blood pressure is up, you ask why and the answer is.. could be a number of things.. and that's it. I understand it is general, but sometimes the answers do not help at all.
0.555600	After being given information, whether it is by brochure, verbally, or through a call I always ask the doctor or nurse to state everything in layman's terms for those who do not understand the medical terminology they use. Once they state everything in layman's terms, I repeat back what was stated to ensure I am correct with the information they have provided. 
0.916700	I'm already a nurse practicer and usually, I don't need the help of anyone to understand basic health information and services
0.844400	I feel I am extremely confident in receiving, understanding, and communicating when it comes to medical records or issues. I have never had a problem in any of these areas. I even help with the my grandmother when it pertains to her medical information.

The only areas I feel like I need help with are insurance-type information, as I have trouble understanding it. As far as things directly related to my medication and health conditions, I feel pretty confident. My parents are both nurses and so I am familiar with the medical world.
0.900000	"I've worked in health care, and know the kinds of things that make a difference when doctors and others are making decisions.  I do some online research before I go to appointments, and usually have questions I'd like answered.  I also have been volunteering as a ""practice patient"" for medical students, which gives me a sense of how good doctors go about doing their work."
0.916700	When given information I attempt to understand it the best I can. If I'm unable to understand something, a healthcare professional is always there to help me. Any time I ask for explanations help is given to me.
0.550000	It's kind of difficult to answer.  I have many conditions that are still unknown, so i cannot get actual answers very often, not to the fault of doctors or nurses most of the time.
0.916700	I feel quite confident in my ability to understand, obtain and process any health information provided to me in order to make the best decisions regarding my health.  I am knowledgable in many areas of health, and research information prior to seeing a physician or nurse.
0.916700	Assuming that a doctor or other provider is not withholding information, I believe I have the full ability to understand and process information related to my health.  I believe I have an adequate understanding of medical terminology to comprehend what a doctor is telling me and make an appropriate decision.

0.738900	I think for the most part I am able to understand most of the stuff that is told to me and if there is something I am not sure about I usually ask or I look it up on the internet.
0.705600	I believe I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. However, because I have a slight visual impairment, I sometimes need assistance when filling out medical forms. That is the only issue I have currently in regards to situations like this.
0.772200	I feel that overall I am able to process the information I get from my doctor or nurse.  I do need to sometimes look up things and get some ideas of questions to ask when I am not sure what the information means exactly for me.  As for my basic health I have a good understanding of what I am told. 
0.800000	I feel i am 100% capable to understand the processes of basic health and the services needed to help me make the right medical decisions. I went to nursing school so i understand medical terminology plus i tend to ask questions when i dont understand something. It is very helpful to do research at times to better understand. 
0.750000	I feel like I'm capable of managing my health and understanding basic information. I do feel like I don't ask all the questions I need to to truly understand because I feel like I'm a bother to doctors and nurses.

0.733300	I have a background in healthcare from my school and that provided me with a thorough understanding of how to advocate for your healthcare and  ask the right questions to make sure I am capable of understanding what I need to do to improve/maintain my health depending on the purpose of my visit to a healthcare professional.
0.550000	I feel like I understand the doctorâs and nurseâs explanations sometimes. The only hardship that I have when they use medical terminologies or expressions that I am not familiar with. Anytime when this happens I can just ask them for further explanation and they help me understand the situation better most of the time. The only thing that I really do not like is that I feel that the doctors are always in a rush and by the time you have a question they have already left. This is not personal it is because of the healthcare system is about the money as well.
0.405600	I would say my capacity would be in the middle, a lot of what is said is foreign, but If someone is willing to take the time to thoroughly explain everything it would be alot easier to understand and be capable without anyone else's help. But in my experience most people don't want to put the time into explaining as that takes time. 
0.816700	When I go to the doctor office due to some illness I used to tell the whole history about the illness and how it is affecting my physical condition and how long it is there and I will ask them what to do on this and how will the treatment proceed and how much duration it may take to get all set.
0.711100	Well i went to the hospital a lot of times when i was young due to my asthma so i have a pretty good idea of the basic information that is given to me. Anything else i would ask questions and look up anything i can online.
0.866700	I feel that I have a very good grasp of things going on around me. I am a reasonably intelligent person.I am not afraid to ask questions if I don't understand. I believe I can obtain, process and understand basic health information quite well.
0.811100	I believe that I can fill out forms sufficiently enough to get the job done. However, when it comes to family history I have a hard time remembering everything that my family has told me about their medical backgrounds. I understand most of the conditions that doctors describe to me, but I have a hard time understanding the causes of them.
0.855600	I understand basic health info easily but there are times when a doctor doesn't explain something fully or in a way I understand so I have to ask questions or just let it go if I don't think it's that important.
0.900000	I am not shy about asking health professionals about anything, even things many people find embarrassing. If do not understand their reply, I will question them until i do understand. I am also fairly competent at filling out paperwork as my previous job required a lot of attention to detail. If I am unsure of a question, I will ask someone who knows to help me out.
0.883300	i feel i have the ability to understand basic health information and make appropriate health decisions because i will always seek answers when i am unsure of something, and research things until i understand how to do them or how they work.  Therefore, i feel i have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand health issues. 
0.811100	I'm disabled and have health issues.  I understand a lot of what my doctors tell me. If not, I use the internet to research, and sometimes ask my 37 year old son for help.
0.783300	I think I am fairly educated and have the capacity to understand basic health information. Additionally, I have friends who are registered nurses that can help me id I have any questions.
0.838900	Over all I can put justification to all basic information that a doctor or nurse my tell me. If there would be something that i might not understand completely i am not afraid to ask. I personally have a very good relationship with my primary doctor, and i am very comfortable around him. 
0.766700	I think I'm fairly well equipped to deal with all of the basic health information. However, some of it is still convoluted. The documents are frequently bordering on the cryptic and the health professionals aren't always sufficiently clear. 
0.811100	I really don't have much of a difficulty understanding health information.  I work as a medical technologist at a primary care hospital and since I don't know everything about health I have people around me like doctors nurses and other health professionals that can help me understand what I don't.
0.827800	I have the general capacity to do so. But there are mitigating factors. I have issues with anxiety and I sometimes feel too anxious to ask questions I need to ask or to bring up topics I need to discuss. On the other side, medical professionals are often rushed and sometimes distracted. So sometimes I don't have time or opportunity to discuss the issues I'd like to discuss. Also, occasionally, I have been clear and direct in my conversation and had the medical professional sort of blow right past the issue.
0.711100	I feel that I have a pretty good understanding of basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions.

If I ever have a question about something I will ask the appropriate people in order to better understand.

0.733300	Even though I am not very confident about my own decisions in this matter, I think I should be able to decide for my own health choice because I think I should be able to make decision for myself.  If needed important ability for it, I should try to have any capacity to understand basic health information by asking and learning for final choice for my own health.
0.827800	I feel that I am quite competent in regards to understanding health information that is given to me. I worked in a hospital for many years and am comfortable around nurses and doctors. When I do not know something, I ask questions but I also do research at home on my own and then ask more questions if needed.
0.866700	I think I'm pretty capable of understanding it. Sometimes it can be unclear what services are offered, whether and where they're covered by insurance, things like that. It's more the kind of administrative stuff that I find confusing sometimes.
0.733300	I feel like I usually have the capability to understand information that is presented to me but sometimes I feel as though I need further clarification or more information before I am fully able to understand what I am being told.
0.888900	I feel like generally I am ok in the specifics of going to the doctor's office and understanding all my test results/procedures. I have not had any major health concerns yet, but I try to follow everything they suggest when it comes to the regular checkup. I feel as though I'm a smarter than average individual (like in K-12 I always was in the 99th percentile on standardized tests), so I'm pretty good at understanding and analyzing information. I don't need a lot of outside help, but I can ask them if I have any specific questions about my current condition. 
0.811100	I feel fairly confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make appropriate decisions. There have been few times I needed to ask questions for for a demonstration, but my doctor was able to provide me with the information for me to do it properly. 
0.888900	I'm fairly confident I have the ability to obtain, process, and understand health info and services due to my reading comprehension skills, question forming skills, and the general knowledge I possess.
0.861100	I feel that I am very capable of understanding basic health information and services, which allows me to make appropriate health decisions. Learning about human health and fitness is one of my favorite hobbies, which has helped me have a good overall understanding of the human body and some of the medical terminologies that they use.
0.766700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand most of the time. Some times I don't get the answer I was looking for or expecting. I do make sure to insist and get the best answer from the doctor. On occasions the doctor comes in and out and does not allow time for asking the questions I want.
0.838900	i always make sure to ask any questions I have with my doctors and nurse, even if they sound stupid.  Often times though, I will think of questions I need answered long after I've already left my doctor's visit and I have to go online and research what little I can but still be unsure of decisions.
0.777800	for me i come from a household with a large medical background. my mother was a nurse, my brother an emt/nurse and i helped both study very often. medical things like in the survey come to me without too many issues but there are sometimes i get tripped up with terminology but overall im good with it
0.844400	I feel I am fully capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information.  I have a degree in veterinary technology so I have a background in medical terminology and a basic understanding of how diseases/the body operates.
0.850000	I feel I'm better than the average person at being able to process and understand basic health information. My mind is still sharp and active and I study about my conditions in order to understand them and their causes. I know that many people my age are unable to do the same.
0.816700	I feel like I am able to ask for clarification from medical professionals but am also fortunate to have a mother who worked in the medical profession who I can ask additional questions after the fact if I need additional assistance processing information.

0.888900	I feel that I have the background to understand what they are telling me. I have a bachelor's degree in science, I grew up surrounded by scientific people, I read medical and science-oriented articles on a regular basis. I think I have a certain degree of skepticism, but also a good deal of faith in the medical people I come in contact with.
0.588900	I think I have the information to do it. If I have a problem, I will call the doctor's office or pharmacist and have them explain any difficult terms for me. I will also Google the issue and hopefully come up with something to help me. I can always ask for help via phone call or email if needed.
0.866700	I feel that all the information is available.  Most important is to be completely honest with the doctor and do proper research.  Googling an answer is not the best way to get information.  Proper research into peer reviewed papers from the top of each prospective field is necessary.  This is not to discount the information that is obtainable by each doctor.  These professionals know more about your individual circumstances than anyone.  It is important to ask for and get information from many different resources.  So, in total I would say that I have a good understanding, am able to process and am able to access the necessary information to better inform and care for my needs.  I do however feel that with all the in formation available, there is a tendency to miss use or miss diagnose oneself.  Although very dangerous, this can be solved by trusting the professionals with all of the relevant information.

0.916700	Having recently experienced some health issues, I feel extremely confident that I can obtain and understand health information. I ask a lot of questions of the doctor and/or nurse. I also have access to my health providers' portal on-line, and I'm not shy about questioning the doctor. I take my health very seriously and I seek out everything I can get my hands on.
0.800000	i am not that old for me not to understand what the doctors trying to say. i am having trouble to read their writings but pharmacy can do it for me. so i am certain that i can get what i needed

I also went to school to be a medical biller, but never made a career out of it.
0.916700	I am fully able to either understand the information I'm given or ask questions about it until I am comfortable that I understand sufficiently. I've been doing this for a long time for family members as well as myself.

0.916700	I have no difficulty understanding medical information. I am really good at learning, so I always ask everything possible when I see a doctor or nurse.

0.794400	When it comes to my health, I feel that I am able to understand when the doctor talks to me and describes what's wrong with me, what I need to do, and what will happen from that moment of us talking.  I know I don't have extensive knowledge in any of their fields but I know the basics of what they're saying to be able to ask questions if I need to and to be on the same page when we need to make decisions.

0.916700	I'm pretty confident in my ability to understand and process whatever information doctors or nurses tell me and if I Have any doubts I always ask for clarification. If I am not satisfied with a response I ask again or look it up online to get more information. Understanding basic health information is really not a problem for me at all.
0.872200	I think that I'm well equipped to read documents and understand information that is told to me. In the event that I do not understand I do not have any problems asking for further explanation so that I may understand.
0.888900	I have the right to ask because itâs dealing with my health. You got to understand whatâs going on with you and itâs okay to ask even if you donât know whatâs going
0.761100	I feel that I have the ability to understand and process most of what a health care professional has to tell me.  There are times when i am somewhat confused about what they are saying.  When this happens i try to ask them to explain in more detail so that i can comprehend what is going on.  I feel confident in filling out medical documents/forms when needed. But, again if there is any confusion i just ask for it to be clarified.  Now, at the pharmacy, i don't always ask all the questions that i should. I usually refer any questions about medication back to my doctor/nurse. 
0.850000	In terms of my own ability, I do have pretty easy access to my doctor and obtaining help that does not require me to go into the office or schedule an appointment. As long as the question isn't complicated or require that physical presence. My mother is also a nurse so that really helps a lot if I do not have access to my doctor at the time. 
0.833300	I have 100% confidence in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. If I do not understand anything, I will ask until my understanding is sufficient. 
0.633300	I think I can understand some of the information, but when there are a lot of medical terms it can be hard to know what's going on and what my options are.  I like it best when the doctor explains the options and information in layman's terms.
0.850000	I usually feel like I can get the information I need, but I oiften worry that I don't have the expertise to understand all of it and get all the answers to questions I need.

0.855600	If I do not understand something, it is due to my lack of medical training. I know how to find the answers and can do so easily. 
0.916700	I feel 100% capable of finding and understanding the health care information that I need, and in consultation with my doctor making the decisions that are best for me.
0.811100	I feel like I do have the capacity to obtain all the info that I need. It depends if I am intimidated by the doctor or the doctor is busy
0.916700	Being an educated person, who can read, write, and comprehend, I feel confident that I can make decisions on my own, or with minimal help from others. Being involved in your own healthcare is very important.
0.916700	I am confident that I am competent to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have a degree in nursing.
0.650000	I believe I have the capacity to understand some of the basics about health care.  The doctors and nurses do not take enough time, though to fully answer questions.  I feel like I'm on an assembly line when I go to the docs\ter.
0.883300	I try to be as open and honest with my health care provider as I can. When I visit the health care provider I accept the fact that in the end they are the expert in the field. I may have some limited knowledge and will give what little I know and ask questions based on that. However, I look to them as the person who can best understand and explain things. It is their field of expertise and seek them for their knowledge and help.
0.733300	"I know that my doctor and every other healthcare provider I encounter are motivated by money and pressure from insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. Often I want to ask my doctor things like, ""how much would you profit if I do this procedure you are suggesting?"" Or, ""did a sales rep promise you a trip to a conference in a vacation destination if you prescribe this drug?"" But, blunt questioning about conflicts of interest is likely to antagonize a doctor and his guilty conscience, so I stay quiet. "
0.850000	I think I can find any information I need fairly well. I am able to understand the majority of it and I can remember what I discover quite well.
0.900000	I feel I have the capacity to process the information. I usually think about what I want to talk to the doctor about. Also I try to inform myself about the condition ahead of time. I truly listen to the doctor and when I feel I need to ask a question, I do interrupt and ask a question. 
0.733300	My mother is a nurse so when it comes to 'medical talk' I usually have an understanding of where my doctor/nurse is going. I am also very capable of understanding what is being said to me. I make sure that i am asking appropriate questions if for some reason i don't understand something. But for most of the time, I do understand basic health information that is given.

0.872200	I feel I have an average degree of knowledge about obtaining and understanding health information needed for myself and family members. I believe my family doctor will provide me with information and would be able to help me understand anything that I did not. Also doing my own research on the internet or could provide information and explanations. 
0.822200	I feel like I'm capable of handling tasks at hand when I need too. If I need to ask questions I will, and if I do not understand I will speak up. But I'm sure I can understand them regardless.
0.844400	I feel like I'm mostly able to understand basic health information. I'm comfortable with forms and written information. To the extent I have some minor problems, there are times when my mental health issues act up and make it difficult for me to be assertive about asking questions or correcting assumptions. That's pretty rare, though.
0.766700	I feel confident i can access the information regarding my health and/or easily find someone who can help me understand. 
0.733300	Oddly, my father is in the hospital this very week with kidney failure and pneumonia and I had to provide end of life, resuscitation information and fill out a great deal of forms in the past 7 days. My mother is a nurse and I've grown up around health care professionals so I have a lot of personal resources I can draw on if I have questions, I also feel I'm fairly intelligent and can do my homework on the internet to ask relevant questions and look  up issues and procedures after I talk to a health care professional to be fully informed. 
0.783300	I feel confident I can obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have worked in a medical environment with physicians for years so am familiar with much of the terminology.
0.916700	I feel that when I go to the doctor I understand how to fill out the forms given. I understand the things that the doctor is trying to tell me. If I don't know a certain aspect of something I ask question so that I will have a better understanding of it. That being said I feel that I can adequately have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.883300	For the most part I've had no problem understanding anything involved with going to see a doctor, but I have had to ask for help to understand health insurance.
0.794400	I feel that I have the ability to make most of the basic common health information and services that I may need. Outside of that, I think depending on the issue it would be much more difficult to obtain what I needed by myself. 
0.900000	I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  Working in health care in the past has helped me understand better, but if there is something I don't understand I ask the doctor to clarify for me until I do understand it.
0.761100	I often obtain the information I need to understand and maintain my health in such a condition, that I am not a nuisance to myself and my loved ones. Sometimes healthcare providers resist. They don't have time for me, they have too many patients, they don't care, etc. That's a sign for me to find a better healthcare provider.
0.794400	I am currently a college student and decently educated in biology and chemistry, along with anthropology. While none of these things alone would help me very much, the combination of them I feel gives me a pretty good understanding of basic medical information. I can usually understand what a condition or illness is doing, or why, at its core. 
0.883300	I feel pretty confident in my ability to read and understand basic and even slightly complex medical and health information and services in order to make good health decisions.  I'm not an MD, but I do have a bachelor of science and I have studied and taken classes on health and medical issues, so the extent to which I understand a lot of the scientific terminology and complex issues is usually pretty good.  If I don't understand something, I will ask, but generally my doctor or health provider is able to answer my question in such a way that I can understand afterwords.
0.900000	I think I have a very good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I generally take time to read through medical information that is provided and ask any questions I might have to my doctor or nurse to fully understand the material.
0.916700	I feel that I am perfectly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have never had a problem with communicating to my healthcare providers any questions or concerns about any of my conditions.
0.833300	I believe that I have a good understanding of the medical field as my wife is a nurse and I also have a background in IT.  Since the body tends to work like a computer and much of the same logic can be applied in different ways, I believe that I am a person who can understand how different parts of the body may interact with each other.  Also, taking the time to understand the body, which is our survival tool is very important and everyone should have a basic understanding of certain medical terms and logic.
0.900000	I feel that I have the necessary skills to understand medical information. I can easily get the information I need by researching online, asking the right questions and continuing to be an advocate for my own health. 
0.900000	I feel I have a decent grasp on what questions I should ask my doctor when I'm going in for a physical. If I have any questions I will sometimes do some research online before going in to get an idea of what others have had questions about so that I can make certain I don't miss anything. 
0.705600	I feel like I obtain most basic health information but it is very hard to process and understand the information. I feel like I already make appropriate health decisions, but when a doctor sits down and tries to tell me what is wrong with me and what I should do about it it can sometimes get very confusing. I have never understood why doctors use technical terms with regular people because a regular person has no idea what the doctor is saying half of the time. If a doctor were to sit down with me and slowly explain what is going on in regular, every day terms, I would might understand better what is wrong with me whenever I go to the doctors office.
0.900000	I feel I have the full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I can under my doctor, ask the questions I need answered, and take the action necessary.
0.422200	Well recently I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and my doctor just gave me a pamphlet. I was not sure what to ask or what the next steps were and it was not explained to me either.   I felt like this was pretty serious and me having no knowledge of it should have been explained in detail but it was not. I would have to say i would really have to experience in obtaining information when it comes to my basic health information or what exactly i should be doing. I would rather hear it from a doctor then to have to google what i should be doing. 
0.855600	I believe that it is fairly easy for me to access and understand my medical plan. I have freedom to make educated decisions regarding my health.
0.872200	I work in a pharmacy, therefore I feel that I understand more than that average person may concerning health and medicine. I've also always been intrigued by health care and things of that sort.
0.888900	I can certainly obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I don't feel I'm at the point where I need help with this. If there is something I don't understand, I do ask questions. 
0.577800	I do not really have a lot of medical knowledge about the anatomy so when a nurse or doctor is trying to explain medical conditions or what needs to be done, it is a little difficult to understand what exactly needs to be done. I put my trust in them that they have my health and well being in their best interest but sometimes I wonder, especially with the billing they are going to send to my health insurance career, it might be a time where they want to add some dollars in their pocket. Luckily I have my wife who is a nurse who can explain everything in a much slower manner once they leave. This is very helpful because then I have time to process what exactly is going on and then we can come up with the best possible decision regarding my health.
0.916700	Yes i know about all these things because when I was young my mom and dad taught me everything I need to know about my health and things of such.
0.883300	i have a large degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. i'm an analyst in my professions, so i don't shy away from asking questions in order to understand my health.
0.783300	I feel like I have a fairly average capacity to process and understand basic health information as long as it doesn't get too technical about the medicinal or diagnostic aspect of it. I do feel fairly confident in my ability to make decisions based on this information. I feel more hesitant about my ability to obtain such information, as due to anxiety I find it difficult to ask relevant questions in real time. 
0.838900	I think I am very capable to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make health decisions. I usually know when to ask for more information as well as help to understand that information.
0.800000	"I'm a very patient and curious person, so even if I encounter something I don't understand, I will do what I can in order to understand it, given enough time. I may not be the smartest person around, but I often make up for that with persistence. I'd consider all but the most complicated of topics within my reach (and those complicated topics out of reach simply due to not having the resources available to me to study them farther). Since the question here is in regard to ""basic health information"", I feel confident in my ability to come to a solid understanding, if needed."
0.816700	If I am given a document to read, I can understand most of not all of it, and if I have any questions regarding the document, I am able to ask the doctor or an employee about it. Sometimes if I am asked an open-ended question (for example, if everything has been okay since my last visit), I tend to err on the side of not mentioning what I consider small or irrelevant problems. Overall though, I feel confident about my ability to get the information and services needed to make decisions about my health.
0.811100	I went to a new primary doctor recently and I felt rushed. I told him a few of the health issues I was concerned with but not everything. I did get a referral for one health problem but I feel I have to make more appointments to address more problems. 
0.916700	I have the knowledge to ask the right questions and understand information that is provided to me. If I don't know something I know who to ask.
0.916700	I am a young adult male at the prime off my life. I am quite healthy and have little need for additional help. 
0.794400	I have enough ability to understand the basic health services and information given to me and the ability to obtain information about my health conditions. With the internet I'm able to have a full view of what is going on and have the ability to bring up things I've researched to doctors. 
0.794400	I think i have a mediocre understanding of how to process and go though my basic health information. I also have the ability to process and understand it quite well.
0.916700	I feel that I have a high capacity for obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I have a strong command of the English language and both my parents were in the medical field.
0.633300	I typically understand what they are telling me, but I find that my biggest problem is remembering it all. A lot of times I will only remember 2 or 3 things we talked about and forget the rest. This becomes a problem because I can't put all the pieces together and remember the entire conversation and how it all relates to each other. 
0.744400	I feel like I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding most basic health information. I sometimes need help understanding how some medical diagnoses affect me, but otherwise, I am competent enough.
0.855600	I feel like I have near total capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am able to read and write English, I feel like I am fairly well versed in health care forms and what they need, and usually understand what a health care provider explains to me and I am able to ask them to elaborate or explain further if necessary.
0.833300	doctors often speak in a term that I can not answer, I almost always go with a family member to understand things more and I like that apart from medical prescriptions written the doctor tell me with his words what he is sending me because I do not understand his writing
0.900000	I FEEL THAT I HAVE THE CAPACITY TO OBTAIN, PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICES AND MAKE APPROPRIATE HEALTH DECISIONS BECAUSE I AM A PRACTICING RN.
0.777800	I feel I am able to get the medical information I need. The internet is also a good source to check on medical information I need
0.722200	I believe I have a basic understanding of health related information when it is laid out in simple manner by a doctor or nurse.  If there is something I find confusing or hard to interpret, I'll on occasion ask for some elaboration and a better explanation to help me be more certain.  In that way I don't leave misinformed.
0.850000	I believe that I generally am capable of making appropriate health decisions, as I am able to listen to and comprehend the information given to me by medical professionals. When there is something I do not understand, I feel comfortable asking questions until I have achieved the clarity I need to feel confident in my choices.
0.827800	I feel, with my level of intellect and reasoning, I have the capacity to process and understand basic health information. If I don't process and/or understand it the first time around, I have the wherewithal to ask questions of others and to get answers in that manner.
0.861100	I feel I am able to obtain and understand general health information.  However, sometimes in a situation where I feel like I am being rushed (short doctor's visit) I forget to ask questions or don't realize I have questions until later.  
0.833300	I feel like most information is readily available to those who know where to look, or know whom to ask questions to. Google is a great tool. Taking notes or receiving a pamphlet about what is medically going on, you can go home and do proper research. When I'm in the moment of receiving a lot of information, I process what I can and tend to wait till later to ask questions. The more often you receive that medical information, the more likely you're going to understand it subsequently. 
0.627800	Given my ability to obtain process and understand medical information regarding my conditions, I would say that I have a good level of understanding, although with more complex heath issues I need a better explanation, that is usually given by a medical professional. Thankfully once something is told to me I have a good grasp of how it works and what I can do to.
0.688900	I feel that I can understand and process basic health information well but obtaining it is more difficult. I do not like to ask questions that have been on my mind or ask someone to explain things to me. In addition, some knowledge I have of my own medical history is faint and I will need to contact a family member to know it and tell the doctor.
0.705600	I feel like sometimes the pamphlets and print outs are way too much information and it's so much to read. I'd rather have the cliff notes. Sometimes I worry about giving too much or too little information while talking to the nurse or the doctor. Or I forget things and then I remember after the fact. Sometimes I think doctors are in a rush and they also dont always take the time to explain things to you in an easy to understand manner. Or they don't give you enough options or time to decide on options. 
0.855600	I am pretty confident that i would be able to get all the information i need by asking my doctor questions about what ever illness i have and i would also do my own research. If i did not understand something that the doctor said, i would let him know.
0.788900	I feel confident in my ability to understand what I'm told by my doctor.

I've never felt as though I left without obtaining and understanding information I was given.
0.900000	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am a very healthy 29 year old woman. I have no mental deficits and have some previous experience working in the healthcare field. I feel like I understand basic health information and services quite well.
0.694400	I feel I'm at a point in my life that if I need to know something about my health I am going to ask a doctor or a nurse and hope,they give me the best answer they can. If I do not understand I ask them to explain it a little more. 
0.822200	 I feel that I could get information that I need the only struggle I have is being sent to different specialist that fine no issue with the doctor recommends I go there then I feel like this is been a failure hey 
0.611100	I'm usually pretty good about acquiring information/help when i visit a doctor but i often have really bad anxiety when consulting on medical manners, so that makes it difficult unless i have someone to provide moral and information support along with me during visits.
0.844400	I am 100% confident that I can obtain, process and understand health information.  I do not have diminished mental capacity and I know mostly what doctors and nurses are talking about.  And if I don't know, I can certainly look it up online.
0.794400	I definately have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  However, I do have difficulty trying to have discussions on this health information with my health care providers.   He would rather joke and laugh, then be available to answer questions.  And if I call on phone, I cannot get a hold of a knowledgable person.
0.888900	I think I have an above average ability to obtain, process and understand health information.  I've been working in medical offices and/or doing medical transcription for many years.  
0.550000	"I feel like it is very stressful and takes a long time to get someone to explain certain simple medical things/information to me, just for instance at my endocrinologists office (I am pre-diabetic), the nurse doesn't even know basic diabetic information such as what level your A1C should be to not be pre-diabetic or diabetic, she states she only draws the blood - but my doctors assistant is the same way, they do not know basic info for that field when I believe they should to save time for the doctor and also be able to explain it to you. My doctors sometimes do not use ""layman"" terms - they use long huge medical terms and don't really dissect it for you to understand, which leaves you to google which can be a severe panic attack in the making to do your own research."
0.872200	I generally do not have any problems obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have taken quite a few college courses about health and medicine. Health and medicine has always been very interesting to me so I have done quite a bit of research in different areas also.
0.705600	I feel to a certain extent I understand most health information but usually seek help from experts to make important decisions when it comes to my health. There's so much information out there, so many terms, that it can be difficult at times.
0.838900	I feel I can understand basic information given to me but I do sometimes have a problem obtaining information when I need it from my providers. I also don't always have the time to ask certain questions. I ask what I can but sometimes I will think of something later and by then there's no one to ask
0.761100	I think that I have capacity to manage all the information but in any real situation I often miss some information, do not feel confident to make connection between the health issues and what is important to share with the doctor. I forget some health issues from the past, After a visit I need time to rethink everything again and to talk to the doctor but nobody has that time, I read a lot of health articled and follow famous health blogger, knowing some information I feel confused because sometimes I see conflict between the information I know and the doctor's opinion. I would like everything to be consistent and logically understandable but it is not. In some of the cases doctors are working with old knowledge, and they do not make connection between the health problems and prefer to focus on one instead of the total picture.
0.916700	I can completely understand information pertaining to my medical conditions. I also make sure to bring my spouse to any important appointments so that we both hear the information and so he can ask questions if I don't think of one. 
0.827800	When it comes to my health conditions, I understand the basics. If itâs a new health issue that I might have, after consulting with a doctor I usually go online and gather more information if necessary. I also talk to my family or friends who might be suffering from the same illness and get their take on the matter. Iâm pretty okay when it comes to understanding what is going on with my health. At times, there are things that I donât understand so I confined in my husband who helps me better understand what the doctor has said if given me.
0.883300	I can generally understand the information given to me by my physician.  Whenever I am not sure, I will ask him or his nurse to explain it in laymen's terms.  I usually do  research on my own as well, and get a second opinion on methods of treatment I am not sure of.
0.705600	I feel that I have the general knowledge to understand what I need to do when it comes to medication and any questions I may have about my health. However, deeper information regarding serious health issues may take time to comprehend. 
0.766700	I can understand and fill out quite a lot about my own health. I have been doing that ever since I was a kid. My parents did not help me much as they do not speak English very well. So I even had to fill out their medical form when they are at a hospital or just a simple doctor visit. Thus, I have more experience about this than anyone in my family. Plus, I want to know the condition of my health or any of my family health thoroughly. I don't want to miss out any little details that would delay the healing process. 
0.827800	I feel like I have a great amount of capacity when it comes to understanding and processing health information when the wording is in everyday language. When the material use a words I don't really know the meaning to that's when it can get a little confusing. If I know it's information I really need 100 percent understanding on I will most definitely ask the doctor until I comprehend what is asked of me.
0.766700	I think I have a decent chance at understanding health material as it pertains to my own health and conditions. Occasionally, I find things confusing and I try to get an explanation from the doctor or nurses. However, they sometimes have a difficult time explaining medical terminology in terms that average people can understand. If I am unable to get the answers I need, I often rely on the internet to clear up confusion. Unfortunately, the internet does not always have the correct information about certain health issues and this can cause more issues in the long run. That is why I always try to get good information from the source, like the doctors or nurses themselves. 
0.866700	i have the capacity to understand health information and services since I went to college and listen extremely well and I don't hesitate to ask questions. I will often research beforehand so I can ask questions to the doctor.
0.844400	I feel that I have the ability to understand basic health information and services. If I am unsure about something I will typically ask the doctor or one of his nurses to clarify, in the event that i don't ask them to explain further I will usually read up on the subject online. I can't recall a time when I have had difficulty understanding medical information. 
0.827800	I feel that I have a high capacity for learning about and understanding such things. I worked very closely to medical professionals while doing medical registration and billing for a while and also had a very strong interest in neurobiology, anatomy, medical diagnoses, and pharmacological pursuits just to scratch the surface. I'm quite sure I can make appropriate decisions concerning my health.
0.572200	I am capable of understanding what the doctor is telling me, if they are giving me basic information about my health.  But when I suffered from a serious condition almost dying and having stayed in the hospital for a month, to this day they never clearly explained why I had the emergency.   I keep having to take test after test that makes no sense to me but they never clearly explain the problem.  I guess they just don't have an answer.  
0.844400	I feel very confident that I can understand and process basic health information.  Most of the time i have no trouble understanding what the Dr or nurse is explaining to me.
0.900000	I feel confident because at one time I was considering becoming a nurse. My mother was a nurse and I took a medical terminology coarse 
0.711100	I believe I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process and understand health information. The terms I do not understand I can always look up.
0.750000	I feel I have the capacity to obtain and understand basic health information given the wealth of information available. I however feel most doctors are uninterested in being thorough and want to get patients in and out so they don't provide or unwilling to provide good medical care and just want to order some tests and prescribe something to treats the symptoms of whatever ails someone based on some robotic intepretation of test results. 
0.900000	I feel well-equipped to understand the materials given to me. My educational background is in Psychology and Pre-Medicine, which means I've taken a good amount of coursework in the sciences including biology, chemistry, and (obviously) psychology. This material challenged my reading and information-processing capabilities and has taught me to understand medical information more thoroughly, though I am no physician!
0.755600	I am an injured veteran. So most of my care comes from the VA hospital. I do feel like I have the capacity to understand quite a bit, but sometimes my doctor isn't always available to answer my questions. In the past, I have also had many issues with misdiagnoses and am honestly not 100% sure what causes many of my issues. Several different doctors have told me different things, so I'm not sure what is right, and what is wrong.
0.772200	I think every time you try to obtain medical information in a clear and understandable manner, it is a challenge. I ask a lot of questions, but I seldom get the straight answers I desire and feel I deserve. What I am often forced to do is find another company or provider that handles this process more efficiently and thoroughly.
0.800000	Since I have a good grasp of medical wording, and I am willing to do my research and ask questions, I feel confident that I can make appropriate health decisions. Since I don't everything about the medical world and medical conditions, I would say I'm confident and not very confident
0.494400	It's important because u never no when u are sick.An could be dieing.My coworker just past didn't no he had cancer
0.672200	I believe that if I do not understand something about my health I have the ability to ask health experts the right questions. I am usually capable of understanding the benefits and risks of any course of treatment. I am capable of understanding the costs also. Overall I think I can make informed decisions.
0.866700	I feel I am highly capable mostly because I have worked within the medical field and psychiatric field for the past twenty years.  
0.783300	I can easily obtain, process and understand basic health information.  When it comes to major health information, it is a bit harder to understand as the words the doctors utilize are harder to  understand.
0.861100	I feel I have the capacity to make appropriate health related decisions under my control.  The only time I need help is if there is something that I don't understand, and in those times I ask for some extra information from someone that knows.  This could be filling out documents, a question about paperwork, treatments, etc. 
0.577800	I feel like I can comprehend the information to a certain extent. I tend to go through it with someone I trust to make sure I understand the information and that I'm not missing anything. I feel like I have the capacity, but still rely on others to help me. 
0.677800	I feel fairly capable of understanding, and obtaining the proper information related to my healthcare and any conditions I might have. My background in partial medical helps me to better understand things than most, however, this can sometimes lead to me not asking questions that I should because I believe I understand something when I might not have the full (or most up-to-date) information on the subject matter. But as a whole, I find I am capable of understanding, and asking enough questions to get the information I need to decide and understand what care is being offered.
0.816700	I am extremely intelligent. I can read and comprehend what I read. Even though I don't claim to know everything, but I know enough to fill out a medical form with my information on it.
0.666700	My capacity to obtain basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is very high. The doctors and nurses try to give me as much information about my condition as possible and answers many questions I ask them. My capacity to process basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is kind of slow. I have to visually see what the doctors and nurses are saying to comprehend it. Just listening is not enough to register my condition. My capacity to understand is that I usually donât understand what is happening unless I am given time to process the information because I need time for the information to sink in and ask questions.
0.861100	I think I have a fairly good grasp on my ability to obtain and understand important information regarding my own health. I try not to be shy or embarrassed when asking for help from my doctor or physician. It can be difficult to convey a specific feeling or discomfort but I try my best. I think I have good healthcare professionals looking after me!
0.688900	Usually if the doctors use big word terms for things, its difficult to understand. But explaining it or using different terms can help my understanding of things and I'm able to figure out what is happening to me.
0.872200	I feel I have a general understanding of information on my health. If there is any information, I do not understand, I make sure to ask questions until I am confident that I understand. 
0.827800	Most of the time I understand what I am being told. About 2%, I have issues understanding what actually is wrong or causing the issue, I think this is more due to a language barrier.
0.916700	I think that I am capable of understanding anything provided by my health care providers.  I am capable of learning about new information and doing my own research to go along with it.
0.616700	I think that I do I just am sometimes worried that I'm going to miss something that they are telling me. There has been a few times where I've not understood what they were telling me but I made them explain to me again.
0.888900	I feel I have the capacity to understand all health-related documents almost every time I read one. I take time to read the directions/information and ensure there are is not any ambiguous wording. I am able to understand all of the necessary abilities that I need to get the information, how to process it in my mind to think about and determine what is needed from me whether medical records, insurance or even authorizations that I need to give to other healthcare providers or to other people. I understand that the doctors use the information I truthfully give them in order to make detailed decisions about my personal health. If I am ever unclear on what decision is being made about my health, I make sure to ask the doctor  - even if it has to be asked in multiple different ways for me to understand.
0.900000	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. If at any time I am unsure of the information I have been given I am lucky enough to have been going to the same medical professionals for several years now and am confident enough with them to ask any questions I need to ask for clarification. I also grew up with a mom in the medical profession and have a basic understanding of the health problems I specifically have and/or may face.
0.722200	I believe I understand most of what I am told. I used to work in healthcare for over a year. I went to college for medical billing and coding so I know most of the medical terminology.
0.822200	I feel that I am able to ask clarifying questions in order to continue post-visit treatment, based on my diagnosis.
0.816700	I believe that I can read, talk and understand any medical info given to me by a nurse or a doctor and be able to repeat that information to someone else, such as my spouse, easily.  
0.555600	I feel like my ability and capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision is about average or slightly below average. I feel many health care professionals are rushing and do not take the time to explain or allow me to ask the questions I need.
0.883300	I have an advanced degree in Library Science and am very well able to find, read and understand basic and advanced health information.
0.844400	I am a nurse, and I know the importance of understanding your own medical condition.  When I see a healthcare provider for myself, I try to be sure I understand everything.  But sometimes I forget to ask questions, or feel rushed.
0.666700	I think I have a good grasp, but sometimes the physicians differ in their abilities to convey information in a way that is useful to me as a patient. I find medical forms a challenge as I am dyslexic and also an immigrant. I usually have my husband read them over or fill them out for me.
0.588900	I feel like I can understand the basic layman language the doctors and nurses tell me about health conditions, but I do not understand the background and the why as often. I just do what they tell me to do, regardless of understanding, and hope for the best.
0.716700	I believe that often times, I am able to read and assess the situation that is provided to me in terms of my basic health information. The difficulty occurs when, if I have a health issue, and I wish to obtain further information, I don't always have the best understanding of what is then told to me. This is perhaps due to the fact that past a point, my knowledge regarding treatment and medications is lacking, and doctors do not often have the time to explain in detail exactly what certain things do. Even when they do, they do not specify side effects of treatments. As such, I am often worried about what will happen. 
0.744400	As a fully functioning adult with competent medical facility, I feel confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and to make decisions pertaining to my health/ medical care. 
0.716700	I have a problem in that I wear hearing aids. If I am not wearing them, I often have to ask the health care provider to either repeat himself or to repeat what he said.
0.777800	From the age of six, when my father carried me into an Arkansas emergency room, I have been intrigued with medicine.  Although my major in college was in Business, the desire to work in the medical field was always on the back of my mind.  At the age of 42, I enrolled in some basic medical classes, just to see if I would really enjoy the subject.
0.600000	I think I have all the tools to find the basic information I need. I can either call in to my insurance and have one of them aid me or I can find information online regarding my questions and requirements.
0.588900	I'm able to read basic health information and services, but I have difficulty with filling forms out without leaving out vital information.  I have someone else fill out the forms and I just sign them in order to avoid the hassle and confusion.
0.500000	I would say to a very, very small degree. Everything about the process is puzzling to me and unless it's something basic (ie something like a simple cold), then I'll have am extremely hard time understanding. I don't know why but perhaps it has something to do with a fear of going to the doctor or hospital which makes it even more difficult for me. Usually I have to rely on my doctor, mother or partner to assist me in understand the information and making decisions. 
0.916700	I'm quite comfortable obtaining and understanding the necessary information.  I have also helped several others by attending medical appointments and explaining the medical information given by the doctors/nurses to them.
0.916700	I feel that I have an advantage over most people's understanding of basic health information because I am a registered nurse.
0.800000	I can make basic health decisions. There are times when I may not understand everything if they use technical language, but I just go along with it. I have not had any serious medical condition where I need to be on top of my care.
0.783300	I am very competent at understanding this kind of information for myself. if anything, speaking with doctors is the part I find challenging because they can be confusing and misleading sometimes. 
0.844400	I believe that I can understand and process basic health information to make my health decisions.  I tend to not ask enough questions.  I tend to depend on internet research to fill in the blanks.
0.572200	Well it is all so complicated, not even just the medical information but the information needed to navigate the bureaucracy so that one can begin to have medical coverage and have things set up the right way to afford coverage. Then you have to do not only what is medical best for you based on what the doctors tell you but what works out with your work schedule and is covered by your insurance but often to find these out it is a waiting game. So you might pick one option in the hopes that you are covered but then find out later that you are not. Plus you might have to go out of work depending on what choice you pick and then you don't have a job and that makes future medical even harder. Plus I worry too about changing insurance standards because everyone seems to think that healthcare should be about making money instead of taking care of people. 
0.900000	I feel I can handle basic health information when it is given to me. I haven't had a problem yet with this situation. I usually only have a question or two for the doctors and nurses when I go to the doctor and most of the time it is just to get confirmation that I understood the information I was given correctly.
0.916700	I feel like I have enough confidence and understanding to understand the basic health information and what I need to know to understand what's going on and what I need to do in order to take care of myself and make myself feel better. 
0.838900	I would think that I fall into a normal catergory of understanding of medical information.  It is not an area that I am interested in or studying so I know about my issues but not those of other areas. 
0.855600	I have access to medical professionals in my family, as well as a background in a tertiary medical field.  I am able to access information via the internet if I encounter any terminology or diagnosis with which I am unfamiliar.  I am very confident in my capacity to understand information provided, ask appropriate questions for further understanding, and research any additional information if help is immediately unavailable.
0.883300	I believe that I have the necessary capacity to obtain and process the information that I need. If I have problems understanding then I am certainly not shy about asking questions. These are issues that are important to me so I will not settle for not knowing what I need to.
0.855600	I think in general there are more than enough sources available for me to learn more about any health or medical issues I might have. I also know that if I don't understand something I should ask my doctor to explain more to avoid more potential issues.
0.900000	I feel like have the capacity to a large degree to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. I often use my health insurance webpage or the doctors group page for additional information.
0.644400	I guess that I have a very basic understanding of the human body and medical procedures.  The only health class I have taken was back in high school so I don't remember to much of it.  I have to ask a lot of questions at the doctors office because I don't understand a lot of the terminology.  Medicine has always been a mystery to me and I feel out of my element when I'm expected to grasp it. Prescription drugs make me nervous because there are so many side effects and sometimes I don't understand all the jargon on the information sheet so I have to ask the pharmacist.
0.788900	I feel I have adequate knowledge and research skills to be able to understand my basic health test results and findings. My largest knowledge gap relates to pharmaceuticals, specifically with regard to understanding alternatives, standard of care, side effects, and potential for dependency. Since I lack this technical knowledge, I usual ask the doctor, a friend in the medical field, as well as the pharmacist about the prescribed medication.  
0.677800	Before I go to the Doctors office or Hospital, I research all of my symptoms to see if I can figure it out myself. If it is something that I can not determine I will go to the doctors office or emergency room for the proper attention of the matter. While I am in the appropriate place, if I do not know what is going on, I will ask questions to understand what is going on, so I can make the best decision for  myself. My going home care, I always speak to the doctor or nursing that is discharging me, to clarify everything that is going on, to ensure I have a good understanding. After going home, if I have any follow-up questions, I will call to get assistance. 
0.916700	I feel very confident with my answers, mostly because if I don't understand something I am very good at looking it up on the computer. But I mostly comprehend what they tell me. Also I am like a very smart person.
0.588900	I feel like I can understand basic health information. But when it gets more complicated, I start to get confused. I feel like doctors rush through and don't tell you things thoroughly. 
0.844400	I feel I have a solid capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make my health decisions. I have a good understanding of anatomy and physiology so if something is wrong I feel like I know the appropriate questions to ask. I have no problem requesting that my doctor run certain tests if I feel they are missing something. I feel strongly that it is my responsibility to be accountable for my own healthcare and I do not rely solely on the doctor.  I don't trust that doctors have the time to do thorough physicals on their patients unless the patient pushes the point, especially with the healthcare provider that I have. So I would say that I take the reigns in making sure my healthcare needs are taken care of  
0.777800	If it came to a serious decision I could definitely ask questions to make a determination.  I understand basics of what doctors are saying and mostly I just wait for results from tests in order to determine what more information I need. 
0.883300	I feel that I have the basic understanding of health services and information, as I am a retired RN. I very much have my wits about me and stay up to date and current on health issues through nursing journals and by staying in contact with fellow co-workers who are still employed.
0.622200	I don't trust insurance companies and I am extremely skeptical of the healthcare industry. Not so much of the doctors although after going to college and seeing future doctors and nurses do blow I am wary of the the future.
0.672200	I feel like for the most part I can obtain health information I need by asking the doctor for documents, pamphlets and other hand outs. I can't always understand or process all of the information because a lot of times I feel my doctor is in a rush or I don't think of the right questions at the time of service and think of them later. I don't know who I'd contact about situations once I am no longer in front of the doctor.
0.900000	I have the mental and physical capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.872200	I believe that I have a very strong capability to obtain information that I need regarding my health. I also can process the information fairly easy. I can understand quite fully basic health information and services presented to me to be able to make appropriate health decisions. I am a pretty good reader and I always ask questions if there is something that I don't understand.
0.827800	I received an Associates degree in Pre Nursing, so I have an above average understanding of medical terms. Also I read a lot of medical magazines mainly my moms as she is a nurse and receives many scholarly nursing magazines. Another reason is because the medical field is my biggest interest and I love to learn about it whether it be medical conditions or any other related content.  
0.622200	I find the world of healthcare to be fairly opaque and difficult to navigate. I tend to avoid going to the doctor because I don't fully understand my health coverage or how various medical professions work. Luckily I am in good health and do not find the need to visit a doctor very frequently. It does cause me some stress when I need to go to the doctor, because I don't know my options.
0.872200	I believe that I can understand almost all of the information I'm told. I would ask questions if I didn't know. If I ever had another question I would look online and see if it is similar. If it is wild I would call my doctor to confirm the information.
0.566700	I think I am able to understand basic health information but I sometimes get overwhelmed and find myself unable to fully process information. It is helpful for me to have someone with me to rephrase what is being told to me. I also find that I do not always remember to ask questions if there is something I wanted to know, so I usually prepare ahead of time with someone who can remind me about what my questions were. 
0.861100	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information in order to make informed choices. While at a doctor's office I am willing to ask questions regarding test results that are unclear or which I cannot interpret the meaning of. I also feel confident in my abilities to research through qualified articles and writings if necessary.
0.794400	I FEEL I HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER GETTING ANY INFORMATION I NEED. I FEEL MY MEDICAL PROVIDER OR INSURANCE COMPANY OR WHOEVER I NEEDED WOULD HELP ME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION NEEDED CONCERNING ANY HEALTH DECISIONS 
0.888900	I feel that it is quite easy for me to obtain and process basic health information. I ask as many questions that come to mind when I inquire about my health. I also am proficient at using online resources to understand any condition I may have and what might be my best options.
0.883300	I feel confident in getting needed information and queries from health care providers. Even the worst healthcare professional would have more knowledge than the average layperson. I have also on occasion researched medication, disease process, and complications online. I have found online information to be easier to understand and often explains the medical professional's explanation. The combination of reputable information sources will often answer any questions and clear any anxieties. 
0.811100	I feel I have great capacity in filling out forms as well as comprehending information given. That which I do not understand I tend to research online to the satisfaction of my comprehension.
0.850000	Most of the time I am able to understand the information. If I question something I use the Internet to get more info
0.844400	I am young and have good reading comprehension skills; I rarely need help understanding forms and info given to me as long as I take the time to read carefully. Sometimes I might feel a little rushed and not ask as many questions as I should have but I generally make time if I feel the issue is important enough.
0.605600	I feel like I obtain information quite efficiently. Theres not too may times that I find myself asking doctors to much about things I dont know.
0.794400	"I feel like I have the information I need because I have a background in healthcare so it's a little easier for me to understand the medical terminology and paperwork. As for others, I feel like certain things should be broken down for patients who don't understand. Doctors and nurses should use ""Layman's"" terms when talking about health conditions so that patients will understand the seriousness of everything and not be left out.   "
0.916700	i do not hesitate to ask questions to ensure i understand exactly what i need to understand what is going on with me. and vice versa.

0.866700	I believe that I have sufficient mental capacity to understand and process health information and services.

When I have symptoms, I do not withhold information because I do not want the doctor to misdiagnose or miss the diagnosis.

0.544400	I understand written health information better than verbal. When it is explained to me generally I have to ask them to repeat it to me. Overall,  I understand written information very well.
0.677800	Well, my wife helps me a great deal in understanding some of the mumble jumble.  I have a fair grasp of things but sometimes it does get a bit technical or there is too much junk in between the important parts that I get a bit frustrated with the paper work.

Some times i feel like i am not allowed to ask questions as the doctors act like they are above you and seem to get irritated when i ask questions to try and understand. they like to speak in terms i don't know the definitions to and seem unwilling to explain further. the last time i went to the hospital i asked the doctor to explain why i was having so much  pain she gave me an answer  i did not understand and said can you explain it a little better and asked how long should i expect the pain and was told by her that she already explained it the best she could.

0.883300	I feel like I am more prepared than most people. I am in my 50s and was never in great health, even as a child. I have multiple serious and chronic conditions. Consequently, I have had exposure to a lot of medical information so I have a reasonably good understanding of what is being explained to me. Even when something new is being presented to me, I have a strong base of general medical knowledge from which I can pull to understand what I'm being told. Furthermore, I am well educated and therefore less likely to feel intimidated when questioning a doctor. Because of my experiences, I am often called on to help explain medical information to family members and friends so I know that this is a serious issue.
0.816700	I feel that I have a very good capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information and services.

0.916700	I know that my health is a very important issue. At my age, I understand that Iâm at risk for things that I wasnât risk for earlier in life.

0.872200	I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding probably more than the average person. I think this was is because I have spent more than average time at the doctor's office due to ailment. 
0.900000	I have a couple of chronic conditions. I have been to enough doctors and have complete confidence that I understand the information that is presented to me.  If I have a question or am unsure I ask.

I work in the health care field so I am around a lot of the terminology and understand most of it. When we get into specific diseases I will sometimes not understand the terminology because it isn't something I work with often, but as a whole I usually have no problems filling out medical forms, it is pretty basic information they ask and if and when I have problems I simply ask questions and usually get the help I need.
0.838900	I feel confident in understanding most all situations. I am a person who listens to and accepts logic. Most of my interactions with health professional has been more than adequate.
0.644400	I google things when I do not understand them. I also get a second opinion most of the time not only for my condition but for my family as well since we have a doctor in the family. He explains us information that we forget to ask our doctors.
0.866700	I think I have a great capacity to understand.  Sometimes I have difficulty with the more technical terms, but when it is broken down, I can grasp what is happening or what I need to do.
0.755600	I am typically able to understand all the information and am able to ask questions until I fully understand. However, it's definitely helpful to have somebody who is more experienced there to help out. I sometimes struggle with processing information for the first time so I often need something to be repeated. It's nice to have somebody else take the responsibility on occasion.
0.850000	I feel like I definitely contain the capacity to understand the information that is given to me. Being young and relatively healthy, I do not have to visit the doctor often and have never had a complicated medical condition or disease.
0.900000	I have worked in healthcare in the past, so I feel I understand most basic information given to me.  Also, if there is anything I don't completely understand (or even find interesting and want to know more about) I feel I know where to find the resources I need.
0.633300	I even come from a medical family as my mom was an RN but still I often leave feeling like I do not know what they said. I think I may not be the best at processing orally and then you factor in the vocab/lingo, and stress of being there and when I leave I feel I really am at a loss to discuss indetail what is going on. I get the gist but not the details and tha stresses me out. I have BA and I still striggle with the forms.

0.861100	I feel confident in my ability to answer questions relating to my health. I can read basic information and understand it. I feel capable of asking questions to my provider. However sometimes I think of questions once I leave or don't like my provider enough to ask.
0.794400	I feel like I can understand basic health information.  I work in the healthcare industry so I feel like I have a better understanding than some people.  However, I feel like sometimes I don't get all the information I need about my own health from my healthcare providers.  I always feel as though they are just rushing through everything and I don't get all the answers  and explanations that I want.
0.900000	I feel that I do have the intelligence to make good choices. In regards to my health I feel that have full capability to do so. I have very good reading comprehension skills and a good understanding of how ailments affect the body. 
0.872200	I think I am definitely able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate decisions. I can usually comprehend everything I am reading in materials and if I do not, I can easily ask the doctor or nurse to answer questions and fill in blanks for me.

0.533300	That is really difficult to say, but I dont feel I, myself have those abilities to make those decisions by myself because one wrong decision or choice and I could be paying for the rest of my life. It is really very serious and I need to be precise when choosing. I feel I have average skills to read and understand and dont feel thats strong enough to make tough decisions as this on my own.

0.772200	I can understand most of the basic information about condition I may have  . I usually can navigate online to earn some more, but i like to discuss with health professional , for my particular case. Than I feel the doctor addresses my certain problem. Discussion with doctor makes me make my final decision about how to address health issue
0.750000	I have no major health issues or constraints, so I am perfectly able to seek out, obtain, and comprehend any available information. 
0.900000	I have no problems with the health information, medications or interaction with the doctors. However occasionally i do use the internet to get additional information and that can be an interesting quest to figure out what information is pertinent to my case. 
0.861100	Medicine has always been an interest of mine, so I have no difficulty reading detailed medical reports or understanding the significance of the numbers associated with blood and other test results. If I do not know a term, I look it up.
0.916700	I feel as though i am very able to gather information about any health information that i may have, and even understanding it is not a problem for me. From my experiences i have learned to get better at this process and have narrowed it down onto what exactly to ask in order to get the answers that i am looking for.  
0.816700	I believe I can understand basic health information and services pretty well - well enough to feel confident about the decisions I make if I am given all of the information.

0.600000	I believe that I can somewhat understand what Doctors tell me but I still prefer for them to write it down.

The internet has been a large help in allowing me to understand medical information.
0.916700	I feel completely confident that I have the capacity to understand basic health information. If there is anything I don't understand, I always ask questions, and if that doesn't work I take it upon  myself to research what I need to to make sure I understand everything. I understand what I need, recognize things I don't understand, and know how to find answers to any questions I might have.
0.655600	I believe that a lot of the terminology used can sometimes be difficult to comprehend. What makes it worse, is that I can be shy and don't ask the proper questions.
0.566700	I have at least some ability to. Sometimes I have trouble processing what's told to me if it's too much to handle at once. It feels like I'm just being bombarded with info and my brain shuts itself off to protect itself. 
0.711100	"In the past I've had difficulty getting the information I need because the nurse or doctor just seemed too busy to care. I felt like a burden or just another $$$ to them. They barely checked me out, barely heard what I was saying, disregarded it because ""they know best"", and sent me on my way. Recently I've gotten another health care provider who are a lot better and seem to genuinely care about their patients. Yes, like many places they still feel rushed and busy but they try their best to help as best as possible and even if they can't address the concerns at the time of the appointment encourage their patients to call or reach out to them through the online messaging system. Previously I felt too burdening or even afraid to voice my questions and concerns, but now I feel welcomed and even encouraged. They want to make sure I'm fully aware of everything and they want to know everything so they can provide the best treatment. I feel like I'm both informed and have the ability to get the information and understanding I need. We're a team in this."
0.916700	I feel I am absolutely qualified to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.916700	I feel I have a really high degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services that I need to make appropriate health decisions. This is based on what doctors have said to me and things that I have asked them to understand and sometimes answer my questions. 
0.866700	I believe I can always obtain, process, and understand my basic health needs with regard to services being offered and health decisions I make.  
0.811100	i think i have a high degree to obtain this type of information.  I don't read everything i'm given (for example i don't read every single possible side effect of every medication, because that would take too long), but i am almost always able to obtain, process and understand the information and on the rare occasion i don't understand it, i know who to contact.
0.838900	I'm usually comfortable going to the doctor's office and usually I understand what is being said. But If I ended up getting a difficult diagnosis I would want someone other than myself to be there, to listen and understand what the health professional is saying because I would feel re assured on what was taking place.
0.883300	In matters of my health I will take the time to carefully absorb the information I am given to evaluate my situation. I will research any additional questions I may have and will utilize all people I have available to me that have a understanding of my situation.
0.722200	I feel that I've had enough services performed within the healthcare system that I understand a good deal of what information I'm given. I also feel empowered to ask pertinent questions where my knowledge and understanding fails me.
0.538900	I feel like there is certain jargon used to confused patients when it comes to medical practices because i usually don't understand what doctors tell me and feel very disadvantaging. I feel like i have limited capacity to understand basic health information because i not educated on the material they are telling me. Also, doctors do a poor job helping me figure out what it is exactly that is wrong with me and i'm scared i'm being treated as some test that they had to pass on an exam; not tailoring their expertise to my specific needs.
0.761100	I feel that I have a good understanding of the information that I am provided by my doctors and nurses, however I do not often feel that I have all of the information on potential alternatives available to me. I am also very confused by my health coverage and whether or not certain things will be covered as preventative care or if I will be billed for them to meet my deductible. This often makes me feel very stressed about talking to the doctors and bringing up additional symptoms or questions because I fear getting a large bill for tests that I may or may not have even needed.
0.888900	I am just a young adult so I have a clear enough mind to understand basic health information and services I need to make health decisions. When I don't understand something clearly, I can easily use the internet to search for more information, or perhaps contact a local health provider to ask questions in person.
0.883300	I feel like I have a firm grasp on how to access and understand basic health information as needed. My medical services have made both accessing and understanding health conditions incredibly easy with the use of phone apps and websites, as well as timely discussion through these mentioned means. 
0.844400	I completely feel that I have the knowledge needed to comprehend the information provided to me by my doctors.  The information is broken down into basic terms that can be understood by anyone who may be unfamiliar with medical terminology.
0.900000	I am educated and well-read. I have been reading about medical and health-related information from a young age. My mom is a retired RN and I learned a lot from her growing up. I oversee my elderly parents' medical care, requiring me to stay relatively current on a multitude of medical specialties. 
0.777800	I feel like I have a high degree of understanding of medical issues and what my Doctors are telling me. I am also not afraid to ask questions, if I don't understand or only partially understand. I like to take a piece of paper with questions written down with me to my apt if i have things i am curious about or don't understand. And when a doctor is telling me something I will stop them if I don't understand something. I'm not a doctor so I don't have to understand things, thats why i have a doctor and why it's important to ask questions when they are explaining things!
0.916700	I have a graduate degree. Although I have never had any medical training, I am familiar with the meanings of many medical terms. I have also studied Latin, and learned the Latin derivation of many terms. I once volunteered in a medical clinic, and learned terminology from a doctor there. He encourage me to go to medical school.
0.805600	I have a lot of trust in my doctors and will ask them to explain anything I don't understand. I'm also always free to call their nurses and assistants and they are always happy to be helpful. I'm good at researching things I might need to know as well, so I always feel I'm well informed when I need to make a decision.
0.588900	I'm competent, just as much as the average person. I know the basics about health to relate any problems and I've had enough experience getting hurt on how to either treat it or find someone who will treat it.
0.705600	I currently am injured and disabled and have been in this state for over 2 years. I see a doctor once a month minimum and see multiple doctors, physicians and health care professionals. Since i have been dealing with this type of stuff so frequently I have a pretty good grip on health care forms. The information gets a little more complicated as I have multiple doctors working with me and they all have a different opinion so in that regard i usually require more information from each individual doctor because I get so much new information every time. Deciding which services are needed is also a little more difficult since my problem falls into the chronic pain category so no one really knows exactly what to do to treat my problem so this gets a little tricky too since everything seems like a guess to see what works and what doesn't work.
0.744400	I feel that I can obtain the necessary information through reading provided materials and asking questions. Often, if I find something confusing I ask and get an in depth response that explains it
0.805600	The one thing I feel I don't have is an advisory function from the doctor.  They are really good at recommending a TON of tests and a million other things, but they rarely tell you how much that is going to cost, which is all out of pocket these days any way, and if it's really needed at all.
0.916700	I feel very confident in my ability to understand necessary health information. I also am competent on researching symptoms via the internet.  Overall, while I am not an expert by any stretch, I feel like I have a very good grasp on my health and what impacts my health.
0.600000	I feel that I can be able to get the help I need to process and understand information, but I do feel I miss out on a lot of information. I feel that when you go in doctors and nurses are on such push for time that the rush through a lot of the information. The often hand you paperwork when you first walk in that the rush you through. Next doctor are handing you paper work and talking really fast because the are behind schedule  and you are still try to process everything they just told you.
0.827800	I think I have the right tools and mindset to understand this information and for what I do not understand I would ask someone.
0.883300	I feel I am very capable of understanding basic health information. I am not afraid to ask question and get clarification when needed, I also research information for better understanding.
0.855600	"While I may not know that I am not asking a certain, necessary question of a doctor or nurse, it's simply because I don't know or understand enough. It's not that I'm not capable of understanding what the doctor/nurse is saying, It's just that I don't know I need to ask. I also issues with ""making waves"" so I will sometimes just ""go along to get along."" I do have a wife, who loves to ""make waves"" and a mother-in-law who is a nurse with nearly 40 years experience so even when I do miss something, one of them will usually understand it or figure it out."
0.700000	I am semi confident, I dont have alot of experience dealing with doctors so it is a little intimidating and I may not understand everything they are asking for or explaining. I feel like if I were to receive some type of document that was not completely clear I would ask for clarification regarding the questions. Maybe some of the terms used would not be something I know and dont want to sound dumb and would ignore but really important things such as conditions I may have or steps I need to follow I would ensure a clear answer from my doctor.
0.822200	I do not always feel confident that I am getting sufficient information from my doctor or nurse, so I always follow up with reputable medical websites. I especially find it important to review medication information because no one ever explains side effects.
0.883300	I feel that I am in a stable state of mind and am physically sound enough to deal with any condition I face. And as such I will be able to fully grasp and understand from my doctor what needs to be done of me to deal with the condition and fix it.
0.816700	I have my B.S. in Biology. I went to the college health center quite a bit and go to the doctor now for regular checkups where we have candid talk about whatever health issues might be occurring. 
0.777800	My family physician goes above and beyond to spend plenty of time with me during my visits. He makes sure I understand everything being said. Also, I am very versed in internet searches and know I can find a lot of useful information there.
0.916700	I am a bookworm who loves to read, I've been like this ever since I was a child. Therefore, reading and comprehending information, medical included, is not a problem for me.
0.700000	I feel that my abilities are more or less on par with the majority of the population. If I am given the tools and a rough idea of how they are used I feel I would have the capacity to navigate them. I would know where to find them or at the least who to ask to find out where to obtain them. I would have no issues processing or understanding them unless they used a lot of jargon. If they information was relevant it would likely help me make a health related choice.
0.722200	I feel like I am fully capable of making decisions upon and understanding basic health information.  I feel that I can grasp most concepts myself, if not there is usually a nurse or doctor willing to answer any questions. Additionally, I have access to the internet via smartphone, so I have essentially all of the knowledge in the world at my fingertips if need be.
0.822200	I believe that i possess the capability to understand basic health information to a high level of degree which helps me make andecision as to what is going to be the best decision regarding what action i should or should not take for my health benefit. I am good at understanding or comprehending and if not inwill ask questions.
0.583300	I have a problem with it cause i got my disease at 12 and my mom always helped me with my medical conditions so i have a hard time expressing things with doctors. So i am trying to get better on making my own decisions 
0.672200	I feel like I am experienced enough to understand things.Also I have a history working in the Medical field and I feel like it can be helpful to me in my personal situation.
0.816700	I feel fully capable of taking charge of my own health and that the current system gives me, as a native speaker and well-educated person, what I need
0.511100	I feel like I can understand if the Doctors / nurses take the time to explain it.  If they don't I look things up on the internet.  It can become confusing because there is so much information available online.  It is hard to get the Doctor to spend more than a few minutes with you.
0.750000	I feel like I have a lot of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.750000	I think that I have the capacity to do all these things. My conditions are not severe enough to disable me from being able to understand and comprehend the problems that lie within me.
0.766700	I consider myself to be smart so I can say that it is easy for me to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.900000	I am intelligent and I am good at coming to understandings and learning on my own how and why things work. Because of this I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.872200	I feel fairly competent in obtaining, processing and understanding the basic health information and services I need to in order to make appropriate health decisions. That being said, I find that I tend to get very emotional about health concerns during doctors' visits such that I don't think clearly. Hence, I often draw a blank when it comes to asking questions and so on. Once I'm at home and I become calm, I find that I can think about and articulate questions regarding the health information and services necessary.
0.888900	I think I have above average competence and ability to understand things.  I will generally do internet research on my own before seeing a doctor so I have a better understanding.  I generally do not need any assistance.  If I have questions I try to remember or write them down to ask the doctor.  Sometimes the doctors are too rushed and busy during an appointment.  That is very frustrating.  I am the type of person who wants to understand and ask a lot of questions.  At the same time, I am very intelligent and understand things quickly, as well as do my own research ahead of time in order to not waste time during the appointment.  Nevertheless, the doctors many times do rush me or make me feel that they are not interested in answering my questions.  The scariest thing is when they do not have the answers to my questions or are dismissive of my concerns or when I am using supplements that work that they have never heard of.
0.638900	I have a good understanding of my past medical procedures, allergies and current conditions.  I can convey this on the new patient or similar forms so the doctor can get my background.  I try to ask questions of the doctor when he comes up with a recommended treatment plan.  I use email correspondence with my doctor to follow up on any tests or labs. I primarily use Kaiser for my health care which stores all my medical records for easy access to any doctor. In fact, I recently moved to CO from CA, and the new Kaiser physician was able to transfer all my records locally. For prescriptions, I try to read about all the side effects and watch for them.
0.844400	I feel that I have the ability to learn and digest new information pertaining to making health decisions, because I listen to doctors, as well as research on my own.  
0.527800	I think i have a pretty decent capacity. I don't know much because I don't fall sick often and therefore my contact with doctors is very rare
0.900000	I feel that I have a strong capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am very confident in my research ability and the internet has reliable sources of information when you know where to look. Outside of the internet, I have access to health professionals that I can speak with or make appointments to meet if I have any concerns regarding my health or any health related decisions.
0.783300	When the doctor is talking to me and it's important some of the information just goes over my head for some reason. I guess because it's a lot of information to take in all at once. I am trying hard to understand everything and create a mental image. When I am processing the information I am thinking about the important things that are said. When it comes to understanding basic health information I retain the more important information and forget about the less important information causing me to ask what was said by having them repeating the less important information when I ask a question.
0.916700	Yes, I do.  However, even though I recently retired from 35 years of Nursing, I had real difficulty getting needed information when my mom broke her leg.  In most cases, I am able to figure out what questions to ask, or how to get further information.
0.838900	I usually understand enough information when given the appropriate materials to read. On some occasions, the terms are not all in plain English; but I usually ask questions if I feel it is vital to comprehend the enclosed.
0.844400	I feel very confident in my ability to receive and process basic health information.  I am pretty familiar with medical terminology and the medical industry, enough that I do understand the medical advice given to me by physicians and nurses.
0.872200	I think I have a very good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to help me make decisions. I am pretty smart and usually can figure things out
0.916700	I feel extremely confident in my ability to obtain and understand health information, whether obtained directly from a health care professional or from written literature.
0.816700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand what I need to do for my health. The problems that I have had in the process usually have been because the doctors don't have enough time for me or don't care explain anything because they think their patients are too dumb to understand. 
0.705600	I feel pretty confident when it comes to understanding basic health information. I took a few medical assistant classes in college because I was studying to be a medical assistant a few years ago. One of the classes was about understanding basic health information and also what some abbreviations and other important terms mean. It was a fun class. I feel that with my knowledge in this field, from school, that I have a little bit of an advantage compared to others when it comes to understanding basic health information and services. There is still some things I am probably not familiar with as I didn't get a degree in this field because I switched majors, but I feel that, overall, I have a pretty strong confidence and understanding in this area. 
0.483300	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. The problem is whether I am informed enough to make appropriate health decisions regardless of how many questions I ask. If I need to know something it should be TOLD to me, and if I need a procedure immediately it should be scheduled immediately instead of them ignoring me for a month and setting up an entirely different procedure without consulting anyone before a different doctor tells me that I needed something different the whole time.
0.916700	I know I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand all the basic health information and services that I need to make all the appropriate health decisions for myself and for my loved ones.  Recently, I have had to make health decisions for myself and I understood all that was necessary to make those decisions.
0.883300	I feel that I am fully capable of obtaining and understanding healthcare information. I have excellent reading comprehension skills and am adept at researching before before going to healthcare, that way I walk in armed with information and have a base of knowledge from which I can formulate questions from. 
0.694400	I believe that I have at least a baseline understanding about fundamental medical concepts and frequent issues that I experience, and am capable of doing research to find information that I don't fully understand. My ability to use Google generally contributes to my feelings of understanding.
0.800000	I feel like I can understand basic health info well.  I am a college graduate and a teacher so I feel my comprehension skills are very good.
0.866700	I feel I have a large capacity to deal with basic health information. Although I have never studied medicine, I follow developments in the field and enjoy reading professional journals. Though much of it goes over my head I feel I have a good understanding of medical conditions and possible treatments. I especially like to go to the doctor knowing in advance what he may say. Allows for a more detailed discussion.
0.816700	I write down and keep track of any questions or new information I have for the doctor so it can be discussed during my appointments I feel I understand my basic health information and services I require based on my health information. If I don't understand something my doctor said I always ask questions to make sure I understand.
0.861100	I am a former hospital RN. I left the field more than 30 years ago so I'm out of touch but I have enough training to know how to do research. What I don't have is the confidence to speak with doctors about what's bothering me, mainly because none of the ones I've seen so far have been interested, plus I always get the feeling that I'm taking up time that they don't have much of. It's very frustrating.
0.761100	I feel I am able to understand basic health information enough to make appropriate decisions. I feel this way because I have several chronic medical conditions and have had to fill out many medical forms in the past. I have more doctor appointments then the average person. Because of this I feel that I have a good understanding of what I am reading and what information I am filling out. 
0.733300	Sometimes I feel that I do not have a sufficient understanding of medical terminology to express to a doctor the concerns or problems I am having in a way that will help them to focus their treatment. I feel that often doctors are using a trial and error method of prescribing treatment and think that much of it could be because I am not communicating to them effectively.
0.783300	I feel I am capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information to make my health decisions. When I do have difficulty, I have no problem asking for assistance from my family members or even my doctor.
0.622200	I have the capacity to understand basic health information because I did not leave the doctor without explaining to me everything.  Asking is learning.  There are words that I can't understand that's why I always ask the doctor what it is just to clarify everything.
0.805600	I feel like I understand and comprehend more than many people do regarding my health information, as I am an active participant in my own health care.  I also have had several medical conditions so I am well-versed in many medical issues.  However, at the same time, medical things are very confusing and there are often times things I do not understand that doctors explain to me.  I often have my husband present with me for a second set of ears so we can both discuss our understanding afterwards.
0.811100	I have an average ability to understand health related topics when they are explained to me. Often I will do research on my own that sometimes conflicts with the information my healthcare providers give me so I need that explained

0.594400	I FEEL THAT I CAN TYPICALLY UNDERSTAND THINGS BEING EXPLAINED TO ME. I MAY HAVE TO TAKE NOTES AND RESEARCH THINGS LATER.
0.855600	I feel like, when it comes to being able to obtain, process and understand health information and things when making decisions regarding my health that I have a better than average capacity to make a well-informed decision and be comfortable.
0.788900	I think I understand most health information given to me. I ask questions when I don't understand what they are saying. If I still don't understand the information I will often times go reach out to someone else. 
0.811100	I can understand most of what I am told about my health from my doctors. If I don't understand something, then I will ask for further clarification. I am well aware of what my healthcare providers are communicating to me. I can make health decisions on my own, for the most part.
0.872200	I am competent  to understand the written and oral word of a medical practitioner. The only time I have had any problem is understanding why I have to take a certain medication. At first I got a lot of medical jargon that any layman would not understand. I made the doctor slow down and put it into plain English. I am still not totally satisfied with his answer not because I did not understand but I am suspect about the basic premise.
0.738900	As far as basic information, I think I can do OK.  I don't currently have any medical conditions and have not had any serious ones so far.  I am alright at looking up information online, but I know not to immediately think that my condition is too serious since most symptoms have some rare disease or issue that is fatal or life threatening.
0.916700	I beleive I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I ask questions and listen very well.
0.783300	I feel that I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I think obtaining the health information and services are easy to acquire through the 24 hour call service I have and through internet searches.

Through all the resources I have available for myself I believe that it's easy for me to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.705600	I feel like I can understand it pretty well after I do some research. When my doctor did testing for thyroid problems, I went home after the appointment and did a ton of research on it before I ever got the results. I wanted to make sure I knew what I was getting into. When she gave me meds, I went home to find out if there would be any side effects from it. 
0.750000	I feel as though I can understand basic health related information and instructions to an acceptable degree. If I am unsure of a certain medication or task given to me, I will usually consult a family member or go online for assistance.

0.772200	I feel that I typically obtain and process the basics when it comes to health information and services. With as much as I have had to go to the doctor, it almost is a natural thing for me to research more if I do not understand.
0.755600	I am not much of a verbal learner. Someone explaining something to me is far less likely to stick than if I can read the information and absorb it myself. I am a researcher.
0.883300	I feel confident in reading and understanding medical information that is spelled out for non medical professionals. I feel that I have basic understanding of health related issues. 
0.538900	I don't speak english that well so sometimes its hard to read written health information when I go to the doctors
0.916700	I am quite confident that I can understand the health information that is given to me by various health professionals.

To date I have not had any problems understanding the materials especially as they may apply to me.
0.883300	I feel very capable of understanding information that is presented to me, and also in performing research about the issues on my own time. I always ask for clarification when I need it, and I go to the doctor with the mentality that they are working for me.
0.916700	I have no problem understanding basic health information. My father was a doctor so I grew up around medical terms.I have never had any information that I could not understand.
0.883300	I feel I have a great capacity to obtain, understand, and process my health info and services.

Having gone through the process so many years give you the experience necessary to process and understand all the information given to you.
0.888900	I feel very capable of understanding health information.  I have a science background and read many books about health, disease control, etc.  I do believe there are racial disparities in health care that affect my access to the information, testing, etc., that I need, but with respect to understanding information, etc., I usually have no problem.  
0.533300	I feel that I can understand a large portion of the information given to me. I do struggle sometimes when being told information about medication and specific diagnosis. I don't like to ask the specific questions because I don't like to seem like I'm not smart.

I consider myself a smart individual and believe I use good reasoning when it comes to making decisions about my health.  I read well and understand medical literature.  I don't have a problem asking if I need more clarification.
0.622200	It really depends on how I feel. If I am in pain or severe discomfort my ability to understand complex issues drops dramatically. I don't go into a doctors office often for a checkup, so most likely the reason I am there is that I am not well. This can lead to my understanding of complex issues and situations being less than great.
0.777800	i have the ability to understand health information said to me or given to me. and i have not had any issues processing information said to me by a nurse or a doctor or health practitioner.
0.844400	I think in most cases I can understand what needs to be know. I enjoy reading when I can about even the possibility of a condition. What I don't understand I am capable of reaching out find out. 
0.677800	I think I'm pretty good with getting and understanding information to make proper choices. It does help though if I was given a list of alternatives like similar drugs, comparable specialists, or other methods of treatment. It helps if all documents are typed out and not hand written. It is so hard to read information when they have sloppy hand writing. I also like to have a bit of time to look over all documents, ask the right questions and come up with the best solution for myself. I don't like to be put under pressure to make a choice quickly.
0.711100	I mostly can understand, but I will often search online something I may not fully understand. I will also ask questions to my provider but will often follow up with looking for information online. 
0.861100	I am smarter than the average so I usually understand even complicated subjects quite well.  I am well educated as well.  I also have a great deal of experience from having to deal with some health issues with my parents.  I am quite familiar with common medical forms.  If I am unfamiliar with something at first, I can usually understand it after studying it for awhile.
0.688900	I sometimes feel that the Doctors and Nurses forget that I am the patient and don't understand all the medical terms and they sometimes make me feel stupid if I ask for more explanation. 
0.900000	I feel that all of the information I need about health related topics is easily accessible. The internet makes getting this information very easy.

0.916700	I feel that I have a very easy time obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information as well as the services that I have completed.  I work within the health industry so that helps me to feel more confident.  I also research my conditions and the services I receives prior to my appointment.
0.916700	I feel that I am in the prime of my life and that my thinking is clear and unobstructed.  I believe I can clearly convey my thoughts.  Therefore I believe that the channels of communication are open and that I can understand difficult concepts.
0.916700	I have the ability to fully obtain, process, and understand any basic health information that is given to me.

0.827800	I feel I can understand information to a basic degree. If something is too complicated, I am able to research the information myself and read it thoroughly to my understanding.
0.811100	I guess first I try to understand everything on my own. If I am still in the doctor's office I will ask a question.  Usually only once though.  I don't want to sound stupid by asking the same question over and over again, or repeated questions of different kinds.  Usually I manage pretty well on my own. but, sometimes I don't always understand medical jargon, or what certain blood reports show, but I have a couple of nurse friends that can help me.  I also know a pharmacist if I have a question about a drug.  
0.883300	I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information because six years ago I was a insurance agent. I was licensed in health care. I had to have educational training on new information(policies) that effect the client's selection of choice based on his/hers health.
0.711100	I feel generally capable. Whenever I have health concerns or change medication I tend to do some research online beforehand. Then, when I have an appointment with my physician I can ask relevant questions and confirm what I've read. I'm not always prepared for the amount of information certain medical paperwork requires me to know, but it's never prevented me from being treated.
0.888900	I believe that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic and intermediate health information and services. The times that I have had issues have been related to interpersonal misunderstandings and friction. 
0.916700	I fully understand what my healthcare provider has told me and I am capable of making appropriate health decisions.  The problem is that sometimes I don't tell the doctor the truth because I am embarrassed.

0.916700	I rarely have any issues understanding my doctor or a nurse and if something doesn't make sense to me I ask them to elaborate on what I don't initially understand.  I occasionally have an issue getting in contact with my doctor by phone but it's understandable as he's busy and it's rare that I actually need to contact him anyhow as he tends to explain things well and answer any questions I have during my visits.
0.916700	I see my doctor every 3 months and he always spends time answering my questions. In between visits I usually write down things I have a question about.. I just jot them on a piece of scrap paper.
0.850000	I can usually understand and process the information that I'm told or reading. Sometimes when reading, it's explained in such a way that is a little confusing, but when talking to someone, it's usually an easy concept to grasp.All in all, I generally understand the information I'm given pretty well.

0.866700	I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG FIBROSIS IN 2008 AND SINCE HAVE BECOME PRETTY ADAPT AT OBTAIN INFORMATION THROUGH THE INTERNET AND ASKING QUESTIONS OF MY DOCTOR AND NURSES. I GENERALLY KEEP SEARCHING OR ASKING QUESTIONS UNTIL I KNOW OR UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH MY CONDITION.
0.805600	I feel like have the capacity and understand to understand medical information. However, I always feel like doctors do not take out the time to answer questions properly because I always feel rushed to get out. A lot of the time I find my self researching what the doctors were rushing to explain.
0.838900	I think overall I have a good capacity to understand and process basic health information that medical staff present to me. Obtaining the information is relatively easy in my opinion. In terms of making proper health choices I feel that that is more of a grey area. The reason I say that is because I feel most doctors are very biased and will recommend things that may not be the best possible option for me.
0.705600	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions a little more than the average person. I understand most things the doctor tells me, and ask doctors or nurses to explain things I don't understand. 
0.655600	I feel as though I have the full capacity to fully understand what health literature is presented to me in the hopes of fully understanding my health outcomes.
0.827800	I feel like I'm more competent than most when it comes to the capacity to understand my health information. When doctors are not clear, I usually feel comfortable questioning them. I also feel comfortable researching my health issues independently. 
0.850000	I definitely feel I have the ability and capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information and services because my health is incredibly important to me and I am always diligent.  Between my doctor, credible online resources and friends and family, I thoroughly research prior to making health decisions.
0.794400	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed very well as long as the information is not given to me in terms that I don't understand, such as by using the name of a specific bacteria instead of just saying bacteria.
0.816700	I'm a fairly intelligent person, with good reading comprehension and critical thinking. On the rare occasion I need help understanding something, I have no issue asking for assistance. 
0.711100	I think I have the knowledge to get the basic health information and services I need to make the right choices for myself and my family. It is pretty clear whats asked and if I dont understand, I always make sure I ask questions.
0.827800	I think that I have the necessary knowledge to make educated questions or have a proper conversation about my health with my doctor.

0.811100	I feel I have a good understanding of most medical terms and I often do research before I go to an appointment.  I usually have an idea of what treatment will be recommended and I have my questions and concerns written down

0.650000	I feel that I have a reasonable understanding of health information and services; however, I do feel that there is a lot that I do not know or understand.  Sometimes I feel rushed and don't feel like I have the time to ask all of the questions that I would like.  
0.883300	I understand what I need to understand and what I have trouble with I will inquire about until I do understand. I was never one to be shy about asking questions because there are just too many things out there to expect that any one of us could know all the answers ourselves.
0.522200	I have a biology/medical background so I feel somewhat more prepared than the average person. I get frustrated when I feel like I am being talked down to by medical personnel.
0.827800	I comprehend most basic health information. I have been given diagnosis that I have had to say âwhat is thatâ on numerous occasions. The doctor explains and sometimes I fully understand and sometimes I donât. I have written down the diagnosis and researched further on Internet from Home. 
0.683300	I have so many health problems due to the Lupus, Sjogren's, and frequent infections. There are so many terms and conditions I am experiencing it is hard sometimes to retain the information. I oftentimes have to ask for clarification. I also have IBD and liver issues. Even if a doctor is rude, and I have had plenty of mean ones, I ask everything I can think of. It could be a matter of life and death, or just not feeling well. I have to get over my embarrassment and intimidation and ask what I need to. 
0.766700	For the most part I think I am able to understand basic health information.  Sometimes there are aspects of it that I don't grasp and that sometimes even asking for clarification I might still not get, but figure I can do more research online later as long as I remember the basics of what they told me.
0.777800	First of all, I usually will do some major indepth investigation upon my own to examine the facts, and then compare to what my medical staff is telling me, or suggesting that I do in their care. I absolutely do not put all of my faith in any one doctor or health professional, as many are simply wrong, or just doing what they are told to do by their superiors, which often is in the best interest of the pharmacutical and insurance companies. We as patients are sold to the highest bidder who then have control over our medical decisions. The outcome of my life is of no concern to these corporate entities, only the bottom line which determines the lowest cost factor for them, and the highest profit margins for the pharmacutical companies which the insurance provider can accept. It is in my best interest to know what these corporations are deciding, and through proper investigation, only I can really know if the medical care that I recieve is in my best interest.
0.883300	I feel that I have excellent ability to understand and process basic health information. I worked in the pharmacy field for several years and have medical professionals in my family and this helped me understand some medical terms and jargon much better.
0.811100	I usually am able to process the information that is given to me at the doctor's offices. I try to research as much as I can about what I do or might have before a visit that way when I actually go it's not as much of a surprise. There are occasional times I have a doctor explain something more in depth. There was only one time that I had a foot surgery and the surgeon was in and out in a minute I didn't even know what to ask. 
0.900000	I am self sufficient in filling out forms. If I do not understand them, I have no issue calling someone or talking to someone at the office of where the forms need to go. Usually all the forms I fill out for medical stuff, is pretty generic and I have no problems understanding the questions they are asking. If I did have a problem, I can always call the doctors office and talk to someone. Usually I fill them out there at the doctor, so if I had any questions, I would not hesistate to ask the front desk. If they didn't know, I would talk to the nurse or the doctor to get the help I needed.
0.850000	I am sixty three years old and have been to the doctor both on my behalf on the behalf of many family members with varying (including very serious as well as unusual) medical conditions, so I have had a lot of experience and know the vital importance of obtaining service and processing how to use it
0.866700	I ask my doctor or nurse to explain exactly what my health problem is.  With prescriptions, I ask the doctor what they are for, talk to the pharmacists to get a clearer idea of what the medicines do.  I also look up online at webmd or other medical websites. 
0.883300	i am pretty knowledgeable on health issues. if i dont know something, i am quick to research it on my own. google is my best friend and i use it a lot.

I am very confident that i can understand basic health information and make good health decisions based on my needs.
0.638900	I feel that most of the questions I have are answered. I am pretty knowledgeable myself but there are times where if feel like I need to ask about them. When I do. i feel i have the right resources to make it happen and feel confident if they don't know the answer. they can find someone who does.
0.883300	I feel that I am extremely qualified to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I am a retired pharmacist with 40 years of experience. Hope this won't disqualify me. I have to say that I am EXTREMELY grateful for my education and background because of the health care experience I had from July 2016 to Feb 2017. I have very good knowledge in researching information when I need to.
0.350000	I have a difficult time understanding medical terminology because it is so complicated and scientific. I often times need someone to verbally explain to me what a specific term or symptom means. Most of the time I feel lost and that I do not understand the cause of my symptoms or that I am just clueless why the health issue is occurring. When a doctor tries to explain it to me, I lose focus quickly because they are speaking too fast and talking about medical issues I am not educated about.
0.783300	I feel truly confident in my capacity to make appropriate health decisions. I can understand what the doctor says, and if I do not understand I am able to ask questions and clear my doubts. 
0.844400	I feel confident enough to understand basic and somewhat more complex health related information, services to ensure that I will be taking the correct approach to treating such health conditions. Anything that is out of the ordinary or too complex I would probably ask for a more thorough breakdown of what it is what I will be dealing with.
0.738900	I feel I can understand medical information if it is laid out in a comprehensible format. However, I often think that important details are left out of the information I get due to lack of time by my medical professionals or a breakdown in communication due to the bureaucracy of the healthcare industry.
0.900000	I feel confident in being able to understand basic health information and services because I find that the forms are rarely difficult to follow and I have no problem asking questions and figuring what I need to do/understand my health.
0.838900	I feel very confident in my own capacity to obtain and process basic health information. I have never had a problem with this in the past. 
0.900000	I feel that I can work through most health related decisions fairly well. Written materials are usually concise enough but I ask a lot of questions if I don't understand.
0.900000	I find basic health information easy to obtain and understand. If the information that the doctor or nurse provides does not make sense to me I ask questions until they can explain it in my terms. As far as I know, I've never had an issue gaining information for basic health decisions.
0.838900	For the most part, I'm pretty confident in my ability to get information about my health and use it to make decisions. The interplay between doctors, the practice they work for, insurance companies, multiple departments...etc. can be obscure at times, but not to the extent that it would seriously effect my health choices. 
0.605600	I have the capacity to obtain and process material but sometimes there are medical vocabulary that I need someone to explain.
0.666700	I know how to get the information or help I need. I do like outside imput when there are medical decisions to be made. In the past Iâve felt Drâs donât adequately explain issues.
0.833300	I feel as if I have a decent understanding being able to understand the term of medical terminology. I also understand when my health is declining i know that I will have to go see a doctor to check on my health and receive treatment. 
0.627800	Although I can understand every day conversations, medical info can be difficult to read and interpret. There is often a lot of language that is unfamiliar and concepts that are not common. Sometimes when a doctor is speaking to me I don't feel comfortable asking questions as it seems as if I should be following.
0.861100	I feel I have a high degree to make appropriate decisions based on my 5 year university degree and subsequent work in a field providing health care. Therefore I feel comfortable making sure I ask all the right questions to understand my treatment to the best of my ability
0.883300	I have been thru enough doctor and gospel visits that I can surely read and comprehend everything in the paper work and when speaking to a healthcare specialist
0.838900	It is fairly easy for me to understand what is going on with my health. I subscribe to my hospital and physicians' online service which supplies me with results of lab tests, clinic notes, and appointments. I have learned to navigate this online service fairly well. My biggest complaint is that some of my doctors don't adequately use the system so I still have to contact their offices for simple or routine matters.
0.777800	I feel that I am capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate heath decisions. 
0.838900	I feel, I understand most of the medical information I am given. If I do not I either ask the appropriate professional (Doctor, Nurse, Pharmacist, etc.) or I use a reputable website such WebMD.

0.866700	I have very good nurses and doctors that are always willing to help and answer any questions. Our insurance also provides us with a nurses hotline if we need to ask any questions. When I fill prescriptions the pharmacists are always very helpful and make sure I understand everything. I also have several nurse friends that are always willing to answer any questions.

0.888900	I feel good about receiving and looking for any health information that is given to me. If I have been diagnosed with something, I always ask as many questions as possible as well as looking up information on the Internet and library. 
0.866700	I feel very confident in my ability. Especially nowadays, when you can google and read more about any topic, I am sure that I could understand any medical information and make solid decisions. I might feel a little pressured in an appointment where the medical professional didn't have a lot of time to spend with me, but I would just go home and learn more about the topic through research, and call back for more info if necessary. I also have a great, experienced family who would help me understand anything I had questions about.
0.566700	I have the basic understanding of medical services. Most times if I need help to understand something I ask a family member or I go on  the internet. I live by myself so I usually call a family member with my questions. I find that the internet is really helpful with my meds and diagnosis that I have received.  Online it is really easy to understand. The only problem with that is that there's a lot of information on the web and it can get confusing sometimes. So mostly I will ask my family members or the doctor.
0.777800	Often forms are easily to fill out because they cover most concerns. Sometimes doctors do not ask if there are any questions and sometimes I forget to provide the questions. Mostly I understand or will look on  the web.
0.794400	I have a degree in kinesiology - an above-average knowledge of anatomy and physiology - and I still sometimes get lost in what doctors are trying to get at. I think sometimes doctors oversimplify in an effort to connect to patients and miss out on key words and important information.

0.661100	I prefer to talk about my health issues, concerns, problems with my husband. Often he sees things in a different light and his input helps me see all of my options and understand things better. I do feel I am capable of making any decision on my own but I'm more comfortable talking things over with my husband.
0.900000	I am quite confident that I can understand many aspects of medical terminology. I rarely have problems when speaking to doctors, nurses or medical staff and have never had a problem filling out forms.
0.861100	I'm positive I can obtain and understand basic health information. I'm a medical assistant, it's my job to have a basic understanding of human health and to ensure that our patients have an in depth understanding of their own health issues.
0.544400	I feel that the degree is difficult. I think most information is presented in a manner mentioned to confuse patients about what the real cost involved are.
0.705600	I feel like I understand most of the processes and information regarding my health. There are times that I don't completely understand, but I have my mom help me with those instances. I have a rare illness, so sometimes it's complicated to answer certain questions just due to the severity of my illness and the fact that my illness isn't completely understood by medical professionals.
0.861100	Filling out forms and explaining symptoms and circumstances are not a problem. I only ask basic questions when it comes to medical visits. As a fast paced person, I do not ask extra questions. 
0.900000	I am fluent in English and have college schooling so I am very confident in understanding basic health information. There is also a lot of information on the internet that has helped me make appropriate and more informed decisions. 
0.888900	I can understand whatever the doctor tells me, whether spoken or written, If I need to I can research further online later. But a lot of that depends on the doctor too, some doctors explain things well, others just kind of assume you already know.
0.866700	I think I have a pretty good ability to process health information. Most importantly, I am not hesitant to ask questions. I go in to a lot of appointments having done research online beforehand, so I am typically prepared with several questions already in hand. Once the health professional gives me more and/or better information, I repeat it back to them in simpler terms to make sure I've understood correctly. With online resources, a close family, helpful friends and quality insurance provider who gives me access to good doctors, I feel like I have the ability to obtain knowledge and support pretty easily before making any health decisions.
0.744400	Although medical jargon can be difficult to understand I feel pretty confident in filling out any medical forms necessary.  My reading comprehension is very high so I feel confident that even if there's terms or conditions I don't understand I can usually figure out the meaning by reading the context of the sentence.  Also, if I need to I can do research on my own and usually do concerning any symptoms I display.
0.866700	I have above average ability to understand written information. If I don't understand a work or jargon, I look it up on the internet. I reread to make sure I know how the condition may affect me. I feel pretty confident I understand the side effects of drugs before I take them. 
0.805600	I feel I am very capable.   Most older family have me go with them to important doctors appointments because I make sure to ask when confused and not leave to we have everything we need and fully understand.  If something pops up after leaving I do not hesitate to contact the doctor again by phone.  Understanding health is so important  so I make it a priority to get the info needed.
0.827800	I believe I can easily understand general and common medical terms and I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision. I usually seek for a second opinion or wait on exams before making any decisions pertaining my health or procedures I agree upon. I am very prone to do extra research should any health issues appear and try to gather all the information I can and bring all questions to a doctor, although it mesmerizes me the lack in tests and exams I see in the health industry, most diagnostics are given based on symptoms and not exams. 
0.855600	I have had no issues in the past with understanding what I am supposed to do and medicines I am supposed to take.
0.850000	I'm 52 and have a fair amont of experience with health issues and the care provided. I've yet to fail to fully understand everthing provided to me in a healthcare setting.
0.555600	At times it becomes difficult to understand what is wrong with me and I need multiple explanations to try understand what to do and where to go from there.I feel like I can understand what is happening but only at the bare minimum since I get lost at times when the doctor explains in an understanding where I have no clue what is happening so I need explanations that I can understand. At times I don't have everything to make a health decision.
0.850000	I have a PhD in public health, so I am generally pretty knowledgeable about health related issues. When I am uncertain about particular health conditions or my family history of disease I usually ask my mother, a nurse, for help.
0.555600	I think that I am capable of figuring out and making concious healthcare decisions when I am faced with it. I understand the services and what is required of me and I fully comprehend what my health care provider is telling me.
0.733300	I feel that when I have the time to discuss my health with a doctor or nurse that I can generally understand the information they are giving me.  Sometimes, when time is a factor and I have been given written information, that information is not always clear.  In those instances, it can be confusing and difficult to get a hold of someone to answer my questions.
0.827800	I feel like I am moderately able to understand and process the information. With the help of better educated friends and family I am able to get a better understanding without much trouble.
0.738900	I feel that I have a good sense of common medical terms and services.  If there is something I am not sure of or fully understand, there are a lot of resources available to me such as Google.  I am comfortable researching this on my own.
0.788900	"I feel pretty educated on my health conditions and feel confident in my doctors.  However, there are times when I still don't feel I have all the information I need to make health decisions.  Often, doctors are unable to ""dumb down"" language to the point where a lay person could understand.  Additionally, I feel that my time with doctors is limited.  I rarely feel that I have had as much time as I wanted.  Insurance forms are also very difficult to understand.  I almost feel like I need to have a lawyer look over everything!  Often the receptionists do not seem educated in health language."
0.800000	I was a certified CNA at one point and have worked in the healthcare industry for several years. I have a high capacity to understand basic healh information to make health decisions for myself. I will always ask doctors to explain anything I do not understand until I can understand it fully.
0.855600	I think I have the skills that I need to take care of myself. I haven't had much trouble understanding any of my medical conditions. I would consider myself fairly literate when it comes to my health.
0.838900	I have worked in healthcare and I make sure to understand my medical conditions/medications as well as I can. I don't always think of the right questions in the moment, but I'm a curious person and want to stay up to date with new info.
0.850000	I have worked in the healthcare industry in several capacities over the last 15 years.  I believe I have an up-to-date knowledge of medical jargon and definitions to be able to obtain, process and understand basic and even intermediate health information.
0.711100	I am a visual learner, yes, but I have more than enough competency to ask and re-ask questions that I need until I have information that is not only useful but coherent. I will read instructions and carefully write myself notes so I don't forget anything. 
0.916700	I feel I have a strong ability to obtain, process and understand basic health and services information in order to make appropriate decisions.  If I have any questions, I actively seek out information.
0.883300	I'm a senior citizen now I'm told. I'm 63 years old. I have always tried to make sure I communicate with my doctor, dentist, etc regarding anything to do with my health. I do ask questions or I call, or e-mail people to explain things to me. I also do this for my husband who is 69 years old. Since he signed up for Medicare I had to make many phone calls to understand different things. 
0.744400	I feel I have a pretty good capacity. I am too shy to ask the questions I should of my provider. And I rarely share all of my concerns with my  psychiatrist because if I do he'll probably have me change my medications or increase my visits. And I don't give my general practitioner all the info she needs to help me as it may cause more tests or drugs.
0.916700	When I go into the doctors, I always have a list of questions that I need to have answered and hopefully I can come up with more if I am very concerned about the condition. Most of the doctors or nurses that I have encountered have been very helpful and open to answering all my questions and relieving any concern that I did have. I have taken health courses and do have a general idea of what is going on. Also, I try to do as much research as possible before an appointment so I don't go in there completely naÃ¯ve to the condition. 
0.850000	I believe I have a huge capacity to understand basic health related information. I have worked in the health care field since I was 15 years old and have had many hours of training in medical terminology. I enjoy health related topics and understanding human anatomy. Itâs a passion to heal people.
0.772200	I feel strongly that one, due to the get them in and out in 15 minutes has to often go to outside sources to help with their own health care. It often takes longer to fill out forms pre doc visit than the time that is spent with a person and that they only glance at the forms. Thankfully there is google and many other seach engines and websites and forums where one can practically, at least with simple maladies, get all the information they need.  I feel personal I have the capacity, I feel strongly that doctors and nurses do not take the time to explain as they should. 
0.700000	I think my only concern is the way that technical terms are explained to the patients, since they don't know educationally
0.900000	I think I am able to understand the heath related questions. Sometimes I may not be clear on the problem or I might come home and forget to ask a question to the doctor 
0.883300	Between google scholar and the amount of time I spend reading about health and medicine I feel fairly confident that I know what the doctor is talking about, and when I don't, that I have the base knowledge to ask the right questions. 
0.827800	My doctor is very good at taking her time and explaining things. My family is in a few health occupations and explain a lot to me too. I read about staying healthy.
0.883300	I believe that I am capable and qualified to understand basic health information and services needed and to make appropriate health decisions because I have a scientific and medical background which has familiarized me with a variety of medical concepts and terminology. My familiarity with medical concepts comes from my undergraduate degree in biochemistry as well as my prior professional employment in the pharmaceutical industry.
0.883300	I feel I have the capacity to understand materials presented to me. I also feel like I know how to form questions to get the answers I need. I do not struggle communicating with health care professionals.
0.900000	I have been with the same doctor for about 15 years. I am very comfortable asking him questions about any issues I have. I do not feel like he rushes to get me out of the office. He takes his time and answers my questions. He is thorough in all my health care needs.
0.833300	I feel mostly confident in my capacity to do the above. With the Internet as a resource if there is something in a pamphlet that seems unclear to me I can often do some reading to clear up any confusion. I am comfortable with my doctor and he answers my questions well. I have had doctors in the past that answered my medical questions as though I were another doctor. Sometimes that made understanding my conditions or the decisions that were being made regarding them difficult to understand. I think doctors just need to remember that sometimes the most simple way for them to explain something might not be as easy to understand for some of their patients.
0.916700	I am a college educated individual and believe that I have the mental capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have health insurance and regularly go to my primary care physician and eye doctor for frequent check-ups. The key is to be honest with your doctors on any potential issues that I might be having.
0.900000	I feel I understand the majority of the information given to me by my providers. I have studied in the medical field and therefore already know the basics and a lot of speciality information. The information that I have trouble with or know nothing about I know to ask my provider to fully explain and tell me what values are suggested for lab/image results if a part of the diagnosis.
0.900000	I understand my medical history and my doctor has taken the necessary time to discuss it with me.  I am a member of a good health group and can also find a lot of information on the website.

0.900000	I feel most confident regarding my healthcare and health conditions. I worked in the field of medical care for over ten years and had the privilege of working with many great physicians and nurses. I have a good understanding of medical terms and feel comfortable with reading medically focused materials, including conditions or diagnoses that I may be faced with.
0.900000	I feel highly confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. If I ever have any questions, I make sure to ask either a health professional, someone who has personal experience with what I am inquiring about, or check online for further explanations/information. I have a personal interest in health care (i.e., taking proper care of myself and others as well as attempting to understand things that I may hear about and could be something of use in the future). Both my father and brother work in the medical field and I actively listen(ed) when they share what they know. My educational background is primarily in Psychology, but I have taken a few medical courses as well. I feel that having a good understanding of how the human body works is important and know that, if something is ever slightly difficult to understand on my own, I can find answers somewhere.
0.900000	I feel that I have a high degree of confidence in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic healthy information and services I need to make appropriate health decision.
0.633300	I can understand most of the basic questions. The problem that I have is when the doctor or nurse use medical terms in which I've never heard of or when I'm filling out forms. So I can and feel confident that I can obtain basic or certain information to make the appropriate health decisions. I just can't do it when it gets too technical. 
0.622200	I feel as tho I have could handle all that basic information. As long as I can have all the information I would need I should not be that hard.
0.833300	I feel I have enough experience with going to many  Doctors that I can get most of the information that I need to determine what is the best way to approach the medical situation.
0.761100	I feel very confident about my ability to make health decisions. All of my doctors belong to the same health system and have access to my medical records.  This is useful for when they need to prescribe something - they have immediate access to see what else I'm taking to be sure something new won't interfere.
0.900000	I have easy access to the answers that I need for any medical information.  A hospital is very close to my whose and I can use Google to find out whatever I need to know.  Also, I have friends and acquaintances who are on the medical field who I can ask questions.  Anytime a doctor explains something to me, they usually say it in a way that I can easily understand.  Also, they never use big medical words that I can't understand.  It's very easy to simply ask the doctor everything you need to know about any medical condition that you have.  
0.750000	I feel for the most part that I am intelligent enough to grasp basic health concepts and am able to make choices based on the information provided.  If any concepts are above my head I am able to communicate that and confirm what are the facts.
0.533300	I think that i definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed. My biggest issue that sometimes i dont get is that sometimes doctors will prescribe medication without knowing what my diagnosis is. That is something i have a hard time understanding sometimes and it can be hard to get a straight answer out of my doctor.
0.733300	I believe in listening to what my doctor tells me about my health. When I don't understand the information I'm given, I ask for it to be explained until I get it.  I like to know what type of medicine to buy, what to eat, what not to eat, what I should be doing for my health. Also the internet helps a lot, if I need more clarification on something I research it more and get more information
0.616700	i can understand basic health information provided by my doctor or nurse. Sometimes i need someone to explain to me  what exactly my medical papers telling me and what i need to do and sometimes hard to make my health decision i don't understand all my medical papers provided by my doctor or nurse and needing someone else to explain to me. 
0.777800	I have access to many resources to be able to make health decisions. Those resources include doctors, nurses, medical books, and the internet.
0.916700	I think my ability to understand and comprehend medical terminology when it comes to reading medical information given to me by a doctor is sufficient.  The majority of times  I get information from a doctor though it may have some medical terminology most of the information is easy to comprehend.  This is what gives me the confidence to say that I can be able to understand most of what the doctor writes me in a medical form.
0.772200	Are usually donât have any issues when it comes to reading information documents reports that concerning my medical issues it is pretty much easily comprehendible and usually thereâs always somebody on standby you call his ass questions

0.900000	I feel that I am capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information given to me by a health care provider so I am able to make an informed decision. I generally know what questions I need to ask to get the information I need, and try to give doctors and nurses enough information for them to treat me effectively. I occasionally ask for assistance from my wife recalling dates of shots and so on when filling out forms, but I donât think that is unusual. I think I am as capable as most people of making appropriate health decisions. I have some hearing loss, so it is helpful to have my wife along when discussing things with a health care worker so I donât misunderstand or nor hear something, but I can comprehend what is being said and am able to make necessary decisions.
0.722200	When it comes to basic issues I feel as though I have the ability to interpret them on my own.  However, when we start to get into more complex issues I often need someone with knowledge to make the explanation easier for me.
0.672200	I feel that I have the intellectual capacity to comprehend what I'm told.  The problem is that both I and the medical professionals I'm speaking with are working with a time limit that does not allow for an actual question-and-answer session or a real mutual understanding.
0.916700	I AM TOTALLY CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING HEALTH INFORMATION AS I HAVE A MASTERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS WORKED MOST OF MY WORKING YEARS IN THE HEALTH FIELD.

0.677800	I am very in-tune with my own physical and mental health, and when I believe there is an issue I need to discuss with a doctor I seek out the appropriate resources. The internet is a wonderful tool to research different things and determine the right questions to ask. I also work in the medical field so I understand the logic and reasoning of doctors. So when I am told something about my own health, and if I don't understand any aspect of what I'm told, I know to ask them t explain in a different way until I can make an informed decision.
0.755600	I feel confident that I do understand basic health information. If I have questions, I will first try to ask the medical staff. If I still do not understand, I try to do research online. After reading more information, I will then go back to my doctor and ask relevant questions until I fully understand.
0.900000	I think I have a pretty good understanding of many conditions, especially those that I am dealing with. I have diagnosed myself long before a doctor could. I enjoy learning about medicine and feel confident in my decision making.
0.755600	"Yes, because there is this thing called Google.com. Google.com is a search engine that allows anybody to have the world's knowledge at the tip of their finger. You can search for ""How to walk your dog?"" to ""How to implement brain surgery?""."
0.883300	I generally feel like I am able to understand almost all of what my doctors tell me.  If I have difficulty with materials, I am capable of googling the correct information.  I often help others interpret medical information.
0.788900	I do a lot of research online usually before I see the doctor. I am sensible about it though and just use the information so when I talk to the doctor I know what they are talking about usually. I think medicine is very interesting but I do have an anxiety disorder that prevents me from seeking all the proper care I need. I generally understand what I am told and if I don't I usually ask or research it later. 
0.666700	I think I have the ability to make my own health decisions because I am very smart. I can process information then make a decision.
0.883300	I definitely feel I have the capacity to use information to make health decisions, largely because I have had the opportunity to work with and around a variety of different clinicians and am comfortable with medical jargon.
0.850000	I do research ahead of time so I can try to ask the best questions. I have good enough mental fortitude to process the information given to me and ask the right follow-up questions. I can think about things afterwards to help me best.
0.794400	I do feel that i have the ability to read, understand and process all basic health information that any doctor or nurse may give me or anyone i know.

If i need or want more information after my visit, i would then google it and do my own research. 
0.805600	I feel as though it's completely in my control in how I obtain and understand my health information and the services provided to me. I don't have any issue asking for help and if I don't understand something I'm not afraid to admit it and ask for an easier explanation in terms I can fully understand.
0.883300	I feel like I have basic general knowledge about medical needs.  If I have questions and need additional information, I will either ask my doctor or nurse, or look up the information online.  Normally I can find out the information easily and without much issue.
0.916700	I think that I have the capacity to understand any of the basic and non basic health information from any of the services and am able to make good decisions also.  I think that if I had any misunderstandings or questions then surely I could talk with one of the health professionals and gather a appropriate amount of understanding for the question.
0.916667	I think i'm very able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I don't have a problem understanding things and I have a great deal of common sense.

The clearer you can be about the requirements, duties, and responsibilities of the job and what kind of person you're looking for, and the better you can represent these in your advertising for the job, the less time you'll have to spend reading applications from inappropriate candidates.

Organizations often have to include job descriptions in proposals for new programs or positions. Sometimes, the act of composing the job description changes the whole course of the proposal, as people realize that they can use a position in ways they hadn't considered, or that what they had originally conceived was, in fact, unworkable.
