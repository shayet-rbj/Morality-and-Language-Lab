0.800000	She never seems rushed with me, and she will always take the time to research an issue to make sure she's considered every possible solution. There was a time when I felt her treatment recommendation was too drastic, but she had no problem referring me to a specialist.
0.680000	My doctor wants to give his all, but the time crunch between patients can make it difficult for him.  
0.760000	I like that the dr takes the time to listen and make sure to understand what is going on and to make me feel like a person that can get better and do well.
0.800000	Typically when I see a doctor, they are a medical resident. I actually feel more confident in this situation because I know that if there is any doubt, they will seek more information through their attending. I would say I usually trust the doctors I see, but I do like to keep myself informed by other means as well, just in case.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because he is highly trained in his field. But distrust him because most doctors are in the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies.
0.800000	I don't see any reason not to trust him. He's a medical professional who's been to school and been in practice for many years. It's his job to know what he's talking about.
0.680000	I trust a doctor because they wouldnt have gotten here if they did not do well in medical school. 
0.800000	I have always had a good experience with her and she seems willing to answer questions and explain things. For the most part I trust her. She seems very intelligent and like she thinks before she speaks.
0.800000	In general my physician does a thorough job. Never seem to be in a rush or anything.
0.800000	All in all over the years going to the doctor has been a pleasant experience. The doctors I have visited have been kind and helpful. One reason I think I have such a positive opinion of doctors is because I rarely use them. 
0.800000	I have had a long doctor/patient relationship with her and she always remembers the different reasons for which I have seen her and follows up. 
0.640000	I guess it is I trust my doctor to make decisions and help find answers. It is the unexplained sickness or pain that seems like all doctors avoid. You always have to see several doctors instead of just a few and that's when it seems like your being pushed through the system. If someone finds something, or another test is run.. I want to know why.. and what the findings are. Some don't let you know anything after tests are done.
0.520000	I don't completely trust anyone. I consider my doctor's advice but if it doesn't sounds logical or address my issues, I ask for clarification. Sometimes I seek another opinion or research the problem. 
1.000000	Personable and sharing, shows interest in and concern for all of his patients. That he listens to my questions and opinions is obvious to me from his answers and reactions.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because he is well trained and experience in his field of study or profession 
0.360000	I typically do not trust doctors. They seem to be rushed and not look at people's problems as a whole. I hate when doctors only want to look at one problem that you have and not look at your body as a whole.
0.720000	I pretty much trust my primary care doctor. She is friendly and easy to talk to. Sometimes I do feel like she is a little preoccupied with other things and in a hurry. But over all I think I receive adequate care from her.  
1.000000	I've been going to the same GP for over 11 years now, so he knows all of my medical history and suggests what I should do to better improve my health. Usually he knows right away and can diagnose what is wrong with me when we talk and i get treated in a quick office visit.
0.760000	i think that some doctors dont think about you as a person more of a name when they call you a few doctors do care a try to help you but a lot of them see you so fast they cant really know whats going on just prescribe medicine
0.600000	Doctors really don't spend much time with you then they always send you to the lab for everything when at times a lab report is just another waste of time 
1.000000	I have gone to the same doctor my entire life. He has been my family's doctor for many years. My family and I trust him completely. He has always been very honest and has always taken the time to answer all my questions.
0.720000	While I do trust my doctor in general, I think it's always a good idea to do your own research and educate yourself as well before coming to any fil decisions about anything. 
0.720000	At times I feel I can trust doctors but there have been times that I have been uncertain with a few doctors.
0.360000	I never completely trust anyone.  I think that all doctors are purely in it for the money first and patient well being a distant second.  
0.800000	When someone goes to a Dr, it's a serious step.  They need to trust what the Dr has to say.  It's ok to ask questions and do independent research.  A Dr should be looked at as part of the team that helps to take care of you.  Ultimately, it resides within each of us to take persol responsibility.
0.640000	My PCP I easy to talk to and seems non judgmental when giving me advice.  Plus she explains  things to me in plain, clear English not a bunch of medical jargon, that's why I trust her.
0.680000	it is just a normal thing to do.  I have never had a reason to not true a doctor with a diagnosis they know what they are doing
0.800000	My doctor has never steered my wrong. I've never been misdiagnosed . my doctor always answeresany questions or concerns. They also double check my symtoms and make sure I'm not fogetting to tell them something
0.600000	I just feel at times I am more of a # than a patient. In and out quickly without always listening to me. I. The past I have had to go to the doctor 3 or 4 times for the same issue before that issue is actually dealt with. That sucks to me.
0.320000	He would rather talk about himself and laugh at his jokes than pay attention to my needs.  I can get whatever prescription I would like, just by asking. He doesn't remember from one visit to the next anything about me.  When he is not laughing and not paying attention, he has his nose in that stupid computer of it.   
0.760000	I have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I have been with this same doctor since I was a child and he has been very courteous and helpful with my medical needs. My doctor is located in a small facility so there are not that many patients he sees in a day. The care is very personal and positive. He has a way of talking to people that is very relaxing and comforting to everyone he sees. There has never been a time that I have doubted the advice or treatment he has given me.
1.000000	Kind observing on top of her business professional and a patient lover prompt just a all around good person
0.760000	I trust my doctor because they know better than me, also i would know or feel if the doctor is not being honest with me. I have my wife to help me too or guide me. My primary care physician has been my doctor for years and he has helped me a lot on different things so I have built a trust for him.
0.960000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician. Doctors are very educated about health and they know much more than i do about whats going on inside of me, so if i am told by my doctor that  i need to take certain meds or do a certain thing to fix a problem i am having, i will absolutely do it.
0.640000	my main dr is a va dr. I trust her for the present time. sometimes I feel that she is just searching for a problem and a cure. but overall I am pleased with what she has done.
0.720000	I trust my doctor but will also do independent research to see if there are other options that my doctor is not aware of.  I also prefer to discuss medications with a pharmacist.
0.600000	I can see through pushes some doctors make when it comes to medications and the financial benefit to them, but overall I do trust them and believe they have my best interest at heart.
0.800000	I have been exposed to very well trained doctors. I usually only visit medical centers that have top-notch doctors. As a result, I trust all of past and current primary care physicians.
1.000000	I trust my primary care doctor because he will refer me to a specialist if he is unaware of anything. I trust my ob gyn because he is knowledgeable, easy to talk to, respectful, he listens, he gives me options. Both my physicians listen and do research. 
0.680000	i trust him we are from a small town and see him al the time. he always ask how we are doing and remembers everything
0.880000	I go to my GP with a concern about something, and even if she doesn't think that is what is happening, she will still follow through in checking herself, or else she will give me a referral to a physician that can give me peace.  Every specialist I have from her referrals has been just as interested, and just as careful to handle my concerns as my primary.
0.520000	It is not that I have no Trish is doctors just I am squrimess around needles. I just am not a fan of going.
0.880000	My doctor usually takes plenty of time to talk about my concerns; I almost never feel rushed. She is kind, concerned and considerate
0.360000	My dr is thorough and goes through everything in detail if I have any questions I will ask they have an answer
0.720000	My doctor gives you options and lets you pick what is best for you. So if he said this is the only option I would most likely believe him. Plus he would probably refer me to a specialist. So I would have a second opinion with the specialist.
0.800000	He has been my doctor for over twenty years, and he takes the time to make sure to explain everything well to me. I ask a lot of questions and he always takes the time to answer in detail.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because he has never done me wrong. My old doctor was and old arrogant man that was not sympathetic to my problems and concerns so I know a good doctor when I get one.
0.720000	i trust my doctor the are very good and care about my needs and questions.i see him twice a year and do tests
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he is honest with me and answers all my concerns. I feel confident that he has my own best interest whenever I visit his office. He is suggestive and offers advice to help me maintain a healthy lifestyle.
0.760000	My doctor is very concerned about my questions and always listens to me so that help me develop trust.
0.560000	I think most doctor's have the best intentions but are rushed or pressured by external forces (billing, administration, etc) to make decisions that aren't always right.
0.760000	I don't have a regular doctor's but the doctor's I've been to has be really trusting.They all ways tell me what I need to know.
0.760000	my dr is conservative-He does not jump to meds etc That approach is equal to mine so we are on teh same page  He is a caring man also
0.760000	In trust that my physician will tell me every truth I need to know. Referrals are always good. There hasn't been a reason yet to not fully trust in my physician.
0.440000	I don't necessarily trust physician's opinions a hundred percent of the time because they can be wrong like anyone else. One physician is just one person's opinion. 
0.880000	I trust my physician because she has known my family for a long time and I know she would never do anything to double cross us. She is very knowledgable and is always very in depth with her examition of me, which shows that she cares. She speaks to me like a person and makes me feel comfortable, instead of trying to just prove how smart she is like some doctors do.
0.520000	My current primary care physician is only concerned about getting my appointments over with. I don't have time to talk about issues with her and doesn't inform me about my health. I'm searching for a new physician because I do not have trust in my current one.
0.440000	Doctor now a days don't act concern I at all  always in s hurry and don't listen my doctor prescribed me meds and my other doctor asked why was I taking two meds that shouldn't go together. I was so mad.
0.880000	If I can not trust my doctor I am in big trouble.  Most of the time he is correct and only has our best interest at heart.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because they never beat around the bush to tell me the truth, and make sure that I'm feeling as good as possible. They always have a way to cheer me up, and lessen painful experiences. 
0.760000	Because he is always honest with me about my health. I trust him because he is reliable, understanding, loving,and a very respectful person. He treats me with kindness that all doctors should do.
1.000000	He is very, very thorough. He is older than me, so he uses alot of old fashioned methods. But that is good, because he takes his time and listens.
0.720000	I donât have a close relationship with them, so I donât know them personally cannot trust them completely. What if theyâre told to prescribe a certain drug? I never know if thatâs occuring. 
0.680000	all things in the end are based on the insurance you have or do not have and where you can go to get the care you need
0.600000	I trust him because he's been our family's primary care physician for a long time now. He is very helpful and courteous
0.560000	They get in to mush of a hurry, it feels rushed. They will come in and start discussing what needs to be done and while I'm there I feel like I don't even talk the same language sometimes. I almost always look everything I can remember on line. It helps me figure out what is really going on. 
0.560000	I don't feel as if my best interest is always in mind , I think that the doctor does and give the bare minimum.
0.600000	It appears they are more concerned about what they think is convenient for them. I wish to be in control of what is best for me.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because they are medical professiols. Since I am not knowledgeable in the field it is in my best interest not to doubt my doctor unless proven otherwise. I not denying that there aren't incompetent doctors out there, but I will give them the benefit of doubt unless evidence contradicts.
0.800000	I have never had a reason to distrust them. I have had a somewhat wrong diagnosis in the past, but this wasn't a major issue and they directed me to someone who could provide me with a more accurate diagnosis and method of treatment. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care doctor very much. I have only had need to see her twice, but she was a good listener and very thorough both times. I can contrast this with doctors past with whom I had trouble getting my needs addressed. 
0.560000	I can't say I completely trust my general doctor, I mean, he has given me good attention for a whole year and he treats me well but sometimes I think he cares more about making money than myself as he makes me do many tests in the same hospital where he is. It's kind of suspicious.
0.800000	I trust them because I don't think they would want to hurt me.
0.720000	They are experienced and i feel that they know more about what is going on than i do.  I don't feel they are swayed by drug vendors often but that thought has crossed my mind before.  Overall i feel trusting of doctors.
0.600000	My primary care physician keeps leaving and I haven't met the new one, but I think they are fine. I worry that I don't know what a patient is supposed to do.
0.520000	My physician is condescending. Usually when I have questions they're met with a 'duh' attitude or as if it's something I don't need to know. I struggle with making regular visits because I end up feeling angry and marginalized. 
0.880000	When I had Kaiser, I didn't trust them at all. They prescribed Codine for every little thing that I had. Now I have a private doctor through PPO and they are spot on, I'm always feeling better, I never feel like I get the run around. This difference can make my answers fill mixed. But if you were to ask me how I felt between HMO and PPO health care, it would be a landslide of an opinion.
0.760000	I trust the doctors I go to because they take good care of me, I've been going to the same doctors for years
0.800000	I trust my doctor.  He has never lied to me, or seemed to push me in any direction.  He gives me the information that i need, and his opinion, and leaves the decisions up to me.
0.400000	They don't give me options for any medications or treatments. They also don't go in depth about explaining all of them to me. They only explain the one thing they want me to try.
0.840000	I believe my doctor is taking care of my needs and is there when I need them. I have trust in my doctor.
0.800000	i had a few good doc in my life they were was honest about my diansoses.helped in any way they could.understood my phobias oh i forgot to menction i have anemia too.
0.720000	I think that the doctor is good at her job, but she is young and seems a little inexperienced. I am not sure if that's a good or bad thing though, as generatiol differences can cloud judgement and can cause physicians to not keep up with the times or to not realize the correct standards of care.
0.520000	I've worked in healthcare (previously) for over 15 years, and have had first-hand experience with many doctors.  I've seen a side of doctors that patients don't see, and some of these interactions have fostered a lack of trust.  I've had experiences where I've gone to see a new doctor and they've had a prescription written for me before I even spoke to them.  I've seen my husband prescribed contraindicated medications that caused an adverse reaction that even I knew shouldn't be taken together.  But, alternatively, I've had some doctors who treated me well who I've really trusted.  I've known other doctors to go out of their way to cater to their patient's needs/fears/wishes.
0.560000	Once you reach 60 and all the doctors are 30, you lose a lot of trust.  Then many doctors are treating statistically, instead of treating personally.  I take what I can get.  It could be a lot better.
0.520000	It depends on the situation but sometimes you can tell when they are in a rush or dont have the time to take and sit down with you, especially when you need it. 
0.760000	She is open to new studies and information. She listens to me. She stays on top of new information as much as she can herself. She will consult with others. 
0.880000	My primary care physician treats me as a person she knows and about my well being physically spiritually emotionally and psychology.  She is very calm but direct and thoughtful. 
0.320000	I just moved to a new city and have only met with one doctor. She doesn't have the personality to work with me. I'm very educated about my disease and she pretty much brushed me off instead of working with me. I wish doctors would listen to their patients instead of putting them on a 5 minute time clock. 
0.800000	The doctor appears to be well informed and caring in regards to the patients that are scene. There are times when they appear to be rushed though.
0.720000	I've had the same primary for nearly my whole adult life. He also has had my parents as patients for many years. 
0.600000	Overall, I may put trust into doctors generally since they are professionals within the field, but I suppose I have a bit of skepticism toward some doctors and their thoroughness. Also, it seems that some treatments in the past haven't been the most adequate in treating various concerns, which influences my perception.
0.400000	They don't have the same helpful enthusiasm when you don't have insurance. They rush through the visit, take their time getting to you, and assume you just want drugs. 
0.800000	To a great extent I.do trust doctors a great amount. I think they are smart and very particular about what resources that.they use
0.680000	i trust my doctor knowing that he/she had medical training and education and i don't 
0.640000	i trust my primary care physician for their knowledge of medicine.  but you have to ask question about your illness and the treatment you are being asked to undertake
0.800000	I generally trust doctors because it is in their interest to make people feel better, and they have the training to do that. I think it takes a lot of caring for others to be a doctor and most physicians have the patient's best interests at heart. Most of them are proud of what they do and want to do well. 
0.600000	I trust my primary physician because he listens to me when I tell him something and he gives me different options to choose from for my treatment. If I have a problem with the treatment I can always notify him and he will recommend something other treatment.
0.840000	i think my doctor is competent. i've been using his service for a long time
1.000000	I have the pleasure to have a older female Dr. whom is attentive and caring person and very good at what she does so this makes me feel confident with her
0.880000	I trust my primary care doctor because he knows me well and has bewen my provider since 2002. Sometimes I feel he knows me better than me medically and personally.
0.920000	I trust my PCP because she is caring and expresses concern about my health. She listens to my needs and concerns and we have an open discuss about what works best for me.
0.880000	I have known my physician for a very long time. He was my family doctor for my entire life. He has always had good solutions to all of my problems. He has never failed my family in any aspect. 
0.840000	It's cool how I can see the way I can relate too many things and it I will never get tired to be a little more person and then you can relate too many times and it I will see how many times you can see it when I try and it is just the way you get it the game is great too but I really want it too many people have been waiting to get the game for a long game too but it is a good app for the app to play and I can play with the game app and it I won't get to the app because it is not working for the game and it is great for the game too and it I won't get to the app to see how many times it does that it is a good game but I can't play with my phone 
0.480000	Always rushed, pushing pills for things even if you don't need them. For example exercise and weight loss can help many conditions, but once you are on medication, rarely taken off. 
0.800000	My doctor always answers all of my questions and has never steered my wrong. I'm never rushed and am always number one when I'm in the room with her. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor wholeheartedly.  He is very concerned about my well being and has been very thorough in helping me solve my problems. He isn't afraid to deal with my insurance company head on to get me the best care.  He hasn't let me down in the past and won't do it in the future.  
0.680000	I completely trust my doctor because he take time to explain any situation and answer any questions I have and when I check the information on Google or with some other knowledgeable person he all ways seem to be right
0.960000	I've had many doctors over my lifetime. My current doctor is the best one I've ever had. He is honest, thorough and truly cares about his patients. He is a gem. I fully trust in his judgment.
0.840000	I have been going to my doctor's office for a long time and do trust that the care is great.We have a good relationship and communication between us
0.560000	It feels sometimes like they are extremely overbooked, and maybe get kickbacks from the insurance company for making certain recommendations. It's hard to trust doctors.
0.760000	I feel that they have my best interests at heart. I do not go to doctors that don't listen to what I have to say
0.520000	too busy and they can't be bothered to sit actually listen to what you have to say. your just a number to them
0.200000	kickbacks, bribes, drug deals, side effects, over booking, arrogant about their importance, believe their own lies hate it when others done.  do not care for clients health because when they are healthy doctors and hospitals, insurance companies and drug companies do not make money from them
0.880000	He is a very caring person, who takes the time to really talk to and bond with his patients.  I am lucky to have found him.  We are short on physicians here in Hawaii.
0.680000	I do believe my doctor is honest, thorough, and careful for the most part. I think sometimes time constrictions can force her to be a little less thorough, especially when it comes to explaining why she is choosing a certain treatment. At times, I have trouble trusting doctors because I don't understand how they know the treatment they have chosen will work.
0.800000	I generally had positive experiences with health care providers. I trust that these people took their education and their training seriously and that they value their job enough to make correct recommendations. I have yet to have any reason to distrust medical professiols.
0.720000	I have been with the same doctor for 3 years and she actually listen to what I have to say and offers her best remedy and prescriptions to fix what is wrong or needs repaired.
0.640000	they worry more about the general public or what people think about things a prime example to me is pain meds 
0.800000	My doctor and I have a similar temperament and she is knowledge, down to earth.  I trust my physician to prescribe medication, inform me of treatment options and perform any type of medical procedures.
0.800000	My primary care person is a local Nurse Practitioner.  She is busy but never seems rushed while visiting with me about my concerns.  She listens and then asks questions to be sure she understands.  She explains the reason she will chose a certain treatment or why she's choosing to wait and see rather than treat right away.  I like that she doesn't talk down to me and treats me as though I am intelligent enough to understand.
0.760000	My doctor has my best interests in mind at all times. She will take the time to explain my health to me in order for me to understand and go thru many options when treatment arises. She is always patient and listens when I have questions or am worried about my health.
1.000000	I trust my doctor to give me the medical knowledge I need to mage my life the correct way.  I've never had a doctor who is so willing and able to take the time to listen.  They block out time for each patient.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because she goes the extra mile and has ordered tests be done just to be sure of something she thought. She has passion for what she does and has my health and well being as her top priority. 
0.560000	My primary care doctor is mostly considerate and kind but often gives me the impression that he is overworked. He has had the tendency to forget certain things about me to the point where I have needed to remind him of things in visits (ie: medication allergy). He has never directly put me in danger with any of his decisions but I would trust him more if he was less rushed and willing to spend more time getting familiar with me and my health.
0.520000	Sometimes doctors lie for their own benefit, it is bad but it is definitely true. I do not fully trust them
0.400000	A lot of doctors see too many patients to be very through with each patient, which I fault health insurance companies for the doctors needing to see so many patients. I was prescribed a medication that could interact with another medication I was taking. I took that medication for months, seeing the same doctors and using the same pharmacy. It wasn't until my regular doctor (pain magement) was on vacation, an older doctor recognized the risk and took me off of it. This greatly reduced my amount of trust in both doctors and pharmacists. My PCP was also aware of the medications but, did not recognize the interaction. 
0.760000	HE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT  ME, IS ALWAYS FRIENDLY AND NOT IN A RUSH TO GET IT OVER WITH. NOT AFAID TO TELL ME I SHOULD LOST WEIGHT AND STOP EATING CERTAIN THINGS
0.480000	Doctors don't really seem to take their time with the patients, that's usually the nurses job, so they don;t seem to care too much or the cherry-picked the patients they went to care about..and I generally don't just anyone that pushes unnecessary medications and treatment on their patients so they can line their pockets or an money for their hospital. 
0.920000	The doctors I've gone to are usually right. They've never given any reason for me to not trust them, and they've always been honest with me, even if I didn't want to hear it.
0.600000	I've met many rude doctors in my short life. It seems like there are may people that become doctors for the wrong reasons. When I find a competent and compassionate doctor it almost seems like finding a rare gem. I think most of them are competent of course, but few have what it takes to interact with patients appropriately.
0.600000	I don't trust the newbies sometime because there new but I feel like why would a doctor deliberately
0.480000	I do trust most things she tells me, but feel she does not take the time to be thorough in her assessments. She always seems to be in a great hurry to be done with the exam.
0.800000	She listens to me, repeats back to me my concerns and has given me no reason not to trust her. She takes the time necessary to understand my needs and questions
0.640000	I think that these days that doctors are trying to push more and more drugs that half the time you dont need. That is pretty scary to think about. Also treatment varies greatly from doc to doc even on simple things like a infection. So there are times i cant trust the doc 100%
0.720000	I have a good amount of trust in my doctor- he seems to have my best interests at heart. He doesnât rush when he sees or examines me and takes copious notes that are added to my electronic file. He has his staff do follow- ups if he canât do them himself. 
0.760000	 i dont have a primary doc I go to a practice that you will see a different doctor every time or a pa nurse practioner  .  at the time I changed doctors I DID NOT LOOK FOR A doctor at the time so I just go to this practice
0.600000	For the most part I have complete trust in my doctor and his staff. Sometimes money does play a part though. 
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to examine and talk to me.  My physician cares to know me as a person and takes a lot of time to ask me questions and gives me time to ask questions to make sure I understand everything.  
0.760000	Shes nice and kind to me. She makes sure that my needs are taken care of and she listens to what I have to say and what questions I may have for her.
0.640000	I only trust my physician, if he gives me honest answers about my health.  I have had physicians I did not trust in the past.
0.600000	I don't have a primary care physician. I trust doctors because they paid thousands and thousands of dollars to go to school and learn things about medicine that I don't know.
0.760000	I've had some pretty negative experiences with PCPs. Mostly due to the fact I smoke canbis and don't want medication. I and my new PCP find that canbis is much safer than being prescribed benzos and adderall my whole life.I trust her because it doesn't seem like she is pushing pills.
0.560000	 I have no reason thus far not to trust his ability to treat me as a patient. He takes his time during my visit and goes over all my medicines, problems and all. Gives his opinion on things and together we decide on the best treatment plan.
0.760000	I really trist my primary care provider first snd for most because he listens to me and respects my decisions. He is always willing to talk in depth with me about my concerns and answer questions and respectful of my medical choices even if they go against what he recommends. In the past he has gone out of his way to look into other treatment options for me and their effectiveness. He is also very respectful of my body and perspective- to elaborate he really takes into considerstion my persol reports about things where as other medical providers in the past have blown me off and insisted Im reporting symptoms wrong etc.
0.680000	I know my doctor is not out to harm me.  I also understand there are other exterl forces at play (insurance requirements, patient requirements, regulatory requirements, etc.) that can affect treatment.  I believe it is in both my interest and my doctor's interest to be honest with each other and have that level of trust.
0.560000	I just think that most doctors just want to get done with one paitent and then move on to the next. I also don't think that they listen very attentatively when you tell them something that doesn't agree with their preconceptions of the person they think the patient is.
1.000000	i trust them because there honest and genuine and really nice also they really care about my health and well being 
0.760000	I ask a lot of questions about my health and usually am given the straight facts by my doctor. If I don't get the best answers I always ask for a second opinion. My doctor has been very upfront and completely honest with me on anything that we discuss.
0.560000	I believe at the end of the day most doctors are all about the money and will put that before their patients. I am weary of them but I can trust some things they say.
0.840000	I have been going to my doctor for the last 20 years and I completely trust her, she is reliable and trustworthy 
0.680000	It's not that I distrust my physician...I go to a free clinic and some things/meds are limited.  Doctors . in general, sometimes push certain products I  guess.
0.800000	I trust my doctor and all doctors cause they go to school for a long long time and are very friendly and know it all when it comes to my health.
1.000000	I trust my doctor as she listens to my concerns and addresses them with testing and the specialist I need. I have became better health wise since being under this doctors care
0.840000	Well my doctor has been seeing me for a while now so he has understanding where i am health wise. I trust his judgement due to his experience and so far its been good.
1.000000	I trust my primary care doctor completely because of my time with her. She has gotten my hip replacement done for me.
0.880000	I trust my dr because he is always up front and honest with me and tells me all. He always listens to my concerns and is always listening and helping me out. He is a caring dr. Not one that just gets you in and out to make money.
0.560000	I don't really have a primary at the moment. For doctors in general, I feel as if some of them are good and some of them are bad. Some are only interested in themselves and making money and other actually care. Its a toss up. 
0.800000	BEEN WITH HER FOR A VERY LONG.  SHE WALKED THROUGH BREAST CANCER WITH ME AND WORKED WITH ME TO DISCOVER  THE CAUSE OF OTHER HEALTH ISSUES I WAS HAVING.  SHE LISTENS AND DOES WHAT IT TAKES TO GET HER PATIENTS WELL.
0.360000	I just recently changed Doctors and the new one seems to be worse then the one I left.  He might just be to busy or have to many patients.
0.680000	
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician very much. He is thorough in my yearly check-ups. I have been seeing the same doctor for 17 years. He is very knowledgeable about my medical history so I am confident in asking questions if I have any. 
0.720000	So far I haven't had any problems with my care physician.  But I don't someone's word without getting a second opinion. 
0.600000	My doctor understands my pain an what I need she talks to me for hours an dose her job right I believe in are 100%
0.720000	I trust my doctors medical opinions. First, because it is his or her chosen profession. Second, he or she answers all my questions and addresses all my concerns each visit
0.480000	He's just a regular doctor, maybe he's trying to sell me something for all I know. That's what some doctors do a lot.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a very competent and experienced medically trained physician who is familiar with various illnesses and treatment options who seems to care for his patients..
1.000000	I just my doctor due to the fact that any concerns I have had she would always look into it with all her testing to get to the source of the problems even if it took a second opinion from a specialist she would take it a step up. Also because once my doctor has results the treatment that would be given would actually help with whatever was my concern so that's why I trust because I see good outcomes. 
0.720000	i have no response to this question because i feel every dr are sworn to be honest to every patient 
0.800000	I jave changed doctors several times in order to find my cuuent one.  She listens and doesn't just push pills.
0.800000	i have been with my primary care doctor for over 5 years. i trust her and i feel that i have a good means of communication wuith her plus she always takes the time to sit with me and explain any issues i may have
0.640000	For the most part I trust my doctor to monitor my health and if a problem presents help me find a reasonable solution. But I also people in human mistake and that sometimes you have to be your own health advocate.  Doctors don't always have the right answers and sometimes you have to be persistent if you feel something is not right. 
0.880000	He examines me throughly and he runs test if needed.  I see a neurolgist due to a muscle disorder.  I have seen him for the past five years.  He has helped me with every aspect of this disease. Ran every test possible.  Also discussed my diagnosis with other neurologist.   He explains everything so I and my husband completely understand
0.600000	I have been going to her for quite some time. I always ask her questions if I don't understand anything she tells me.
0.680000	I believe we are all humans and humans make mistakes. So, although I trust my doctor they are not perfect.
0.800000	My doctor has little reason to lie to me, so I can trust in them to provide me with the proper care. I do question medications when I can, as I know that doctors receive kickbacks and things like that from companies. I try to make sure to use holistic methods when I can. Medications can be dangerous and harmful if you become addicted to them. I prefer to use natural methods when I can, so that I can avoid anything unnecessary.
0.800000	I had a near fatal stroke in 2012. After nearly 3 months in various local hospitals, I had to pick a primary care physician since I never really had one.  I picked my current doctor and haven't regretted it one bit.
0.600000	I trust their expertise and their knowledge but I trust myself in knowing my body better than any other person.
0.840000	we have built a relationship, he knows what we desire and expect and all live up to the exceptions we have set
0.480000	All doctors follow rules and procedures that are generalized for everyone and not for me. They may or may not take me 100% at my word when I describe symptoms and feelings and will not provide all options if they don't approve of one. I've only been able to get full information when I pressed and asked, although I have encountered some doctors that did let me make the fil decision without judgement. I feel I know my body best, and often they don't take that same attitude.
0.640000	I occasionally feel rushed when interacting with doctors. Although I know they make an effort to be efficient with their time, I sometimes feel as if they are sacrificing quality for efficiency.
0.760000	My primary care physician has changed often lately, so this is more about physicians in general.  For the most part, I trust their decisions:  they are trained professionals with a lot of experience in their jobs, and many are also active research scientists.  However, they do have some pressure put on them by drug sales representatives to recommend one product over another, and I think that there is a possibility of their judgment being distorted by drug and other medical product marketing techniques.
0.520000	Doctors are often busy and overbooked. They spend 90% of the time looking at a computer instead of having a dialogue with iContact. My doctor is too much in a hurry and forgets the last visit even if it was a month ago. 
0.760000	Usually I trust my doctor for respecting his knowledge at least, but still I have some opinions, I will depend on him in severe conditions
0.800000	They listen and are observant. They care.
0.800000	My doctor has never gave me a reason not to trust her. She is kind and caring and upfront and honest. 
0.880000	He is a great guy and he opens the floor for me if I have any questions. He knows what I need and makes sure my levels are always good. And if its a little off he tries to figure out why the levels are what they are
0.560000	I feel that today doctors are just trying not to get sued. So they go with the safest least liable option always and what is convent cause the most patients they see means the most money for them. 
0.360000	She seems to care more about squeezing the most money out of the insurance company as possible and doesn't seem to care if I can make up the difference
0.760000	I trust my doctor because they be honestly with you about your conditions and runs test's on you to make sure that's really what's wrong with you
0.720000	I completely trust my Primary Care physician, but also understand that she see many people, so I ultimately have to do some of my own research and decide what is truly right for me as far as treatments are concerned.
0.600000	i trust them because ive been going there every since i was little so theres really no reason i shouldnt they watched me grow 
0.640000	I trust my primary care doctor. I have been with the same person for 4years and she is very knowledgeable and always on point with treatment and what to do
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician sometimes. This is because I have been seeing him for awhile and he has prescribed me my birth control, iron pills for having low white blood cell counts, and has given me different types of medicine for my anxienty. The only thing is that I have complained about both axienty medicine pills making me extremely sleepy and my doctor has not done anything about it. I took it upon myself to stop taking the pills because I hated being sleepy all day long. Doctors should also not be giving patients all of these opioids and other pills like xanax where people can get extremely addicted. That is why I do not trust doctors.
0.680000	I trust my primary physician because she has never given me reason not to. She is attentive and always helps me feel better than when I arrived
0.600000	I'm not sure whether to fully trust  my primary care physician or not. It's hard to tell. However, I do give the physician the benefit of the doubt
0.680000	I trust them because I have to, they are the medical professionals and as long as I give them all the information they need they should be able to tell me what's wrong. I distrust because they are in business to make money as well. Medical world is big business and driven by insurance company's and their reimbursements 
0.280000	I have found doctors are more interested in shoving pills down a patients throat than actually addressing issues that are causing the problems in the first place.
0.800000	The only doctor I see is my dentist.  I HATE going to the dentist, and refused to go for decades.  Pain overrides fear to a point so I went.  I still get a nervous wreck when I go; but I trust him.   So far he has been very nice and careful.  He even gave me a free filling.
0.840000	has always been to the point and forth rite in dealing with me in all of my health concerns even now that I have a rare terminal condition
0.600000	I believe that doctors sometimes have your best interest at heart and they take the hypocratic oath, however they also have a living to make. They go to school for several years and are sometimes in immense debt, so their personal interests may cloud their judgment sometimes
0.680000	TODAY I have to do that again and again in the morning to get together and then we can go back to work tomorrow morning and then we went out for the next few days and nights in my room to talk about this weekend
0.480000	I don't trust the medical system at all and never will. It would be extremely foolish to trust them.
0.880000	I've thankfully had good experiences with doctors. I don't need to see doctors often, but when I do I have received care that I had been satisfied with. I feel that the doctors I have seen care about me, they care about making sure I understand my issues and they explain to me the importance of my options and the results of any decisions I make. I have not felt at all that doctors don't care for me or that I am wasting their time.
0.560000	I am neutral in trusting my primary care physician due to having a negative experience during my childhood where I was misdiagnosed multiple times and given wrong advice/information regarding my health. It got to the point where it was almost too late for me to survive because my parents were being told that their child only had a cold/fever. Outside of that experience, I normally do not put that much trust in a person regardless of it being their profession because some people only have their own interests in mind.
0.440000	I distrust my primary care physician because she is always in a rush and in a hurry and basically often ignores what I am concerned about by brushing it off as no big deal. She often pushes medications as well when I make it clear that I do not want to use medicine as a first resort.
0.560000	i trust my primary dr. because he saved my life when dealing with colon cancer h was very precise when treating me and getting me to the right specialist 
0.880000	She is thorough, thoughtful and knowledgeable. My health is good. I have no data that argues for mis-trusting her
0.800000	I have been you g to get for over ten years .  Through my experience and good outcome from her treatments, recommendations, and care know she is knowledgeable in her practice.
0.760000	I think that my doctor is a decent person whom wants to make sure his patients lead a very healthy life. His job is more than a pay check. He's doing an excellent job by providing the necessary help to his patients.
0.600000	my doctor misdiagnosed my low sodium  
1.000000	My primary care physician is excellent! I love her and her team! They offer suggestions. They explain everything to me in a way that I can understand it.
0.320000	Every single PCP I have had the displeasure of dealing with has been arrogant and rude to me. They don't seem to take anything I say seriously, and seem to just want to get the visitation over with. It's a one-size-fits-all approach for these guys.
0.800000	I have had the same doctor for 9 years and he has been nothing but a profession al and friend. He always diagnoses my correctly and prescribes the correct medicine. 
0.760000	I trust my physician because he takes time  to explain to me what is going on with my body and what treatments are available to me concerning  my well being.
0.560000	I take everything with a grain of salt. In most situations, I will follow the recommendations of my primary care physician as they typically know what is best, however I also do my own research. Occasionally, if I don't feel my questions have been answered satisfactorily then I will seek a second opinion. 
0.760000	I find my doctor to be very trustworthy. He is open and honest with me and make things easy to understand.

0.720000	i trust me primary care physician because they provide my health information and perscribe my appointments.
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for 14 years. We have develop a relationship of honesty and trust on both sides. I 100%, totally trust my doctor.
0.600000	Doctors are practicing physicians and to me that means they are still using us as experiments to see what will work and what will not work.  There are to many side effects for the drugs on the market to be prescribed for anyone there are more side affects than cure and the doctor knows this but yet they prescribe these medication for people what ever happened to using more natural products like the olden days.
0.760000	I have known my doctor for years, he takes care of my family and know and trust him to make careful and thoughtful decisions concerning my health.
0.360000	I haven't been to a doctor in over a decade. In general I don't trust doctors. Many of them are so profit driven. I hope to never have to see a doctor again.
0.440000	I do trust that our primary care physician is capable of making proper decisions involving health care if they were to take the time to do so. Often, issues are misdiagnosed or overlooked because they are in a rush. The same goes for the doctors support system, such as office staff. Many times they are so busy that they overlook completing there tasks such as calling in prescriptions or referrals.
0.360000	"I receive medical treatment through a public health service. These people are over worked, under paid, and emotiolly drained. They have no incentive nor energy to deal with people who are uncooperative, and thus will try to give few options that leave people with ""obvious"" choices. "
0.800000	She listens well and I never seem rushed.  She is willing to answer questions and look up information if I ask something specific.  She is persoble and warm.
0.840000	My doctor takes the time to explain things to me. He gives me options and gives his honest opinion about them.
0.600000	It really depends on the doctor.  I have had doctors who are mostly concerned about other things than me.  Then I have had some that seem like they are only interested in me.
0.600000	some doctors are just wrong with the diagnosis and treatment.  Some treatments are very difficult to accomplish by me.  Some doctors just order them and don't give a thought as to how hard it is on the client
0.680000	PCP is as good as you tell them your issues. In todays medical world they are more of a gate keeper referring patient to specialist as needed.
0.760000	I feel they can be trusted most of the time, if not I can at least get an insightful opinion on something. Besides not being helpful could cost them their job. 
0.680000	Although I don't have a certain doctor that I go to, I trust most doctors in general. Of course, there are bad ones that don't do everything that they are supposed to, or that don't do their job as they are supposed to, but I do trust most doctors in general to do their jobs properly.
0.800000	I haven't had him long but so far he is very caring and listens to what I have to say.  I bring a list of questions when I go and he lets me ask and gives thoughtful answers.  Doesn't blow me off like some.
0.560000	From what I've seen in the past several years, their too much emphasis on time magement and payroll correlation than on what's really beneficial for the patient. Issues are only addressed if it's convenient for the doctor and his/her staff. 
0.840000	of course i trust my doctor i have chosen him  because of his good fame and he always give me the right treatment.
0.520000	It seems that doctors can be too detached from their patients. They can sometimes forget patients are people not problems. 
0.360000	Primary care is ok but I don't trust OB/GYNs. I had to switch twice at the end of my last pregnancy and was delivered by a midwife. The first OB/GYN was trying to force me to have a c-section for no reason, the second didn't support unmedicated birth and my chiropractor implored me to change to a midwife because she specializes in pregnancy and found that her patients had more success with midwives for unmedicated birth. I also had a doula and the birth was still tense due to the overbearing OBs in the practice, who almost forced me to have a c-section as well. Thankfully my doula was there to fight for me to get the birth I wanted. 
0.960000	My doctor presents me with options when it comes to my health. He is always available to me.  I can reach him on the phone or via email.  He responds promptly to my requests
0.960000	My doctor has never steered me wrong, giving me bad advice, the wrong medication, or show disinterest in me. 
0.400000	One thing for instance, I just started seeing a new PCP due to insurance changing over,  I have not been impressed by my first visit, hoping it gets better, but like receiving a blood test in the mail stated all was negative and clearly a level of Vitamin D was very low, the test was highlighted in Bold, and labeled Low, but it was stamp signed stating all normal.,  
0.640000	he is very free and open to talk to me about just anything I may ask, has my best interests at heart
1.000000	because my primary care physician tells me everything no need to know weather good or bad.she dose not hide anything from me and is always in my best intrest.
0.920000	I have known my PCP since I was 13 and friends with his daughter. I am usually very healthy and don't go to the doctor very often, but I do trust him as my doctor. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor. I trust my doctor because he has a degree and went through a lot of tests to ensure he knows what he is doing and is good at it. He see's a bunch of other patients who also think highly of him which is what in return I trust and believe the same about him. He has a lot of education and does a lot of good things in his profession.
0.840000	They are informative. If I don't understand something they go into more detail about what it is, etc. They give me all the information I need to understand what they are saying.
0.600000	I do not have complete trust in my physician because sometimes they are just out for money and do not tell you everything.  They try to push medications and not everything requires prescription medicine.
0.560000	I beleive that sometimes doctors get in a routine and just give you the basics. They dont take into consideration your situation at the time
0.800000	I've seen my doctor for over a decade now, and we get along great.  She's been a good help to me, and as far as I know has not ever guided me wrong.  I have no reason to doubt her. 
0.840000	i trust my doctor, she seems very capable and have a lot of knowledge, i always follow her instructions and get better
0.760000	I think i can trust my primary care physician i feel that most doctors are honest people.some doctor my not be trustworthy but i have had no reason not to trust my doctor. if i thought my doctor could not be trusted i would look for another primary care physician.
0.720000	I generally trust doctors, but I don't believe you should trust anyone 100%, without at least verifying their information with another expert at least once or twice, every so often.
0.800000	most doctors that I've had has had the patients best interest in mind. Sometimes they may not seem too warm or attentive but most of the time they are in my experience. They make sure to go over everything thoroughly so they don't miss any symptoms I might be having and that I understand fully the information that they need to tell me.
0.280000	I have pcos and I feel like the doctor is always trying to give me false hope with something new that I haven't tried that will help me have another baby. Sometimes I feel like they look at me as a money person who will pay. 
0.520000	No I don't have any specific doctors I only have Medicare but currently need something to get a check ip
0.760000	He/She has a full record of all my medical history at there fingertips.  They can order new tests and/or labs easily which can often be done in the same facility.  I have had one doctor before moving for over ten years which enabled him to get to know me a bit personally which I think helped the overall care.  This facilitated discussion on lifestyle and care out side the clinic. Often, they new colleagues in the same medical plan that would be a good fit for me in other areas of care such as back doctors or physical therapy.
0.480000	I trust my doctor because I can talk to her about anything I may be going through at the moment. I am always open and honest with her 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I have always gotten a working solution for my problems. She asks many detailed questions to make sure she can understand what I am trying to describe and is able to come up with a valid diagnosis.

He likes to laugh and makes jokes when I see him. He seems happy when I come in for my check ups. He has never steered me in the wrong direction. He looks me in the eyes when we are speaking. He can gauge if I'm having not a great day just by the responses I give him. He's a great doctor and I completely trust him!
0.720000	I truly trust my primary care physician because they always provide me with all of the information that I need to stay up to date with my health 
0.600000	I think it is more that I do not trust the time put into me as a patient than that I do not trust my physician.  I worry that my doctor has a busy schedule and because she works for a big company she is required to keep her time with me short.  I do not believe that it is possible to come to correct, well-thought conclusions when you only have 15 to gather information, process it, and explain to the patient.
0.800000	My doctor takes the time to listen and help me she doesn't try to rush you out the door. When she isn't familiar with an issue she will find out about it and then help you 
0.640000	I trust what is said, but sometimes I feel like I am not a person to my doctor, and he could misread my symptoms.
0.720000	The doctor that I have now is pretty good. He seems honest and decent. So I do trust him a good bit. Don't feel this way about all doctors but this one is pretty good.
0.440000	They seem like they are just in it for the money. Wait for an hour in the waiting room only to see the doctor for 5 minutes. 
0.800000	I typically trust that doctors know how to treat and care for whatever health condition I'm dealing with if they can pinpoint it.
0.880000	When I was 41 yr. old I had a severe asthma episode.  I had never had asthma before and I almost died.  The Dr. the ER called in saved my life then and I had him as my doctor for many years and had me on meds that controlled the asthma.  More recently I have had other doctors and have been treated well; have had questions answered; been given meds that did what they were supposed to do.
0.560000	I've found that physicians rarely agree which makes me nervous.  Often there are treatments or reseasrch on existing treatments that unengaged doctors are not aware of.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because when I go in for a visit, she listens to me and usually has more than one option to try without immediately going to medicine. I feel like I am heard and she typically solves my problems without multiple visits of trial and error.
0.760000	If I did not trust my physician I would change and find one that I would.  I trust my physician currently as I watch how he lives his life outside of the medical field.  Church, community, family.  I judge their ethics away from work to get a feel and add it to how Im treated and the discussions at the office.  Its usually going to see other doctors (any little thing you always have to go see somebody else or 2 or 3) where I have my problems with trust, don't have many to choose from so have to use doctors that are available.
0.800000	I trust my healthcare provider because I have been going to him for the past twenty plus some years. My doctors has always done what is best for me and never put his interest before my own health.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he takes his time with me during my appointment time and and answers all my questions
0.520000	I mostly trust the physician. But some physicians are work for the salary period. This may be lead to patient's uncomfortable. Physicians has the high responsible for their patient. But some Physicians are not take care about the patient. Their only focus is to improve their financial stability.
0.600000	I trust some doctors, but I also think that it's more about making money.                                    
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician for at least two reasons.  First, I've been with him for many years.  Second, he has never given me a reason to distrust him.
0.840000	My doctor has always been honest and upfront with me and he shows he cares. I couldn't ask for more from him.
0.760000	they accept my agreement or refusal with out pressuring me into what they might want . they discuss all options with me and give me suggestions to my problems without pressure
0.320000	They are always in a hurry to be done and move in to the next patient I am not seenas the individual I am 
0.360000	I just havent had the best physicians. Ive been wrongly diagnosed in the past so there is little trust when it comes to doctors.
0.520000	I am not sure if I completely trust my primary care physician because he seems more concerned about liability or convenience at times rather than in the welfare of the patient. He is not as open to answering questions about medical care. He also is not as uptodate on treatments and may recommend something that he is familiar with but may not be as effective as more new or modern treatments.
0.680000	I mostly trust my doctor, but sometimes I feel as though the doctor may think some of the things that are bothering me are insignificant.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she is very careful when it comes to my treatment. I believe that if it wasnt for her quick thinking and action my premature son might not be alive today. After that pregnancy I decided to stick with her.
0.600000	I often get simple answers to my ailments as if wha I'm feeling is normal when it clearly is not. I would like more attention to be paid to my concerns.
1.000000	I trust my physician because they will never tell me the wrong thing. They always make sure to inform me.
0.680000	"my doctor does not mention/discuss any real ""natural"" ways to help any kind of  medical issue I might have so I do my own research because I cannot trust that the dr. will give me any such information, instead just wanting to prescribe medications when it may possibly not be needed."
0.520000	I don't trust the American healthcare system in general, not necessarily the doctor. Nowadays, patients are just numbers to doctors. The medical care system is deeply flawed and needs reform. People aren't being treated properly for their illnesses because of astronomically high medical costs. Everything is about profit, so that's why I don't trust any doctors.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because I genuinely feel they have my best interest at heart. They're competent, fair, have good have bedside behavior...
0.400000	I think doctors treat all bodies like if they are the same. Just because you have heartburn doesn't mean all patients should get the same pill. Doctors should look deeper into what lifestyle changes they can make and maybe certain prescriptions work well for some but not all.
0.920000	I try to have any issues I want to discuss written down and keep to a max of three things, if possible.  He always makes sure I am up to date with any shots I am suppose to have.  He tells me things for my own good health care.
0.600000	I don't fave one but I guess if telling you that I might be able to get one if that works be okay with you . So if you could help me with that, that would be amazing . Thank you vert much .
0.800000	"My doctor always suggests tural remedies first if the condition is not serious. She is not a ""pill pusher"" like most. My mother used to work with her also. She is also my mother's doctor now that she no longer works with her."
0.800000	I trust my doctor. He is thorough. Whatever I ask he lets me know what is going on. He gives me the advice I need
0.760000	My primary care physician is very forward with information and makes sure I understand everything he tells me. He is very open to questions and is very considerate.
0.560000	The practice is very busy and he is late all the time. He shuffles a lot of things off to nurses. He seems to know his stuff, but he rushes through it often. It can also take a long time to get an appt or a refill.
0.840000	I trust doctors because they seem very open to discuss questions and concerns. Even to the point of not wanting to take prescribed medicine they will refer to other alternatives. 
0.800000	I have been going to my internist for over three years now and have trusted her from the very beginning.  She's never given me a reason to think otherwise, but as I am a somewhat skeptical person, I can't honestly give her 5s in these ratings.
0.640000	because they have more knowledge, education, and training than I do and though I may think I know, they likely know better. They have seen more people with similar issues than I possibly could so I trust them mostly. I also think that they are influenced by things such as insurance and pharma companies and such. That is why I think sometimes they rely on what is convenient and makes them the most money.
0.600000	this is true most of the time that doctors care more about what is convenient to them so we should not completely trust them but not all doctors are same so my view is neutral.
0.720000	once again i know how to trust the doctors because when I was young my mom and dad taught me everything I need to know about how to talk to my doctor and stuff.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because what i share with him about me always helps in my well being we can pretty much come to a conclusion on how to keep me in my best health i ask a lot of questions and he gives true and honest answers there is nothing i distrust about him.
0.520000	I have been given a new doctor recently who've only been to once.  Therefore, It is difficult to judge how much I can trust them.  The majority of the time spent is sitting with a nurse.
0.840000	My primary care physician takes great care of me. She is attentive and remembers details and LISTENS to me. I have seen many other doctors whether walk-in or specialists who do not listen to what I say. If they do not listen to me, they can't possibly diagnose me correctly. If a doctor is dismissive or rude, I won't trust a word out of their mouth.I find a new doctor as soon as possible. Last year, I had a piece of my jaw come loose and fall out of my mouth (it was as horrible as it sounds), in the beginning it just hurt a lot, and I could see my bone through my gums. The male doctor I saw at the walk-in told me there was no way it was my jaw and I probably had a cankersore. I asked him to look and he glanced into my mouth without a flashlight. Yeah, I spat out a piece of my jaw a few weeks later after several appointments with an oral surgeon. 
0.680000	I have nothing to say. I like my doctor. They help me more than not. I really don't have much more to say about it.
0.560000	I do not have a primary care provider. i normally go to urgent care if I am sick or if I have an issue that needs to be addressed.
0.960000	My doctor always take the time to explain things to me.  My doctor never makes me feel rushed.
0.800000	My physician is highly regarded and always takes the appropriate amount of time to see me. He doesn't rush me out of his office for other patients, and I feel that he gives me his full attention.
0.640000	I work in the medical field and I understand the way that pcps interact with their patients. Sometimes admin gets in the way of getting things done and this can impede the patient process, sometimes doctors are burnt out and are sacrificing patient outcomes for their own gains.
0.760000	
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she went to school for a very  long time and she knows alot more then I know about anything
0.920000	she is caring itrust her judgement she talks to you she explain as she goes along she do and ask what and how i feel we laugh she call me and ask how i feel
0.560000	I don't necessarily trust doctors. Some are very trustworthy, others are not trustworthy at all. Doctors are often more caught up in imposing their ideas on their patients and don't actually listen to their patients. Too often they tell women that losing weight will fix all their problems or that they can't have a hysterectomy, even when it is medically called for, because they might want to have children later. Too many of them have relationships with drug companies that make it hard for them to be fair-minded about which treatments are best. Some of them haven't kept up with the latest in medical science news. 
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician as I have been going to him for a few years now.
0.840000	I like my PCP a lot. He is patient, thoughtful, and always listens. He is also very willing to utilize care that is more holistic. If I tell him that I'm confused or uncomfortable with a potential medication or treatment, he listens and is willing to explore and consider altertives.
0.600000	Doctors in far to big of a hurry. If you get ten minutes with the doctor I think you did very well. I feel they just push through to get to the next person so they can make that money.
0.920000	In the past, my doctor has been very receptive to my needs as a patient. He has taken the time to explain to me anything I did not understand.
0.920000	I would only choose a doctor if I believed in them and what they stood for and whether they were competent enough to take care of me the way I should be taken care of. If I get a hint of a wrong feeling about a physician I will definitely not use them
1.000000	I have been dealing with the Medical staff at MUSC, ever since i moved to SC 20 yrs ago. They have pulled me thru some pretty scary times. NEVER going anywhere else.
0.720000	Mostly I trust my doctor, although she is relatively new for me.  Initially, I did not feel that she listened well enough to what I was saying, but my latest visit with her felt much more complete and comfortable.
0.920000	I trust my Rheumatologist and my Nephrologists because they got me on the right treatments to steady my condition to were I am more balanced mentally and physically.  
0.800000	my doctor has always given me proper information and prescriptions to make me feel better and each time his remedies have worked for me
0.760000	I trust my physician because she is open and honest with me; she explains everything before I even ask. 
1.000000	First of all, he is a Kaiser doctor and we have 40 years of not good but great experience there. After 10 years how could we not love him!
0.600000	I kinda both distrust and trust. But the reason why i distrust is because i feel like they dont want to actually look into the problem. its like they have to diagnois you with something even its wrong. and then on to the next person. its like they have so many people that they dont really care about whats happening with you. 
0.600000	I can't really say because ive changed doctors but she listened to what I had to say and made sure I was ok
0.880000	I think my doctor does an excellent job of listening to me and following up.  I went in describing symptoms that I did not think added up to anything. She immediately ordered bloodwork for me and we learned that I have hypothyroidism. My doctor appears to really pay attention and I trust that she is working toward my best interests.
0.840000	My doctor always lets me know about my tests and if she feels I need  another test to make sure that I am doing well, she will not hesitate to get me the best care.
0.960000	My PCP is a Nurse Practitioner that I have known for many years.  She is knowledgeable about my conditions and keeps up to date with treatments.  What she does not know, she will find out and get the info to me.
0.720000	My doctor has taken care of all my family, so he knows our family medical history. I trust his knowledge of medicine to provide the best care possible. 
0.880000	I have some very negative experiences with doctors trying to treat beyond their personal capabilities. My current doctor is great at discussing the problem, and if he does not feel totally confident in a procedure or treatment, I get a referral to a specialist. I love it.
1.000000	My doctor is very trustworthy. I have no issues and have complete trust in his abilities as a doctor and for my well being. He is a great doctor for me and I have been with him for a long time.
0.760000	Doctors have expertise in field of medicine, have completed training, and continue to train when new science is applicable, where I on the other hand do not have any experience in the medical field. 
0.880000	I have been going to my primary care physician for almost 10 years and have built trust with them. They always offer me advice on the best treatment for my conditions and help me monitor any possible conditions that may arise.
0.800000	I have been with the same physician for over 20 years and he has never been wrong. He knows my history, takes time make sure I understand. 
0.960000	Usually my primary care physician had more experience and knowledge than me, and they know better what they give to everyone
0.920000	I HAVE BEEN LUCKY DO TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE BEEN SEEING THE SAME DOCTOR FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS, THATS WHY IN TRUST HIM AND OR HER
0.600000	The sad news you have to put trust in your doctor. Distrust doctors because they like to hide problems from you, which is stupid.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she's willing to answer questions. I don't ever feel she's rushing me or dismissing my concerns. If I ask about altertives she gives a lot of facts - I like to hear it all and not generalized statements meant to pacify.
0.840000	I have many doctors and i view them as a team. There are 10 doctors i see and i trust them to get it right. I listen and i ask quesrions. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because i have been going to him for awhile. He takes the tine to listen to my problems and to answer any questions i may have. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician primarily because he has always taken the time to listen to me when I have had health concerns and discussed treatment options and recommendations with me. He discovered that I had a heart condition when I was 40 that I had all my life, and he sent me to a cardiologist,who was impressed that the doctor say it on my EKG. He has been careful about prescribing drugs unnecessarily, but prescribes medicine as he feels necessary. He even takes time to answer health questions I have when I am with another family member for an appointment. 
0.560000	I don't have a primary physician, I see whoever is there. And while they all seem nice, I do not feel like they fully listen to what I tell them. I don't think they are as thorough as should be. 
0.360000	The few times I have seen her, she seems to hyper-focus on ONE issue, and almost overdoes it. She tries to quickly get me out of her office after dealing with that ONE issue only, even if I ave 2 or 3 medical issues that need to be dealt with. To get the appropriate care, I would need to go to separate visits for all my individual issues and needs.
1.000000	I very much trust my doctors at the VA,  they have been unreal kind, right on & always right.    Everything I've had done there has been great & right on with what they say.  I'm completely happy..
0.560000	The least that doctors can do is provide guidelines.
0.560000	I trust my doctor because he fully listens to me. I never have a problem with my doctor listening to my worries or health concerns.
0.520000	Doctors only know what they are taught and rarely, in my experiences, actually do more research.  As a result, I dont have much trust in drs.
0.800000	I don't have a pcp at this time.  However, while I have some good doctors and some not so good doctors, most of the time I have had exceptional care from my pcps in the past.
0.560000	I love my physician. He makes sure I understand everything that is going on with my health. He ask me if I have any questions, and I say no
1.000000	he is a personal FRIEND OF MINE SO I KNOW HE ALWAYS HAS MY BEST INTERESTS IN MIND NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH HIM OR HIS STAFF
0.400000	My doctor only sees me as an obese ugly woman and only wants to get to the next patient.  Doesn't see me as a person but only $$$ signs
0.440000	My primary care physician is good and better than most.  I believe that, in general doctors have become salesmen.  They are very quick to prescribe medication and refer patients to doctors to patients who refer patients to them.  I do not feel that anyone should completely that in these days of greed and avarice, no one should blindly entrust his/her healthcare to another human being.
0.880000	I explained this in the other answer. They really answer my questions in detail. I also research my questions and have access to my medical records online. I also get printed information on my conditions and steps to take when I leave the doctor.
0.600000	i trust my pcp doctor because she is helping me with some of my help problems and try to see me live happily and helthy
0.520000	Because hey might mix up my results and Donald trump this year I mean cmon and don't even get me started on Ben Carson like why are they even here please don't ask me this again I have arthritis hard to type I'm speaking into my laptop 
0.520000	I dont feel like I trust my primary care physician because she seems to force me to take shots that I dont really need and forces unnecessary tests onto me just to make a few couple bucks. But she seems knowledgeable and thats the only reason i am sticking with her for now.
0.800000	If I didn't trust my PCP then I would look elsewhere (as I have done in the past). One of the most important aspects of a PCP is trust. If I can't trust him/her then the relationship is worthless to me.
0.720000	The reason I trust my primary care physician is because he gives me the right info I need to staying fit and the right ways to make sure I don't screw up on being healthy.
0.720000	For the most part, I think doctors are trustworthy. However, they are very busy and see a lot of patients, so they could make mistakes, just like everyone else.
0.920000	She is a great person and professional, can not trust her. Everyone I know who is cared for by him, blindly trust in his decisions;
0.800000	I have noticed when I am more open and honest with them then in turn it allows them to understand my situation better and they will be more honest and willing to help me because I am not trying to hide anything as well as the relationship I develop with them I can sense they want to help me. 
0.600000	Doctord I see are more interested to get clients moving through their offices. The focus on the number of clients rather than quality service.
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my doctor for a long time now. I've experienced good results and up till now I only have positive reviews. 
0.680000	My old doctor I trust because he would be very open and straightforward with me and he would always make sure I am feeling ok. I am not sure about other doctors but hope they would be as good as him. 
0.920000	I know him personally, he goes to our church and we have his home phone number.   He is great with our boys, always has a second to talk if we have a concern, is thorough but not overbearing, hasnt been wrong about anything yet and you can tell he genuinely cares about us.
0.600000	Sometimes I feel that certain doctors are only in it to make the bucks not to look at the person's health as a whole. 
1.000000	She listens to what I have to say and asks questions rather than jump to conclusions.  She also checks up with me yo see if the treatment we decided on us working or not, or hiw a consult with another doctor went.  She has never been dismissive of any issue I've gone to her with.  I feel that she honestly cares for my health.  
0.680000	His last name is Patel. And he is always in a hurry. Doesn't seem to listen to me. Maybe it's just me expecting to much.
0.720000	You  choose your doctor and put your faith in them.  If your relationship does not have trust, it will never last. That does not exclude, however, sometimes questioning your doctors decisions.  For that reason, it is important to have a place where you can always get a second opinion. 
0.560000	I have to trust them right now because they tell me whats wrong with my body and I feel like if I dont listen to them something bad will happen to me.
0.600000	I saw the results of his work and I know I can trust him in terms of whats best for my health. Not sure about what he is charging me for it...
0.920000	My doctor is very thorough at explaining my different treatment options and also understands her limitations. After working with her for sometime to find treatment for my migraines she referred me to a specialist who was able to help.
0.560000	My doctor seems pretty neutral. The last time I went in, I had a question regarding this rough itchy spot on my skin. He didn't look at it and asked me if I've tried any over the counter steroid creams on it.
0.640000	I know they have the knowledge, but they also deal with so many patients on a daily basis, that I feel like they can get careless and annoyed easier because of that. I worry they don't care as much as they should.
0.800000	I feel that my doctor does all that they can to provide me the best healthcare. I have never felt that they were being dishonest with me. They alwayws are open to my questions and doubts.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because i have history with him. He has gained my trust by listening to my concerns and having my best entry
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he has never tried to get me to do any treatment I didn't feel was right for me regardless how he felt
0.840000	I trust them because the stuff they usually tell me works or is true. Also ,I've been going to this doctor for a while.
0.920000	They have always taken great care of me & my family. My doctor has been in the family for several generations. He knows our history very well.
0.760000	I do not trust them because they will just prescribe you with over the counter drugs that will end up killing the human body one day.
0.920000	 My primary care doctor had shown diligence in researching ways to help me personally. She knows my conditions and is careful to address all of my concerns. I trust her because she's earned that trust over time. 
0.680000	I trust my doctor because I trust the profession. I appreciate that he explains things alytically, which is consistent with the way I process information.
0.760000	In my experywith him he never made any decision or recommended any medical decision that was not for my best
1.000000	I fully trust my PCP. He is always verbose in his explations and open to any and all questions. He has fostered a great trusting relationship.
0.640000	I have only gone to my primary care physician for about a year now and hadn't had one before that for 20 years. So far he has given me no reason to distrust him and has been open to conversations about various problems. I don't have enough data to have a strong opinion on how trustworthy he is but I am assuming he is.
0.560000	I trust my physician because they do the best of all that they can. With telling yiu everything you want to hear.
0.600000	I trust him to an extent, but not fully.  I believe he presents the options that are available to me honestly, but I would not trust him to make medical decisions on my behalf - in an important situation or when facing a problem I would want a second opinion, would want to do some research myself, would want to talk to other people about the situation, etc.  I also think my doctor, like many, is often more rushed for time and more concerned with getting to the next patient than I would like him to be.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because they're very helpful. They always answer any questions I may have, no matter how silly they might seem
0.920000	I trust my primary care doctor completely. He save my life many years ago and I have never gone to anyone else.
0.880000	I have been seeing him for a few years now. He is very thorough and he explains things to me very well when I have questions.
0.920000	He is trained to do his job and to do it well. He took an oath and doctors are supposed to keep up with the latest research and developments in health care. If he makes a mistake he risks his job and reputation not to mention his ability to practice medicine. I have no reason to doubt he would do everything he can to help me as my doctor.
0.720000	Because we are supposed to trust our doctors. If there was no trust we wouldn't be with them. Most doctors have a fairly good patient doctor relationship. 
0.680000	I trust them because I feel like they know what they are doing and how to approach a certain problem. I also trust them because previous treatment have turned out to be good for my problems 
0.680000	I trust my doctor to give me the best advice that they are aware of. I do not think of doctors as gods or in fallible, because of which I do not trust them without question. I also do my own research and seek second opinions when I feel I should. I do know that my doctors want to give the best care they can provide, that just might not be the actual best care availible
0.800000	I'm neutral about some docters and physicians. They can tell you what they think is goo for you but then things can turn out to be bad for you. For instant my wife had high blood pressure. Her blood pressure is always high and she is on medication. They have switched her medicine about 4 times saying that the next one will help, which neither one has helped. I don't that everything they say and everything they supply to you. 
0.800000	we have had a long relationship and I have never had any issues with and concerns that have come up with my health that was not resolved.
0.760000	I generally trust my primary care physician because she has been my doctor for a long time. I trust what she has to say as she has not given me any reason to not trust her yet.
1.000000	I can really trst my doctor because he does know what medical treatment is best for me and also what medication is right also.
0.800000	I went to many doctors before I chose mine. She is very caring and very careful and attentive. I can tell she really cares and has my best interest at heart. 
0.560000	I try to trust my doctor, but it's a hard line to walk. On one hand, I know (or hope) he became a doctor to help others. On the other hand, pharmaceutical companies love to push harmful, addicting medications on you and because the doctors are in cahoots with them, medicines are pushed onto patients. It is a bad cycle that makes me wary of their judgements.
0.680000	I went through few primary doctors. Some are trustable more than other. Over all i trust them because i don't know any better than them. Of course, i make sure i understand what they are saying and what they mean. What are the advantage and disadvantage of particular medicine or treatment before i make my decision? If i  have a certain condition and if i don't trust them then that not good for my health. If i am doubtful then i will take the second opinion. But i will not ignore completely what my doctor is saying.
0.840000	I trust him because I have a lot of experience with doctors due to a heart problem I had several years ago. I know he is conscientious and thorough and he presents all the alternatives to me.
0.600000	I feel like doctors are usually in a rush to see as many patients as possible and just throw out the most broad diagnosis and treatment that they can hoping it will solve the problem. I feel like if something is more complicated to diagnose, it will take a long process of narrowing down if they ever even get it right
0.840000	I think sometimes doctors focus too much on pharmaceutical prescriptions to mask problems when it would be wiser to get to the underlying problem. In general, though, their solutions to help and can help someone who is getting or is sick.
0.800000	I have had a relationship with my primary care physician for many years.  Throughout those years I have never had a reason to question his care.  He is a straight shooter and tell you what you need to hear whether you want to hear it or not.
0.840000	If I go to a mechanic, i assume he knows more about cars than me.  If i go to a physician I expect the same.  I am in no place to tell the doctor how I should be treated medically.
0.480000	"I have little faith in the medical system as a whole simply based on what I have persolly experienced as a person with arthritis and chronic pain, and based on what people I know with other chronic conditions have experienced generally.  In the past, my condition has been ""written off"" as being caused by things I know it is not caused by (for example, the last time I went to a rheumatologist, I them I have had joint pain for most of my life, and their response was it is the insomnia I have only just recently been plagued with that is causing it when for 90% of my life I had a very healthy sleep schedule), thus preventing me from getting proper treatment and having to jump through hoops to ""disprove"" what I already know.  I generally feel doctors do not trust my own knowledge on my health, and therefore I am not totally trusting of them or their motivations.  "
0.880000	He hasn't given me a reason not to trust him. When I have questions he has answers. And if he doesn't I can certainly count on him to find them.
0.800000	Honest and answers all my questions openly every time I go. Can always openly talk to and discuss what's on my mind
0.360000	doctors are human beings.  their work is a job just like other people have jobs.  people are people.  you have competent ones, and incompetent ones.
0.560000	As to doctors in general, I don't trust them completely because they will often do what is best for them rather than what is best for the patient. For instance, they may not prescribe a patient with chronic pain the right medication because they don't want to prescribe certain drugs.
1.000000	I feel really good when I go to my doctor because I know that I can go in the office with a bunch of questions and I will have them all answered by the time I leave. I do not feel rushed, which is a huge deal for me. I think my doctor is thorough and very interested in my as a patient rather than just a number or someone written in his appointment book.
0.920000	My doctor has been treating Me for years.He always treats me right and talks to me about what's going on
0.640000	I trust my doctor to give me all the options I have for any situation but I don't completely trust her to make the best decision for me because it's a business and in any business, people care more about their profit
0.960000	"I trust my physician because she is always very personable with me. She always gives me both the ups and downs to new medications and doesn't push me to take anything that ""she wouldn't take"". "
0.920000	My doctor has never shown me a reason to distrust her. When I visit her, she never makes me wait long, she is timely and responsible to any issues I have. If I call her office for a refill, I never have to make a second call like at some doctor's offices. Her staff are professional and responsive. I am quite happy with my primate care physician.
0.720000	I don't trust doctors because their not trustworthy I always trust my gut instinct. And I don't know why I have to type so much
0.720000	I trust my physician because they're always honest with me and seem to have my best interest in mind. I've never had a bad experience. 
0.920000	"My primary care physician believes in preventive medicine. If there is a potential problem with any health issues, she will address them and not say, "" Let's wait and see if things will get better."
0.600000	i like mty proimary care physical physican i like him alot he seems like a nice dood i can trust him with a lot of info :)
1.000000	He takes time and explains everything.  Then he has me to tell him what I heard him say.  He makes sure you know what he is saying before you leave.  Then he gives you written instructions just in case
0.480000	I haven't gone to see my doctor for a while because I haven't had any new, pressing issues, but I do believe that, in general, doctors have an expert opinion that cannot be gained from internet sources such as WebMD. However, with the fairly broken medical system we have in America, I also understand that many doctors may have profit motives outside of simply providing the best care possible, and so I question choices and opinions when possible. 
0.400000	I don't trust them anymore. I will go to the Emergency room if I have to but the doctors where I live are all foreign. The nurses in the hospital are all from Haiti. I live near 33460 and we have tons of illegals and foreign people here. They don't seem to care as much about quality of care, like I had growing up in Alabama.
0.600000	The last time I visited my primary care physician, I felt they were a bit distant and basically told me to put ice on a foot injury, then walked away. Was kinda weird. Seemed like they wanted to leave.
0.760000	I've been going to my primary physician for years and she has earned my trust. Also my mom who works in the medical field says nothing but praises for my primary physician.My primary physican gives me good advice and tries to maintain my health in the right area.
0.680000	My doctor seems like a sincere individual who would not do anything to intentionally harm me.  He also seems to enjoy his job and be highly qualified.  He does not get frustrated when you ask him questions, and always has an answer ready.  Nonetheless, if i had a serious medical issue, i would of course get a second or third opinion.  This isnt because i distrust my doctor, it is just because i feel it would be the smart thing to do.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he is not too quick to prescribe drugs.  If there is a natural approach to fix the problem he will give safe suggestions to try before encouraging a drug fix to the problem.  And what he has suggested has worked for the most part.
0.640000	It's great. It's convenient. It's trustworthy. I would trust it with anyone. He's nice. He's patient. He's trustworthy
0.600000	I am not sure he takes the time to understand everything is happening to me. Sometimes I think his time is much more valuable than my health.
0.400000	I have had the same issues for years the the Doctors never can find anything wrong.  It is extremely frustrating!
0.800000	Well, this doesn't seem like a very good question to me. But I think that one has to trust their doctor or find another one to deal with. So what can I say. that is about it, about that........
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he is extremely careful and honest telling me about all the different treatment options all the time.
0.960000	He is extremely careful and asks many questions. He has always been very inquisitive and helped me understand my thyroid problem.
0.680000	I trust my physician to Inform me of all the different options available to me, I also trust that they know what they are talking about but I also seek second opinions in many cases.
0.880000	So far nothing has happened to encourage me to distrust my primary care physician.  To be honest, there are very few primary care physician's that I have ever distrusted.
0.600000	I really have no reason not to trust my physican or my doctor in general. They are all comptent medical professionals
0.880000	I always trust my doctor unless I have a gut feeling that's something is really wrong with me then I will go get a second doctor to look at me
0.640000	I trust my primary care physicians because they have experience with medical issues that I do not understand.
0.960000	Because me and my doctor are able to go over every ingient so I will have a better understanding what each one does
0.760000	I trust my condition but some of my condition can't just be cured it will take alot of money to fix all the problems I have and the work that's cut out for me
0.840000	I trust my doctor totally    He does what is in the best interest for me and my family   He is very knowledge and dedicated to me
1.000000	My doctors are very aware of my physical circumstances and listen to any objections I have. We agree together as to what is needed. If I have an objection, they willingly listen to me and change things.
0.840000	I believe that doctors enter the profession because they want to help people. It would be unethical for them to mislead their patients. 
0.760000	I trust them because my family uses them and have used them before I was here. I feel like that is the biggest thing that makes me feel like I am taken care of.
0.720000	I basically trust my doctor because he does have a treatment that works. Sometimes I wish they would listen to their patients a little more.
0.760000	Well he knows what is best. I'm sure he doesn't want to get sued for doing something wrong. He wants to do the best he can do. 
0.680000	The reason why I mostly trust my primary care physician is because he examines and explains all physical circumstances to the best of his knowledge. Every challenge I have encountered rendered very positive results thus far. Although I am also aware that my doctor is not perfect and is very capable to error. This is why it is important to research certain medical ailments on my own as well. Asking plenty of questions are always in order when it comes to my well being.
0.480000	I had a doctor I could trust but when we moved to a new state several years ago, I haven't found one I could trust here. I've found larger medical practices where the doctors are in a hurry and you usually end up seeing someone different every time you go.
0.600000	There is a hidden agenda in the medical practice in which medications are pushed for revenue, this is not necessarily a bad thing but it does make one accept most pill-based medications with a grain of salt.
0.400000	I think they are more concerned about what is easier for them rather than for you. In my experience they would much rather just give you something than figuring out why you are feeling this way or have the problems you have 
0.960000	I was sick 10 years ago and my doctor was awesome! He explained everything and put me in the right hands of another doctor in the hospital
0.600000	I tend not to trust doctors in general to a great degree. I have list family members to negligent care from doctors. I myself have a rare cardiovascular condition that most local doctors don't know a great deal about and, more importantly, don't try to learn. I feel very afraid overall and cannot be reassured by local doctors because of that reason. I have already had one major heart attack with cardiac arrest so one would think they would pay attention. 
0.600000	I have some trust in the primary care physician because they are there to help you not to hurt you. Most of the nurses and doctors are very good people.
0.800000	I trust my doctor's ideas and decisions, but I also allow for the possibility of human error or the fact that she might not know everything about what I'm feeling to give the exact solution I need. Whether that be because I left out something important or because she or I forgot to ask certain questions. My doctor is great, experienced, and well meaning so I don't doubt her but I don't take her word as a complete final decision either.
0.560000	I don't know if I trust doctor's in general, I feel that they may be only looking out for themselves, but I can't pinpoint why. It's probably just distrust for that type in general.
0.320000	I recently had a doctor inject me with a different medication than what I normally take, without ever informing me of this or obtaining my consent. It was a generic form of the medication, which I understand is apparently legal to do. I however find it extremely and highly unethical. I have switched doctors as of today. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he has taken an oath to treat his patients as such. No doctor wants the reputaion of bad advice. They take this seriously to become esteemed physicians in the USA.
1.000000	My primary care physician has always been there for more over the years. I have been seeing him for almost 10 years now. He always cares about my well being and does everything he can to make sure I am in good physical and mental health.
0.960000	"Very caring.  His words to me were ""I'm going to treat you like I would treat my Mama.  And I love my Mama.""  He has even called me at home after hours to make sure I am okay."
0.800000	I guess I could say that I trust my primary doctor because he hasn't given me a reason not to trust him.  He is upfront, tells me about options, explains procedures, and is good natured.  I believe he is looking out for my best interests and until he does otherwise, I will have trust in him.
0.800000	I don't have a primary doctor right now but all the doctors I be been too turned out good whatever they recommended worked 
0.640000	Because they are all about getting as much money as possible. And getting as many patients in and out quick as possible.
0.560000	I trust her because she is a licensed doctor and looking out for what is best for me. If my physician wasn't trustworthy, i'm sure they would've stripped her of license to practice medicine.
0.680000	I trust my doctor.He has always come through for me.He has never steeredme wrong. He has always helped me with my health and known the right things to do.
0.560000	I know you lying. I was just aBout to make sure you have to be a good girl. She said she was going to move up there for the summer. I was just aBout to get married. The only way to get my own place in the bed . U can be found in the bed and breakfast in the bed  
0.760000	My primary care physician shows a genuine interest in me. She shows that she cares about health, calories, weight and healthy food. I trust her.
0.720000	I trust my doctor for the most part.  A doctor isn't always aware of all the side effects of a medication or its interactions with other medications.  Medicine is changing very quickly and it is hard to keep up with the latest developments.
0.760000	My doctor is pretty clear about his observations and at the same time considerate about my thoughts 
0.640000	I trust my caregivers because they would not decieve me. They are supposed to do no harm and care about their patients
1.000000	My doctor takes out time to work with me on everything. She recommends services as well as gives me handouts and relates my health to her personal experiences 
1.000000	Physicians have generally given me plenty of information and different options for care. They explain things when asked. I have rarely encountered physicians that are not attentive to my needs as a patient.
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been honest with me and has always given me clear direction. He has never pushed any drugs or treatments on me that would be unnecessary. He is very thorough and complete when I go in to visit. He makes me feel very comfortable when I am with him, and I never leave his office feeling confused. 
0.760000	In general, I trust doctors as they have a tremendous amount of experience, but they are also sometimes rrow in their views of what types of remedies work. So, I trust but reserve my right to question things.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because i've built a relationship with them over a number of years. We have open communication regarding any health issues i may have. We talk about those issues openly and at length. I never feel like i'm being rushed out the door. I never wait for a long period of time in the waiting room. I'm given ample resources in order to understand and educate myself. 
0.960000	She does not pretend to know everything. She considers my ideas and opinions. When it comes to my health we act as a team.
1.000000	My doctor is up-to-date on newest medical treatments and experimental data. She is forthright in talking with me, asks me a lot of questions, and explains everything so I can understand what she is saying. She has a sense of humor. She is thorough in her record keeping, follow-up with me, and treats me as an individual, not a number. She's young, bright, and persoble.
0.880000	I trust my doctor to give me the most up to date information concerning my health and well being.She emails me when I need to keep up with my chronic condition appointments concerning my diabetes.I get frequent emails with my lab results and information that my doctor wishes to relay to me.
1.000000	She is amazing and extremely knowledgeable. She makes time for me whenever I need to see her and she provides updates results within 24 hours.
0.720000	I don't know, I haven't been to a regular doctor for four years. I went to the gynecologist like two years ago, and that went pretty well. I've known that doctor since I was a little kid (~3-4 years old), so I do tend to trust her. I think that most doctors are probably pretty trustworthy, because they really have to work hard to become doctors in the first place, so they probably wouldn't be bad people after all of that hard work.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because they seem trustworthy and have had more experience than me.
0.800000	i really trust my primary care physician because i have been having them for a while and they always let me know everything and keep me updated as well with everythiing that i need to know
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I know she has done this for many years. She's a professional and cares about each patient. 
0.720000	I generally trust my primary care physician because she has been with my family for many years. She took over a practice from another older physician that helped my mother and needed to retire. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I feel she is very open and he honest with me. I also trust her because she is very relatable. 
1.000000	each time i go to the doctor, she always explains things clearly. She gives me all the options I have to cure what ails me. If she does not know an answer she is not afraid to say it either. So I know she won't just make something up.
0.680000	In the ocean of herbs R t univ the itty of the workaround behavior Thucydides gets geggeheeyywgshd gsgeyehd
0.600000	I trust my primary doctor to a certain extent sometimes worry that they choose prescriptions thru firms that they get something from so push that companies pills
0.720000	It's never occurred to me not to trust her. She seems to explain things well. I don't know how to expand on this answer - it's never something I've thought about before. 
0.640000	I generally trust my primary care physician due to the relationship that we have developed. Over the several years that I have visited their office I have come to know and trust the opinion of my doctor and feel that he is looking out for what is the best for me. 
0.720000	i feel my dr has my best interest at heart. Everything is always explained to me. I feel as if my dr really cares about my well being.
0.600000	 When they make a diagnosis without hearing symptoms from me, and I feel rushed out with minimal dialogue. 
0.440000	I trust them a little but often feel they want to rush to get to next patient and not focus on me 100%  or learn all there is about my situation
0.920000	He is the professional with access to studies regarding medications and illnesses.  If I didn't trust in him, then do not know where I would turn.
0.840000	My primary doctor is really good with patients and caring.  I think she has her patient's best interest in her heart.  She is careful not to give me too many pills of the same med.  For example she didn't want to give me any more of the pink blood pressure med, so she gave me a different one so I could have more of what I needed but not too much of one kind.  
0.480000	I feel like doctors are very much about profit for themselves. I don't think that they have my best interest at heart a lot of the time.
0.880000	I feel I can trust my primary care physician because he has shown me that the decisions he helps me make about my health are the ones that are best for me. My doctor is also very clear about the decisions he makes.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I know him very well. He is more than just my physician, he is my friend. The decisions he makes are in my best interest. 
0.760000	 trust my doctor because he is very knowledgable about most if not all medical information that is relevent to my medical and emotional wellbeing. if i have any questions, he explains what i need to know to make an informed decision.
0.720000	My primary care physician is a resident student so its hard to fully put trust in them because at some point they will be gone.
0.800000	I DO TRUST MY NEW DOCTOR.  SHE IS RIGHT TO THE POINT ABOUT THINGS.  SHE TELLS YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND TELLS YOU HOW SHE FEELS WHEN YOU DON'T DO IT.  SHE HOLDS NOTHING BACK.  SHE HASN'T LET ME DOWN AS OF YET.  
0.960000	My PCP has given me care for over 25 yrs so I literally trust her with my life ang9the life of my child.
0.720000	I trust that my doctor is not going to do anything overtly damaging regarding my care however I do not trust that he is willing to fully treat some medical issues of mine. I have severe anxiety and depression and my doctor is unwilling to treat this issues medically to my satisfaction which causes some quality of life issues for me that greatly reduce my functiolity as a person.
0.800000	I have never been given a reason to not trust my doctor and he always seems to take precautions even when he believes everything is ok.  This makes me feel better because he is not just going off of book knowledge and things he's seen in other cases.
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician, but not too much. I always try to get answers from multiple sources, so I never fully go with what one individual says.
0.920000	I have known my physician for over thirty seven years as I worked around him at the local hospital where we both worked .He is very informed of each and every health issue I have and if I need a specialist he is very forth coming in recommending one on my behalf
0.760000	For the most part, I trust my doctor and her looking out for my best interests. I tend to not fully trust anyone and always think there's a possibility for alterior motives, but for the most part, I trust my doctor's advice.
0.400000	My primary care physician didn't thoroughly investigate my son's condition when I brought him in. She just assumed it was the Flu because of the season. My son was later diagnosed  with a Pneumonia.
0.840000	my doctor said I am healthy as a fat horse I get check-ups on the daily and II take very good care of my body watch what I eat and I keep my levels on track and I'm hung
0.640000	I often feel that doctors have their own agenda when it comes to diagnosing patients. After all the medical field is for profit. To that effect, I am cautious about completely trusting doctors.

0.800000	Sometimes I think that most doctors are honest and some give wrong diagnosis. Byt I've never been given the wrong diagnosis by a doctor everything has been accurate.
0.360000	I was diagnosed last year with NF 1.. instead of my doctor trying to get me to a genetics doctor who specializes in what is wrong with me all he would do is say I had a patient with that once.. no test, no scans, no mri's, nothing to see what is going on inside.. I would show him the tumors on the outside of my spine and no reaction.. just I use to have a patient with that..
0.840000	i feel that i can trust my doctor because they always give me all the information that i could possibly need regarding treatment plans. they always treat me like a person. and whe also treats the whole person not just the issue and she doesn't just try to push pharmaceuticals on patients.
0.760000	I had a bad doctor, ended up almost dying because we (doctor and I) ignored my health. After getting out of icu, I changed my doctor and my attitude regarding my health. I an now back on track with a doctor who listens and makes me listen! 
0.960000	I don't trust any Primary Physician. But I have full trust in my Back Surgeon he takes the time that I need to listen to my general complaints and gives me his best answer based on the knowledge that he has and how it will benefit me as a person. 
0.760000	I believe that most doctors sincerely care about their patients. A doctor should care about his/her reputation. I do not think doctors wake wanting a malpractice lawsuit. He/She will do their best unless there is lack of knowledge.
0.800000	I trust my PHC because diagnosis and prescribed medicines have worked in the past.
0.560000	I trust my Primary because we hve been going to him for years as a family and he cares for each of us as if we are his own family. I feel I can talk to him about most anything.
0.800000	I have been with my primary physician for years and we have built up a rapport. He has never given me a diagnosis that I felt was wrong to real degree. Even if I did not have my own trusted doctor, I believe that it is in a doctor's best interest to provide the best care possible, so it is easy for me to trust a doctor.
0.600000	I trust them, it's there job to make sure people like me are OK. I'm sure you don't go to school for 10 years and not learn anything there.
0.600000	I have hypothyroidism and my doctor does not like to go above what's the current dosing which I believe is what I need in order for it to be effective
0.760000	I guess I was always raised to have the utmost respect and trust in my primary doctor. they have never given me any reason to distrust them. I feel very comfortable with their opinion on all things .
0.720000	Sometimes the doctor will tell me what i need to do or take, instead of giving me options. I know that he isnt always right all the time, so that makes me question him.
0.360000	Although currently I do not have a primary care provider, I have had many MANY throughout my 22 years of existence and there were so many that didn't know what the heck they were talking about. When I can go online and find medical documents from the actual US government along with WHO and the CDC to name a few, showing contradictory information to what I am told by a doctor, it starts to shake your faith in em. Then we also have to get into the deeper part of, do we trust the government? Do we trust WHO or the CDC? And if we do, should be believe them over our own doctors? Should we trust our doctors medical training was equal to or superior to the training of those that work for the government? Can we trust those workers even have credentials and how easily can that be faked or covered up? As you can see the reasons run very very deep and is much more than I care to type here.
0.600000	All doctors, like all eople, are different. In my lifetime I had to change my doctors due to unprofessional aproach.
0.840000	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years now and we get along very well; both of us almost look forward to seeing one another. Also, her being a woman like myself helps with our rapport and my general comfort around her.
0.440000	I've only seen this doctor twice in the past couple of years.  Once for my general physical and he was very careful and checked out when I needed my next tests, etc. I have now not had any blood test for over 2 years, and he just keeps refilling my Rx.  I went in for a skin problem and saw him for 1 minute after waiting 2 hours - I was upset of course.
0.680000	In most instances I do trust my primary care physician but sometimes would rather have another opinion about more complex problems
0.720000	I trust doctors but only as far as I can throw them. There is still a line of distraction in them, and that they do not exist inside of you. You still need to be informed and ask questions 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has done nothing to lose that trust. He always explains why he recommends things
0.760000	They have not misdiagnosed me or ignored my fears or reservations about a particular treatment. My PCP does not treat me as another number.
0.400000	My doctor often says things like I think you have ......  Without any tests or proof I know I should find another doctor
0.640000	While I do think that they can sometimes be thorough and careful, I do believe that sometimes it's only to fit their hypotheses. I don't firmly stand by that, but I do believe some just want to get patients in and out without so much as a second appointment or a scheduling more exams. 
0.760000	I trust somewhat but not fully because I have my own knowledge & ways that I can take care of myself.
0.800000	I trust my doctor she knows whats best for my best treatment and always rightmy doctors has my best interest at heart her opinion top notch
0.880000	"I mostly trust my primary care physician because he is usually right when deciding what is wrong with me. But I do have doubt's wondering if he is always right when deciding what is wrong with me because he has said in the past, ""Try this medicine to see if it goes away and if it's still the same come back."" It makes me wonder if the physician knows what they are doing and if he will be able to help the next time I am sick and know what is wrong with me."
0.640000	I do have a primary care doctor, and generally I trust his advice but sometimes doubt that he is giving me all the information I need about certain situations.
0.760000	Your primary care provider will monitor your health closely by taking your medical diagnostic tests, and coordinating your care with any specialists you may need
0.800000	I believe my physician has my best interest at heart and tries to offer the best professional help as possible.
0.800000	We build a  trusting and  reliable  relations between us. I been with my doctor now for 15 years, so that how we build our relationship between us.
0.920000	"I am a ""Type 2 Diabetic"". I know that my doctor must get frustrated when my A1C count is high. He does not give up on me for not trying my best to control it. He still gives me advice on how to eat, exercise, and not give up. "
0.680000	I always trust my doctor. He has helped me deal with some very important health issues and always been so easy to recover. He is over all very very polite and very careful at my disorders.
0.760000	My first visit was her questioning me about my health in general and if I had all the necessary test up todate?
0.840000	I trust my physician because he knows everything about me and he gives the correct treatment what ever you are suffer
1.000000	I love my Doctor and have been seeing him for over 5 years. He is brutally honest with me about everything and is very blunt, which I love. I like to know everything about any diagnosis and he always tells me both the good and bad possibilities. It makes me feel confident in him because he isn't hiding anything.
0.800000	I trust doctors in general because of my experiences in the past. There are good and bad doctors, but I believe that overall they are trustworthy. 
0.800000	i trust her she is nice i knew her for a long time i love going to her she is a good person she is really kind 
0.520000	I trust her somewhat, but I didnt like that I had to tell her to test for my being anemic and I am an African American women, She acts fast when I go to an appointment, she ruses too much , I feel like she half way cares about people
0.640000	"i think more than the majority of doctors care about their patients but that they are stretched in time needed to actually give the right amount of time to the care of a lot of situations and rushed. i have to trust in the doctors i have. some are better than others but the extent of what is needed to become a doctor entitles the doctor to depend on that trust and my giving it to him. if i knew what was wrong with me, i wouldn't need a doctor but i do know my body and what is going on in it and need to let him know so he knows where to start to ""fix"" me, and also follow his directions. it does make it hard to trust anyone that is in charge of your health and how you feel, live or die when they have not the time to really know their patients and sometimes therefore form clinical decisions that are not necessarily the best answer for them causing the patient to mistrust his doctor. i feel i have no trust but to try to or change doctors."
0.520000	I don't think my doctor has 'bad intentions' towards me or any of the other patients in general, but I do think that It's just a job to him. In a hurry to get to lunch, and in a hurry to get on with his day like anyone else when they work that much.
0.600000	I am pretty neutral in general to how a doctor acts or any motivations I am not seeing. Mostly, I just go when I need to. Get seen and checked on. Told what they think is wrong and then get the medication. If it works great. If it does not then back I go to see what could be the issue. 
0.960000	My PCP is a former Director of the CDC and is a Board Member of the American Cancer Society.  His experience, knowledge and wisdom, associated with viral infections and Cancer, have proven to be a profound blessing.  Also, his associates and other specialists work well as a team when preparing my treatment plans, explaining all of the parameters associated with them, and carrying them out.
0.640000	I have moved to colo. So I have not found a primary doctor yet. The doctor I had in Michigan I completely trusted. They helped me control my asthma. 
1.000000	I have had the same PCP for 16 years, and I trust her completely.  She takes time to actually talk to me about anything, from my personal life to any medical issues I might be having.  I never feel rushed during my appointments, like do when I see other physicians. 
0.760000	I have no reason to mot trust him. He has been p[en gentle kind and sesitive to my conditions. I have no doubts about my trust in him
0.680000	Sometimes doctors are preoccupied with administrative priorities rather than health care. It appears that the government has changed the meaning of health care
0.840000	My primary care doctor is all about making sure I am okay. She always asks questions about how I'm doing and how life is going. She also explains to me all the different routes I can go to see what works best.
0.800000	They seem sincere and seem to care about my well being and always friendly and makes sure im doing everything i need to be doing to be healthy 
0.720000	We all are human with all possible mistakes. I like to have second or even third opinion almost always.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because they are honest. If I didn't trust them I would get a doctor I do trust.  Trust in your doctor is very importan . 
0.880000	My doctor is honest and open with me. He seems to provide all options regarding care and doesn't refrain from telling me things that may be difficult for me to hear. 
0.440000	I do not trust doctors in general. However, since I am not an expert in the field of medicine, there are times when I feel really sick and have to consult a doctor. In such situations, I try my best to ask all possible questions that I have about my illness and the course of action suggested by the doctor. Only if I am completely satisfied with the answers will I follow the advise given by the doctor. If I feel that the doctor is being dishonest, then I will either seek a second opinion (if I am very sick) or treat myself with home remedies.
0.600000	Health system is so costly everyone seems to be able to become easily wealthy on their patients expense. High medical bill, high medicine cost, high everything.
0.800000	I trust my doctor in every way when he tells me what I need to do and when to do it and I have total trust in him
1.000000	He listens to my concerns and acts to put them at ease.  He works with my other doctors to see that I get proper care.  Whenever something new is going on he takes the time to listen to what I have to say, orders test to find out what might be happening and works with me to figure out what needs to be done.
0.840000	I have been seeing this doctor for years and I trust his judgement. I have never had any issues or problems with him that would make me doubt his ability or honesty. I am comfortable with him as well.
0.880000	I feel that I can talk to my physician about anything and ask any questions relating to my health or how I feel.
0.720000	I trust her because she truly does full exams to see whats really wrong with me. So I trust her completely for future examinations.
0.680000	I think that in general doctors have little incentive to be dishonest to patients. However, it is easy for people to have biases that influence them and effect trustworthiness, even if they meant to be honest.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician as she takes the time to listen to all my concerns and gave me the proper advise which so far has been positive. She will tell me the pros and cons of the medication before prescribing it. 
0.880000	I have only had one bad experience with a doctor, and it was because he went against my wishes. Other than that one experience, my normal doctor listens to me completely, and always has insightful advice or resources for me to utilize.
0.800000	Generally the doctors I've had give the impression of compassion and empathy, and at the very least, they seem knowledgeable and confident.
0.560000	I trust him because I have been with him for so long. I know he is looking for my best interest.
0.520000	Because some doctors just don't care about me as a person. For a lot of reason that I know of. And they just don't like me because they think I'm a bad person. But they are wrong. Because I'm as good as I can be.
0.560000	He always refers me out to specialists/it seems he is reserved about making some decisions about my health issues
0.680000	I had a LEEP procedure twice last year. I trust my doctor because She is professional and I am not. However, after having first procedure, She recommended me to have another procedure even though my after procedure result was negative. According to her, Just make sure all bad tissue is taken away by taking bigger portion . So, I followed her recommendation because she is very careful person, but on the other hand, I feel having second procedure is really needed or not.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he tells me the whole truth about my health.  there's no sugar coating anything and he gives me all of the best available options for helping to continue to be in great shape.  All of the advice he's given me has worked, so I will continue to trust in his advice and recommendations.    
0.800000	My doctor is very thorough. She has been since the very first time I met her. Only one time did I think she was extremely busy and didn't have the time to listen to all my aches and pains. But she is quick to refer me to another doctor. I was referred to a dermatologist and thank goodness because what I had turned out to be melanoma.
0.920000	I have had doctors I did not trust, and quickly sought a new doctor. To me, it is one of the most important decisions a person can make. I need to feel they are thorough, caring, and aren't just passing over any concerns I have. If I am unhappy with a doctor, I have no problem asking to see a different one. The one I have now is very caring, compassiote, and listens, even if the appointment takes  a little longer than expected.
0.880000	Ive seen my doctor for a long time, since I was a child, so I feel very comfortable in their choices and opinions. They have never let me down before so I dont see why they would now. They've always taken good care of me in guiding on the right path and being very transparent.
0.640000	I feel like some doctors love money more than helping their patients. They will make you take test that you don't really just to bill your insurance and make money 
1.000000	Because she is always open and honest with me. She doesnât sugar coat anything for me. And that is exactly the way I like it. She takes her time with me. She never acts like she s in a hurry or look at her watch and clock all the time.
0.520000	I have learned that it is best to watch out for yourself  with the medical field.   Find out all you can about any treatments they suggest.
0.440000	I dropped my primary care because I did not trust him.  The people that worked with him were incompetent and he did not want to hear that they gave me the wrong information.  I have had extremely bad care for my father from a doctor in a rehab.  I have a very hard time trusting any doctor.
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because he has helped me find treatment for things when I have gone to me and given me advise on how to treat things in a helpful way.
1.000000	I trust my physican because of the help and treatment I have received has helped greatly. I have a better healthier life. 
0.720000	I'm not sure if I trust the Doctor.  Now a days, he checks things off on the computer, while asking me questions.  I can do that!  Is the system good or is the doctor??? I don't know!  ...not sure!!!
0.920000	I trust Mt physician because they are very thorough and tell me the truth they answer my questions at all times
1.000000	I feel that he is well educated in his field and he very friendly.  I feel that he truly loves what he doing. I also just trust Kaiser to hire the best doctors.
0.320000	I feel that since the practice I go to has switched/been bought by or covered by a certain medical group, the quality of care has greatly declined, and I've noticed several subtle and some not so subtle changes for the worse. I have gone in so many times trying to figure out what is causing my body some negative problems (pain, easily fatigued, etc) and I just keep getting the run around, it seems. I am considering finding a medical practice that hasn't yet been bought out or taken over by the specific umbrella medical group, which has been difficult. I don't believe that prescription drugs that just bandaid a situation are the answer. I don't like to take a bunch of Rx, and would appreciate some direction from my physicians, but haven't gotten much help in that dept.
0.880000	I trust them to do the right things for me and have my best interests in general. They be open and straightforward about it.
0.760000	I trust my primary doctor because I have no choice but to, and most of the time i think doctors are usually here to help us so why would they not want to do what is right for their patients.
0.920000	He knows me well and even asks me if I have researched something to enable us to better understand a subject
0.800000	i think my primary care physician is very skilled and is straight-forward.  he is also compassionate (and funny)
0.920000	love my doctor. Explains everything really well and understands me. 
0.680000	I will trust my doctor because he can find the minor issue that other doctor may not be found.
0.840000	They always help me when I'm  in need of help with my medical needs. I been going to  them for a long time and I trust them
1.000000	My doctor has always shown care and concern for me. She has never once brushed aside my feelings or acted as if I was stupid. She has always taken time to answer my questions. 
0.520000	I never fully trust a doctor because I know they are just human beings. As a lawyer, I understand that there are many people who can go through medical school and come out under-qualified.
0.840000	I trust her, but so far she's been fine. I was diagnosed with Diabetes 5 years ago, and then my doctor retired and I started with this doctor. I lost 55 pounds on my own and she took me lots of my meds including Alendronate because I was on it for 10 years. My osteoporosis didn't get better, but stayed the same then I hurt my back and they found two fractures, so she put me back on it. She also doesn't check for A1C because no diabetes anymore. So I trust her, but really doesn't check a lot of things.
0.640000	At times, non-traditiol treatment options may be overlooked or undervalued depending on a doctor's experience and history, when altertive options paired with modern medicine can find a useful balance.
0.800000	They have always explained why they are going to use a certain kind of treatment and why it's best for me. I've never gotten the impression that they were out for their own gain. I have always been taken care of and wouldn't look to switch any time soon.
0.720000	My doctor has been honest with me since I've been with her. 
0.960000	my doctor is also my employer. she is very kind and listens to my problems. we have a great work ant patient relationship. 
0.680000	My doctor is very straight forward and honest but he's not rude about how he explains things to you. He always explains situations to the best he can so that you understand what needs to be done. 
0.800000	I have rarely had a bad experience with a doctor.  Also, I don't have much choice.  What else would i do?
0.320000	I think he's just motivated by the dollar. Doesn't care if I die, just wants to prescribe me items that he gets a kickback on.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing the same doctor for various things over several years. I have never received bad advice. I feel like he listens to my statements and questions. I feel like he makes informed and educated decisions about my health.
0.600000	I have a neutral opinion. The only time I questioned the doctor's diagnosis was when I still went to a pediatrician, and they thought I had a bacteria infection. It turned out when the sickness came back, it was actually full blown bronchitis. 
0.640000	I trust her education and experience, but she and other doctors spends so little time with patients that I feel it's hard for them to know each patient.
0.880000	I have known this doctor for 32 years he has always been caring and honest with me and my whole family 
0.800000	I've had the same doctor for a very long time and she's always put in the time to see me and help me feel better no matter what's wrong.
0.640000	I feel if I picked them they must be good and good reviwes. I ask others I know as well if they know of my do today and any concerns fromantic them or otbers
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because he is kind and caring.  He gives me options about my treatment, tells be about research that has been done, and lets me choose what I think is the best option.
0.400000	Be sugar coats a lot. I can tell him how ied and what I'm going through and he tells me it's all in my head. 
0.760000	i trust him because he will always make sure i have the information that i need and that i can do what i need
0.680000	It seems to be really easy to trust a physician.  I believe this way mainly because a person who has obtained that level of job and status has dedicated their entire life to getting to that point, and why would they want to be untrustworthy and not provide the best care possible if it were to put their job at risk that they have literally dedicated their entire life too.  However, many physicians may abuse their power or even be untrustworthy because they want to take advantage of you and make as much money as possible. 
1.000000	My doctor always concerned about me I can tell he usvi am very trusting of my doctor I know he cares about me by  his actions I know he is concerned about me 
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because I feel like that I can tell them what I need to tell them. I trust in what ever I need to say to the doc.
0.600000	I distrust my primary physician because all you here these days are how people are being prescribed things that they don't need 
0.640000	I trust my doctor i have been with her over 20 years and i feel they want you to feel better, if you talk to them and tell then what is wrong they will help you 
0.800000	my doctor is up front with any problems i am having and is a good listener hve ben withhim for 9 years and am very satisfied
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician for the most part because he treats my whole family, but I personally don't get along with his personality that much. I feel like he jokes around and doesn't get to the point fast enough. I trust that he knows of A way to treat something, but he feels very confined in his treatments and doesn't feel comfortable exploring other options outside his comfort zone.
0.720000	I am generally trusting of doctors but I do like to do some research on my own as well -- forewarned is forearmed.
0.920000	HE IS THE ONE THAT GOT THE DEGREE AND HE KNOW MORE ABOUT MY PROBLEM THAN I DO SO I TRYTO  KEEP ALL OF MY DOCTOR APPOINTMENT  WITH MY DICTOR.
0.720000	I have never been treated wrong by him.
0.640000	I trust my primary physician because i have found no reason to distrust him. I have found him to be open,frank and accommodating when it comes to my health.
0.720000	They too are not perfect and sometimes have a chance of not getting it right. But for the most part i trust their judgement
0.800000	I believe my primary care physician is trustworthy.  He came up as a PA from the previous doctor that was there at the practice and the retired doctor was very much a people person.  The current doctor has learned a lot from him but is now more of people person as well.  I trust him because he will follow up with questions and answers to treatment options.
1.000000	shes friendly an nice to me an all her patients she does what is best for me  an i trust her a lot  we get along great 
0.800000	in order to feel comfortable and know you have the right doctor for you is to be able to completly trust him and the desicions he makes.
0.680000	I think that I trust my doctor but always try to relay on my own instincts also. If there is something that I don't agree with or a treatment that I'm not sure about, I always wait and do my own research before jumping on board. 
0.680000	None and I'm dong okay and I have nothing to say as for right now and I really don't have no answer for this question that you are asking me 
0.600000	I feel I haven't seen my newest Dr. enough to have complete trust in them. They do give me my options and seem knowledgeable in what they are doing. I do however always have some worries as to if sometimes they are just being paid by some drug companies to give certain meds out or prescribe certain treatments.
0.680000	i trust as i use the primary care physican for years and my family has as well. a stellar reputation in the area . Plus the hospita affilation is strong with good rep there as well
0.320000	I had little choice in who s my primary care physician, limited by my insurance.  He has a large caseload and cannot spend the proper time.  Also, he is careless and has often prescribed inappropriate medication that would have harmed me if taken.  Generally shoddy medical practice
0.680000	I trust my doctor. He's been thorough in diagnosing issues. He's open communication and will try different things in order to assist me
0.960000	I simply trust my doctor, because every time I needed to go to him, he was very clear and helpful about what ever the situation is. My doctor has been in his practice for over 20 years and he is very knowledgeable about his practice. 
0.600000	I don't see a primary care doctor because I have had trouble finding one that really listens to me and works with me to solve my medical problems. It seems to me that they are too busy most of the time and want to solve the immediate need that I have come in for, rather than working towards long term health. 
0.600000	I trust my doctor because he doesn't rush me out of the room and genuinely seems to care. He's gotten to know my family personally. I even have his cell phone number.
0.600000	Sometimes when I visit my doctor, I feel extremely rush and unimportant. Other days, I feel like my doctor actually listens to my problems and needs 
0.760000	I usually trust doctors. I think it's pretty risky for them to be deceitful. In my experience, doctors are honest and kind and smart.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because i have been seeing her for  a while now and i haven't had any issues and she helps me out every time..
0.920000	My doctor has never been wrong. She has always been honest with me, and she knows when I am not taking my medications like I should. She gets me the results of my blood test back in short order, and changes my prescriptions if I feel they are not working.
0.720000	I don't have primary care physician. But i think doctors are okay and do a good job at being a doctor 
0.560000	She seems overburdened, yawns a lot during our visit. I'm just not sure that she's all that engaged. Does spend a good amount of time and is very nice. Just not sure how much she really gets done though
0.640000	I trust Doctors to a certain degree they are trained to give you medication for a problem but I prefer to take natural methods and lean on my beliefs.
0.680000	I trust my physician because I believe he is very knowledgeable and he considers different possibilities- he doesn't jump to conclusions. 
0.760000	I feel my primary care physician is trustworthy. I feel they know whats best for me and will provide any needed assistance if needed.
0.520000	Well sometimes i feel as if my doctor doesn't take the time to really look at me i know they are in a hurry but they could spend just a little more time
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because she is clearly very knowledgeable, and also comes across as confident and direct, which I find reassuring. She is very no-nonsense, which I really appreciate. She is thorough when it comes to tests and exams and I have no reason to believe she has ever misled me with regards to treatment options or anything else.
0.680000	I do not hesitate to ask questions and make sure they know what i want and what i expect. i do my homework so i am familiar with my options ahead of time. i make sure i let them know what options i am interest in and give them the opportunity to discuss those options with me.
0.840000	I have a complete trust  my primary care physician.They dont lie about my health reports and provide me actual information about my health.They even help me understood if anything is hard know about my health conditions.
0.400000	I don't trust my doctors decisions because he is always in a rush when he is visiting patients. He doesn't take the time to explain all my treatment options. When I tell him about symptoms that I have been feeling he doesn't do any tests or anything until months later. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he is very experienced. He is very sincere and honest with me. He is very down to earth and tells me like it is, regardless of how I feel.
0.680000	My doctor does not always tell me all options available. Sometimes this is due to his time constraints. In general I trust him and his opinions.
0.920000	because i feel we have a great relationship beyond patient and dr. i feel he is my friend looking out for my health and well being
0.480000	"I have had the same primary care physician for over ten years now, and he has slowly been losing my trust over the years. I have seen him often over the years and have grown tired of him telling me he can make me feel better or that I will be back to my ""old self"" soon. It never happens. I don't trust that he knows how to help me. "
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician, but I would go with trusting that person because I am sure they know what they are doing. They have more medical knowledge than I do.
0.880000	I trust PCP because I have been a patient of his for over 10 years and I have never got the feeling he has ever been less than truthful with me. 
0.600000	they tell me what i need to kow an are very nice to me all the time i feel like they tell me everything they also talk to my family about my illness
0.800000	I have a god relationship with all of my doctors.  They always take as much time with me as necessary
0.600000	I strongly consider their opionions but dont necessarily trust them. Some doctors force their bias on patients amd are sometimes inpatient and rude. 
1.000000	I love my dr. because she is open to hearing what I have to say and is not interested in bossing me or just telling me something to get me out of her hair.
0.720000	"I trust my doctor because she shows genuine concern and often discusses options with me in regards to my treatment. I am only neutral on some issues because I feel that she is very busy, and often is trying to get through things quickly, or discredits certain things I report as ""just my anxiety"" since I have a medical history with it."
1.000000	My doctors is very qualified and professiol.  I am highly aware that my doctor knows far more than I do.  My doctor has educatiol experience in many areas that I do not. I trust my doctor's knowledge, experience and expertise in all medical situations concerning my health.
0.600000	He is more than likely busy with multiple patients on any given business day. I don't feel like he is completely paying attention to me.
0.640000	I use tricare on a Air Force Base. The primary Docs rotate. I have really liked and trusted my last 2 Doctors but the one I have now, not so much.
0.720000	Because I know him very well. And he is a very knowledgeable person also.
0.520000	I somewhat trust my primary care physician because I do not believe he shares with me all the possible solutions to my ailments. Many of the times he prescribes drugs for something that can be healed with more natural substances. I would like to know the full range of my options, from natural to prescribed medications when making a medical decision.
0.760000	I trust that most doctors truly have their patient's well being in mind when they recommend courses of action. Most doctors that I have seen have been very open with me about my treatment options and about finding what is affordable for me at the time.
0.920000	my primary care physician takes time to talk to me and helps me understand what the medications she prescribes are for and how they can help me. she seems to care about my health.
0.640000	I don't actually believe the doctor is actively trying to mislead, but are they getting an incentive to prescribe one drug over another????  and it is almost impossible to keep up on all the different medical studies.  How up to date are they???  are there other options they don't know about. 
0.680000	I am not in trust with doctors cause they're always changing doctors everyday is not getting close to any doctor if themes a new one the next time u go.
0.720000	I have a hard time trusting doctors sometimes because some of them only seem to in it for the money and dont really have a personal care for helping people be healthy. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor as he has never led me wrong, He listens to me and isn't showing me the door for his next patient..within reason of course...He has been my primary care Doctor for 8 yrs. and he's the best one I have ever had...
0.760000	I have been dealing with my doctor for a very long time, over 30 years. We had many different discussions on multiple ailments, concerns, sickness, cures and how I feel. We always discuss how each cure, symptons, sickness and feelings and he has been thorough discussing what he feels that I need to do, actions that need to be done and when I have been sick he comes up with different suggestions that will assist or cure what ailes me. 
0.600000	I don't know him very well yet, but I think he will be a good fit to handle my complex medical needs.
0.320000	I have seen doctors talk about how canbis is dangerous and can make you hallucite, and then proceed to put my mother on opiates as if they were a safer altertive for pain (with full knowledge of the fact that she was also on SSRIs and benzos). Once she was addicted to opiates, they treated her like an addict. When she quit her pills she lost her mind. She is now in rehab for alcohol and illicit drugs. She never drank or did any drugs before her doctors put her on pills. Meth and heroin are schedule 2 drugs, while canbis/ mdma/ psilocybin/ and lsd are classified as schedule 1 (no medical benefit). I guess I distrust the system more than the doctors, but they mostly have to buy in to the system to make it through med school.
0.360000	Doctors are human, they are arrogant and used to getting their own way, they are inclined to listen to the powers that be instead of to their patients, and they are often lapdogs for the pharmaceutical industry.
0.960000	I trust my PCP because I work with them and for them on a daily basis and i know that thehy care about each and everyone of their patietnts. I trust them to give me the right options and recommendations about my care.
0.640000	I feel doctors are often carrying a heavy work load and are anxious to get patients in and out. If you are not presenting drac tic symptoms they can overlook things
0.680000	I have not seen my PCP very often as I switched about 1 1/2 years ago and mainly have the need to see specialists.  When I have seen my PCP I feel he cared and did what he felt best and was honest with me.
0.800000	My doctor is honest and gives me options. She listens and is patient. My doctor informs me of everything.
0.640000	I generally think they are looking out for me and have my best interests at heart. 
0.840000	I have been seeing him for years and he knows what best for me. We both do research on things to see what will work the best.
0.840000	Any time that I have had medical issues, my doctor has taken the time to explain all options. I never feel rushed when I visit my doctor. My doctor has accurately diagnosed and treated several conditions I incurred.
0.760000	I trust her because she listens to me and genuinely wants to know how i a doing. She suggests things for me to try that fit with my lifestyle instead of pushing pills on me. I appreciate that she isn't rushing to go out the door and listens to what I have to say. She is thorough and has a lot of knowledge in the things i need answers about. Plus one of my illnesses she also has so I get that extra insight.
1.000000	I TALK TO MY DR ABOUT MY HEALTH MY LIFE SHE IS OPEN TO HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY I SAY MY GOAL IS TO LOOSE 5 LBS N I MOMTH SHE SAY SHE SHOULD C THE DIFFERENCE MY NEXT WEIGH IN I SAY U BET
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that we can have made a connection over the past five years. He always tells me how it is with my physical condition and any issues that may be occurring in my life when I visit him. He is thorough with explaining all of my vitals, my lab results, my physical activity, and my history. In addition, he lets me know when I should start doing something different in my eating habits such as eating less fatty and sugary food items. I also think he cares about me when he gives me a serious look and starts critiquing my lifestyle.  
0.800000	i have had nothing but good experiences with my doctor and he has given me no reason whatsoever to mistrust him. He has taken the time to address any and all concerns that I have had.
0.800000	I completely trust my physician.It is important for me to stay healthy for myself and for my family.My physician is a very good person.She is very caring and understanding. She really makes me comfortable.
0.760000	I trust my physician because that is there job unless they want to. Change career paths. But unfortunately that's honestly a doctors duty.
0.560000	I dont have a strong persol relationship with my doctor so I can't really say that they have my best interest in mind. I'm sure they dont want to actively harm me but I don't know if they really care that much. 
0.520000	i just got a new primary physician not too long ago so i dont know him too well. overall i think some doctors, especially psychiatrists (my primary care doctor is a psychiatrist as well) do what is most convenient for themselves.
0.280000	I do not trust my doctore since when I talk with him alone he is rude and makes me feel bad for my depression. Although when I am with my parents he tries to be respectful and acts very different. I have never felt comfortable around him.
0.960000	I've been seeing my current primary care physician for 5 years now. I've had Type 2 Diabetes follow-ups regularly every 3 months for that period of time. The staff in his doctor's office are always very nice, kind, and polite. They're efficient, knowledgeable, and patient. My primary care physician himself is very knowledgeable on just about any condition you may bring up to him. He's always been honest about my health, suggested non-medical ways to address said problem, suggested medical ways to address said problem if non-medical wasn't enough or not appropriate for me personally, and been personable in a professional way. 
0.520000	I don't completely trust my primary care physician because I think he is mostly in it for the money.  He knows that I am very limited financially, yet he insists that I make an appointment to see him for any prescription refills, even if I just saw him two days before.  He routinely prescribes the most expensive drugs, knowing that I can't afford them.  On top of that, his office routinely charges me double what my co-pay is supposed to be.  
0.360000	I have been prescribed medication for an incorrect diagnosis that I must take the rest of my life.  Recently prescribed medication for a wrong diagnosis based on the advice of a doctor misreading the result of a test.  
0.760000	"I see no reason why my pcp would not be honest with me.  I go to a practice where I am seen by residents and interns overseen by attending physicians.  There are plenty of ""checks and balances"" in place to ensure I am getting quality care."
0.920000	I have had the same doctor for at least 10 years.  He has always been completely honest with me and spends a lot of time with me. He will get to the bottom of any discomfort I may have and makes me feel well taken care of.
0.720000	It is her job and she has the training necessary to give me proper information; she also seems to really care about her job rather than just going through the motions and takes time to think about questions I have rather than answering off the cuff, which seems to mean that she is giving some real thought.
0.520000	My doctor is a bit snobbish, so I sometimes worry that he thinks so highly of his opinions that he fails to consider other points of view that might actually be valid. He has a lot of pride because of his immense experience and impressive education. But perhaps he has too much pride. 
0.600000	The pay cash to see my doctor.  I honestly believe he is running the clinic he has for the money.  I do believe he understands the way I feel about my condition because he's experienced the same problems I have, yet I still think he is more worried about money than he is the actual welfare of his patients and their recoveries.
0.800000	As I mentioned earlier, my father was admitted a week ago to my hometown hospital with kidney failure and pneumonia so I'm drawing on my past week. I haven't been to a doctor in a long time or had any medical issues. My interactions with his primary care physician, cardiologist, renal specialist and all his supporting staff have been professional, transparent, caring and seem to be of the highest quality. He's in rehab today after flat-lining and a close brush with death and I have nothing but respect for every medical professional  I've dealt with.
0.760000	My doctor is easy to talk to and I can discuss all medical problems. He immediately explains to me what I can do about my medical problems and suggests simple things that may help me. I can call with a medical problem and will receive answer before 5pm.
1.000000	I think that doctors in general have your best interests in common and that you should trust them generally speaking to help you whenever you need it.  You should follow any and all instructions that they give you under most circumstances unless you feel you might need a second opinion from another doctor.
1.000000	I been with the same doctor for ten years at least. She and I are not just patient and doctor but true friends. I know she has my best interest.
0.800000	We have a family doctor that I started going to at an early age and now this doctor sees my daughter. Myself and my family members have been seeing this doctor for many of years. There has been a lot of trust built between us We do believe he has our best interests in mind..
0.680000	I don't always believe that I can trust physicians in general. I believe that some of them care more about marketing certain products or services and they try to sell it to you, without being honest about the products and it's side effects etc. 
0.560000	I always have to call and remind my Dr. of things we already discussed.  In someways they are good, but still needs some work.  I don't like it when they screw up the Rx's or don't place the orders.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. He's certainly smarter than me and I let him know what's going on. I feel like because I'm open and honest with him he's that way with me.
0.720000	I feel like I have a bond with my doctor and i feel as if he has my best interest at heart. I trust his decisions when it comes to my health.
1.000000	My Primary care physician is very thorough and can recognize the problem very quickly. I have seen her for anything from a serious illness to a fall and she has known what the problem was so soon as I explained to her how I feel and she saw the injury. She has always been correct in her diagnosis and has sent me to great specialists when the need arises.
0.760000	I have honestly only seen my doctor a few times and it was after I had my child and what I like is that she is personable and takes her time making sure I'mâ well taken care of
0.640000	I do trust my doctor to give me the best care possible. But I also believe nobody is perfect and everyone makes mistakes sometimes.
0.880000	Because one Doctor put me on medicine that would kill me, didn't believe my medical records.  And couldn't be bothered to ask.  Reduced my faith in everyone in the medical profession
0.360000	I do not trust completely in my doctor or any doctor for that matter. In 2010, I kept having chest pains and the doctor said that it was nothing. I had them for about a week and then one day I almost passed out in the parking of my electric company and I was taken to the ER. Come to find out I had a blood clot in my lung. I do not trust doctors. If I have a illness I will try and fix it myself.
0.600000	I feel like my doctor seems me as a number and not as a patient. He never allows me to fully discuss all of my issues and just rushes me out. He comes off cold and i do not have trust in him but will be looking for a new doctor.
0.560000	I distrust all the doctors because I do not see that they try to help, they just thinking how to sell expensive medicine or expensive treatment. They offered my son a new medicine for treating his allergy for $100 out of pocket, this medicine is extremely new and doesn't tested enough, knowing that allergy problems start from the gut I can't except the doctor who sell skin creme and doesn't think about the gut. This doctor drives Tesla is that possible, no. That is why I am extremely careful I try not to argue but can't accept to work who are thinking about their profit instead of helping patients
0.800000	I trust my doctor. She is very thorough and follows up on any concerns I may have. If she is not familiar with something, she researches it so that she can better help me.
0.280000	I feel as if my concerns are not addressed by my doctor.  I feel he is too busy with too many patients and will tell me one thing in one phone call and a week later will forget his direction to me or forget what we discussed or what my initial concern was about in the first place.  He isn't a problem solver for me but rather he dismisses my concerns and makes me feel unimportant.
0.800000	She addresses all my questions in a thoughtful and caring manor. She never seems like she's trying to rush me out of the exam room. Also, I've been seeing her for a few years and have never had a bad interaction or diagnosis that was wrong.
0.440000	Most doctors are in the pockets of big pharma, and too willing just to prescribe pills insteas of really looking into the problem.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I know that they are working hard to provide the best care possible. There are some money hungry doctors. But as long as I constantly talk to my doctor and they are honest with me then everything will be alright.
0.840000	My physician takes the time to listen and does not rush me when I visit. They ask many questions and answer any I may have
0.640000	My primary care physician can be very blunt but that is because he has a lot to do for a lot of patients. When he speaks with me, I know my health is his only focus. I trust him because he tells me what I need to know, his professional recommendation on treatment plans and medications are trustworthy. 
0.960000	I trust my primary physician because I take the time to ask them questions and gauge their answer.  If they do not seem to speak as if they have my needs in their consideration, I switch physicians.
0.840000	My GP knows more about medicine than I do and the only way diagnosis and treatment will work is if I participate and do my best as a patient.
0.520000	I feel like sometimes he's in a rush and just wants to move on to the next patient.  He addresses issues but I don't feel like he's being thorough and thinking through his answers.
0.760000	I do not trust or distrust my doctor. They are only human and are capable of making mistakes so I trust my doctor but if necessary I will opt for a second opinion if I am uncomfortable with anything 
0.600000	I neither fully trust or distrust my doctor because sometimes they are trying  to help genuinely, and then other times it feels like she is selling products.
0.800000	I trust them because if they wouldn't be in the position that they in . Most doctors have an degree in which medical information they giving out . So I would most def out my trust in all the Doctor's that are at the physicality 
0.760000	i have been seeing my doctor of over thirty years and he has never led me to anything that would hurt or harm me
0.640000	My doctors are great and listens sometimes, but sometime looks over some of the problems I am experiences.  I have been having a shooting pain in my foot and all she says is its your nerve but haven't checked it out.
0.480000	"Generally speaking, doctors are a product of their systems and culture. They often see themselves as godlike figures, incapable of being questioned, and the environments where they work, with their constant reverence for doctors, reinforce that mentality. This, combined with their fear of liability often makes them completely averse to anything new or different, even when the literature and research show that there is significant potential benefit. I feel that more doctors are concerned about ""not rocking the boat"" than doing what is best for the patient. There are, of course, stellar exceptions, and I have been fortunate to work with some of them.   "
0.800000	Before she retired, I had a good relationship with my former primary care.  She was very open with me and worked with me to better my help.  I really trusted her.  Now she is gone and I'm back at square one with no one I trust.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because I do not really have a better option. If I am sick I have to go and visit him hoping that he can figure it out how to get better. But on the other hand health care system is lead by money so it all comes to the end where it is about our pocket. If everyone would be healthy then hospitals, health care providers, doctors etc. would be in a big trouble. No customer means no paycheck. So till a certain extent they must have patients. Health care system does not create cure. It creates consumers.
0.720000	I would trust my doctor because she has a lot of experience and is well rounded. she always answers my questions with quality answers and really listens
0.800000	My doctor says a good businessman can never be a good doctor and a good doctor cannot be a good businessman. My doctor has a simple practice in which he spends considerable time with each patient.
0.640000	I have a new doctor and he seems fine. So far he persoble and seems knowledgeable. I hope over time he will be a good choice.
0.440000	I have had doctor's only tell me information that would make them the most money, or be lazy and not give me all the information, especially if was not convenient for them.  It's hard to ever know for sure if a doctor is telling you everything or not.
0.800000	They have a good reputation and I have never seen/had anything major to complain about. They have in the past referred me to a specialist whom they thought was better rather pretend to have superior expertise.
0.560000	My primary care physician is kind and he listens but I feel he is often in a hurry and hears my words but only the ones that he wants to. He wants to order more test on top of more tests and sends me to other doctors that I can not afford even after I express to him that I do not have the finances to go to others. 
0.480000	Pharmaceutical companies have alot of doctors and hospitals by the boot straps so if its not something that is paying their bills they are least likely to admit it. Example going hollistically versus a medication to help a small yet consistent pain is not going to come out their mouth much less approve you doing so already yourself
0.720000	I trust my current PCP very much! I had very negative experience with a previous PCP who didn't want to take on my complicated medical history, but I am currently very lucky.
0.720000	I do trust Docs but they also are human and can be moody, high strung and sometimes jackasses
0.800000	About 12 years ago I had major heart surgery due to life threatening conditions.  I have had chronic conditions since, and my care requires ongoing monitoring and treatment.  My doctor saved my life then, and my care has continued to be thorough and effective.  I have never been dissatisfied in the least with any outcomes from my doctor or provider.
0.960000	My doctor is very thorough and takes the time to meticulously ask questions and make sure she has all the facts before treating me.  She is never in a rush, and is always honest and up front with me regarding conditions and medications.
0.760000	I do trust my Doctor,he is always making sure to check on everything like Blood Work and xrays or ultrasounds to get to the answer that we are seeking
0.640000	I think it depends on the type of doctor, but on the whole, I trust doctors to prescribe medications and diagnose, but I also trust my own feelings about my body and what I need. So I usually pit the two against each other. 
0.640000	I don't know how you feel better soon to be the best for you and your mom is the best ot your life for the rest is just the way I can see the point in time for me today 
0.600000	My physician is trustworthy but I do feel she can be pre occupied with what makes her life easier at times
1.000000	My doctor knows me and my medical problems if I try a medication and it don't work we'll try something different
0.800000	I've been with my doctor since I was born. I feel like she can tell what is wrong with me as soon as I walk into her office. 
0.520000	They are pressured by time to see the next patient. They have limitations from keeping up with every change in science and medicines. 
0.480000	I feel like I can't trust my primary care physicians completely because sometimes I feel like they do what is more convenient for them and don't put my needs as a patient first which is what I believe should happen, they don't tell all the side effects to a medication and some may not even know all the side effects. It's best in my opinion to go out and do my own research before trying anything just because I feel like most doctors really at the end of the day care about making money more than their patients health
0.520000	The reason I cant trust my primary physician on a regular day to day daily basis is because to me it seems a lot of them are simply in it for the check. I also feel like my primary physician looks at everything from a book perspective, and the truth is no matter what schooling no book can tell you everything about real life, especially when dealing with a real life person. I feel a lot of providers just see us as a number or a insurance claim, they aren't understanding enough to realize that some things are just life not everything can be explained via a book. 
0.840000	They know me pretty well and have my best interest at heart however they are busy so if I really need something I will remind them
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he has been honest and upfront with me about my conditions and has always treated e with respect. 
0.560000	My doctor doesn't care too much about me he just tells me a few things and hands me a perscription to go to the pharmacy to get pills
0.720000	"I do not have ""complete trust"" in any human being as any person can make a mistake. I tend to trust my Physician because based upon experience this person has proven to be trustworthy and knowledgeable. Ultimately my health decisions are mine to make guided by the professional knowledge of a trusted Physician."
0.800000	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him. He is looking out for my best interests. He takes his time to listen to me. He is never rushed - or at least doesn't show it. He is friendly and helpful and I trust him.
0.760000	My Dr. is caring and compassionate. He will try to help people to the best of his ability. He takes time to listen and talk to his patients even when really busy.
1.000000	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. I have always had a good experience with them. They are thoughtful and clear and always make sure I have my questions answered.
0.240000	I have been misdiagnosed so many times by doctors that I do not trust them to be able to help me in any capacity. They seem to have their own motives in mind and do not care about the actual problem I'm experiencing or finding a solution. I feel like the reason they are in their profession is solely to make as much money as they can.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he is always aware of my health and indicates the appropriate treatment for improvement. I always do what the doctor tells me. If at any moment that I need it, do not attend to me I look for another doctor with similar aptitude of my personal doctor.
0.560000	I feel we should trust our physician to do the job right or else we will be worried all the time trying to figure out if our physician is trying to kill us
0.560000	I trust most of the things a doctor tells me. But they are human and can make mistakes.If it is serious,getting a second opinion is a good idea.
0.720000	They have years of school and  experence  
0.720000	She is competent and very thorough, but I feel she relies on prescription drugs too heavily as a course of treatment. I would like to know about altertive treatments and therapies.
0.840000	I personally trust my primary care physican because He always shows a lot of knowledge about any topic that is brought up and he always have the right answers to the questons
0.680000	I trust him enough to provide me with the information I need to make a decision - as to agreeing with what he thinks is best for me, I am neutral.  I make my own decision after speaking with those that are close to me.
0.560000	I believe my doctor is competent and concerned. He is  nearing retirement himself and is pretty conventiol in his thinking. Old school is his approach and he doesn't stretch his thinking to consider newer treatment options. I think there is some value in looking at treatments like acupuncture, pain magement techniques beyond meds and holistic treatments. He pooh-poohs such ideas and finds fault with altertive practitioners. So I believe he has my best interest at heart but I think he stopped expanding his views on what options might be.
0.760000	My doctor is very thorough and I am pretty confident in her abilities as a doctor. I have gone to her for many different ailments I have had and she has always prescribed or ordered the right tests for me.
0.880000	"I don't ""completely"" trust anyone, but do I believe my doc is being honest and upfront with me?   Yes.    Not that I wouldn't get a second opinion if I had a serious illness, that's a common sense thing.  "
0.600000	Seeing so many people, it is hard to have a relationship with a doctor that would be anything more than a routine visit.
0.600000	I'm a skeptic by nature, and I know that human beings are prone to making mistakes. However, I trust that my primary physician's medical knowledge is much better than my own, so I respect his judgement and analysis. As with anything, I like evidence and data-based reasons to believe and trust things. As long as he can provide that to me, I'm likely to trust more. Otherwise, I remain skeptical by nature. Even so, I am likely to take his advice even if I disagree with it, if it may end up benefiting me, and the risk is low. If it's a matter of life and death and I don't like his judgement, I may try to find a second or third opinion.
0.920000	I have been with her for 20 plus years and our relationship has grown to the point that I know she will not bs me on any issue
0.880000	Shows concern, listens and works hand in hand for the best results and outcome for healthcare monitoring and fit,there whenever needed services offered and advice when required
1.000000	My doctor knows that I will seek outside information about any conditions that he may be treating to make sure that I am informed. Therefore, he is thorough in his explanations and makes sure that I have the pros and cons before I make a decision.
0.440000	I somewhat distrust doctors in general to take the time to explain all treatment options because they are in such a hurry and want to get to the next patient to make more money. I don't think they want to waste time to followup when patients need additional explanation, help, or guidance with their situation.
0.640000	As explained before, my doctor doesn't always have the time or the commitment to explain every single little detail. Perhaps they feel it's unnecessary, and that I should trust their judgment. This is somewhat worrisome for me, as I do not know what potential issues might be going on even if the doctor does. This isn't really to degrade the work that they do, and how they treat me, since I don't believe it is done on purpose. Nevertheless, it reduces my confidence in my treatment, or any medication provided. 
0.840000	She has always listened to what problems I am having.  She runs the tests necessary to diagnose my medical conditions and my general health.  She changes medications when needed to better treat my issues.  She seems to genuinely care about my health and well being.
0.800000	I trust my doctors.  When I don't I find a new one.  My current PCP is friendly, honest and gives me a feeling that she cares about my well being.
0.800000	I trust the doctor I have now because he listens to me and is willing to do a large number of tests if necessary to find out what is going on. He doesn't regard my symptoms as something unimportant. If he can't figure out what's going on he refers me to a specialist in that area. In the past my doctors would act as though they didn't need to listen to me because they already knew what was happening. They wouldn't order tests, so it took me much longer to be properly diagnosed. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician to do what is best for me when he knows my situation .  Ask the right  questions and be concerned about what is going on 
0.560000	Sometimes I feel my appointments with my primary care doctor are rushed. There have also been times when my doctor wasn't very informative on treatment options when I have been sick. Because of this I feel I have to do a lot of independent research when I am sick or am given a diagnosis. 
0.840000	My doctor goes out of her way to get answers for me. When my diagnosis is unsure she does research. I have had a ver positive experience so far. 
0.560000	I have only seen my physician twice.  I do not know him that well. I believe that he is capable, and that he really does want to keep me healthy as can be.  At the same time I think he is also out to make money, which may mean unnecessary tests.  I have to see him more to find out if I really trust him before I am willing to say that I do.
0.680000	Having worked in the medical field for many years I can conclude that sometimes doctors push a certain treatment that may not be the best possible choice for the patient. I understand doctors work directly with pharmaceutical companies whose interest is making money.  
0.680000	I feel they do the best they can.  There is always a standard to what you need to do when looking to speak with a doctor. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor. Sometimes she tells me things that I do not want to hear. But I know that she is only looking out for my best interests.
0.760000	My primary care physician as taken care of my family for years my mother and her mother both see the same primary physician 
0.560000	I do trust my physician with my medical treatment. I do feel as if he rushes me through my appointments and doesn't necessarily treat my issues with the severity I feel they may be. I have found that any issues with mental health are taken more seriously though.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she has been my PCP/GYN for a long time and haZs NEVER steered me wrong with any diagnosis or medications.
0.440000	It's not that I think my primary care physician is particularly untrustworthy. I just think people in general can at times be lazy, malicious, or in some way disincentivezed to help you. And it's not always easy to tell when that's the case. So I take what my doctor tells me as being probably true but potentially not the whole story, as I do with most people. For instance, I happen to know that doctors are under a lot of pressure right now to not prescribe opioids, so if my doctor tells me the best route for me is lots of ibuprofen, I'm going to be skeptical. But what other thinks am I not aware of, that might be relevant to my health? It's just best to get second opinions and take things with a grain of salt. 
0.720000	I have been seeing him for a couple years and he has helped me. When I didn't know what was wrong he did and he also helped point me to someone else who tried to help me.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a professional and specialize in patient care. He is always truthful and provide the best options possible for his patients
0.400000	I generally feel mistrustful because I don't think doctors really care that much about people, since they see so many patients and have so little time to spend with each of them. I also don't trust that they know what is best for me half the time, since I know my situation and body better than I can communicate with them or they have time to learn about. I also feel suspicious that they are being paid off, for example, by drug companies to push for certain medications , regardless of the patient. 
0.520000	I distrust physician because I am completely dependent on them to do the right thing or properly inform my about available or possible options
0.800000	I have not had a reason not to  trust him, everything he has recommended thus far has been accurate with no reason to question his decisions.  
0.760000	When a doctor shows interest in what I have to say and gives advices relevant to my needs, it helps build trust.
1.000000	I have certain things in common with my primary care physician. He routinely vacations in an area I am familiar with. My doctor speaks English, and there are no cultural barriers between us. He has a good sense of humor and is, generally speaking, a very nice man. I like him as a person, and I trust his judgment. 
0.440000	too rushed, not enough time for appointment because they are running behind all day. too many patients.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because whenever I have questions that need to be answered he is always willing to answer them honestly and right away and he always gives me all the info I need when I go to him.
0.480000	I don't have one primary care doctor, and the doctors at the Army hospital are more interested in keeping the patient flow moving than they are in effectively treating their patients, whom they will most likely never see again.
0.400000	I have seen many relatives have horrible doctors who could really care less about their well being. It was like the only good they were was for the diagnosis. I have had a few like that as well. 
0.560000	In the end I feel neutral towards doctors. I know there are some that are good but I have had mixed experiences with them. Whether it be misdiagnosis, bad bedside manner, over charging, etc. So it is hard to feel anything but neutral towards them. But you have to have enough blind faith in them to get the job done because that is what they are educated in. 
0.920000	My doctor gives me all the correct information. The right diagnosis if needed. The correct medicine. I can ask questions and get the correct information. My doctor can be trusted she is a 5 star rating. My doctor is very good at giving information when needed. My doctor is reliable and friendly. 
0.480000	I believe doctors are mostly concerned with selling drugs to patients. Their main concern is treating symptoms, not the actual disease. Sometimes they spend just a few minutes with each patient, people get more attention at the mechanic .
0.640000	We have established mutual respect as a patient/ physician where we can discuss any issues in regards to my health. 
0.680000	I've had a few doctors and most i feel cared about me, but sometimes i did feel like they weren't putting their full thoughts into correct treatments.  Sometimes they'll let a problem sit and see if it fixes itself, or sometimes they'll try to do whatever would be easier for them if it does require prescribing something.
0.640000	I trust my primary physician because he is honest with me and tries to help me as much as he can. I also get to freely engage him when i have a problem
0.520000	Sometimes doctors don't have the patients best interest in mind.
0.840000	I trust my doctor but have also disagreed with them over things that I knew were the current recommendations. So we had a discussion and he looked up the new information I gave him and thanked me for making him aware of it. Doctors are incredibly smart but things are constantly changing so I feel it is important to listen to them but, also advocate for yourself.
0.640000	I do not have a primary care physician as I rarely need a doctor and if I do, it is for something specialized (kidneys). In general cases, I trust doctors and believe they give me credible, appropriate information but I'm not willing to completely believe everything.
0.800000	i figure he knows what he is doing, what meds to prescribe based on the reason for visit/illness,etc.
0.480000	I don't completely trust physician but there is a number of practices that prescribe medications just to mask the pain and not actually fix the issue so it becomes an ongoing cycle of doctor visits and money being spent.
0.400000	I have been hospitalized recently and no one was telling me anything except I had to stay in the hospital.  I had four specialist and none could tell me why.
0.760000	because they always show me how much they care about me.They answer any questions I have and calm me.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I've had her since I was a child and there was never a time where she harmed me. She may have been a bit dismissive sometimes but she always makes sure to express all available options for whenever I see her. 
0.440000	When my doctor is not rushed and has time he always answers my questions and does not rush me.  When he is very busy I feel as though he ignores me and does not take what I say into consideration.  I trust him when he explains his decisions to me but I do not trust rushed and unexplained decisions.  
0.720000	I trust my physician because he has gotten me to a better state of health, so that I will live a longer healthier life. I have leds impacting meds to take. 
0.720000	"I never have total trust in anyone. I do ""mostly"" trust my primary care physician. He's a good man. I like him and he hasn't failed me. But that doesn't mean I don't look online to learn more about the things he tells me to do. I think that's a good thing to do and I don't consider it to be distrusting."
0.920000	They have always been helpful and informative. I've never had a problem  talking with them. They are respectful and I feel I can talk honestly to them.
0.760000	My doctor spends the needed amount of time with me, responds to my emails and asks appropriate questions.  My doctor is aware of needed procedures and tests that may be needed.  She listens and is not anxious about her time.

0.880000	I trust the physicans i currently have because i have had positive experiences through the many years that i've been a loyal patient. And when issues arise they are always handled quickly and efficiently. 
0.800000	I TRUST MY DOCTOR BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEY HAVE MORE ACKNOWLEDGES AND MORE EXPERIENCES. I THINK THEY WILL DO THEIR BEST TO HELP ME GET BETTER HEALTH.
0.640000	"I have been with the same primary care doctor for over 10 years now. For me persolly, I have never had a misdiagnosis or a recommendation that required further visits (I don't feel that my doctor is out to cheat people out of their money). However, I do agree that sometimes he might ""wing it"" during my physical checkups. However, I do put trust in him because I know that if there as really something serious, he would let me know. "
0.760000	I have been going to him for the past seven years and I trust him completely with my health because If I don't trust him by now I have a serious problem
0.480000	I do not have a primary care doctor. I rarely see a doctor. In my experience doctors always have bad news so I really don't have much trust in them. When my husband was sick there were a few doctors that were honest and thoughtful but the majority of them seemed disinterested and made the wrong decisions because they did not take the time to get updated on his condition.
0.720000	I am personal friends with most of my doctors and therefore I have a high level of confidence in the care provided. 
0.960000	As I do not have a primary care physician that I am aware of, I'll have to answer in regards to doctors in general. I have complete trust in doctors, because they simply know more than I do. I won't challenge or question their information as this is their profession and not mine. 
0.880000	I have done a lot of research and tried several different doctors in the the surrounding cities until I landed with one who I trust greatly. 
0.640000	I believe most drs are about a paycheck and just want to medicate you so the pharmaceuticals can get a check
0.960000	My doctor is genuine and very caring.  She knows me and what my needs are.  She goes above the call of duty and asks me to call her if anything comes up or I have any questions.  She is a great listener and allows me to make suggestions.  She also takes the time to explain things and doesn't treat me a just another patient.  She asks the right questions and gives great advice.  
0.800000	I guess if I had to think about it, I would have a hard time coming up with a reason not to trust my primary care physician. I have been seeing him since I stopped seeing my pediatric doctor when I was a teen. He has never led me wrong or given me trouble about my prescriptions when I needed to get them filled. I also see a psychiatrist for anxiety and he provides me with the medicine needed to treat my panic disorder. I have been seeing him for over a decade and by now I only need to see him for a quick appointment once every three months because he knows me so well.
1.000000	I have been with hi around 15yrs. He listens to everything I say and tries his best for me not to hurt.
0.800000	I trust my physician because as they are telling me thing, they confirm what they say by showing me test sheets or diagrams. They have also helped me in the past and not given me a reason to distrust them.
0.600000	Sometimes the wrong information can be misleading and you want to be educated on how you can get better at things
0.520000	I think that it would depend on what they need in their life. That will affect what they tell me.
1.000000	My doctor has years of specialized training and is up to date on all the latest medicine and their side effects.  I feel free to tell my doctor that I would prefer another option, if available.
0.480000	Doctors are human, Some are qualified/competent, some are incompetent. Some put patient care over money, some put money over care, etc. I wouldn't blindly trust anyone for anything without doing some reasearch on my own, getting a second opinion if necessary, and considering the facts myself. 
1.000000	He is nice and kind. He tell u the truth. If it bad or good. He find outhe what is the problem before he give up.
0.800000	I have a medical issue and instead of running more tests and sending me to more specialists, my doctor said some things just can't be treated and you have to manage. Thus saving me time, money, and unnecessary tests
0.560000	I generally think he is honest and trying hard but I don't think he is a very good communicator and sometimes it feels like he is hard to read. I don't always know how urgent or serious something is.
0.840000	I trust my Doctor because she is a very knowledgeable and she tells me what to do with my body to stay healthy.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he has proven trustworthy.  He listens to what I have to say and develops treatment plans based on what he believes the issue is.  He treats the problem and not the symptoms.
0.680000	Something I trust doctors something I don't, it depends on how friendly and caring the doctor is. A doctor must understand or try to understand their patients
0.920000	She has far more education on it than I do ,and she hasn't given me any reason not to trust her.She has has never led me wrong.
0.440000	i suspect that doctors in general are influenced by financial interests when recommending treatment options and prescribing medication. i also suspect that many doctors make assumptions without thorough examination sometimes because of heavy workloads or personal bias.
0.400000	I was feeling a lot of pain and other symptoms. I went to my primary doctor and she accused me of exaggerating. She also said that she is not some clinic to get pain pills from because she said I always complain about body pains and it is unlikely someone under 30 can be in so much pain. She still took my blood for sampling and as usual, it showed I had a high white blood cell count. She said I haven't been eating right and she gave me antibiotics. I went for a second opinion and was diagnosed with 2 autoimmune diseases that apparently would have been easy to spot if the other doctor listened closely to everything I kept telling her every time I went in so she could have gotten the proper tests.
0.920000	My doctor is completely honest with me no matter what as I allow him to be.  If Iâm over weight heâll tell me, if I have high blood pressure he will tell.  He tells me all these things looking me straight in they eyes and letâs me know all the bad things that can possibly happen if I donât do better. Death, stroke, being paralyzed.  This is why I trust my doctor 
0.560000	I don't have a primary care physician, but I've seen several doctors during the last year.  Two of them prescribed treatment which I agreed to.  One doctor did not tell until after the treatment that I would need to have surgery to have the problem corrected completely.  I would say most doctors can be trusted, but some cannot.
0.720000	He or she listens and has a nurse listen and gives opinions and what type of meds are best and makes suggestions that are wise and schedules new appointments and calls in prescriptions and is concerned and gives advice and pamphlets and samples that help and is helpful
0.640000	I worked at a hospital for along while doctors worry more about getting as many patients seen and worry less a out providing good healthcare this has gotten worse. Since Obama care started
0.480000	"In past experiences, visits to my primary physician have resulted in absolutely nothing. ""Take this medication"" is pretty much the only advice I receive. "
0.720000	I have seen my doctor on several occasions. She has always shown concern for my well being and given good medical advice. I trust her advice.
0.760000	My primary care physician has seen me a few times and has always thoroughly explained information about my health with me.  These discussions are backed up by data, and the correlations between what I am being told by my physician and the data I am being shown align.
0.800000	I have had no negative or bad experiences with the care I have received from my primary physician.  I do not seek medical attention very often. I sometimes research on the internet conditions and  symptoms about diagnoses 
0.800000	Because my doctor is like me and she has been practicing for a while.  She always tell me what I can do to get better and she has my best interest when it comes to my health. She asks me questions and allow me to ask her questions.
0.760000	I trust my DR because she takes time to listen to me. She seems to really care. I've been going to her for quite a while now. My previous dr. recommended her to me and I trust him completely
0.600000	I don't completely trust Western medicine and only seek it out when it is absolutely necessary.  I don't always trust the doctor's information especially when they just want to prescribe a pill to mask symptoms and not really deal with the core of the problem.  I take everything my doctors say with a grain of salt.
0.760000	I've been with my doctor for many years now and have had no issues with her. She is very nice and I do trust her very much. That said on a big medical decision I may get a second opinion.
0.600000	I've had a reoccurring issue, and I feel like im not being taken seriously. Nothings been diagnosed. Ive been given no assistance, or alternatives
0.560000	I trust my primary care physician because it is their job and they are supposed to be knowledgeable on the subject. They have tons of training and education and should be prepared. 
0.400000	Doctor never listens to concerns and basically acts superior does not explain anything and rarely rechecks if I still have the symptoms
0.560000	I trust doctors who take the time to get to know me and my situation, but all too often doctores don't take the time to see you as a person and do not custom,ize their advice to fit your particular circumstance.
0.960000	I have none my doctor for more than 10 years. He has treated me since I was a teenager. He has always putting my needs first. There has never been a time when I've questioned his decision.
0.960000	I have been his patient for several years.  My entire family is a patient AND there have been instances where i have requested weight loss drugs and he has refused to prescribe to me as they had adverse effects.  I trust him and his judgement completely and really do believe that for him, patients come first.
1.000000	I trust her because when I feel something is wrong she always advise me to get it checkes out. I really have a good rapport with my doctor.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for years . He is always correct and helps with any problems I may have .
0.520000	I don't have a primary care doctor. Why not? Because I basically don't trust them, they did no good for my mom, told her it was all in her head. She had MS
0.800000	My primary care physician cannot and does not treat all of my health issues, but I trust him to refer me to specialists who can help me.
0.920000	never completely trust anyone. once you do that you open yourself up to hurt. to believe someone you trust has betrayed you is like getting punched
0.560000	They are human just like the rest of us. My doctor has his own best interests at heart when it comes right down to it. I'm sure that he tries his best to help me, but if my needs conflicted with his I'm sure he would take care of himself first. Nothing against him in particular; I just feel that is how everyone would act. 
0.640000	Overall i trust that doctors have my best interest but sometimes i don't think they take what i'm saying seriously and that could because they see so many patients that they don't have time to really hone into the problem
0.960000	Well he is a doctor who was trained in those sorts of things. So it's in my nature to trust someone who knows what they are doing. 
0.440000	If I am doing well the doctor finds some other medication that has the opposite effect on me.He doesn't explain what it is for and why.It didn't bode me well,it made things worse.
0.680000	I trust doctors because they have a lot of medical knowledge. Their assessments and recommendations usually work for me. I've never had a serious problem with a doctor that would make me lose faith in them.
0.720000	I have a good doctor, it's his sense of humor. He is like a comedy central roast comedian, it fun but it make think more about my health

0.800000	My physician seems like they are well educated and seem to communicate well with other people. Their ability to portray information to me is critical in deserving my trust, and I have had no problems at all regarding this. I feel that most doctors are so well educated that they have a good idea what is going on and how to treat it, and they can get more information readily if necessary, so overall I trust them due to their education and ability to communicate.
0.440000	I don't really trust my doctor very much because i feel that sometimes they are too caught up in all the drug company's ideas that certain medicines work for thing they don't or are trying to perscribe medicines due to kick backs from companys
0.800000	I TRUST MY DOCTOR VERY MUCH - I KNOW THAT THE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE PRESCRIBED FOR ME HELP ME.  I KNOW THAT MY DOCTOR TAKES THE TIME TO GO OVER MY HEALTH ISSUES AND PROBLEMS.
0.840000	she is very through and knows exactly what my needs are and recommends specialist that I need to see for any problems she knows I need. she follow ups with my blood work to see if my meds needs to change. she ask me if i'm having any problems since my last visit and what is going on with my current health issues.
0.600000	I trust her because she is the one who is looking over my health. I myself have to as well, but she knows the ins and outs of hte human body and what is good and not good.
0.760000	I have been seeing my PCP for almost 8 years, so we have developed a pretty good relationship, and I do trust her. I trust her so much that my children also see her. There are some areas that I feel she isn't expert on, but that is why she refers us to specialists.
0.480000	I typically trust my doctor but there are times that the prescribed treatment seems inadequate. It's good to find a doctor that you like and trust. It takes a while but a doctor that is willing to put time in with you could be a lifesaver.
0.800000	He has always been honest with me and tried to help me or sent me to someone who could help. He asks if I have questions and answers them.

0.480000	I think they sometimes can make mistakes as any person and it's not good to rely on just one person.
0.320000	I can never get a straight answer out of him. Every time that i go to the doctor feeling bad he tells me i have a virus or just tells me that he isnt sure what i have, but he will still prescribe steroids or antibiotics. Sometimes i worry that i may have a serious problem that wont get fixed because he doesnt put the proper care into figuring out what is wrong with me.
1.000000	i've been going to my doctor for years and he knows me very well. he gives all options. if i want to do something like try a new medication he'll give me all the pros and cons and also give me other(better) options. he's never dimissive
0.920000	They have the knowledge and understand the best course of treatment for whatever is medically wrong with me.
0.560000	I recognize that doctors have bad days or hold onto rigid views.  At the same time, I admire their minds and dedication. I trust my own views more than a doctor's about some things, e.g., nutrition.  But when it comes to serious illness, I would listen to their recommendations and take them under advisement.
0.680000	First of all my doctor now I worked it worked with her at another facility Abely should be honest with me and telling me the truth regarding what the results are I feel that I can trust her whole heart

0.400000	I feel as though doctors sometimes see too many people to really be able to focus on one person care. Also they can't know everything about each individual.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. He has never done anything to make me think he should not be trusted or that he is not honest. He has always been candid about my health concerns, and explains everything. He happily answers questions I might have and has even given me his email to contact him if I have any further questions.
0.560000	He's a nice guy, but I don't think he weighs all the options. I have been diagnosed wrong a few times, so I have less confidence in him now.
1.000000	My physician is young like I am, so I can relate to her. She is very good at remembering things that I am interested in so she can make an honest connection with me. So when I get some bad news about a medical condition, she is very thorough about making sure I understand what options I have and that I can talk to her if I need to.

0.400000	they don't really know much more than i do and they treat us all like commodities if they see one condition in one person and the same condition in another person they treat it like the same thing but it is not they are just humans.
0.720000	I recently moved and do not have a primary care physician. I think doctors in general have the patient's best interest in mind. I have enjoyed working with most of my doctors, but I have occasionally felt rushed during appointments. Therefore, there has been occasional distrust.
0.960000	I love my primary care physician. She always give me the best options regarding me Health and if not she always have more options. 
0.280000	I have a medical condition that has been ongoing for years. The last time I went to visit the doctor, I asked her about what procedures I should do for that issue. She said to me that she hadn't seen that in my chart, went and checked, and seemed surprised that I had that condition. I have been seeing her the whole time. Then when she gave me instructions about procedures and what I should do next, she also gave me the last set of test results from the past year, and there was some disturbing results that should have been followed up on at the time. Needless to say, we followed up on them then but it could have been catastrophic for me if the results turned negative, which thankfully they didn't.
0.600000	Don't currently have a physician, but have usually trusted them when I have. They've taken the time to answer any questions, and make me feel comfortable
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he helps me with all my questions. He seems  trustworthy and i am sure there isnt any untrustworthy physicians, they are all meant to be trustwrthy.
0.800000	My doctor is very willing to spend extra time with me discussing things that I am unclear on or need extra help with. I am able to ask about alternative treatments or additional ideas on how to get better when I am sick or injured. He listens without judgement and shows that he cares.
0.760000	Sometimes they really dont care about your feelings. They say whatever not caring about how someone feel. Yes obesity is a big problem in America today but telling someone that they need to put the fork down and exercise is wrong.
0.800000	I trust my physician. He encourages questions and respects my preference for natural alternatives to prescribed services.
0.480000	Sometimes I trust her judgment other times,I do not. When it come to basic healthcare needs and minor ailments, I trust her. But major issues ,I do not. She is too quick to offer medicines, when I don't think it's a good idea. For example, she encouraged me to take pain medicine after a minor surgery and I refused.
0.600000	I think doctors tend to rush and don't really go in depth to things to give you all the options. Typically they just give me whatever the most popular treatment is without listing options
0.600000	I trust my healthcare physician because I know them and I know they have gone through the correct training 
0.520000	Do not think they give you a lot to pick from as they get a kick back for the drugs the prescribe. Would get at least 3 different opinions before I would make a decision.
0.720000	i trust my doctor because she takes time to give me as much information and advice as possible and does not shy away from my questions. Most importantly i find that doing want she advice's me actually helps and improves my health and happiness. She is also very kind and friendly.

0.760000	I usually trust my primary care physician because I know he cares about my health. He usually takes the time to explain things thoroughly if he feels like I don't understand them.
0.560000	They don't really go over every possible option that could be wrong. They don't consider everything and are not thorough 
0.440000	Often feel rushed or forgotten by my doctor's office. It's packed and I have a hard time getting anyone on the phone or talking to busy staff while I'm there. I ferl like one in hundreds of patients they see in a week. I wait for literal hours for my appointments and spend maybe 30 minutes being seen.
0.760000	I generally trust my doctor because he quite thorough in everything he does.  At the end of the day, he is the one who is professionally trained and sees various ailments daily.
0.760000	I have seen my doctor for many years and I feel I can trust her with making the right decisions for me.   I sometimes second question what is said.
0.880000	My doctor is a great doctor, but she has so many patients (1800) that it is just hard to trust her 100%. She is a doctor at a VA hospital and they are always so busy that they may sometimes overlook or not notice something. 
0.760000	I have trust in them for the most part. However, I also know my body and don't just simply take them at their word when they say everything is normal or ok
0.400000	Based on anecdotes and past experiences, doctors cannot be trusted many times. Sadly, there are a lot of doctors who will play with your lives for the money. That is not to say all doctors are like that, but you have to be careful.
0.920000	I have recently acquired a new physician.  He is young and on the cutting edge.  He cares and is very attentive.
0.760000	She has been open about what I have and how to treat them.  She seems to listen me sincerely and in a warm, attentive manner.  It doesn't look like she's going through the motions of pretending to listen and care about me, not brushing me off if I have concerns or questions, and she is accommodating towards me.  She also provides articles that she has her nurse print out for me to take home and study about treatments and conditions.
0.600000	I trust my doctor to s point but when I'm recommended medicines that I know I don't need I feel as if I can't trust him.

0.840000	It depends on the individual doctor. I have met some that are terrible, but most are as I rated them above.
0.680000	I generally don't trust people, but my primary care doctor seems pretty trustworthy. She tells it straight up and that's important to me.
1.000000	I have total trust in my primary care physician because he did extensive test during my first visit and was able to make diagnosis that other Doctors had not been able to make. They did not do any of the test that the Doctor I have now performed. That is why I have full confidence in the Doctor that I have now. 
1.000000	I have had my primary doctor for 26 years and he always does what is in my best interest. He always explains why he is giving me the prescription,
0.560000	"I believe that doctors in general are not always up front with patients concerning medical conditions. Too often doctors try to "" sugar coat"" the facts, when in reality, most would rather NOT be given false information and false hope"
0.640000	Overall, I trust my primary physician but I don't think they always want to commit to a detailed answer.
0.880000	I have used the same PCP for many years. He cares about his patients and researches each out of the ordinary problem and comes up with the best answer.
0.720000	Doctors are people too, typically I believe they are trustworthy and what they say is knowledgeable but they can still have areas where they do not know much about, like nutrition. Also, doctors are heavily lobbied by pharmacy reps to peddle their product.
0.560000	He seems nice enough, and he tends to explain things adequately, but I never feel very comfortable with him. I've been in a few times with issues that he's diagnosed was stress or anxiety related muscle tension so I worry that he might think I'm a bit of a hypochondriac.
0.840000	My PA is extremely intelligent.  He listens to me, and he gives me credit for knowing something is wrong with my body.  He involves me in treatment planning.
0.560000	There have been times when my Dr. has overlooked things, but there have also been times when my Dr. has been very thorough. 
0.440000	"I often feel like doctors care more about their time and money that the patient. It can be difficult to talk in depth about medical problems because my doctor is looking for a ""quick fix"" rather than a long term solution."
0.600000	I might trust them if they seem professional enough. But might not if they wind up  telling me or doing something to me that might not help me.
1.000000	He lets me be a part of the plan of treatment and always asks what I think aand if I agree or disagree. He always takes the time to listen and is very willing to see me whenever i need him too. He explains everything to me in a way that I understand and is very patient, kind and gentle. is office always calls to see how I am doing.
0.920000	My doctor has been a good doctor and I believe he does his job well.
0.480000	Doctors seem to often be in a hurry to move on to the next patient. I feel like they don't ask me enough questions. I feel like they don't take the time to fully and accurately diagnose me.
0.960000	I believe that doctors have my best interest in mind when treating me.
0.400000	My primary care doctor usually seems rushed and annoyed. I can tell she wants to do her job but perhaps doesn't like the scheduling or the company that mages her. Overall I don't really trust her to make educated decisions for me, and had to beg for a cholesterol test. It had been six years, at least, since my prior one. 
0.440000	Doctors are human just like I am.  Some are good, some are bad.  It is up to me to question what I'm told and help find solutions.  If they won't work with me I'll find someone else.
1.000000	been with my doctor for 5 years and he's great at what he does always answers my questions and my commonlaw wife has him also a a primary physician
1.000000	I have know my doctor for a long time. I trust what he does. He looks after my best intrests and takes care of me. 
0.680000	My doctor has a certain style which inspires confidence.  I think this comes mostly from his actions resulting from many years of experience.  There's never a sense that he's following a mechanical flow chart, or reading from a textbook. 
0.720000	I have been working with him for over 10 years so I feel like he knows me extremely well.  He understands the health conditions I have and how the impact me.
0.600000	I am neutral on how I feel about trusting my Doctor. I will listen and use my common sense or go with my gut feeling and/or research more on my own.
0.480000	Because a lot if these doctors have began to work more for the pharmaceutical companies than their own patients 
0.840000	My primary doctor is good at her job and seems to be open and honest about what I need and what is best for me.

0.880000	I trust her as she does not insist on any medication that we do not feel that we need.  We are not much on taking medication that we feel has adverse side effects.  Thankfully we do not need a lot of medication.
0.880000	I completely trust my doctor to give me correct, accurate and complete information and not mislead me.  But I don't fully trust that my doctor knows which medical treatments are best for me.  I take the information they give me and I do my own research and I make my own decisions taking into consideration what my doctor has told me.  I am neutral that my doctor knows what's best for me.  
0.640000	He seems to know what he is talking about most of the time, but he doesn't explain things in detail that I can understand. I have trouble keeping up at times so sometimes I don't think he wants to see me anymore. I trust that he knows what he is talking about, but it all just flies over my head. 
0.920000	My doctor explains everything to me and then presents options for me to choose from. This creates a relationship where I trust her. She is providing me with the opportunity to be involved in my healthcare decisions instead of being extremely paterlistic and telling me what I should and should not be doing.
0.640000	Sometimes physicians give unnecessary treatment and sometimes they are on point with treatment with my personal experience I always recommend a second opinion 
0.600000	I trust my doctor because he so far has given me the best care.Plus I have been with the same doctor for years
0.960000	I have know my primary care physician for a long time and have the utmost trust in him in treating all my health issues. 
0.560000	I find that doctor rely most on what they are taught in medical school, which are mostly funded, staffed and run by pharmaceutical companies.  They tend to ignore holistic approaches that are not approved by the FDA and yet numerous studies have proven they work. 
0.400000	I distrust my doctor because of medical advice that he gave me, that turned out to be completely false. This makes me have little trust in doctors in general.
0.960000	I guess when a primary care physician attempts to connect with me even though I know it is standard, it makes me feel like I can trust them. 
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because he has the medical knowledge to guide me regarding my needs in health care.

0.800000	My doctor has given me no reason not to trust them. They have provided me with the means to help whatever medical issues I have and have even gave me their contact info if it is after hours and I have an immediate need.
0.760000	I do trust him, but he is a GP and usually sends me to other people to really do a good physical.  Many things he has me do have all come out clear, yet I have spent a great deal of money doing all of his tests.
0.960000	I feel that I can completely trust my doctor.  SHe listens to me when I talk and she helps me to feel at ease.  I believe that she has my best interest in mind.  SHe genuinely cares about me.

0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because they have never gave me any false information about my medical issues and health information 
0.720000	I'm still alive!  He must be doing something right.
0.720000	She is thorough and informative, and won't give you unnecessary drugs. She actually tries to get to the root cause of ailments instead of treating the symptoms 
0.600000	I have no issues with my current primary care physician. However, in the past, I had a PCP that was not very attentive during my yearly physical examinations. This resulted in my performance anxiety condition to go undiagnosed throughout my childhood until finding a new PCP later in life. 
0.600000	they do not want to see you back again in a few weeks so they are inclined to give you better treatment. 
0.640000	He is very true and I never had a misunderstanding and understand my needs and wants.Always diagnosis me right
0.840000	my primary care doctor is always willing to explain any doubts or questions that I have. He is thorough but does not needlessly order tests and procedures. He is very knowledgeable and keeps up to date on new info
0.560000	I went to the doctors office back in December well tube same thing came back a few months later. I wanted her to just give me the prescription but she wanted to send my stuff to the lab... I'm stuck with a 380 labcorp bill.
0.480000	My Doctor seems very lackadaisical to me. Going through the motions while trying to act interested in what I am saying.
0.720000	I have learned over the years to trust in doctor's opinions as they have never let me down in a serious way. Sometimes they tend to be hurried and most do not like to do a lot of chit chatting but the advice seems to be very good. They have the experience in these areas so I usually go with whatever they think.
0.640000	WELL THERE MY PRIMARY CAR DOC SO THEY SHOULD KNOW WHATS BEST FOR ME. THEY BEEN A PRIMARY DOC FOR YEARS AN KNOW BETTER THAN I DO
0.560000	I am always wary of medical personnel.  It is hard sometimes to discern the most caring of doctors from the indifferent ones.  
0.520000	I trust a doctor's medical knowledge but not a doctor's character or infallibility. A doctor can make mistakes even if they try their best, they can have beliefs that influence their medical advice, they can be influenced by prejudices or incentives. Doctors are only human. But that doesn't mean I should ignore what they say.
0.760000	I feel like not trusting a doctor is foolish. It takes an incredible amount of dedication, smarts, and experience to become a doctor. I trust experts in most places where it makes sense, unless something seems off about them. I might be less inclined to trust a doctor where I was not as sure of his credentials, like maybe in a third world country. I do not have a primary care physician to think to but I would like to think If i Did, I would place a great deal of trust in them to give me accurate advice. If I did no trust the doctor, I would pretty quickly find a new one.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for several years, and he has always provided me with great care, and I have never had an issues with any of his decisions/ diagnoses. He has a good record of quality and care.
0.600000	I neither trust or distrust my current primary care physician because I currently do not have a primary care physician

0.760000	I generally trust my PCP. I have been seeing him for many years and his advice is generally good. He does, however, sometimes gives me advice on things outside of his specialty. I take that advice with a grain of salt.
0.520000	they are worried about volume of parietns and receiving the money UCR payments because  my doctor is always late to my appointments
0.440000	I have migraines. My former pain management doctor gave me botox injections. I also got occipital nerve blocks for a different headache. My new doctor (moved to a new state) told me nobody is trained to do that. He didn't offer any type of option. He doesn't care. I don't trust him with my care for that reason.
1.000000	I trust my primary physician because I know that they are professional and here to help in the best way they could
0.880000	he has a lot of years experience and has had his own practice for many years,and gives full explanations of medical conditions
0.720000	I really have no distrust at all. At the end of the day it's still a job. They are helping everybody so you can't care for everybody just find a solution to their problem and on to the next one.
0.600000	I'm pretty neutral on this one. I feel that most doctors DO want to help you, but they also want to drag it out as long as possible for profit reasons. The end goal is a cure/help, but it's going to be VERY expensive.
0.960000	My doctor is very sincere and always go to the point.  She was very helpful with a health problem I was having for months, do all the tests and then recommended all the procedures available and what she thinks was the best for me.  It was my decision base on the information she gave me about all the procedures, secondary effects and results.

0.880000	For me, the default is to trust doctors, and my PCP has given me no reason to distrust him. In addition, he has always been sympathetic and responsive to any problems I bring up. He also does some community events. I believe he cares about and values all of his patients, including me.
0.680000	I really trust my doctor. he really understands me like he really caring.i just wish there was more doctors like him.
1.000000	doctors are trained to take care of you they go to school for years to do this most of them are good honest people

0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because so far he hasn't done anything to erode my trust for him. I am wary of my physician when he tells me treatment methods. This is more so because I am a cautious person.
0.800000	I have been going to my doctor for many years and I feel that he is always open and honest about matters that relate to my health.
0.440000	I don't trust my doctor completely because she sort of rushes the appointment.  She doesn't really do whats best for me because she should be testing my thyroid on a regular basis.
0.920000	I trust my PCP because she takes the time to listen to me. She gives me all the options needed for different treatments and health remedies. She asks me before doing things instead of just telling me they are what I need to do
0.560000	Doctors now a days seem pre-occupied and kind just go through the motions of their job.   I am not sure my best interest is their main concern
0.840000	My doctor has shown me that she is thorough and caring. In the few times I have thought that she might be wrong on something - it turns out that she was right! As far as I am concerned, my doctor has a great batting average when it comes to health, so I am with her for the long haul. 
0.640000	Sometimes doctors may diagnose you with something and at times they may be wrong that's why I sometimes distrust doctors
0.800000	He's been a osteopathic physician for many years and takes the time to listen to my concerns and suggest options for treatment.  He's open-minded and not the least bit dismissive.  His judgment is sound and his demeanor is caring. 
0.840000	I see a resident doctor that practices in a family clinic.  My doctor is supervised by experienced physicians.  I trust my doctor because she listens well.  She has supervision regarding her treatment decisions.  In addition, I have net some of her supervisors
0.800000	I feel like the doctor-patient relationship is built entirely on trust and so my basic foundation is totally trusting him. He's never given me any reason to doubt him.
0.960000	My husband and I share the same Doctor and there was a time my husband had an appointment and I did not and I went with him. I had a cold at the time and even though it was not my appointment and I didn't bring it upâ the Doctor noticed and asked me questions. Right then and there he wrote a prescription for me even though I didn't have an appointment for myself. He has always gone above and beyond in the care of my husband as well (who has Type II diabetes) and has always been there for us when we had questions and needs. I would recommend him to anyone.
0.800000	I trust him completely.  He has never given me reason not to trust him.  He takes as much time as needed with me when I visit.
0.640000	She sometimes will not listen to me and its my body. I once had to fix my ear infection because she would not help me. Now she listens to me.
0.560000	I trust that my doctor would provide me with the best care that they thought was possible if there was a real serious concern about my health. I also feel that my doctor does not always listen to every symptom and she is only trying to get through her day. I think my doctor prescribes medication to easily and doesn't always look to see if the benefits out-weight the side effects.
0.520000	I trust one of hen but not the other because the first one Peggy lied and said nothing was wrong with me but there was
0.720000	I trust my doctor because he helped me a lot with my past medical issues. He always explain everything to me.
0.800000	She is quick but thorough, makes sure to explain anything if I need her to, doesnât if I donât, tells me what I should/shouldnât do not what I have to do/not do.
0.320000	Doctors only care about shoving pills and expensive treatments at their patients.  They care about money and not how to fix issues with patients. 
0.800000	I have been going to the same Dr for several years and we know each other very well.  If I disagree with him I will tell him, and he knows it.
0.520000	I have family in the health care business and would trust them whole heartedly. I think that it is important to have trust in your doctors. They go through a lot of training and pledge an oath to provide to their patients as well as they can.
1.000000	I have a strong trust in my provider. She has spent extra time with me when I needed it and followed up after stressful visits to make sure I fon't have more questions and to just check in with me.
0.840000	I feel my doctor has no reason but to tell me the truth.  I feel they want the best for me.

0.480000	My doctor is the same doctor I had as a kid.  He is super Christian and super American.  I haven't been to see him in over 10 years because he always wants to talk to me about Jesus and democracy.
0.640000	I am not currently on pain medication, but if I were I would be extremely wary of having only one doctor's opinion due to the prescription opiate addiction epidemic that is sweeping the United States. 
1.000000	My family doctor has always treated us great including my two year old child with a serious heart disease and if it weren't for them we may have found out about her disease in the worst way possible which would be finding her dead. My doctor gives it to me straight and certainly does not sugarcoat anything which is good considering I am obese.
0.880000	Because I am a retired nurse I am very satisfied with the care and understanding my doctor and I have
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician for a few reasons. For one he is an excellent listener. I often over think or over worry and he puts up with it. He offers a variety of medical options when issues arise and he is always knowledgeable on these options. This makes me trust the he is making informed choices for my health.
0.520000	I don't trust any doctor. Many receive incentives from pharmaceutical companies so they have a vested interest.

0.840000	I trust my doctor in that he has answered all my questions and has been right about everything I have asked, especially in regards to my own research about issues or topics I bring up to him.

0.760000	My doctor takes the time to explain things fully and answer any questions I have. He is receptive to what I think and asks many questions to get a full gauge of what is going on with me every time I see him.
0.920000	Everything she has told me to do so far has works.  She explains everything thing thoroughly and prescribes medication she think might help me to get to wher I need to be.
0.360000	They do not discuss the real reasons for my visits.  They do not listen to my symptoms or how it affects my daily like.  I don't think a 15 min appointment is enough time to asses any condition.
0.800000	The particular doctor I currently have takes her time during visits. She asks questions about my life, my family, and the current condition I'm experiencing. I've told my wife I believe my doctor sees me as a project, her goal is to keep me heathy and strong. 
0.720000	I visit military clinics to see my primary care managers.  This means that they have no reason to mislead me.  However, they can sometimes be in a hurry to try and get to all their scheduled appointments on time.
0.840000	My general practitioner is adaptive and listens to my concerns. Sometimes it takes a long time for her to get back with me.
0.960000	My primary care physician guided me through the hardest point in my life health wise when I had to be hospitalized for a colon condition. His advice was spot on through the entire ordeal and it was possible to make a fast recovery due to him. His guidance is what makes me trust him really no matter what.
0.600000	I've known him a long time and he usually answers all of my questions honestly and truthfully. He is always available when I need him.
1.000000	She makes sure she has all the current information before making a diagnosis. I am very happy with my doctor.
0.680000	I've used the same primary care doctor for more than a decade, I definitely trust their opinion when discussing treatment options for various ailments 
0.680000	I trust my doctor for the most part, however I don't think doctors know everything and they should really listen to their patients views and opinions when it comes to their health and what their body is telling them. 
1.000000	If I didn't have trust in my physician I'd find one I do trust.  This is somewhat of an absurd question.  My physician ALWAYS explains things, is upfront, takes necessary time and explains everything 
0.960000	My doctor takes a good deal of time to sit with me, answer my questions and advise me about courses of treatment when necessary. She has not steered me wrong in any of my medical issues.
0.800000	I facebook stalked my current doctor. I was in search of a black female doctor who was not overly religious to be my primary physician. I truly trust her and know that she has my best interests in mind because she is like me. I don't get the same feeling of controlled condescension that other doctors have and none of the fanaticism some black women are wont to have. It 's just pleasant, and I feel like big pharma cant buy her either. 
0.760000	My doctor is a professiol and uses their best judgement in dealings with my health. They also explain things to me and answer questions I have. This is why I trust my doctor. 
0.640000	I do trust my primary care physician but I also don't feel like I get very personalized service. I feel as though I get a generalized service saying that I have basically the same issue as other people. 
0.800000	They can get into a lot of trouble if they lie to someone. I also haven't been mislead by a doctor yet in my life. A lot of medical information is easily verifiable on the internet nowadays too, so if your doctor is lying to you it is easy to find out.
0.560000	"I haven't had a primary care doctor for years because I'm poor and couldn't afford to go to doctors, but I did go to the emergency room a few years ago and that doctor totally ripped me off. I had a sty bleeding wound on my eyebrow. The doctor glued it back together, gave me 2 Tylenols, and a tetanus shot. All of that cost almost $2000. You can explain it to me a million ways but there's no way those actions cost $2000. It took the doctor 5 minutes and the bill said that the ""physician fee"" or whatever it was called was $800. They charged me $10 a piece for the 2 Tylenols. All some of these medical people care about is money. It may have once been a noble profession but now they're just as crassly capitalistic as any other big business in this country."
1.000000	She is blunt, yet caring. Very thorough and answers all questions to make sure I have a good understanding
0.640000	I trust them to a certain point,because sometimes their advice is not accurate also when dealing  with my helth
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician to an extent. She is very caring but not very attentive to things going on with me and my son all the time. I don't really recieve any follow-ups with her it does not feel like the type of connection I thought it would be with a primary care physician/family doctor
0.480000	My primary care is good enough.I really rely on my heart doctor though.My primary can be dismissive,abrupt and officious.My heart doctor is gentle ,sensitive and caring.
0.480000	I have been with my GP for almost 20 years.  Over those years, he and I have built a sort of rapport that I have come to trust.  Unfortunately, in the last year or so, something has changed.  He is less tolerant with questions and does not give  you much time to discuss your concerns.  He is more concerned with getting you out of his office and moving on to the next patient.  I am currently looking for a different  GP. 
0.800000	Because she has been kind and compassionate with me for many years.  She is easy to talk with and confide in.
0.680000	sometimes my doctor seems to want to go with what is considered standard medical practice rather than what I am telling him about the effect of a particular treatment.  I want to continue a medication and he wants me to stop taking because I MIGHT have a bad side effect.
0.760000	I believe that the doctor will give you the best care for you, they have your best interest at heart.
0.760000	ive know my doctor for years, have had him for maybe 8 years if my life, he has always given me advice and the best of care.
0.760000	I do not know my primary care doctor.  He was assigned to me with the ovomitdon'tcare tax went into effect.  I have yet to be able to get an appointment with him.  Every time I need a doctor, I call and, first, I am told he is not taking any new patients.  When I tell them he is my assigned doctor, I am told the first available appointment is 6 to 8 months away.  Thanks to the ovomitdon'tcare tax, the emergency room is my primary care doctor.  I answered the above questions based on the two times in the past 4 years I have had to go to the emergency room.
0.600000	I trust my doctor, but i trust myself more. I know me and what's right for me better than my doctor does. 
0.640000	I am very new to my provider. She came highly recommended and I felt comfortable the few times I have seen her. But I have not had to use her for anything more than basic check ups.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because of his track record over the years with patients who aren't me and the fact that doctors can easily get in trouble for not doing the right thing.  
0.680000	Many doctors seem to rush through appointments and take the easy solutions when a more thorough visit might be appropriate along with discussion of all treatment options.
1.000000	I trust him because he listens to what is going on and if he can't figure something out, he will direct me to someone who will and will provide a referral with no problem.
0.640000	I don't trust my primary care phyaician, for the simple fact that I am just know know (by them), that I shouldn't be taking Celexa and Reglan together because it makes me even more in a bad mood.
0.440000	Doesn't take enough time to discuss options & doesn't follow up. Cannot trust and I have to research everything to be certain I am getting the correct treatment. And/or get a second opinion.
0.720000	Some I trust some I don't. All depends. There's honest to God willingness to help while others just want to milk the coverage plans
0.360000	My primary care doctor never ask me what I want or how I feel about a treatment, she just tells me what to do. She wanted me to remove my gallbladder but never asked me if I was ok with it or if there were altertives. I cured myself with limonene. I feel i no longer need her help most of the time.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because she seems knowledgable and trustworthy so far. ive only been to her oncce though so we will see
0.840000	I trust her because she is a very good peron.  She tries to do her best at all times.  The small lack of confidence I  might have relates to her overlooking something or being pressed for time.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because I feel they are giving me the best medical care they can provide. I feel my doctor is always right.
0.840000	I generally trust my doctor because they have always led me in the right direction and provided me with the best information or options in respect to my situation. I still like to do my own research as to things they say or recommend to me, but I generally trust their initial assessments. I think most doctors do really care about their patients needs instead of what is just convenient for them.
0.640000	I know my body better than my physicin and they dont always get things right pertaining my health. They always try to push some drug i dont need.
1.000000	My doctor is from The Republic of Moldova.  She went to medical school in Russia.  Now she is in America and has a Natureopath license.  She restored my hearing in my right ear using lasers and ozonated tea tree oil/olive oil.  Now she is helping me to clear my lymphathic system.
0.800000	It's just the feeling that I get. With doctors it is all about trust. If I didn't trust a doctor I would shop around until I found one that I did trust. And again it would just be the feeling I got off of them that decided.
0.480000	I don't trust them there very greedy and only care about money they act like they do BS my mother and aunt where killing by doctors your just another dollar to them but there are a few good one out there but hard to find or you just good to pay out pocket for them
0.480000	I have a general distrust for those with medical training. This is caused by a negative experience with a doctor that I had as a teenager.
0.520000	"Because many doctors are either a) trying to get through patients as quickly as possible; b) trying the safest (and not always most effective) solutions that minimize their own liability; c) have a ""band aid"" approach to medicine that treats symptoms rather than the underlying cause, and d) depend on medications and writing prescriptions. Furthermore, most doctors are not interested in preventative care and have very little good advice on nutrition. "
0.720000	I do not have a primary care physician anymore so I will just go with my neurologist.When I started going to her I was on all the wrong medicines all of my Drs before her were just throwing pills at me hoping for the best, I was even on a medication that was so outdated they only prescribed for cases where nothing else would work. She changed all of that in just one visit by putting me on all new medication. She even took care of my constant headaches and other little issues that I thought where just there for life.
0.800000	My PCP has been treating me a long time and has went out of her way to help me with new treatments and with exploring different treatment plans when traditional ones weren't working. She would also visit me during hospitalizations which has given me a lot of reasons to trust her and feel she is looking out for me. 
0.880000	My primary care doctor is thorough and caring.  He never rushes my visit and always asks a number of questions about my various health issues.
0.920000	My primary care physician has already proven her abilities to me. Three years ago I almost died from an acute COPD flareup that just would not get better. My Dr. took care of me, made sure I understood what was going on and how much danger I was in, hospitalized me and treated me. she then changed my whole maintenance med routine to improve my overall health. At this time she was the ER Dr on duty not my primary care Dr. After that hospitalization I changed her to my primary care Dr. I knew I would never find a Dr more dedicated to my health and I trust her 100%
0.760000	my doctor is only telling me whats best for me. He has my best interest in mind when I have an appointment with him. He is only trying to get me to stay healthy or get me back to that point.
1.000000	I trust my doctor with my health decisions. They are always looking out for my well being. I can talk to them about anything that relates to my health.
0.760000	I trust him, but the things I'll take a neutral position on are things like pharmaceutical drugs. I don't like taking them and I'll always do my own research to see if there are other things I can do before trying them. If there isn't, I'll grudgingly take them.
0.720000	I have been seeing the same primary for years, since I was a teeger. He delivered my oldest daughter and he has always been forthcoming.  He is also the primary for most of the women in my family and has always been wonderful to all of us.
0.800000	My doctor is a very knowledgeable and personable man with a very good bedside manner.He cares about all of his patients and has a very strong desire to heal.
0.760000	I have no problems so far. I have been with my doctor for a little over 2 yrs now. I think he does a good job and would recommend him, and have. 
0.760000	My primary care physician spends time with me in my appointments and explains every little detail about the procedures or treatments that I may be going through. She never rushes and she always takes time for my questions. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very experienced and highly recommended.  She is very kind and very honest with me.
0.400000	I feel they do not care to put in the time to really figure out and discuss health complaints and often rush patients in and out. I do not fully trust them for fixing health issues.
0.720000	"Normally and previously I have had total confidence in her. However recently my medical needs have started to conflict with what is ""popular"" to do because of certain topics in the media. Though no one has told me that is the reason. I have been given NO reason why I'm being denied effective treatment. "
0.640000	I have military healthcare through my husband. Both my primary care doctor and my neurologist were recently rotated out to new duty stations. Both of them were really good, and saw me through my initial GBS-CIDP diagnosis and the first cycle of recovery and recurrence. I'm now on cycle #2 and both my current doctors are new to this duty station. They may prove to be just as good as my last doctors...but I just haven't seen them often enough to make that determination yet.
0.800000	My doctor has never steered me wrong before. Although he may have been quick with information i have always been able to find out what i need.
0.560000	Because they know what's best for you . They know the right spot or place for you. They provide the best for you . They care for you .
0.400000	I feel like there have been other treatment options that my doctor didn't tell me about because they got extra money for getting me on something they were in business with.
1.000000	My doctor is a very good and honest man.  He is about 35 and has a modern view about many things.  He explains everything in detail and ask many questions about me and my conditions.  He is very knowledgeable about family medicine because that is what he studied in medical school.  I could not ask for a better doctor.  He also treats my entire family the same way.
0.680000	I trust that they understand what they're talking about. However, I sometimes wonder if the prescriptions and procedures are given out to make them the most money
0.520000	Knowledgeable but doctors will rush to see too many patients.  Will not go in depth unless problem is already too far gone. Prevention not a thing with most and don't take their time with each patient.
0.800000	He's the expert. I don't know much about medicine, so I don't have much choice. Additiolly, he's always been open and honest with me about my treatment options, side effects, etc.
0.520000	Some are not very persoble and always feels like they're in a rush.  The ones who have practicing for too long appear to fit this description.  It seems they have loss interest in their profession.  
0.800000	I generally trust my primary care physician because she consistently treats me with respect and listens to my needs. She's also willing to say when she's unsure about something and when I need to seek additional resources or opinions, rather than pretending to know everything about everything. 
0.840000	My primary care person listens to what I have to say and we work to find the best solution to any problem I might have.
0.640000	I have been with my doctor for a number of years, and he has always been able to take care of my problems. I think I could better answer this question in regards to why I don't trust him. Sometimes, I read and learn about treatment options, but when I discuss them with the doctor, he generally doesn't give them any merit- I am not talking about radical treatment options which have no backing in the scientific community. However, as I think about this now, I realize that he ought to have my full trust, as he is lettered in medicine and has never done wrong by me. I am virtually experimenting when I offer my input for treatment options. I don't have as much certainty as he does- I could say that I am just trying to see if I could find a solution on my own, sort of like a test of my ego.
0.760000	Most doctors choose to do what's right because if they get caught doing otherwise, they could lose their license. That is why I trust them in general.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she feels that if I am able to get healthy without prescription drugs, that is the best route. That is respectable to me since most doctors just want to push pills.
0.320000	had  a  pain in my side  went to my doctor  he told me it was all in my head  kept feeling that  pain  went to another doctor after  again being told it  was all in my head   the  other doctor helped me in finding out that pain was actually  a cancer  to where  i  almost died from so  no  i  don't trust my old  doctor at  all  .
0.320000	Most docs where I live care about money, not their patients. There is very little access to a large health system in South Carolina where I reside and what we have is what we have. If you have to go to the ER it's best to go over the border to North Carolina than to go to Piedmont. 
0.920000	I have never personally had an experience with a doctor that would make me not trust a doctor's advise.  I believe that in general doctors do have their patients best interest in mind. 
0.800000	I have seen the same Dr. for 17 years so she knows me well. She's open to my suggestions involving my care and will usually agree. She orders appropriate tests and mess and is available to receive and promptly answer emails.
0.760000	The reason I trust or distrust doctors is because I believe they have a protocol to follow. They might order an xray when it could of been more beneficial to order an MRI. I understand they also have to perform what is approved if the patient has limited insurance.  
1.000000	My doctor is always very thorough and does not leave the room until all of my questions have been answered
1.000000	I track my doctor because she is a good doctor plus you caring about my well-being for me and my family she always been honest with me and my family and told the truth about everything that is going on with my health 
0.720000	I trust my Dr to a certain extent, I don't believe in taking so many different medications just to treat minor issues
0.720000	I trust my physician because he has been my primary doctor for many years. He listens to me and doesn't judge me regardless of my habits. He always tries to provide the best guidance possible.
1.000000	SHE IS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL RELAXED AND TAKES THE TIME TO ANSWER ALL MY CONCERNS. SHE IS ALSO REACHABLE WHEN I CALL.
0.920000	she seems to remember all the tiny details of my case. she seems genuinely interested in helping me to feel my best.
0.440000	I think most doctors have good intentions but they are very overworked . . .  to the point where it's very difficult for them to do their jobs well.
0.480000	I do not completely trust my doctor because it seems as though he really doesn't care anymore. He is close to retiring and just seems as though he wants to get in and get out of the room as quickly as possible. 
0.760000	I feel I must trust a physician.  If I feel something doesn't sound right about treatment, I would question the physician to find out pros and cons.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physicians because we have a mutual trust of respect and friendliness. I find that if I empathize with them and ask then questions in a friendly manner, they are always eager to listen and advise me best on how to proceed.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she has never done me wrong. They have gone above and beyond to help me, and get the proper care I need.
0.760000	I have had my primary care doctor for years and it's obvious she's someone who truly cares about her patients and isn't just trying to make money or has been burned out by the job. More than once she has told me I might want to get a second opinion on something, which only increases my trust in her, for I much prefer that rather than a doctor who thinks they're always right.
0.680000	They ensure that you get the best possible care and are very informative on questions that concerns me 
1.000000	my doctor is very upfront with me. she knows when i dont take meds regulary by results of blood screening, and will confront me with results in a compasionate way and in a way i understand.
0.840000	I truse my doctors because she take good care of me and ask me a lot of questions about me and she cares
0.560000	They are greedy, underpaid, and will do whatever it takes to make money off their patients and not really try to heal them. 
0.680000	I trust them with the family and friends and family and friends and family to the hospital and I will be there for a while to get it from the other day when 
0.840000	I feel that you can trust a doctor fairly well because the last thing they want is to cause you harm. For one they most likely would feel bad and morally wrong for hurting a patient. Also they do not want any law suits on their record or in their life at all.
0.680000	Sometimes for the same symptoms different specialist give way different, sometimes opposite prognosis, so there are many things they disagree with one another in, that makes me nervous.
0.760000	Medications, Test,  Availability  My doctor explains the reason for the medications he prescribes for me. My doctor tell me about the possible side effects of medications. The medical test that my doctor recommends for me, he explains why they are necessary. Finally my doctor makes himself available on short notice, if I need to see him.
0.720000	I don't distrust the doctor. I merely feel like so many tests and procedures are unnecessary and sometimes harmful. I don't go to the doctor unless I feel like something is wrong.
1.000000	In today's world and insurance drs have to turn alotbof patients Not only have I never been rushed through an appt but the dr never forgets to ask about my family When called I always receive a call back the same day
0.800000	He has dedicated his life to helping people with their life. I don't believe he would lie to me. I believe he always has my best interests in mind and gives me the truth.
0.800000	I have been with the same primary care physician for 15 years now. We have an excellent relationship where she is honest with me about what changes I need to make for better health, and I am honest with her about what my health goals are and the treatment I am or am not willing to undergo. She never tries to pressure me into making a healthcare choice that goes against what I want to do.
0.640000	My primary care physician is very busy.  I know that he has many patients.   I think he is thorough and careful but sometimes he may miss something due to being busy.   There is always other patients waiting whenever I visit him.  I always feel a bit rushed.   
0.840000	I trust the right kind of doctors because they know whats best of me healthwise and the right kind of medicine
0.440000	"My current primary care physician worked in an ER. He still has the ""treat and street"" mentality. He will only go over any concern specific to what the appointment was originally scheduled for, and will not allow time to go over any new issues or concerns that I have. "
1.000000	I think my doctor has a great deal of compassion and caring for all her patients...I know how she interacts with me and other patients and it shows she is a trustworthy doctor to all her patients.
0.760000	They know more than me with their experience in the medical and health field. They are more experience than me because they have taken the the class for the class. They are very helpful
0.760000	I have just started with her, but she seems to be communicative, alytical, takes time to explain, moderately to highly intelligent, sympathetic, and experienced.
0.600000	I trust them nbecasue they are professiols. I am going there because I value their opinions and trust them whole heartedly.
1.000000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician since I have been a long time patient of hers and she has kept me healthy all that time even though I have several problems that could make me unhealthy if not treated right.
0.760000	I think all in all doctors are worthy to put your trust in their care. I just think there aren't enough doctors to go around. They are so frazzled and tired trying to keep up.
0.560000	Generally all doctor do not take enoug time to talk to their patience. Sometime the doctors just want to see as many as patience as they can 
0.720000	My doctor seems to have a thorough plan for my various ailments and seems open to any questions that I have.  I don't feel rushed by him during the appointments.  He is personable.
0.720000	I have used the same doctor for years.  He has always made sure I understand his recommendations/decisions.  I have never had an issue with his performance.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because they have excellent training in the medical field, and have a wealth of other doctors and medical resources to go to as a backup
0.800000	My doctor is pretty good at giving me all of the options and making sure that I am doing what I want, for the most part. There are rare times when they are busy and ther just isn't time and they tell me to just do something and I trust they are doing what is best and know better than myself. 
0.520000	I haven't been going to them for long so the trust isn't completely there yet. I imagine with more time and continued good treatment I will trust them a lot more.
0.480000	We have recently moved so I've had to find a new primary care physician and I am having a hard time trusting him.  I have been on several of the same medications for years and years, but a couple of them he is not comfortable with, so he is wanting to change them around even though I have been the most stable on these ones for the longest period of time.  I feel like he doesn't trust what I'm saying, and it doesn't make me feel good.
0.560000	I dont completely trust any doctor simply because they get paid to treat sick people and so sometimes i feel they prescribe medications to prolong symptoms or treatment in order to make more money off their patients.
0.800000	My doctor has never given me false or misleading information. He's always been straight forward with me, even when he knows there are things I should change but probably won't. 
0.560000	I trust somewhat because they are trying.  However, I think they are sometimes rushed and it is difficult to get appointments on time.  I think they try but sometimes are short staffed as well.
0.560000	I have been to  this doctor foever. They always give me the correct medicine and I feel better in no time
0.560000	I trust my Doctor to a certain extent due to fact don't feel as thorough as she can be when have ailment
0.840000	My doctor is very bright and because of this I have learned to trust her more and more.   It is my own persol distrust of people that made me not trust her 100% when I first starting going to her for care.
0.560000	I have switched doctors until I have found one I trust.  Prior to that I truly felt as though the Drs wanted to make money on procedures and medications.  I felt as though they pushed the same things and it was for a monetary reason.  Currently my Drs really listen and I am involved with my health care choices.
0.800000	All of the doctors that I have interacted with over the past few years have been understanding and compassionate about my current situations. Sometimes I feel like they haven't been completely helpful in finding solutions to some of our health problems, but I've never felt like they haven't been doing their best job to communicate and give me options. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician is because I've been with him a very long time. He is very thorough and honest with me every time I go to see him.Therefore I trust him completely.
0.280000	I feel like some doctors are only concerned about getting paid. They don't always look out for their patients' well being. Some doctors also get perks from prescribing certain medicines to their patients. 
0.640000	I believe that they generally have the best interest of other people in mind, and do not want people to suffer. 
0.680000	I trust that my doctor will want the best for me. They are getting paid to help me feel better so I should trust them.
0.640000	I sometimes dont trust medical professionals because like most other people they are just trying to do the bare minimum in their jobs to get by. Sometimes they don't care for the patients as much as they do the money they are making. 
0.480000	It seems that physicians want to treat symptoms rather than dig to find causes and solve complex medical issues now.The latter takes more time and effort and expense and the medical industry does not favor the old diagnostic approach to medicine.Physicians are too ready to write prescriptions than to treat patients with drugs.
1.000000	It's their job to be honest and to give me all of the information available
0.320000	I distrust my primary care physician because his opinion on what he feels is best for me is a generalization based on what he feels is best for every patient with similar symptoms without taking into account the differences in genetic makeup. Each person is different, and what may work for one patient may drastically affect another in a different way.
0.400000	Doctors are after the bottom line for the most part, which that is how many patients can I see in a day and how much money can I make off them. My doctor is sort of that way and I don't like having to wait hours for just 5 minutes of his time. It takes longer than that to diagnose someone and help them through that situation
0.800000	My doctor is generally aware of my needs and the needs of my family. I always feel a level of personal care and attention when  I am in her office
1.000000	My doctor ð¨ââï¸ is totally awesome ð and she knows me like the back of her hand ð¤ she is dependable 
0.680000	I mostly trust my doctor but I also know that sometimes doctors have other interests in mind. Example, if a new drug has come out and insurance will give the doctor a bonus for each patient who prescribes to said medicine for a certain medical condition, the doctor may persuade you try it if it pertains to your treatment even if it's not the best course of action for you 
0.720000	sometimes I think doctors deliberately hide information to keep you coming back to the doctor so they can earn more money off of people
0.760000	I trust my doctor because of the relationship I have built over the years. Also my doctor has a stable client base and they have never misdiagnosed or prescribed anything I would refer to as unecessary.
0.760000	I have been going to my family practice for over ten years. I am very comfortable with the doctors, nurses, and aides working there. They take the time needed with me, listen to all my concerns and answer all my questions, and will offer me additional options if need be.
0.520000	I trust them for the most part but still feel they advise initially from a place of automatic response. It's not until I have challenged or shared personal findings that more information is given or alternatives are shared. 
0.800000	I just had my doctor leave the practice I go to and I've started seeing a new PA.  She is very nice, but we are still getting to know each other and figure out communication.  My PA was very nice and straight forward the last night I met with her and listens to my questions.
0.600000	I trust my doctor they went to school to learn this stuff so I would hope they know exactly what they are telling me and what medicine they are giving me
0.480000	I'm so frustrated now.     I'm seeing 4 specialists and could give a damn about coordinating care with each other.   God forbid they go an extra inch , must less mile. 
0.240000	I was in extreme pain for a very long time when I finally decided to go to the doctor. I told my doctor where my pain was and how extreme it was. At first she treated me for something way off. Of course I was still very sick and hurting. I went back and told her what she treated me for was not right at all. So she sends me home with a bunch of muscle relaxers which made me sick. After 2 months of trying to follow her patient plan I went back. I begged her to refer me to a specialist and it turned turns out I was right and she was wrong.This is why I do not trust doctors. There are several times when they are wrong.
0.440000	There have been times where I left the doctor's office without a diagnosis, without any assistance in dealing with my medical issue.  When I went for a lower back pain, I left with instruction to drink lots of water, but no indication to go for physical therapy, which is what I needed.
0.520000	I distrust my primary care physician because I have family members who works at hospitals and I can see that the doctor only cares about how many patients they can see and donât care to find out the background of a personâs daily life and see what is affecting the person and trying to solve the problem slowly. They would rather prescribe instant medication to stop the problem from spreading but does nothing to get rid of the problem or be proactive about the problem next time. We basically have to solve our own problems then go to doctors to get the drugs. 
0.640000	I trust that most doctors have the patient's best interest in mind. I don't have a general distrust for doctors, but I also don't blindly accept their opinion. I always research.
0.800000	My primary care doctor is caring and seems very wise. She has been a doctor for many years and always has good answers to my questions. I've verified many things she's told me on websites such as Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins and she is always correct.
0.680000	In general I have a great deal of faith in doctors, but I know they are very busy and there is an intense amount of knowledge they would need to synthesize in order to truly be able to find the best course of action for everyone. I believe they try very hard, but from personal experience I know that often several courses of treatment need to be tried before the right one is found. I don't think badly of doctors for this, nor do I think it is from neglect or mal-intent. I think it is just a result of the complicated workings of the body and the fast amoutn of medical knowledge that exists.
1.000000	He is caring and listens to what I have to say and how I feel.  He has had to pass all the testing done to become a Doctor and I don't think many untrustworthy people can pass all the testing that is done.  And he has taken an oath to do no harm all trustworthy people will adhere to any oath they take.
0.760000	I only have a mild distrust of doctors because of some experiences my mother has had working with them, but on the whole I have had extremely kind and patient primary care physicians. My GYN doctor, especially, is extremely trustworthy. She gives her patients her personal cell number to call at anytime in case of an emergency. 
0.720000	some of the doctors are very trusting and some can be not as trusting and they have sometimes they kist think that its okay but i know better and i would get another opinion sometimes .
0.760000	I trust him because he is persoble and lets me tell him what I am comfortable with and not. He isn't pushy, but will always do what is best for his patients.
0.360000	They just want to be paid they don't care about their patients just want us to keep coming back that's why i don't go to them 
0.640000	Sometimes it seems that they're too quick to recommend invasive treatments like drugs with bad side effects or surgery rather than trying to get the body to heal itself, which seems much safer (and less expensive) to me.
0.600000	My doctor just hurries through the appointment and does not really listen to me especially about woman problems and he just does not understand or know how to fix them.
0.600000	I stay in the middle when it comes to trust.  I trust their opinion, but they are still motivated by self interests first.
0.920000	My doctor has always taken the time to listen to my concerns and follow up with appropriate treatments/testing.  This has not always been the case so I can definitely see the difference in what a good doctor and bad doctor are.
0.760000	I have no reason not to trust my primary care doctor.  If I have a problem, I can ask my doctor anything.
0.800000	I actually have a new PPC so I don't have a lot of experience with her.  From what I do know, I trust her and her judgement.
0.600000	I do think doctors have a lot of pressure to get one patient done and move onto the next; hence lapses in high quality service.  My doctor is careful, but could probable be a little more detailed.  Also, I can do research on my own to determine what medication I need and know my medical history well enough to know what medication doesn't work well or causes a reaction.  
0.720000	I have a lot of trust in my primary car physician. They treat me like an individual and show me a lot of care. They ask me about my concerns and really try to get to know me. They are very good at diagnosing problems that I have.
0.800000	I have been going to my doctor since I was little and he knows me and my family well. I trust in what he says and does to treat my ailments.
0.840000	I have no reason not to trust my primary care physician.  She has always been straight forward with me.  She listens, investigates the problems, provides a solution, and if the solution is not working, then we work together to find another solution.  I wouldn't say i have complete faith in her, but i trust her and her ability very much.
0.720000	My doctor actually takes the time to see me and know my history. They ask me questions to better understand my concerns. 
0.960000	stop asking for such long answers to these questions   my doctor never steered me wrong  blah blah blah
0.720000	I like my primary care physician, but I don't ever fully trust my healthcare to any one individual. Humans are fallible. I take my physician's advice, but I will separately do my own research and, ultimately, decide for myself and talk it over with my physician. If I disagree with them entirely, I will seek out a doctor that will oversee my care in the best way I see fit. 
0.680000	I trust my primary care doctor. I have had good experiences with her so far. On the other hand I have only seen her a couple of times.
0.600000	I don't have a primary doctor so these don't really apply to me personally. I think a primary care doctor is more reliable than an error doctor because they're less rushed and spend more one on one time with patients
0.800000	My doctor has my best interest at heart and through what i have encountered this past year my doctor has showed consistently over and over that there is care and concern 
0.240000	"I went to court for disability, and found out my medical professionals think I am ""faking it."" I feel betrayed, judged, and misled. "
0.800000	I just started to see my new doctor & hadn't been to a doctor in a # of years, but she seems very thorough about testing me for almost everything.
0.560000	I think Doctors can get in the habit of following the same treatment plan over and over. Each person is different and should have their treatment tailored to them. 
0.520000	I don't go to the Dr all the often, but when I did, it always seemed like he was in a rush. I would tell him what was ailing me, but it felt like he was just talking at me instead of to me. It felt like he never took me seriously. He has since moved on to another practice out of state, but I don't miss my former doctor at all.
0.280000	The physician and doctors in general come across as rushed and that they have no desire or time to truly help.
0.200000	"Doctors are only out to make as much money as possible. There should never be a time when you make an appointment at a doctors and have to wait a month to see them or be told to go to the ER ""if"" it's an emergency. Doctors should have patient CAPS and all doctors should be required to take all insurances. Also a doctor should never have so many appointments that you see their nurses aid instead of them."
0.880000	My good health is a reflection upon my provider, if I'm doing well, then so are they. They have never given me a reason to doubt that they have my best interest at heart.
0.800000	She listens to my concerns. Allows me to provide her detailed history in my symptoms.  Also had grandfather as a physician and father biochemist. Told her these things before starting going to her
0.760000	I have many issues because of my Lupus diagnosis. Therefore I listen to my Doctor as well as listen to my body. I believe that my being well informed helps my relationship with my doctor.
0.760000	I trust my Dr because, I'm feeling better than I was years back.  Also I believe my Dr is listing compared to my former Dr's.
0.680000	I think in general most Doctors, the ones I've seen have your best interest at heart, I don't always agree with everything they say, I believe most doctors are paid to prescribe medications. This makes it hard to completely trust at times.
1.000000	He seems to be aware of my ailments and is concerned that my treatment is correct. He is listening to me and my individual issues. 
1.000000	"I work for a world-renowned health system with some of the best doctors in the US. I always look to see where they attended school, I have access to their ""heath scores"", and if I have to I'll ask my boss, who is the CEO.  They were able to diagnose that I had an autoimmune disease that usually takes 12 years to diagnose."
0.720000	My PCP does his best, I think. But he is often rushed and is getting older. I trust him less than I used to. That said, I have absolute trust in the NP in his office.
0.800000	The took an oath that I respect.  They would have no reason to not have my best interests in mind.  I do have an obligation to myself to double check their recommendations.
0.600000	I have never had a problem with a doctor.  This survey is not for me because I don't have any of these problems.
0.880000	I have been seeing my primary doctor for seven years.  She is through, and takes the time to listen to all of my concerns.  Although I have many health conditions, they are all controlled by twenty prescriptions.  I feel my main concern is RLS, which I research at RLS.ORG.
0.720000	My primary care physician hasn't given me any reason to think he has ulterior motives. He has been pretty spot on every time I have seen him so I will continue to trust his judgement.
0.400000	I have had a personal, plus three familial situations in which--two if the times, two different family members almost died because if a lack if thoroughness and misdiagnoses. I myself was mid handled during a very high risk pregnancy. Each of these times, I mystery of, was forced to tell the doctors what I felt should be considered it done. I must add, that all three if these instances did not take place at my preferred hospital, UVA, where I wish all three of us would have been treated.
0.920000	I have been with my doctor since I was 18 years old. He has never done unneeded testing, is quick to personally call me when I have questions instead of having a nurse do it. I had a medical scare in November, and he actually came to my house when my blood pressure sky rocketed to wait with me while my husband drove home. 
0.800000	My doctor has taken the Hippocratic oath, and I have no doubt that he is looking out for my best interests at all times.  If I had a negro doctor, I might feel differently, but I have always found the orientals to be trustworthy
0.520000	I do believe doctors want to help people. The issue I have is hospitals are driven by profit and people can be driven by rewards. So I may have high blood pressure but instead of trying to give me a diet to follow they go right for the medication. They do that because its a pay back to them. If I have pain in my knee the first thing I dont want is an opiod but thats the go to becasue there is so much money in it. So in all I trust them to help but I dont trust them to do it the cheapest or more reasonable way.
0.800000	I trust most doctors because they are highly educated and have much more knowledge and experience than I do on the subject.  I do not trust some of those I go to because I am in the military and some are just HMs who have not necessarily been to college let alone medical school and could be lacking in the right information.
0.720000	They have always been open and honest and answer all my questions throuhgly
0.720000	My doctor seems to take a conservative approach towards treatment. He is not too quick to recommend medication and advises a healthy overall lifestyle. 
0.840000	She seems intelligent and puts a lot of thought into treatment. She researched my case before I see her and so I know that she cares and does what she can to give me the best advice.
0.520000	Although I'm quite satisfied with my doctor and really like her as a person, she's made a few mistakes that cost me a lot of physical pain and could have been very bad for me if not fatal. 
0.680000	I have limited experience with my current primary care doctor but she seems to be pretty thorough and honest.
0.640000	He is honest and caring.  However, he is not entirely well versed in health issues outside his specialty.  He has made mistakes before and shown that he does not  know how to do certain procedures.  He is good at interl medicine but not at neurology .
0.920000	I have seen a few doctors at this point in my life and have had various different experiences with different ones.  I feel confident in the intelligence, concern, and care this doctor exhibits.  He is willing to take time with me and answers any and all questions I have.
0.800000	Because I have been able to talk to him like a person - without it feeling like a judgment.
0.840000	I have complete in my doctor, Ihave been seeing her for quite sometime, She always give the best treatment , So for she have taken good care of me.
0.960000	My primary care physician demonstrates a willingness to listen to my physical and emotiol complaints and can empathize with me.  She demonstrates a level of caring for her patients that I have not seen often in a clinical environment.  She even remembers who I am and what I am dealing with without having to consult my records.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough and has helped me with a few medical problems that I've had. She is patient and kind.
0.960000	The general care practitioner I go to is really good. They do the basics really well and I don't ever really require anything besides some antibiotics every 7-10 years anyway.
0.680000	I feel good about my primary care doctor because I've been seeing her for a while and she's helped me several times when sick or feeling depressed, etc. but I don't have the same good feelings about most doctors in general. 
0.520000	I sometimes trust them because they give good solutions, and sometimes I never get the right cure. Also some doctors tend to be very well behavied and this gives me some more trust because they judge the case as if this is their case.
0.800000	My doctor is very personable, friendly, and honest.   She does thorough tests yearly, gives me all the details and takes a much time as needed.
0.840000	I trust my care physicial a lot, i have been seei g him for over 10 years and he has always given me the right tips. He knows me very well and tells me the right tgings to be healthy
0.960000	We have known each other for a long time and w ae a great relationship.  He is a professional and I trust him.
0.640000	Doctors make mistakes, MRI's don't show things correctly sometimes and doctors believe the MRI's more then listen to what I am telling them.  Doctors don't consider that I know what I am talking about, and they just assume I am not communicating the symptoms correctly. 
0.800000	I have a lot of trust in my primary care doctor. My first meeting with her was a little awkward because it seemed like she was a little distracted and it took a little time for that feeling to go away. Subsequent appointments have been much more relaxed and she has been pretty easy to talk to. She always gives thorough explations and goes over my lab results with me, paying closer attention to anything that has changed since my last appointment. I feel very comfortable asking her questions. She gives me time to ask questions and give me good answers. She also hasn't hesitated to give me referrals to specialists when that has been needed. Overall I find her to be very helpful and knowledgeable.
0.800000	I have had no bad problems with the doctors I've gone to.I think most doctors are well trained and honest.
0.760000	I trust most doctors in general. I feel they provide adequate enough healthcare services. I don't really have a reason to not trust them because I feel like they know enough about whatever health-related things to made accurate assessments of my health. 
0.960000	I have been going to the same Doctor for 20+ years I have total trust in him he has always helped me whenever needed
0.200000	I think most doctors are in it just for the money I take their advice with a grain of salt and research stuff on my own...I have been given wrong advice often and wrong diagnosis more then once
0.800000	All doctor miss things on some patients that they deal wit they can't catch everything so if u smart enough to know something is still wrong even tho ur doctor told u that everything was ok u all ways go to a higher physician that can assist u better
0.840000	I had researched this doctor before selecting her and was satisfied with her educational training, experience and customer feedback.  I have been seeing her now for a few years and have not seen anything to change my mind about my initial impressions.
0.560000	I have a new doctor so my trust hasn't been earned yet.  I did trust my old doctor completely.  My old doctor did all of the things that are listed above.  The new doctor seems to be following some kind of generic schedule instead of finding out what I personally need.
0.800000	I trust my physician because she is caring and honest. She is open and you can talk to her about any of your health concern and she will give her honest advice on what should or shouldn't be done. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has training and experience. I will question him if I have doubts, and do some of my own research, but I think my doctor is my best resource. 
0.800000	My doctor has over thirty years of experience practicing medicine. This gives me a lot of confidence in his ability to care for me. He is very caring and through when treating any medical condition that I may have. I trust him greatly.
0.520000	I do not believe they are totally in the business of patient care. It is a business and mostly A JOB.
0.200000	I have been misdiaganosied a few times. I had a stroke and was told go home and rest it was a pinched nerve. My doctor does not listen well and does not trust I know my own body. I have been told many times I dont have something like kidney stones and after tests confirmed that i do.
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because he also took care of my mother while she battled a terminal illness. We became close with him during that time and he did a lot for my mom. His care went above and beyond and that has made me trust him very much.
0.920000	My doctor is more educated on physical well being than I am.  I trust him alot.  My doctor has helped me a lot with ailments in the past.
0.960000	I recently switched physicians and have found a truly remarkable one who actually listens to me and works with me
0.680000	I think there are always other alternative treatments beyond medication. However, the focus of treatment seems to be a prescribed medication rather than treating a condition with natural options.
0.880000	i trust my doctor  they know what they  are doing most doctor u can trust and u can relie  on them for medicial needs
0.920000	I trust that my doctors are following the oath they made to do no harm. Additionally, I believe in science and believe that the doctors who have years more training than I do are far more capable than I am in this regard. However, I do think that it's important to tell them when you are experiencing side effects etc. so you can get a treatment that works for you. 
0.720000	I sometimes feel they're a bit rushed to get to the next patient, but I do feel they are listening to what I'm saying about the state of my health.
1.000000	Over time everything thing that my doctor suggest that I do benefits me and I never had a bad experience with any medication that she precribed for me.
0.720000	i've visited my doctor a couple of times and I do feel like they really care about me as a person and want me to be healthy. I've not had any negative experiences with them and plan on continuing to go visit them annually or more often.
0.520000	Sometimes they are very dismissive of me and my concerns but will only care when it is convenient for them
0.560000	I do trust my doctor but to a sense. Sometimes I feel like he just wants to hurry me out of the room to go on to the next patient. When I try to explain something that might be wrong he kind of dismisses it. But I do know that he will try to help out for issues that are already present.
0.640000	I trust my doctor 0n most matters, but I feel sometimes I have to insist on being involved in my own care, and to make sure I get full answers to any concerns I have.  I do not like arrogant doctors.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician. I believe that he cares about his patients and gets them the help they need. He is competent and if he can't help with a specific problem he can recommend a doctor that can.
0.920000	I trust them because I have a gut that I use and it is always right. Also they are honest and incredibly amazing. My doctors always try to make me calm and happy. I love that about my doctors they are there to help me nothing else.
0.840000	Because I tried alot of doctors who didn't take the time or care to properly treat me. I My doctor who is a cardiologist noted this and got me proper referrals. And has been treating me for the last 6 years. Even when I was uninsured for a couple of years.
0.960000	I have had my primary doctor for years and have been satisfied so far with treatment outcomes she has made for me.
0.800000	Yes, i'm t ruting in my doctor because she's always honest, and never hiding anything even things will make me feel sad.
0.800000	I have a few doctors I see regularly. They are all very dependable, capable, and intelligent. I don't see any reason not to trust them.
0.520000	this doctor is new to me, he seems like he is in a hurry all the time. so, its too soon to tell at this point.
0.640000	I think my doctor is a good one.  I think she's very busy.  I trust her, I just think she's busy. She makes recommendations and ask me lots of questions.
0.320000	If I'm asked about symptoms, I can barely finish a sentence before he just blurts out some answer. After that he's very dismissive of questions. I might get a printout with s cursory explation of what's going on.
0.800000	well i trust my doctor and all that he do for me.they take very good care of me. ther is nothing i dislike
1.000000	I trust my doctor i know that wind i go see them she take her time in doing what she do make shore all my test are up to date
0.640000	I trust my doctor to an extent because she has her own motives as well. Sometimes nothing is wrong  but she is addresses it because she wants the additional money, something she admitted to my husband who works in her office. So, I feel that all doctors probably think the same way. So, I could be worrying about an issue because my doctor, who already gets paid very well, wanted more money.
0.520000	seems like i am rushed n and put... wont stay to answer ,y question... seems pissed or upset if i do
1.000000	"My primary care doctor has been part of my life for 26 years! He & I know each other well & have ""grown"" over the years."
1.000000	"I've had the same PCP for eight years and she's always been very up-front about anything involving my health. If there is an issue with multiple treatment options, she makes sure I understand all of them before making a decision. I've never felt as if she were just trying to apease me or ""get me out of the office"" by doing the easiest treatment. "
1.000000	I havve been with my GP for 20 years. I can trust anything he says. He has been with me through the good and bad times and always tried to do whats best
0.760000	I trust my primary doctor because, have no reason to tell me a lie! Don't trust because might be wrong!!
0.440000	I don't think my doctor really takes the time to know what is going on with me. She just pushes prescriptions
0.720000	I'm neutral with my doctor. Sometimes i feel I know whats best for myself. I don't agree with what my doctor is sayig. I also feel that he doesn't know what he's talking up sometimes.
0.720000	I do trust my doctor but you can never be too careful because at the end of the day with all the good intentions in the world if something goes wrong I'm the one it'll effect, I have to live with it. So I do trust my doctor but at the end of the day I'm responsible for taking care of myself. I think doctors in general are well intentioned and do the best they can in general.
0.840000	I see my nurse practitioner instead of my doctor as my primary care provider.  I trust health care providers that are intelligent and kind and I prefer to understand all aspects before engaging in care.
0.880000	Because I've known my primary doctor for over 10 years. He makes sure I'm fine ever visit. He also calls and makes sure I remember to schedule follow up appointments 
0.360000	Many times they simply do not listen to concerns especially in relation to medications. They tend to trust too much in medications that can cause serious side effects and don't realize how much they can negatively impact your life. Specifically I was given medication that was not working well for me but the doctor kept telling me to give it time. I listened and regretted it. I lost most of my hair and gained about 40 pounds by the time I gave up and stopped taking the medication. The doctor was not empathetic or concerned about the effects but the experience had a very negative and lasting affect on my life. I've had more than my share of negative outcomes due to poor medical advice. My son also went through years of unnecessary treatment due to a misdiagnosis. So I can't say that I fully trust any doctor's medical advice.
0.680000	I think that your doctor should be one of the most important people in your life. If you do not trust your doctor or if you do not have that bond with your doctor, then I think that you need to find one with which you can form that bond with. I think trust is the number one thing between doctor and patient. 
0.760000	I mostly trust my primary provider. I feel that she has my best interests in mind and provides good care. However, I wouldn't fully trust any single human with serious health decisions. I have a need to research things myself, and even though I know my doctor is a good one, she's human, and we all make mistakes. 
1.000000	I can depend on my provider. I trust that my provider will steer me in the right direction. My provider has never given me at reason to have trust.
0.760000	My PCP has always been very kind, thoughtful, and educated. I have never felt like an idiot while being in the office with her. 
0.680000	i trust him because he's a physicaian in the professional and medical field,he,s never steered me in the wrong direction that i can prove if anything to prove he is a kindhearted peson and really cares about his patients
0.600000	I trust them to an extent but I don't have a very strong relationship with them and in general I'm a little suspicious of medical professiols.  I think they withhold some information from patients.  Plus I've had them tell me the wrong things before, things I knew were not true because I had found research conflicting it, so I sometimes just don't trust them.
0.800000	I really trust my doctor because I have been with him for over 15 years and nothing he has stated so far has been false. He has the best in mind for me and will be honest when I am not doing something correctly.
1.000000	She has always helped me out.  If she doesn't have the answer she sends me to a specialist.  She makes time to listen.
0.800000	He has saved my life on one occasion and my daughter's life in another. He is very thorough and helpful. I have been seeing him for over 25 years. He knows me. 
0.560000	I trust doctors to a point. However I feel that they do not always listen and just generalize your condition. They lump you in with other patients they have experience with
0.840000	I trust my primary care physicians to do what they believe is best and affordable for me given the knowledge they have. That said, one can not be an expert in every specialty and sub-specialty so I do expect to be referred to a specialist if necessary.
0.640000	healthcare profession is doing the best that it can, the situation at times for them can be limiting and handcuff much of the industry.
0.920000	I always make sure the doctor I am dealing with is trustworthy. They usually have rules in place to make sure I am getting a fair deal, and if not, I can always find someone else or complain about them to the office/hospital. I have never had a bad experience at the doctor's office, and I can tell by their personality that they are taking care of me and have me in their best interests.
0.560000	My PCP seems rushed when I see her. She also seems tired and overworked. She seems like she cares a little, but she explains things to me but doesn't try to be super thorough. I probably wouldn't keep seeing her if I had actual health problems.
0.480000	They do not seem to listen to me often about what is wrong. Or think that family history of something is anything more than me being stupid and an huh strung
0.800000	My doctor doesn't seem like a bad guy. He doesn't push any medicines or products on me, so it doesn't seem like he's benefitting in any way that would make him disregard my care.
0.720000	He pays attention to detail.  He recommends another doctor if a specialist is needed without hesitation.  He is in the loops if I need to go to specialist.  He does not horse,around about giving medicine that will do the job.
0.800000	Because if they lie to me they would be in big trouble. Doctors should always be truthful to their patients at all times no matter what.
0.800000	I have only been to my present PCP once, and have not completely formed opinions making it difficult to answer the questions on this page.  However, I was favorably impressed by him and intend to keep using him for the foreseeable future.
0.800000	Since I have been going to my doctor he has been very through at telling me if anything is wrong and explains to me why I need a certain medicine. 
1.000000	Because honesty trusworthy, down to earth easy to speak to and explains in a eay to understand. Easy to lean from
0.800000	I recently had a serious leg injury and surgery and she has been in contact with me almost daily to check on me and make sure I have what I need to get better.  She also makes sure that I am doing the things I need to do for the rehab of my knee and wrist to get full function back.
0.560000	I live in a small town and our doctors are not known for having the best track record for getting diagnosis correct.  We usually use our Primary Care Physician as a way to get to a specialist for a true diagnosis.  I do not let my children go to a local doctor, if they are ill we travel over an hour to take them to a pediatrician's office in a larger city.  
0.720000	She's a professional, she seems to be pretty knowledgeable and she seems really caring.  I just kind of assume that most doctors know what they are doing, so I do not see why my doctor would be any different.
0.520000	Dr's work and are obligated to the pharma business. That is their main goal, patients are secondary.
1.000000	My doctor is extremely familiar with my worries, feelings of helplessness at times and he provides enough time to listen to my concerns. He is very empathetic. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because i've been going to him for years and years,  and after every checkup and everytime i've went to his office i've just got a good wholesome feeling from their practice. I just get the sense that he just wants what is best for me and my family.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he has never given me advice or information that has not proved to be true. 
0.640000	I do not know my physician well enough because I do not visit him very frequently. I also do not trust people too much to begin with.
0.560000	The Primary Care Physician I have right now I trust very much, but she is leaving her practice and has not informed any patience as of yet. I am afraid of finding a new one Because my previous physican gave me a hard time helping me manage a medical condition
0.640000	they are title specifically to tell you what you need for what is wrong with you. Afterall we all want to be in peak physical condition.

0.680000	been wit and hah him for 35 years he has helped me with so many health problemsand never steered me wrong
0.520000	Sometimes information may not be as accurate. Information is open for interpretation. More than one opinion is good.
0.560000	I don't go to the primary care physician but once a year I don't trust her I go to the pain doctor I trust her and I go to another doctor and t trust her
0.800000	I have had the same doctor for more than 10 years & he has helped me allot.  I can tell him I have a weird pain & he figures it out quickly.  
0.680000	i like my doctor because he listens to me and has a lot of experience with different medical problems. he is personable and is smart about medications, side effects, different conditions, and health insurance
0.720000	I believe that I trust doctors in general because they have more knowledge that pertains to the situation that I might find myself in. They have endured the proper schooling and training required that qualifies them to make diagnoses, and give medical advice. They are professionals for a reason. 
1.000000	I've had the same doctor for the last 30 years and he's been very forthright every step of the way.  Besides, my sister recommended him to the family because they were in medical school together
0.880000	I trust my doctor to explain completely, to tell me what I need to know.  He does not trust alternative treatments very much.  I check with another health professional (whom I trust) about those options.
0.920000	I trust the doctors I have for my various needs. I like to do my own research and ask lots of questions if I don't understand something. Sometimes, my doctors aren't completely aware of what I've researched and our opinions are different, but for the most part, I trust my doctors to have my best interests.
0.840000	My doctor has made efforts to connect with other doctors treating me for various issues, and she spends as much time as necessary with me during appointments.
0.400000	They have tried to push me away from solutions that don't involve taking drugs when those options are just as viable.
0.840000	He is a smart guy. Been around for many years. 
1.000000	I have been going to my primary physician for almost 4 years now and never once have I felt that I was not important to her. She has been supportive and attentive always.
0.600000	I have not found a primary care doctor that i actually like. They are always quick to give medications or rush you out of the office. 
0.240000	My Dr. doesn't isten . He just gets in and out as fast as he can. I don't think he even really cares I am just more money to him. Ireally get upset. I wish he would take more time to pinpoint what is going on.
0.760000	My primary care physician has known me for a couple years now and I have grown to trust in him lot. He is good at explaining things to me for the most part and is very easy going. He is also very thorough in explaining things to me and trying to see what I think about certain health issues. He has not let me down yet and has not given me a reason to distrust him.
0.440000	I do not think I do not trust my doctor, I just think she is rushed. She always has a ton of patients and book them so close together to make money that the care suffers. She rarely has time to talk about any concerns she is more in and out of the room. 
0.480000	In general, I trust my doctor. Sometimes I get disappointed. That happens when I cannot get an appointment when I need it, I do not get phone calls from doctor's office informing me about a problem when I have to wait for a refill of medications.
0.680000	He's great to talk with, but aging, and perhaps a little less careful now with actual exams in his office.
0.840000	I think my doctor takes enough time to address my physical and mental health concerns. She takes the time to explain things to me and helps me to explore options if we do not have a solid answer for anything I am dealing with.
0.800000	I chose my doctor out of a few that I've visited over the years. She's always eager to answer questions and is professiol, all the while still having a kind demeanor.
0.760000	He often has a lot of patients to care for so they overlook things they may be a big deal to us. One time I went to the doctor because I had a runny nose all the time and he gave me one look and told me that it was a sinus infection. I think it was something else 
0.800000	I've known them for years and they've always had my best interests. My doctor always gives me ways to treat what's ever wrong with me, they let me know which treatment is beat but they let me choose which one I prefer
0.920000	They care, they are quick but thorough. They are available when I need them. They make sure to follow up on what ever is wrong with me. They know where to refer me if they can't help me.
1.000000	I have known her all my life she is my best friend that happens to be my doctor
0.680000	Everyone makes mistakes and often there are multiple treatment options for a given condition.  So, while I do feel that I can trust my Doctor I don't rely on them completely without understanding the full situation.  I like to ask them what they would do, or if their loved one had the same issue what would be the top two treatments they would recommend.
0.680000	None i trust my doctor pretty well I have been going through the same doctor for years and I'm treated pretty good so far 
0.600000	She used to be an excellent doctor. Not so much as her practice has expanded. Now she seems to take longer and longer extended vacations.
0.680000	I do not fully trust anyone completely, even a doctor. I always have a sense of questioning about what if. No one is perfect and even doctors make errors or are wrong.
0.760000	My primary care physcian always seems to care about. He always wants to make sure I'm telling him everything that is bothering me . Mentalliy and physically.
0.680000	He knows what is good for me. I asks a lot of questions and get good feedback. He is very efficient with hic examination and consultation
0.760000	I trust my primary doctor because I feel she went to doctor school and she should have learned something about the human body. She specialize in a special field of practice. I trust in God and believe in her to take care of my health and give me advice about it.
0.600000	My primary care physician is okay for routine care, but I have never been so sick that I needed extra attention. If something big were to go wrong with my physician, I'm not sure I would trust her completely without a second opinion. She has been fine so far, but I'm generally healthy.
0.400000	DOCTORS THESE DAYS ARE OFTEN NOT SUFFICIENTLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THEY TREAT. THEY DO NOT LISTEN OR HAVE AN INTEREST IN LISTENING TO PATIENTS. THEY HAVE 15 MINUTES TO SEE YOU. LESS IF THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. IF YOU TRY TO ASK A QUESTION THEY ARE IMPATIENT AND TELL YOU THEY DO NOT HAVE TIME. THEY HAVE A SUPERIOR AND JUDGEMENTAL ATTITUDE. THEY ARE OFTEN FLAT OUT RUDE. THEY ALSO BILL FOR THINGS THEY HAVE NOT DONE AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT REASOBLE.
0.760000	In general I trust my primary care physician as they have demonstrated their honesty in the past. Additionally, I trust most doctors in general. Furthermore, it takes a certain type of personality to be a primary care physician. They are stereotypically honest, trustworthy, and caring.
0.960000	Their overall experience and rating among the community. I have not heard any bad statements about them.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she has given my no reason not to trust her.  She explains her thought process when it comes to diagnosing any issues I am having and she explains the pros and cons of various treatment options.  If she makes a recommendation for a certain course of action she explains why.  I guess maybe a primarily trust my doctor because she is transparent.
0.720000	I trust my physician to a degree.  However, she tends to send me out to specialists a lot...which makes me wonder how much she is really able to treat.  If I have a cough, sniffle or fever, she's fine.  If it goes beyond that....hmmmmm.
0.600000	I have had a lot of bad experiences with doctors. I currently have a nurse practitioner that I like and trust. My experience began young when I had a doctor tell me on several occasions that I couldn't have whatever disorder I came to see him for. Such as telling me a thirteen year old can't have ulcers (I did). Once I had a doctor put me out of work for seven days for whooping cough as an adult, and when j explained to her I needed one more day to not get in trouble at work so I'd be on sick leave she denied it. There are other instances where I felt my voice wasn't heard. 
0.840000	Primary care physicians in general should be trusted by their patients. They are very good at what they do.
0.880000	I just began seeing a new physician since my previous one retired. She is extremely intelligent and is totally aware of my medical history and how to treat and prevent any issues that I may have.
0.400000	My primary care physician is a very nice, warm, friendly woman, and I liked her immediately upon meeting her. However, during our last appointment, she prescribed a medication that has awful side effects, some side effects that I had expressed concern about with her during that same appointment, so I was disappointed to read about those side effects after picking the medication up from the pharmacy and that made me second guess my immediate trust in this physician. 
1.000000	I trust them because I've known them a while and they listen to me.
0.760000	I do not have a primary care physician but I on the few occasions that I go to the dr, I trust what they tell me.
0.520000	I have had experiences with doctors that make me skeptical of their trustworthiness. I have had doctors give me medicines for illnesses that I didn't actually have several times.
0.480000	Some medical decisions are not 100% safe. And I prefer to do all natural remedies first before having to pump toxins in my body that can cause more harm than good. They have some good options but half the time without tests, they are guessing. 
0.600000	I do not trust anyone and I defiantly do not trust doctors because there the main ones handing out poison. 
0.920000	I have known my physician as a friend before he became my doctor. He was also a work associate before, so I know the type of doctor he is to other people, and I know for a fact he is good and cares about his patinets.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has always been good too me and make sure in always doing what I need to stay healthy 
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been honest and helped me and my family in any way he could and if he couldn't he would always send us to a doctor who could
0.800000	My current primary care doctor is the first to take my concerns seriously. He is doing everything he can for me so that we can find answers for the symptoms I have been experiencing. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because they always tell me the right things and steer me in the right  direction, they never tell me anything wrong.
0.840000	He has always been correct in the past.  He treats me with respect.  He does not order unnecessary tests, but does order those that cannot or should not be avoided.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he listens to and trust what I have to say about what is going on with me and doesn't try to tell me that I don't know myself and my own body. He talks to me and doesn't talk down to me and I believe he provides me all the information that he has about me and my condition.
0.720000	I trust my physician. She asks a lot of questions and always wants to know what works and what doesn't work for me. She offers medication and solutions.
0.800000	up until now everything my dotor has told me and prescribed, has been right on the money.  i trust her completely as to her ability 
0.600000	I some what trust but sometimes I feel like I am not being heard and the doctor is always in such a rush that he doesn't listen to me
0.640000	My doctor spends more time with me during check-ups than any doctor ever has. She continues to ask questions, give me tips and pieces of information I wouldn't normally expect, and will even bring up questions regarding other possible issues I have to ensure there is nothing being missed. She truly listens to everything I say and never seems like she's rushing to get to the next patient. I feel she really does care about my health.
1.000000	My doctor is trustful. My doctor does what is best for his patients.
0.280000	Most of the time, when I go visit my doctor, she is so busy that she spends a maximum of five minutes with me, looking at her clipboard, asking generic questions and then rushes out. I feel like I am not allowed to ask her questions in the off chance that I am inconveniencing her and her busy day. Makes me not really trust doctors and someimtes i feel like I am prescribed something for the sake of pharma companies tryign to seel patients drugs when we actually don't need them. I honestly dont like to be highly medicated but at times, it looks like docs are looking out for their own salaries and compensations at times. like this. 
0.800000	The reason I trust my doctor it is because I have known him for a long time and is a very professional and caring person. He loves what he does.
0.760000	I think alot of the time they make alot of money off people having disease that they over diagnose and over medicate
0.720000	I trust my primary doctor because she attentively listen to what I have to say, and is willing to provide me with the latest treatments and how she arrived at her decision about any treatment that she feels will benefit me. I like that we engage in a dialogue that is therapeutic from both perspective. I feel that my doctor is being honest with me based on her abilities as a doctor
0.560000	I do not currently have a primary care physician.  Doctors that I have visited in the past seem to get stuck on one particular notion and don't listen well to what I feel.  Additionally, they are not interested in whether or not I can afford the test they are prescribing.
0.720000	I've known him forever and he's pretty kind.  We have a generally good relationship we've maintained throughout the years and he helped me get back on track with managing a condition I had neglected due to a doctor that made me feel poorly about myself.
0.280000	I am seeing my doctor for about 2 years.   I have to visit him every 4 weeks.  I distrust him because he doesn't answers the questions important me .  He just follows standard procedures every time.
0.760000	He has never given me any bad advice. He has helped me through several situations. I do trust him and do as he recommends.
0.760000	I trust her because I have know her for years and she is very approachable and friendly. She is willing to be honest and frank with me, even if the truth hurts.
0.800000	My doctor is awesome. He's smart and funny but he is also serious when he needs to be. He has always been honest with me and given me many options on what to do next and how to proceed. In almost every single case of him suggesting something, that has been the right suggestion, whether I took his advice or didn't. 
0.680000	I trust doctors in general because I believe in the Hippocratic oath and I haven't had a negative experience that would make me distrust them. There are cases (specifically scheduled c-sections) that I think are about convenience, but for the most part, doctors are trustworthy. 
0.400000	Physicians in this day and age are governed by insurance companies and regulations more than medicine and science.  They don't always willingly do these things, but nonetheless they have to bow down to these entities in order to get paid by using less effective treatments first, or substitute treatments for others due to money.  Also, a lot more time is spent on documentation than actually giving the patient good eye contact and favorable bed side manner along with taking as much time as is needed with patients.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I believe he cares.   He seems down to earth and he showed concern when he saw I had too high amounts of cholesterol in my blood.   Also he seems to provide good advice that has helped me in the past. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she is always honest and trustworthy and helps me in any situation that I need her opinion or advice.
0.840000	relevancy to good things. I can belive in only good things happening to me and nothing bad. if I follow the door's instructions mostly good things can happen.
0.720000	My primary care doctor seems to take care in doing all the necessary testing for illness and other conditions which might be present is a person of my age, gender and lifestyle.
0.640000	My physician is okay, she seems scattered at times and has made mistakes in appointment times or reading records. But nothing that was critical was overlooked. She is convenient, a female, and although an MD believes in altertives.
0.880000	we have a great connection and i feel that we are able to ask anything to him about my health i feel he wants whats best for me 
0.840000	My doctor always explains things thoroughly and answers all of my questions. He explains the side effects of medications before prescribing them to me, and allows me to decide on what I believe would be the best treatment for myself
0.840000	She is always patient with me and takes as long as I need.  She never seems bothered when I ask her questions, and if I call with a problem, she usually can see me that day. 
0.920000	If my primary care physician see that his way is not working he will send me to another doctor , he will explain every thing to me , sometimes draws pictures and shows me how something will work , he takes his time with me and make sure I know what is going to happen 
0.560000	I DISTRUST SOME DOCTORS THAT I SEE, BECAUSE THAY DON'T TELL THE TRUTH AND I FIND OUT FOR MY SELF AND LET THEM KNOW ABOUT IT.
0.960000	I trust them because this time they spent a long time trying to be accurate with my illnesses. They made sure I have the right treatments so it wont damage my body more. My immune system is weak because of my lupus and I have a pe.
0.800000	I have used the same PCP for  the last 5 years. In that time ihave got to trust his decisions on my health care.
0.800000	I trust my current doctor since he seems pretty honest. He is friendly and has told me that he's interested in my well-being directly at least once. He wants to hear what I have to say, and if I ask a question about something, he does his best to answer it to my satisfaction. I haven't experienced anything that makes me feel I should distrust him thus far, though I won't say I completely trust him 100%, since I know he's not infallible.
0.760000	My doctors take the time to explain findings to me and possible treatments, needed. They let me consider which treatment I might prefer and then guides me to what might be best for me. 
0.920000	My PCP is very caring and thorough. She never rushes through my appointments/exams and we go over each of my conditions and monitor my process.
0.680000	you have to put faith in them. they went to lots of schooling to make sure they can help you when you need it.
0.560000	I feel my PCP sometimes rushes through appointments. Plus they are handcuffed by what my insurance allows them to do. 
0.600000	I don't really go to the doctor like that unless it is for a physical in which I always know that I am in good health. I just I trust my doctor, I'm not really sure when it comes to me asking questions about things that I have prior to my visit thought was wrong they would always say its no big deal but it seemed like it was so its kind of an indifferent feeling.
0.760000	I have made substantial progress with my physician in reaching my health goals.  We have good communication between both of us
0.800000	I really trust my doctor because I have been with her for a long time and she has been with us for many health situations. I have a lot of friends who go to her as well, and they have nothing but good thigns to say. I feel like she really listens to us and knows her stuff.
1.000000	I completely trust my primary care physician because he has gone above and beyond in handling my illnesses.  There has been times when I have gone in for a routine check up and he sent me directly to the emergency room.  Upon arriving at the emergency room I was informed that my blood level was severely low.  He has recommended me for four surgeries and I have felt a little bit better after each. 
1.000000	I have 4 very close drs that have been actively in my life one for 15 yrs  another for 14 and the other two i believe now 4 yrs. They know my body better than i do. I completely trust all 4 to any descisions may may conclude
0.760000	I agree for the most part that doctors are looking out for their patients and can be trusted, but I do think like all human beings sometimes they are working in their own interests.  For example, my regular doctor used to recommend removing moles even if they are not a problem (cancerous or pre-cancerous), but when I mentioned that I am on high deductible insurance and these procedures come out of my pocket, she conceded that this mole removal is not needed.
0.600000	trust because they should know what they are doing in there field. if they don't then they don't need to be in the health field
0.560000	In general, doctors aren't perfect, they all make mistakes or misinterpret something on occasion.  In regards to treatments, they may have motivations other than your health, like earning more income or arrangement with a pharmaceutical company to promote a certain product.
0.600000	I don't go to the doctor often, but they are more knowledgeable than me so I believe them
0.800000	I trust my doctor. I have many health conditions going on so it has to pin point whats ailing me on a specific day
0.400000	She is too stuck in the allopathic medicine.  I'm about to fire my long term physician. She sometimes does not listen, and has to be forced to listen.
0.640000	Pt was also educated about the importance of compliance with psychiatric treatment and need for regular follow ups to check on response to meds and seems to understand the same. She was also educated about the importance of abstinence from illegal and intoxicating drugs, like alcohol. Consider addition of Lamictal vs abilify in the future. F/up in 2 week, get records, safety plan discussed.
0.800000	I trust my physician because due to medical training, and knowledge of my medical records, she can make the best decision.
0.440000	He doesn't even remember my name or say hello to me if I walk by in the halls.  Like he's emotionally detached from everything and is just there to do his job, nothing more.  I can't trust someone who share little care for their patients.
0.520000	I trust that he means well, but I don't trust his ability to see things clearly.  And in general, I think most doctors have too many patients and not enough time to focus on them long enough to really see what might be apparent early, until it's so obvious and too late.
0.760000	He spendsa gooda mount of time with me and makes me keep track of important health information and give it to him on our visits...then he really studies the info i give him.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he is honest and Straught to the point. All alternatives are taken into consideration when talking about my health options 
0.600000	I trust my doctors to a point. I do not trust them completely and feel they sometimes choice the easier way than the way that might be more beneficial to me. 
0.680000	I usually trust my care physician. I take my time to carefully select who my doctor is so I don't have to worry about it trusting them. I trust them until they I've me a reason not to
0.640000	I trust my doctor to give me the best advice about my health. I also feel most doctors are somewhat out to make a extra buck.
0.880000	She is intelligent and asks thorough questions.  She is good at following up.
0.840000	They take good Care of they patients to put there needs before there own kids and be honest instead of leading a long day talking about you
0.800000	I trust him because he seems to really know what he is doing, and was able to treat my infection correctly. He is also very kind and caring and seems to really care about the patients.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he used to be in the group with my previous primary care physician in the past.  I didn't not have a good one a year ago and changed to someone that I trust will care for me properly.
0.800000	I feel comfortable talking to my doctor(s), and if I have questions or concerns I don't have a problem asking. Also, if there are side effects I ask about those, or potentially alternative treatments. I have always felt that my doctor was able to explain things in a straightforward way that I understood. 
0.720000	I have seen my doctor make mistakes before treating me. However, he is brilliant and helped keep my children healthy growing up so I give him credit. I feel as though he did overprescribe antibiotics for me, though, as I did end up with C-Diff in the hospital two years ago from prescriptions he wrote on my behalf.
0.600000	first of all my primary care physician doesn't show up to work on a the regular basis and also he always smells like alcohol and do not have that much knowledge in medicine.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I believe he has my best interests in mind. I don't feel like I'm being taken advantage of or being talked down to. I think that everything is done with the patient's best interests in mind.
0.840000	My primary care physician is very thorough and makes sure to have adequate communication with me, I normally feel confident in what they are saying
0.280000	I have worked with doctors for years, they are people with problems and attitudes and unrealistic goals also.  MY OBgyn is useless. 
0.640000	I believe that there are situations where certain treatments may be suggested that are not in my best interest.  Doctors have been known to receive compensation from pharm companies to push certain drugs.
0.800000	I believe in my doctor and she very thorough and I have confidence in her.  Whenever I hav had a problem she has always been right.  She is very cautious
0.240000	I distrust my primary care physician because I have a great understanding that insurance companies pay doctors more to be quiet than to speak up about one's medical issues
0.840000	I have been going to him for a while now. I Google him & looked at reviews on him. All reviews were excellent on him. 
0.800000	My doctor makes sure to let me know what is going on if there is anything going on and makes sure I understand everything they do as they do it. My doctor makes sure that my thought are heard when I have a questions or comment and makes sure that they understand ever question I have. 
0.760000	My doctor will sit down and listen to me and my concerns and she will also talk to me in terms that I understand  she will not leave until I fully understand her and what she is saying
0.560000	I have neutral trust of my doctor. While I do believe he primarily acts with integrity, he will spend 20 minutes lecturing me on healthcare issues that I'm not there to address, leaving the real needs unattended. Namely, he spends the entire explaining to me that I shouldn't drink at all, ever. In return, I lie and say I don't drink. 
1.000000	My doctor always has my best interest at heart. He will listen to my concerns and do what we both feel necessary to help the situation. My doctor will explain the pros and cons with me and together help me decide my best option.
0.600000	I trust my care physician they know what's best in my eyes I trust them they know what best when it comes to Heath 
0.680000	"I usually trust certain doctors depending on howe well they listen to me, but doctors who talk over me make me mad. My GP she patronizes me and its sooooo aggrevating. She wil also say, ""Im not your mama, so you should be doing this or thta but Im not your mama.....Im like ..look lady my mama is dead, so can you please stop bringing that up everytime I see you? She is a terrible doctor."
0.360000	I feel that too many doctors are influenced by pharmaceutical companies and only want to promote  the taking of drugs instead of determing the underlining root causes of illness. 
0.800000	He cares about people he believes in give goid care for people going be on to help people when they dont have health insurance 
0.560000	well he is older and I worry he is not up to date. he seems to prescrine new meds not sure if its for exchange for gifts
0.400000	I don't trust my primary care physician because she is barely available and doesn't spend much time with me. She doesn't fully listen to what I have to say. Her assistants do most of the intake, if not all of it. She often seems stressed, and she probably is. Even so, I need someone to sit down and listen to me for more than three minutes. Every meeting and exam seems to only cover the bare minimum of a patient's needs.
0.760000	My primary doctor is my OBGYN and she is amazing. She listens to my concerns and takes them seriously. Whereas other doctors would gloss over my anxieties/fears, she will go the extra mile to make sure I am well taken care of, even if that means transferring my care to someone else.
0.720000	I feel that the few doctors I've had really answer my questions and take time to explain things to me. Even when I don't understand something he takes time to help me understand. Easy to talk to and makes me feel like he cares.
0.720000	I trust them and they usuallt have my best interest at heart... i love doctors and believe they gerenally are good and have my best interest at heart
0.840000	Doctors train for a huge part of their life. They are incredibly knowledgeable and determined to provide the best care for their patients. I have no reason not to trust my doctor.
0.520000	I have a chronic illness. Most doctors are quick to say nothing is wrong or that its all in your head when they can't find anything upfront. Most doctors have told me this, and then my last doctor diagnosed me with Epstein Barr. I have recently started seeing a new doctor and I don't know how I feel about her yet.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician . She tells me everything I need to know about my health and what I need to change to be as healthy as possible.
0.800000	i trust my physician because she does a great job of going over different options to my problems. she doesn't just say there is only one path of treatment. she looks at the whole picture.
0.760000	I trust my physician because I have been seeing him for quite a few years now! As er say bedside manners in a dr is a must! Someone who shows you they care & what's best for you!
0.760000	I trust my doctors advice on care because I am a relatively healthy male with no preexisting conditions.  I only usually go see the doctor when I am really sick.
0.720000	I do not trust it sometimes. Because, some doctors do not look at the bright side and they are upset the people. And they do not look at the all type of test results. they see just some symptoms in report and they put the me of sickness. but they are not looking other side effect that cause the sickness.
0.680000	I trust doctors to a point, i feel as if some doctors could use a bit more training and i do not always trust them.  All in all i do trust most doctors it just really depends on teh situation 
0.800000	My Doctor, OBGYN, has been my doctor for over 15 years and he's the best. He diagnosed my cancer and re moved it as well. I've been cancer free for 5 years. 
0.760000	Because if he doesn't come through with being honest, I will own him...I will sue him into oblivion, and I will have his medical license yanked.
0.680000	I never trust a doctor 100%. I JUST got a new doctor, and I was happy with him when I went to have a physical back in November.  I like his temperament, his openness to listen, he followed up when he promised that he would, his staff was friendly and so was he.  He looks at things from multiple views.
0.960000	I have been going to him for over 25 years, he is one of the most well known doctors in CA.  I trust him completely
0.760000	Usually, when I have several questions about something that is going ion when my health, my doctor usually has all the answers to whatever my questions are to put my mind at ease. Sometimes, I have my doubts about the answers and then just google search more about when we talked about or on my visit I will ask more questions and he will answer them once again to put my mind at ease.
0.880000	I find my self without any reason whatsoever as to why I should not trust my doctor. I have always followed his transcriptions and every time I get cured. I therefore have gained a lot of confidence and trust in him. 
0.840000	Physicians spend years and years honing their craft, learning their skills, and making rational decisions about what to do in any given medical scenario. I don't feel that it's my place to question their advice, so generally they know what the best course of action is. I have full trust in what my care provider tells me I should do.
0.960000	They spent years learning their practice so I should be able to trust them.
0.640000	My physician seems competent and knowledgeable. I trust her recommendations. She seems to have a decent interest in keeping me healthy.
0.560000	I had a wonderful primary care doctor but he had since retired due to too much paper work involved in the practice. For the time being, I don't have a primary doctor. However, I come in contact with different doctors. Many are good, normal people. They do their best to treat patients with their specialized knowledge that they spent years to acquire. At the same time, they are just humans and could only do so much to treat patients. 
0.840000	I trust that my doctor is looking out for my best interest as I could give him a bad review otherwise.
0.600000	I trust the knowledge that doctors have to identify a problem and provide solutions, but I distrust the use/prescription of medications when they aren't necessary to solve the issue.
0.520000	I feel that i am just a number and a pay check most of the time. I have had a few different pain issues over the last 10 years that no medicine, exercise or checkup has been able to diagnose, help, or fix. 
0.600000	I dont think I've ever trusted a doctor completely. When I see them taking meetings with pharm reps and so many patients they only have about 5-10 minutes with each, I dont feel very confident about everything they say and do. They seem to go on vacation a lot too.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has been our family doctor for years, and considering my other family members are still alive he must be doing something right.
0.960000	I trust my doctor a lot because she's the one with the degree and not me. She knows what she's doing and I trust her because she hasn't given me a reason not to.
0.760000	I believe my doctor has no reason to lie to me unless it happens to do with trying to sell me a pill of some sort. That does not work for me because I can't swallow pills, so the subject usually moves to altertives or something I can do myself, at home,  to help the problem. I think a doctor can tell who is serious in trying to get well and who just wants attention and/or a prescription of a magic pill to get them well. I am willing to do the work to get myself well, so I get along fine with any doctor I see.
0.640000	I'm unsure how I feel about my physician because I rarely see her. I trust her to give me good advice because that is her job.
0.200000	I distrust physicians in general. I believe that they are strongly misinformed and guided by big pharma. They are told to prescribe things and they don't do their own research.They just take what the pharma representative says as fact. 
0.800000	I went through several doctors before I found my doctor.  He is always ready to listen, doesn't prejudge and is willing to go the extra mile to make sure that I understand what he tells me
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he gives me through advice and he knows what he is talking about. Another reason that I trust my doctor is because he genuinely cares about you and your well-being.
1.000000	My doctor takes the time to explain options to my condition and never tells me what option I have to take.  She recommends what she thinks is the best option, but has no problem if I select another option. 
0.480000	I like him a lot and think he is good and means well, but he is always in a hurry and lookingâat the computer too much. I think he is overbooked.
0.280000	I don't feel like it is intellegant to trust any one 100 percent with your health because of so much malpractice 
0.560000	I don't put too much trust in doctors because I know they get kickbacks from certain medications and don't always look out for their patients. I know they mean well, but sometimes they don't do what's best and I don't want to put myself in that risk over something small that I can treat.
0.720000	The explaianation and reason why I trust my primary care physician is do to her character and understanding. I feel she is an honest physician who truly wants to help.
0.840000	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because I have been seeing him for a few years of my life. It's been enough time for me to gain my trust.
0.960000	I just changed to a new doctor and she is very caring. She was very patient when I saw her for the first time. She took time to listen to my concerns and started an immediate plan of action. So far, her plan of action is working and I'm starting to feel better.
0.720000	I go to a medical professional for their knowledge and expertise. If I don't feel comfortable with the information or advice, I feel confident in my own ability to seek a second opinion or read up on treatment options.
0.640000	I trust my doctor because he's never given me a reason to distrust him.  I don't believe he values me above all else, and certainly he cuts corners/time/doesn't explain EVERY possible option every time, but he always tells me the relevant information I need.
0.800000	I like to give physicians the benefit of the doubt.  I have never been steered wrong yet.  I bet there are a few crooked ones out there but I have not encountered them.  I like to think people are more good than bad.
0.520000	I don't trust any doctors anymore. I have seen so many that are not involved in my care as I feel they should be. I like my doctor now but I don't trust him.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he always provides excellent care to his patients. He listens to your problems thoroughly before making decisions and never rushes through any treatment.
0.920000	I trust my doctor.  He is always very open about all my options and is willing to help me.  He always treats me like family and sometimes even calls to check up on me.  I believe he really does have my best interest at heart. 
0.760000	I believe that they have my best interest in mind. They want to do the best for me that they can.
1.000000	I've been a patient of my doctor for 25+ years and he's never steered me wrong ever he takes good care of me.
0.680000	He listens to me and if there are issues that he has concerns about that require a specialist he never hesitates to send me to one. However, as I believe with most primary care docs he is somewhat rushed.
0.520000	Follow up information is idequate.
0.640000	They know what they are doing there should be no reason for them to try to mislead or misdiagnose me
0.760000	My doctor has been working for many years. I trust his experience, but sometimes I doubt his knowledge of up to date medical procedures/medications/causes.
0.840000	I have bene going to him since I was 16 and he has always given me good advice and medicane to amek me better when I have been sick
0.720000	I've been with my doctor for 15 years  I travel to my doctor n that's Because they r trust worthy n accurate plus when new things happen they can handle it
0.680000	I feel like my doctor is quick to prescribe something for my condition without fully testing me or suggesting natural methods or cures. 
0.680000	He's very open and discusses the options with me openly.  He takes the time to answer my questions and provide me with options.  What he's done so far has worked well.
0.840000	I have been given no reason not to trust her. She always has good advice and doesn't push pills as the fix for something.
1.000000	My doctor has never treated me without respect and has worked with me in the past years to help me stay healthy. Since I don't have any physical or mental conditions to deal with my annual checkup is normally without incident or problems.
0.560000	I believe doctors in general want money. I think they make stuff up to scare you.
0.440000	Most doctors have a patients best interest at heart but many have become nothing but car sales man that deal out drugs because of kickbacks and free samples
0.640000	My doctor is very knowledgeable but he sees many patients each day. I feel that he can make mistakes from time to time.
0.720000	I have had the same PCP for many years and we have an honest relationship.  I trust him to a certain extent only because he knows me and for the most part my habits and can best prescribe something for me if needed.
1.000000	I've been with my doctor a long time and he never sugarcoats anything he tells me. He is always honest about whatever aspect of my life is going to kill me. He's good.
1.000000	I completely trust my doctor. he is thorough and honest. he is caring and understanding. he has kept me healthy and happy for many years. I cannot imagine seeking health advice from anyone else.
0.600000	some dont have your best interest in mind. they just wanna give you drugs drugs and more drugs. i dont wanna be a sale. they need to do better to help these people
0.480000	sometimes he seems like he does not listen to me, he is kind of quirky and i call him spaceman. i tell him something and he goes on to the next subject like he did not hear what i said.
0.600000	i trust very few of my doctors... they just never seem to care enough to hear what is wrong with me so in turn i just stop going to the doctors because its a waste of money and time to go to a doctor that fails you then you lose the ambition to get get help because no one cares.... 
0.600000	I do not have total trust in my doctors because in my lifetime I have been misdiagnosed.  I question my doctors and will let them know if I disagree with them.  
0.240000	Over the years the doctors have done vary little to help with my disease other than take my money, give me medication that does nothing or makes me feel worse, or give me no hope at all. I have been able to do much more for myself than any doctor has
0.600000	My doctor tends to think clinically as opposed to holistic. That is, she would rather have take another drug rather than finding a solution that might be more healthy without side effects. 
0.600000	She does a good job in keeping up with my care and treatment. I feel comfortable in confiding in her with all my problems and medical needs.
0.800000	we have had a close realationship for the past 8 years and he spends the time nessecary to make sure i understand all my opitions when it comes to any problems i have and the treatments available for me
0.680000	I know my doctor knows more about me than I know about myself health wise. Some things I really dont feel comfortable speaking about with anyone. This is usually the case with the doctor, as I do trust what he/she will tell me but comfort isnt always there. Sometimes I get angry with my doctor as well when I hear things I dont want to hear. Especially when telling me to change certain habits I have had for years. I do also use the internet to self diagnose myself and certain sicknesses I get. Sometimes its really just a tossup on if I want to ask or not about something. 
0.600000	I think that overall I trust my doctor, but will verify for myself if there is anything that she says that I am suspicious of.
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough. She runs extensive tests when needed and rules out the worst possible scenario first. She takes time to talk with me, explain things and answer questions.
0.800000	I feel like she takes times with me and really tries to understand what is going on with me. She asks me a lot of questions. She never rushes me. She runs a lot of tests if necessary. If she can't find answers she refers me to someone else. 
0.960000	I trust my doctor because she makes me feel comfortable every time I go see her. She will listen to things that I say and don't judge me when I'm being honest.
0.800000	I have been going to my primary doctor for a lot of years and I have come to trust his judgement completely.  I feel he always has my best interests in mind and tells me what to expect.
0.440000	Doctors today spend too little time with each patient because they're in a rush to get to the next one. Doctors also hand out prescriptions for medications based on the added income they make for doing so. Its very difficult to rely on and trust the medical community anymore.
0.840000	they dont listen to what you try to tell them, when you try to tell them how you feel and what meds you need they dont wanna try to make you feel better
0.960000	My doctor is very conscientious.  He asks me a lot of questions to get to why I feel the way I do.  He is very empathetic.  
0.240000	My doctor is always looking at a computer and asking my thoughts on in. he has brought up his personal problems and comparing his problems to mine 
0.920000	She is very kind.  She is able and willing to answer any questions that I might have about my care.  She has never hesitated to tell me the truth about what is going on, and does it in a way that makes me feel as comfortable as possible.
0.800000	He always seems to care about my health. He takes time to explain and talk to me. 
0.800000	i do this with insane force. this month, can buy some steak for celebrate this victory. Perfect oportunity to see you.
0.600000	In general I do think that doctors act in the patient's interest and would at least put a good amount of stock in what they tell me.  But at the same time I have my reservations about total trust.  Especially the more serious the medical situation is, the more likely I would want other opinions.  But for routine things, I figure the doctor knows how to handle the situation.
0.240000	all doctors care about one thing, money. they don't care about you. to them, you are a bank and they want to drain you, even if you die.
0.880000	My doctor listens to me and spends a good amount of time with me instead of just rushing along the appointment. She always asks me if I have any questions and addresses every one of them if I do. When I call the office for a need, I always get assistance over the phone in a timely manner.
0.760000	I have one medical condition that is rare and doctors have no effective treatment. They generally pretend to have some awareness of the condition and offer me treatment I know if not effective.  Once in a while I will get a doctor who is honest and their lack of expertise with my disease.
0.960000	I trust my primary physician because I've seen him ever since I was an early teenager. He knows me very well and a lot of my habits both good and bad. He was critical in getting through high school and college with all the necessary vaccines and STD prevention tools, and has always been very open and engaging. It's almost like talking to an old friend where you feel like you can be yourself and open. This really helps in getting across to each other better, and allows him to more easily attune his prescriptions and medical diagnosis' to my situations. I think a lot of people tend to see their doctor as just a means to get medication when they need it, but I think a lot of people fail to realize just how beneficial it can be to have a doctor you trust and is willing to go that extra mile to help you.
0.720000	I trust mine because he seems he helps to keep me well and is very informative. He always gives me additional information about whatever is going on with me and more resources
0.520000	"My Doctor is extremely overbooked and is always trying to get me out of his office as soon as possible. He interrupts me constantly when I am trying to describe why I am there. He does not answer any questions I may have ""telling me to ask the nurse:."
0.800000	They are my doctor and I do not believe that they would intentionally cause any harm. My doctor has a family and he seems to really care about people. I have no reason to not trust my doctor. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that she takes her position seriously and tries her best to make thoughtful and accurate diagnosis's. 
1.000000	I have a lot in common with my Dr. She knows my limitations and spends the time I need with her to see that I understand what and why she is doing what she does.
0.840000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician because there is no confusion and I am comfortable all of the time. 
0.600000	I trust my doctors for the most part. I don't however completely trust medical science or drug manufacturers. Medical science just doesn't seem to have all the answers where many diseases are concerned and drug manufacturers seem to be more interested in profits than life.
0.600000	She was always distant and just focused on what she thought was the problem. She wasn't bad at all...just distant.
0.560000	I think it would be foolish to completely trust a primary care physician. They are humans and make mistakes like the rest of us. If it's something important I will want a second opinion.
0.480000	I've only recently started seeing her. I had an issue wrong and I feel like instead of truly trying to figure out what was wrong , she just sent me out for any test she felt could possibly solve it for her. Then when the tests didn't work, she was quickly done with me and wanted to refer me out. She has also put me on some questioble medications for this without explaining fully the side effects or that I could have a bad reaction to one of them.
0.400000	I don't really have a lot of trust in the medical decisions of doctors. There is almost always pressure to diagnose and get the next patient in as quickly as possible. If I had serious concerns that I wasn't sure of I would get a second opinion. Just a few days ago I read about a women who was told her breast cancer was only cysts and the cancer spread throughout her body in the year after her diagnosis, and she wishes she had got a second opinion. The cancer is termil for her and she is only in her early 30's. 
1.000000	i trust my doctor because she know what is right for me and know what is not right for me and tell me thing i know to know
0.600000	I think in medicine, having some room for reservations is good, and second opinions are good as well. I think after taking classes with some of the next generations med students...makes me question them as well. They are people just like me. 
0.240000	Most physicians are time constrained, they do not believe in altertive medicine nor ways to treat problems, they want to prescribe a pill and have you out the door so they can make more money by seeing more patients. 
0.680000	My doctor seems always pressed for time everytime I go there. He rushes me in/out without really talking in depth. But he seems to know what he's doing, so I sort of trust him. I will speak up next time it bothers me.
0.840000	I have a relatively young doctor, who is usually very thorough, and very plain-spoken. I respect and appreciate these qualities, and he's never given me reason to doubt him.
0.440000	I think doctors are more interested in making money through prescriptions than the well being of their patients. They often are too quick to prescribe medication with bad side effects, or are uninformed about what would be best for the patient. Sometimes they prescribe medication that would react badly with other medication that the person is taking. Because of this I have to take what they say with a grain of salt. It's better safe than sorry so I trust myself first. Plus doctors might forget some of what they learned in school.  I saw one of my doctors looking up the answer to their question online
0.800000	I have been seeing same doctor for many years so I trust her with all my medical issues. She has never let me down
1.000000	I like my Dr he's between on this ride with me for8 years,  he was there from day one.  He's had been great he's never in a rush nor in a hurry to leave.  He listens to what I have to say
0.840000	she knoiws what good for me to keep my alive I think she is a good dr. I don't know what else to say that I really like my dr.
0.440000	Doctors seem more concerned with liability than they do in treatment.  The medical profession has become process based instead of treatment based.  These large medical organizations are nothing but a pass through to create profit and limit liability. 
0.640000	I can trust and distrust a doctor depends on the what they say to you when you ask them a question that concern your health in a long run 
0.560000	I trust my doctor because its his job to know how to treat his patients but i think he could be more thorough and listen more.
0.960000	Trust but verify, using the popular vercular: Never buy a pig in a poke!
0.920000	I believe they are legally required to tell the truth, based on the information they are given. If I truly didn't trust the doctor on something I would go to another doctor and see if they have the same conclusion.
0.600000	It can be hard to trust physician due to financial incentives they may or may not have. I often wonder if physicians have to do so many procedures, write so many prescriptions, etc. just to stay a float. 
0.960000	I have been seeing my PCP for years and with my complex medical history they have always been very good about discussing my options and letting me decide.
0.600000	Most of my interactions with my primary care physician are straight forward. I mainly interact with him for general check ups so as long as nothing is wrong most of what I hear from him is that everything is good.
0.400000	It is not that I mistrust my doctor but I do need let him make all my decisions for me.   If they prescribe me a medication I research it thoroughly before I decide to take it or not.    I am more in favor of hollistic medicine so I always look for a natural way to help my problem.   Medical doctors only want to give you more pills and I am afraid of the side effects so sometimes I do not take them and seek   a natural way of treating my problem
0.880000	I trusty primary care physician because I have been with my Dr for over 3 years, and he's been my family Dr for yerar
0.560000	I feel like a lot of the time the doctor is just more interested in getting out of the room as quickly as possible. Anytime a question is asked, there is a quick, rushed response as if the question was annoying. Sometimes I even ask for addition tests and they are disregarded as not needed even though there have been times when the additiol test would have helped healing faster and was later proven to be so.
0.720000	I generally trust my primary care physicians. However, I've had recent experiences where the judgment was wrong and it's since made me somewhat skeptical. Two doctors prescribed an antibiotic that wasn't the right choice for treating an infection that almost led to serious consequences. I ended getting advice on a different medicine from family friends that ultimately led to a change in medication. While that experience has made me a little skeptical, I still generally trust doctors and think they have my best interests at heart.
0.800000	I have been knowing him for a long time.  I know how he works.  He has good online reviews.  He is a good listener.
0.840000	I trust my physician because they always give me the best treatment options. I can always trust my primary care physician to select the right treatment for me. More importantly, I can trust my physician not to do the wrong things.
0.320000	I have repeatedly had issues (not serious) that were not helped by my doctor. I ended up figuring out what would help me, and I got better using alternative or holistic things that completely cleared the issue. I have also been repeatedly prescribed medicine that had severe side effects or addictive qualities, and was not told about it. Because I read - a LOT - I declined to take the meds because of this.
0.800000	It has taken me several years to develop positive relationships with all my physicians.  If a doctor does not meet my needs I look for someone who is a better fit.
0.600000	i don't trust anyone fully but that doesn't mean i automatically distrust them either..........................
0.720000	I just switched my primary care doc after over 20 years so I really don't know her all that well.  It isn't that I don't trust her; she's just new to me.  Being a nurse, I do have doctors that I work with that I trust and will ask their opinion on something from time to time.
1.000000	I have been seeing my doctor for 6 years and she has always gone above and beyond for me as a patient, whether it be helping improve my illness or offering advice on other matters. Not to mention that my health has undergone tremendous improvement
0.600000	my nervious are primary reason why im like that tho, in test and quizz is were im more nervious and nonpasient, and I try to get som help 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because she has shown me, over the years, that she has my best interest at heart. She listens to me and my concerns and together we come up with a plan to take care of whatever problem I am experiencing at that time.
0.720000	I like him and have known him for 30 years. Not sure I trust him completely but he's pretty good. Needs to spend more than 10 mins. with each person...
0.920000	I have been seeing the same doctor for 13 years, we have the same medical condition so we have a great repore.
1.000000	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY PCP. HE IS YOUNG, TRUSTWORTHY, FRIENDLY, PROFESSIONAL AND HAS A GREAT BEDSIDE MANNER. I RECOMMEND HIM HIGHLY AND HAVE NEVER HAD A COMPLAINT. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HIM AND WILL NOT CHANGE PCP'S. 
1.000000	My doctor is the bomb he listens to my and my needs. I trust him with my care. He is firm but kind and ice been seeing him for seven years.
0.720000	yes i love my primary care physician and my insurance through my company it helps keep my health together
0.520000	I go in his office and he asks me how I am doing and looks at the lap top to see what is going on and says a few words and then says I will see you in 6 months. I keep him just for my medications.
0.680000	I usually ask what I already know so there is nothing much to discuss.
0.920000	I know that my doctor wants to do all he can to make me well.  He gives me options for natural medicine and regular medicine. I know he is a Christian and that also makes me feel better about my care.
0.800000	I trust them as I have had them since I was about 7 years old and know them very very well. They are more like family at this point, for me. .I am grateful for this as they are a good person and very helpful to me. 
0.920000	My primary care physician has been honest and helpful in my decisions regarding my health.  Even though my last blood work showed I was nearing a diabetic level, I was very concerned that she wanted to put me on Metformin.  I chose not to add this medicine into my body and wanted to change my diet instead.  She approved my decision and suggested that we re-do the blood work in 3 months.  I am getting ready to make my 3 month appointment for Monday.
0.960000	I have a long relationship with my doctor.  I have every confidence in her ability to research and diagnose conditions.  She is a very respected and knowledgeable phycisian
0.800000	I sometimes research my doctor's suggestion.  It seems like when I do, I ask him more questions.  I do not disagree with him very much.
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because she's thorough and takes the time to talk to me about my health. I feel like she cares about my physical and emotional well being. I can talk to her about anything pertaining to my health.
0.840000	The doctor I see most often is actually not my primary care doctor. I trust him because he listens to me. I feel like he understands what I'm saying. We make decisions together. It's not like he's telling me what I have to do. So I guess I feel like we collaborate. I'm the one who knows about me, and he's the one who knows about treatments.

0.760000	"i trust most doctors, it depends on how they 'deal"" with me. As long as theyre willing to answer questions and not rush you out."
0.760000	Generally, I tend to trust my doctors' treat and their recommendations.  Since I have not been in severe health condition in the past, I didn't think seriously about doctors' advice because I mostly respect their treatment and recommendation.  I think most doctors should be reliable and trustworthy in giving best treatment and recommendation for their patients.
0.800000	My doctor always takes the time tot talk to me.  I never feel rushed.  She will take all the time necessary.  She will answer any questions that I have very thoroughly.  Over time, she has won my trust by doing right by me.

1.000000	I have no reason to distrust him.  I have had nothing but positive experiences with my doctor so far.  He listens to what I say and vice versa. 
0.320000	I do not always have trust in my doctor because they always try to prescribe me medications for every problem that I have. I think that if they took the time to listen to me and understand my symptoms then I would achieve more of my therapeutic goals rather than having to try new medications every few weeks. 
1.000000	She has been my doctor for years. She is older and has been a doctor for years. I basically like how she conducts an examination. 
0.480000	Doctors are only in business because people are or think they are sick. You go to them for one thing & immediately they want to send you for testing to see if they can find something wrong. I feel if it isn't broke don't try to fix it. There is a lot of truth in the statement what you don't know won't hurt you. Some people make themselves sick because they worry what if.

0.680000	I don't really have a primary care physician, I have been uninsured for many years. I try to put my trust in any doctor that is willing to see me on a self-pay, emergency basis. That is reality, and those are my choices in that reality.

0.680000	I think my doctor is generally trustworthy.  I wonder sometimes with the things he says if he is pushing me to get on drugs because he wants to write RX for those types of drugs.
0.240000	when i told her i had a cardiac problem she said i didnt. i ended up in the hospital for a cardiac ablation. she was told by my mental health doctor to check my thyroid, she didnt. when the cardiac ablation was done and bloodwork by the hospital they told me i had a thyroid problem.
0.600000	as we know little about the health concerns we have no other choice than believing doctor as we can't take risk with our life
0.760000	My doctor is highly trained and highly regarded in the community.  I am comfortable with him and my treatment plans and therefore trust him.  He is highly rated.
0.720000	For the most part doctors seem to want to help but they don't all have the time to spend with you to really figure out what is wrong. They usually go with the easiest course of action, which I understand is commonly the correct one. But, I cant tell you how many times people have had to go back multiple times just because the treatment they were given was for something they didn't have.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because I truly believe she has my best interests at heart. We spent a long time my last visit just taking through all my options and making sure I truly understood what was going on. 
0.560000	In general most practitioners do a good job, some spend more time with you and some it's different each time you visit. Some make you feel like they are guessing while others give you assurance they know exactly what to do. 
1.000000	He is straight to the point,knows his business, asks questions gives feedback without a whole lot of thinking.  
0.960000	These people have gone to years and years of schooling to get into their position. They just want o do what's best for the patient and don't want to risk their job for anything.
1.000000	I trust my doctor implicitly, because I have been going to him for many years, and he always has my best interests at heart.
0.680000	I've been through many doctors and can understand that some are to be trusted less since they may diagnose you with something that nets them alot of money if you dont understand your own issue. Sometimes you may be a test subject for a new disease that makes alot of money for them and you have to go through a lot of bullshit just because you dont know whats wrong. I trust my primary care physician quite a bit since its more of a help me help you situation, but generally they're still a second opinion.
0.920000	I have had a good relationship with him in the past. I feel like he would tell me the truth about any potential diagnosis. He has given me reason to believe that he would not falsely lead me on with some diagnosis or other.
0.240000	"The doctor I was seeing was not good at discussing things of importance with me.  Apparently he had too many patients because he left to go be an ""Amway"" doc.  I lost faith in him when I was literally dying and too stupid to realize it one time.  My throat was infected and slowing closing off my air.  I called for an appt on a Monday knowing he was in the office to do paperwork.  Would he see me?  No, he wouldn't.  I didn't think he would because for some reason Monday's are sacred to him.  I saw a perfectly competent doctor who referred me to someone else, a specialist.  But I never saw my doctor and I've always resented that a bit.  I literally was very ill and he could have at least popped his head into the door.  I lost a lot of faith in him after that."
0.840000	Well they are there to help you, no reason to lie or trick people unless they have a horrible agenda under their belt to hurt some one. but I trust them very much because they have helped me. Now I wont go to a doctor the doesn't seem to care how I feel or treat me with respect.
0.800000	my primary doctor has been working with me for a few years and he is one of the best doctors i've ever had.  he is soft spoken, tells the truth but in a polite way, is an excellent listener, and has a pleasant attitude.  i have no reason not to distrust him; he hasn't lead me in the wrong direction yet.
0.400000	I mentioned my extreme anxiety and how i just couldn't relax no matter what I tried. She told me that I just needed to walk out in the sun everyday and completely cut out caffeine and I'll be cured. She did blood work for my hypothyroidism and did a cholesterol test with it. The test came back I had high cholesterol and she put me on a medication they just called into the pharmacy and she didn't talk to me about anything. Just told me to take the pill.
0.880000	Most of the time I feel like I can trust my doctor. He obviously knows more about health than I do. I don't think he would steer my care in the wrong direction, and it never seems like he is trying to push some unneeded treatment on me for something silly (i.e. restless leg syndrome or something like that) that would make me think he is being paid a commission by pharmaceuticals.
0.840000	Generally I always trust people. My doctor cares for me. So I always trust him.
0.800000	"I feel like there are no such things are ""untrustworthy"" doctors. You can't be one, simple as day. Your doctor is only there to help you."
0.440000	I personally have had bad experiences with doctors, NPs not listening to what I am telling them. Doctors are constrained by a broken healthcare system, insurance system, so they cannot spend the time with patients, even if they have good intentions. the federal gov. is meddling in the doctor/patient relationship. 
0.600000	I trust my doctor for the most part, but sometimes feel he takes the easy way by throwing medication at me even if it has a warning attach to it. 
0.880000	I have been going to my Primary Care doctor for a few years.  Any concerns I have brought up she has addressed honestly, but in a caring and comforting way.  I am not talked down to and I am often presented with information and options. 
0.760000	Overall I trust the doctors I have see.  However, the last time I made a Dr's appt. the office scheduled me with  a PA, I did not like this because no one told me I wasn't seeing an MD,  therefore at this practice I they were not being truthful or honest with me, and will not be using this practice again. This did cause me to distrust them.
0.600000	I  LIKED THE PRIMARY ATTENTION OF MY DOCTOR BECAUSE IS GOD, THE INFORMATION THE HE LET ME KNOW IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND
0.880000	I trust my physician because she takes the time to explain potential problems and my own research has given me no reason to distrust her information.
0.720000	I trust that my doctor has my best interests at heart. I have often had many questions and my doctor always had time to answer them and give me as many options as I needed to make health decisions.
0.800000	My family and I have been with the practice for a long time. The experience is always comfortable and open and honest.
0.800000	My doctor is amazing.  When I have had a medical condition, everything was done to get me to the correct specialists to make sure it was taken care of.  My doctor even called me after the appointments to follow up.
0.720000	Because you have to treat someone very carefully, like when you treat your own kid with a sinus infection.
0.640000	My primary physician has been a physician in my family for a long time. I completely trust that the reason he has been was because my family trusts him. 
0.720000	I tend to trust those that have done no wrong to me and act in my best interest which is why I trust my physician.
0.560000	I do not have complete trust  or distrust for doctors but I feel most are more about making a buck than they are about caring for their patients.
0.440000	Even though I have been going for at least 4 years, he often mistakes details about my conditions.  Also there is a language barrier communication problem.  He often prescribes medications which I find out later are harmful to take given some of my other conditions.  Unfortutely he is one of the only providers of my insurance carrier within my local area. Some of the problems I try to fix by writing out questions.  All in all, he will correct mistakes when I point them out.
0.800000	My doctor has years of training and real live experiences.  He know more about my medical issues than I do
0.880000	I trust in doctors because they generally have my best interests in mind and consider all the options available.
0.720000	My primary care physician wasn't honest in a medical report over a small issue which causes a patient to mistrust!
0.760000	"I trust him because he seems genuine in what he says and seems like he truly cares about my wellbeing. However, I can't say that I trust him ""completely"" because I have a bit of distrust in medical professionals and the healthcare industry in general."
0.800000	I have always had very good doctors and fully trust there opinions. Both of my parents are doctors and I think that influences my opinions of doctors. I trust my parents so I trust other doctors too. I have never had reason to not trust my doctors.
