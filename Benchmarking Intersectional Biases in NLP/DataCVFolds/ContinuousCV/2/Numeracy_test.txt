Being in the field of psychology and having had to take classes centering around what I was feeling really helped to put certain things into perspective. For example, when my counselor asked if I knew about a certain type of treatment that she wanted me to try, more often than not I would say yes because I had to study it at school. Knowing about things like that helped me to understand what she would discuss with me and helped her to put things into a frame of perspective for me.

I knew that I needed to go to the physician and get a hormone replacement therapy if I was going to start feeling more normal.  I went to a gynecologist since they are more equipped in handling this type of problem.

I also knew I needed a supplement with not only estrogen but progesterone.  So I was sure to notice the physician gave me the right prescription.

0.785714	As stated in the letter of intent, the NHMFL offers the capability to measure actinide materials under unique conditions. Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile samples m.

0.928600	A few years ago, a nurse practitioner prescribed buspirone for my anxiety. I reminded him that psychiatric drugs in general tend to affect me much more strongly than they do most people, and suggested that I should start at the lowest dose possible. He wrote the prescription for the second lowest dose available. When I got home with the medication, I broke the tablets into quarters for the first week, then into halves for the next week. I didn't have any adverse effects, but did not really see any positive effects either, so on the third week, I took whole tablets as prescribed. I got very useated, extremely dizzy, and found it nearly impossible to stay awake. I continued at the recommended dose, thinking that maybe these were side effects that would wear off with time, but they persisted. I tried to reach the nurse practitioner, but he was on vacation and I didn't feel comfortable discussing it with anyone else in the office, so I went online and looked up information about the medication. I learned that what I was experiencing were symptoms of a severe overdose of the medication. Going to an emergency room was recommended, but I felt certain that no one would listen to me if I tried to explain my drug sensitivity and that they'd probably think I took some illegal drug. I'm aware that some psychiatric drugs recommend tapering off rather than stopping abruptly, so I looked for this information online and found that while it's not recommended to stop abruptly, in some situations it may be necessary. I decided that this was one of those situations, so I stopped taking the medication. The symptoms decreased appreciably within several hours, and though there was some lingering dizziness, everything else was more or less back to normal within a few days.

At the time I the cost to have it treated was well beyond my means as I was between jobs and my co-pay was infeasible. Luckly I knew to process of dealing with such an infection was to remove the core from the boil, disinfect the wound, place a drain, then cover it up and request some antibiotics.  I was able to lance the boil and do all the treatment work (I have a very high tolerance for pain) and requested my doctor prescribe some antibiotics.  When I arrived at the office he examined the treated wound and told me he was impressed I was able to do that myself and that it looked as good as the work he would have done.  He did suggest I let a professional do it next time as I could have hurt myself but still I managed to treat it myself.

After inhalers and steroids didn't help, we thought it might be heartburn, as I've had history of acid reflux and stomach issues. So after being on prilosec for a bit, I noticed I still had the burning in my chest. It was then I noticed that it occurred when my heartrate went up.

The nurse wasn't happy about that but I assured her I wasn't trying to cause trouble I just wanted to find out what was wrong with my mother. After looking at her chart I realized she had been given too much of one of her medicines. There was an error by doctor or hospital in what she actually took. I immediately called pharmacy spoke to pharmacist, explained what had happen and had him look up what to expect. It wasn't an amount that would cause any damage, just make her feel bad for awhile. I had to take control as all the nurse seemed concerned about was who's fault it was. I explained to her...mistakes happen..we're human but when you make one or one is made you try to correct it asap.
0.857100	I had a knowledge of health issues when I saw a spot on my mom's hand. I knew the ABCD method of detecting skin cancer, so I told my mom she should get to a doctor because it fit all the criteria. Sure enough, the doctor said that it was skin cancer after he performed a biopsy and she had surgery to remove it.

0.857100	I found a lump in my testicle and went to a doctor.  He had it scanned and while we waited for results I did some research.

0.857100	I was talking to my mom about Dold Trump's mental issues. I told her about his rcissistic persolity disorder and possible dementia. I think I read he was a textbook case of it.
0.714300	My family has a long history of medical issues, primarily autoimmune diseases. It has been imperative we stay as healthy as possible as many doctors are not knowledgeable in this field. Treatment is typically left to us and in several cases had better medical knowledge been obtained, lives would have been extended. One family member was lost due to a medical mistake, another to incorrect diagnoses, and another has had quality of life severely impaired because of incorrect diagnoses. I struggle with my own health and have two children with a complex medical history. I have also become the primary caregiver to my mother who is now severely impaired. If I am not fully aware and knowledgeable then the risks are simply too great. It's worth it to me to learn and understand all that I possibly can.

1.000000	Not sure if this is what you are looking for but true story. A few years ago I experienced severe pain in my feet that lasted for weeks. I looked up the symptoms and was reasobly sure it was something called plantar fasciitis (sp?). It HURT. I went to my doctor and he agreed with my assessment. Unfortutely there doesn't seem to be an effective treatment other than stretching and not walking (or walking as little as possible) for many months to allow the muscles in the foot to heal. Near the end of the appointment my doctor offered me a shot of cortisone for the pain. I was surprised and promptly refused. The problem with the cortisone shot, in my opinion, is that it simply masks the pain and might lead me to overdo it during a time when I needed to rest, thus making the injury worse instead of better. It took over a year for the problem to go away. Even though I suffered through the pain I feel I made the right choice because the cortisone shot might have made the recovery last even longer!

0.428571	I was told I may need an angioplasty procedure for Coronary Artery Disease.  The ballooning procedure would allow a stent to be deposited. It is left behind to keep the vessel open.  Even for the positive affects, there can be life threatening results.  Stenosis can re-occur.  You also need blood thinners for the rest of your life, which also has adverse affects.  I am choosing at this time to do all of the health and exercise changes and be checked along the way. 
0.571400	My son experienced aversions at a very young age to many fabrics, and other sensory experiences. After the years of doctor visits to neorologists for so many of my own neurological problems I was able to see correlating patterns between he and I. I was able to get him seen by a developmental pediatrician much sooner than I would have were I unexperienced in such matters. I consequently obtained a diagnosis that allowed me to request specialized services at school at the earliest possible grade.

0.428571	"This whole survey hurt my brain I can't take anymore. Algebra ahh Here's some random crap off the internet Medicine (British English Listeni/ËmÉdsáµ»n/; American English Listeni/ËmÉdáµ»sáµ»n/) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.[1][2] The word ""medicine"" is derived from Latin medicus, meaning ""a physician"".[3][4] Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.[5] Medicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is ""variable and inconsistent"" for any condition,[6] but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.[7] In contrast, treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery."

0.857100	Apologies in advance if this isn't exactly the type of experience that you're looking for, but it's the only thing that I can think of that somewhat relates. Whenever I run across something that I don't know about (especially a health issue), I typically try to do as much research on it as I can. As mentioned before, I suffer from IBS. I tried to do what research that I could on my own, but I eventually had to cave and go to the doctor when it didn't seem to get any better (it's a good thing that I did, because I likely also had a stomach ulcer). Anyway, fast forward about half a year later, and it seems that my IBS is getting worse and my medicine doesn't seem to be helping that much. I go to the doctor again to get a different medicine, which also doesn't seem to be doing much good. In the meantime, I've been keeping a food journal and doing more research on my own. After a couple of months of pain, I figure out the problem--I've developed fructose malabsorption. After cutting out soda and other things high in fructose, the problem is as fixed as it can be.

0.357143	Relating effectively with patients is among the most valued skills of clinical care. As a beginning clinician, you will focus your energies on gathering information. At the same time, by using techniques that promote trust and convey respect, you will allow the patientâs story to unfold in its most full and detailed form. Establishing a supportive interaction helps the patient feel more at ease when sharing information and itself becomes the foundation for therapeutic clinicianâpatient relationships. 4 Because illness can make patients feel discouraged and isolated, âA feeling of connectedness with the doctor, of being deeply heard and understood, reduces this feeling of isolation and despair. This feeling is the very heart of healing

I decided not to have the surgery and found a doctor who agreed to take a slow approach to healing my broken arm.  I spent nearly a year in various casts and my arm healed on it's own, with full range of motion.

0.790000	I think the most memorable experience I can think of is when I started experiencing acute pain in my general groin area & started frantically googling the symptoms, prior to going to an emergency room, which were actually very hard to narrow down. Through a process of elimination, I was able to determine I was suffering from acute epididymitis, which the ER doctor was actually very reluctant to diagnose given that I did not fit into the typical risk group/rarity of occurrence, but that is indeed ultimately what it was.

Because of my knowledge, I was concerned that she may be at risk for stroke and her blood pressure was very high. I retook her blood pressure because if you get an abnormal reading, you should always recheck under the same circumstance. She had a headache also, so after rechecking her blood pressure was still around 170 systolic. I told her that we need to go to the ER because I was concerned about how high her BP is and her risk of stroke. She also smokes cigarettes, so her risk is increased. Her symptoms could have been dangerous and the abnormal visual hallucinations could have been aura for an oncoming migraine, but I didn't want to take any chances. I took her to the ER. She ended up being fine.
