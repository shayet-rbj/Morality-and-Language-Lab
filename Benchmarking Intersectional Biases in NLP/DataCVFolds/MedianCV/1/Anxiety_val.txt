1	I always worry that the doctor I'm seeing won't be attentive to my needs. I have encountered several doctors that seem to have a script that they recite, no matter what ailment I'm being seen for. I worry that the visit will not accomplish anything, and it makes me feel quite helpless.

1	i'm always worried i'll hear the worse. something wrong with me or my health is in jeopardy. doctor's office makes me nervous in general.
-1	I have had health concerns in the past and I worry about things that may come up again when I go to see the doctor.  Since I do not know what he is going to tell me, I naturally am anxious about what I am about to hear.  Those who say they are not anxious are either lying, or just ignorant about what can happen to peope as they get older.  I work in a profession that has a lot of people having health issues and these concerns travel with me when I go in to see the doctor as well.
1	I don't know what to expect when I visit the doctors office... anything can happen and be unexpected... you don't want to expect the worst

1	The general sense of invasion that examition brings, the thought of future discomfort or pain or inconvenience or tragedy, all waiting for me in that little room.
1	Of what they might tell me or how bad my pain is. But it is still better to go than to risk your chance of dying
1	That a test will turn up something (I've had 2 different types of cancer). I have had more than my share of being told I need surgery and being quite frightened by the diagnosis so those feelings from those times tend to crop up.
1	It seems that there is always no progress to my condition even though I religiously follow his advice.

-1	I feel anxious because after the exam you don't know if the Dr. is going to tell you that something is wrong.
1	I am always worried that a doctor will find something wrong that I never knew existed, like cancer or a sexually transmitted disease.  I fear the worst news.
1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctors office.  This is not something that applies to me.
-1	I NEVER FEEL ANXIOUS OR WORRIED. I HAVE WORKED MANAGING MY HEALTH WITH MY DOCTOR FOR YEARS, I GET REGULAR CHECK-UPS AND TESTING, I EAT RIGHT AND I EXERCISE REGULARY, SO IF SOMETHING DID OR IN THE FUTURE DOES COME UP ON AN EXAM, I KNOW THAT I WOULD BE CATCHING IT EARLY.
-1	I just always wonder if he will find something wrong that I don't know about. Maybe something has changed in my bloodwork that I need to take care of

-1	I always feel anxious because i think he might find something wrong that cannot be easily fixed, or that is chronic.

1	I just feel like it's a waste of medical insurance dollars -- you don't get well and the sick get sicker
-1	I think the things that make me feel anxious or worried is the doctor coming back saying something is wrong with my health. I also gets a little worried when he's going over test results and finding out I'm not doing recommended suggestions like exercise or eat righg. I worried that im gonna get fussed at by my doctor for being hard headed.
-1	It's the uncertainty of it all that's nerve-wracking. You second-guess yourself and maybe something is wrong and maybe you lose sight of the truth and start to fear random things.
-1	Sometimes when I don't know what is going on and I think it could be two or three different things. I get anxious wanting to know what it is and what I might or might not have done to cause it.

-1	That she will find something that is not good or do something that is uncomfortable that I'm not expecting
-1	The feedback that I will get I fear will not be a joyful one. And also going to the doctors is scary because one moment you think you are fine and you go see the doctor and they have found something scary.
1	That they'll think I'm lying about how I feel and that they'll  just think I want drugs even though I really just want a doctor to be receptive to my needs
1	I most feel anxious and worried that I wouldn't get the right diagnosis. Sometimes, my problems are ignored and the doctor usually wants to tell me what's wrong with me, instead of me telling her what's wrong with me.
-1	I just worry sometimes that they might find something that I already didn't know about.  I don't like to be surprised usually.  Especially when it comes to my own body and health.
1	Because they take tests and the waiting in the room while the Dr. is on the way can be worrisome because it could go really well or really bad. Its the anticipation and unknowing that can make one feel anxious.
-1	If I have something wrong with me and I can't pinpoint exactly what it is I get a little bit worried, since it might be something serious.  I always get restless when I'm waiting to hear the information that the doctor will tell me. 
1	I'm worried that they will find something wrong with me. I hold my breath until they tell me everything is okay.
1	Just hearing or getting back the results from tests or seeing what I've read or seen is true.  Guessing that the worst may come true from what the doctor says.
1	Just whatever is going to be found. I've had a bad medical history lately and it always seems like I'm going to have some huge medical problem.
-1	Occasionally, I feel anxious at the doctor's office. I feel like I am in a vulnerable position and I do not know if something will be wrong with me that I did not know about before.
-1	I get most anxious about the bill I receive after the visit. 
1	If I go to a doctor then there is definitely something wrong.  I do not regularly go to the doctors but when I do then I worry about how serious it may be.
-1	About the only thing that makes me anxious or worried is when they take my blood pressure. It always tests high for some reason and is disturbing to both the doctor and I. I do get a little anxious being around all of the germs hanging around the waiting room.
-1	I get worried about the what the doctor has to tell me about my health. I'm afraid of what they will find. I'm also afraid of the needles.
1	I am pretty much constantly in pain or having some symptom or another, but I do not like to bring this up, even to the doctor. It was not looked well upon by my family growing up. You just toughed your way through things without whining. I would be worried that I would bring up a concern and it would not have any real medical basis and I would feel like I was complaining about nothing. 
1	I feel a little afraid that the doctor will find something wrong with me tat i didnt even know about yet. As i get older i know parts of my body will not function correctly and im anticipating that on a visit
1	I get anxious about what medical conditions that the doctor might discover and the treatments that might be suggested.
1	The fact that they could say anything. Anything could be wrong with me, or happen to me, or need to be done to me. She could ruin my life in one checkup if something is wrong with me.
-1	When the pain becomes unbearable and I cannot manage any longer I fear all I will get is bad news, also doctor visit co pays are costly and I can't always afford to see the doctor even though I have health insurance
-1	In my primary care physician office when they are doing any examination that will not make me anxious or worried or created any fear to me because these are only good to help me.
-1	that to find out that my health has gotten worse like lung cancer that i had last year the right lung which i was not using because of my COPD and now my left lung has a spot on it
1	Using my recent visit, I worry about the cost of the visit itself, the work they want done, and anything else (kind of like a lawyer's fees for responding to emails, or making phone calls) that needs to be done. That is number one. Number two, is just being told there might be things wrong with you when you feel like you are pretty good. It creates a psychological tendency to worry about the issue, potentiating the extremity of the issue.
-1	NOthing.  I really dont require a lot of personal space or require any privacy as far as my body is concerned so I really don't care what she needs to do.  I'm also super healthy so I'm never ther for anything too crazy
1	I worry about getting really bad news one day. I worry the doctor will find some condition or disease that has cause irreversible damage.
1	I don't like the idea of taking medical tests. I always expect the worst and always thing that my blood work or other related tests will come back bad or that I will be diagnosed with something really bad. I also do not like the very sterile and fluorescent lit environment that Dr offices are in. 
-1	nothing without any reason sometimes i will get anxious but sometimes there will be some reason with of my job related work
-1	I am most anxious when there's a time that the doctor takes a long time giving me a diagnosis of my condition one time, for some reason it made me very worried and fortunately, the results were not bad compared to what I was imagining.
1	It's like preparing for battle with lots of prepared questions, questions produced hostility, and then it can get nasty. So I keep smiling and sounding like Mary Poppins. 
1	I'm worried that he may find some serious condition that requires either expensive tests or expensive medications.
-1	That I won't really get a solution.  He defers me to specialists.  He talks more about politics than about my health.
-1	ALWAYS WORRIED THAT THEY MAY FIND SOMETHING THAT IS SERIOUSLY WRONG THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED.YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT FEAR BUT I THINK THAT IS NATURAL.
1	I am usually nervous about what they will tell me that I have.  The last thing you want to hear when you see the doctor about having headaches is that you have brain cancer.  I seem to always think the worst.
1	I feel like everyone nowadays ends up with cancer or some other huge disease, even when symptoms aren't present. I am generally very healthy, but I do worry about the doctor finding something abnormal that may not have presented symptoms. I like to be in control and have a fear of the unknown. 
1	I am afraid they will discover something about my health that will be negative, about which I was previously unaware.  Sometimes, I worry they will suggest preventative measures such as immunizations, with which I am not 100% comfortable.  However, in my experience, most doctors I have encountered are quite accommodating to different approaches (mine is more wholistic) to health, as long as they are working/workable.
1	It's the feeling of not knowing exactly what is wrong with you and the Doctor asking a lot of questions, sometimes personal questions.  I know my Doctor must ask but it is still uncomfortable to answer.
-1	What makes me anxious about the doctors office is more so when they make you wait and wait in the examining room to see the doctor.  It's the physical atmosphere of the sterile environment that gets to me if I have to sit in that little room too long.  I'm not anxious about actually seeing the doctor because he is familiar to me and I trust him completely.  It's the equipment and the environment I don't like.
1	diagnosing me with problems i don't have. giving me the wrong drugs to take. having really bad side effects from the pill im taking
-1	I think just being in the doctors office it seems to raise my blood pressure that doesn't rise when taken in the dental office or when I give blood donations.  
-1	Often I feel nothing is being done for my diagnosis. Sometimes new medicine is introduced. Yet the medicine rarely helps. 
1	I don't like instruments and tools used for assessing patient conditions. Doctors offices and hospitals seem to sterile.
1	There is always sense of anxiety when you go the doctor. You might feel healthy and fine, and then the doctor  might find something. It happened to me a few times, when I went to the doctor. So, there always there sense of uneasiness. Just my 2 cents. 
1	Thinking that you have some major disease. 
1	You just never know what they may tell you by the end of your doctors  visit and it just makes me nervous
1	What they might have to say more about my diagnosis and other unsuspecting news.  Also, all the waiting around that goes with it.
1	I HAVE AN INTENSE FEAR OF DOCTORS, HOSPITALS ETC. THIS COMES FROM HAVING HAD POLIO WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD. I SPENT FOUR MONTHS IN HOSPITAL AND  
-1	i feel anxious or worried what the outcome of the visit may be and if there will be anything serious to consider, the length of time to take care of it and the cost.
-1	I don't want to hear any bad news. I am also worried about how much it is going to cost for all of my services.
1	Feeling anxious or worried about doctor's visits stems from the uncertainty of the entire experience. Not knowing if something is seriously wrong or even if your doctor will diagnose correctly.
1	I always feel anxious. I never know what is going to show up on the tests. I have several things wrong with me. What's gonna show up this time
1	I worry about the length of time I might have to wait until the doctor is ready to see me.  Then I worry about is there something else wrong with me.
1	Even when it is irrational, I fear that a doctor will tell me I have some illness I had never considered before. 
-1	I'm usually in the doctor's office when I'm not feeling well. The thought of having something life threatening or harmful to other puts me on edge. Thus making me anxious and worried about the outcome.
-1	When I go to the doctor's office for something serious - that isn't just a regular checkup - I'm more worried about what's wrong with me than what the doctor's gon do to me. I know my doctors aren't going to do anything weird, or try to make me take any weird medicine that doesn't actually work so that I'll just keep coming back to them. I feel like I can actually trust my doctors, even though I understand that not everyone feels that way with their own doctors.
1	I'm usually worried or anxious about what my diagnosis will be. I'm also on medications daily, so I'm always concerned they might change or alter my meds which does affect my everyday life 
-1	I usually don't feel anxious at the doctor. But sometimes I feel anxious at the doctor with my kids, I just want them to be healthy and I get nervous if something is wrong.
-1	I would only feel anxious or worried about visiting the doctor's if I thought I had something serious wrong with me. If I thought I had a serious disease or a potentially embarrassing disease, then I would be worried. 
1	If it is a routine office visit I'll likely not be anxious or worried since I don't anticipate any unpleasant surprises. If the appointment is due to a new or on-going problem I'm most worried about whether or not there is an easy solution to this particular health issue.

1	When I have a medical problem that I cannot identify the cause, or a recurrence of a problem that I know portends a negative prognosis, I become anxious.
1	"I'm pretty typical in the fear of ""something being wrong"". I also have history of anxiety including previous family members."
1	Sometimes I feel like I'm not where I should be weight wise. I am a shy and modest person for the most part and having a physical exam makes me nervous.  I also am worried he will find something that I had no idea was an issue with my health.
-1	White coat syndrome. Usually when I attend the doctor it's something I've decided isn't going away by itself (common cold etc) so I usually am anticipating the worst at the appointment. 
-1	People has to belive the doctor and sometime. They be wrong they only care about the money not the person they put you on pill that all of them has bad side affets
-1	The bill when it comes in the mail. Why isn't healthcare universal? Health insurance should not be a privilege. 
1	I am anxious because I generally don't like going to the doctor or the dentist. The place often has other sick or injured people there, which makes me anxious. The environment, while clean and sterile makes me uncomfortable. It usually involves annoying paperwork, driving to and from, checking in, and lots of waiting, which makes the experience unpleasant and anxiety inducing. Further, the uncertainty about health conditions or what might be wrong creates nervousness and anxiety.
1	I usually feel very calm when I'm at the doctor's however, I am for the most part in good health. I guess the only anxiety I have would be them telling me I have a terminal illness or something horribly wrong. 
-1	There is nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I am very confident that I am healthy.
1	I get anxious and worried because I feel like something is going to pop up in my health records that is just going to throw my life for a loop. It seems like having a doctor officially diagnose something makes it just that much more real and scary.
1	I worry about being judged or put down again. I worry that there will be something terribly wrong with me and the dr will miss it or dismiss me based on my appearance.
1	The Dr. knows best. But my family dr. seems to always find something wrong maybe cholesterol or diabetes I can't afford to be sick I have a heart condition and it takes all my payroll for that

-1	I am not worried or anxious when I visit the doctor I feel confidence what ever he tells me I will be able to pray and ask God for guidance
-1	The time I have to wait in the office waiting to be seen and waiting on blood work to come back and waiting for them to come into room for my exam. 
-1	somethings I just feel anxious, I do not like to talk about myself or my issues and feel like maybe they will not have an answer for me or that they are too busy to care about what is going on
-1	I am worried that if I go to the doctor for something minor, something else will be found that is more serious. I live a healthy life but somethings you can't prevent. 
1	What makes me most anxious is finding out that I have some horrible sort of disease or illness. I also tend to feel worried that I'll be taken advantage of.
-1	I usually get bad news so I try to prepare for the worse case scenario but I never know what it is. I worry I'll have a new chronic illness.
1	easy to use and no funds to get new meds and things work amazingly with others and helps find hellp to be useful
1	Pain.  But also, I know that I need to lose a few pounds.  I exercise regularly and am not dropping any weight.  I know I'm going to be scolded for it.
1	i get scared.I dont want to find out something went back.I dont want to find out something wrong with me that cant be fixed or treated.
1	I don't want to hear any awful news and find out that something is terribly wrong with me. I feel scared that something might sneak up on me health-wise and it can be catastrophic.
1	I do not know the person and to get a check up I have to remove my clothes and the touch me. I do not like strangers touching me
1	I feel anxious because there is always the possibility of something serious being diagnosed. My health isn't the best, so I tend to worry.
1	The things that make me feel the most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor is I usually already know that it is going to be something bad, and I fear what I will be told and than the next course of action. I have many medical issues and most don't simply just go away on there own.
1	Not always taking care of myself and putting others before me. Also being naked is never fun and doing my yearly exams suck
1	I am afraid after certain tests are run, I may be diagnosed with some incurable dread disease. I would feel helpless and very upset to receive this news.
-1	The feeling that you could have an underlying condition that is not effecting your quality of life but could. You would only find that out when visiting the doctor and being examined. 
-1	I don't want to hear any bad news about my health.
1	I always worry that I am not going to be able to clearly  express the health issues I may have, or that I will sound like someone who has nothing better to do than look up health conditions online and adapt those as my own issues. I also worry that the doctor is not going to believe what I tell him.
-1	I have lost faith in my current doctor and his ability to properly diagnose me. I also feel that he is trying to see the largest number of patients in the least amount of time.
1	The not knowing why they do what they are doing when they are doing it. I have yet to find a doctor that will answer my ongoing questions as to WHY things are done and What the purpose of those are, in a complete way. Sometimes the answers that I get just make me have more questions.
1	I mostly worry about my bills and how I can pay them. I worry about see a doctor but don't have money. I worry that my car is so old but I can't afford to buy a new one.
1	I really don't like going to the doctor unless needed.  I try to keep healthy so that my visits to the doctor are rare.   It's just the way that I am.  No particular reason, I'm just that way.
-1	i have no fear or worry when i visit my doctor. i am completely comfortable because it is in GODS hands.
1	It scares me that there might be something wrong with me or sometimes I'm worried that I'm going to get embarrassed because the doctor will point out that I'm practicing poor health habits or something.
-1	I worry about my doctor's age and how long he is going to remain in practice since he is well aged. I also worry about some of the staff at the office and how many have left over the years. Just general white coat anxiety is what makes me feel most anxious, I have always had that and always will.
-1	IM WORRIED HE IS GOING TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME EVEN IF I AM JUST THERE FOR A YEARLY PHYSICAL
-1	If i'm going to have a procedure done or a surgery i'm obviously going to be nervous and worried. That's always how it works for me. When going in for a routine exam i'm not usually worried, however.
-1	Nothing really. I'm always calm about going to the doctor, even if I do feel sick or injured. I guess I just think positive the entire time. I don't know. It never bothered me or worried to go and see a doctor.
1	just the waiting to see what he or she says
1	In have not been to doctors much in my life until a few years ago,  therefore my blood pressure always goes up when I see a doctor
-1	That there may be some serious condition with me
-1	Making sure that my health is 100%. And making sure that there are things that I can do that are preventative, smart and affordable.
1	Well I really can't blame the doctor for this one. I have just always felt very anxious about visiting a doctor (or dentist, for that matter). I am always fearful that they will find something wrong with me that I was unaware of, or that the visit will entail pain I don't want to deal with (such as shots, drawing blood, etc.) I wouldn't say I'm a problem patient though, it's just that I am quietly anxious about my appointments. 
-1	I'm getting older, and I know I'm not as strict with myself about maintaining proper diet and exercise.  I know it's for my own good, but visiting my doctor means confronting my own shortcomings in this area.
1	Normally I am concerned, like most, that my doctor could find something seriously wrong with me. My mother passed of lupus, and my father just recovered from colon cancer, so I am concerned that it's only a matter of time that I am diagnosed with a life threatening aliment. 
-1	That they will find something that is a medical problem. That my a1c will be too high. That my best efforts to take care of myself aren't good enough. 
-1	If I'm going in for something unknown, I might feel a bit anxious.  Other than that, it's routine body maintence.
-1	Number one, I don't like going to the doctor. I never have liked going to the doctor. I usually go because I have to go. Then, I expect to receive bad news.
1	Im always afraid of wbat the outcome will be its a nerve racking experience for me and usually have to take medicine befoee i go
1	"Having to pay a lot of fees and monies above my insurance as ""standard procedure"". The history of medical apartheid. The rate at which doctors misdiagnose everything. The low quality medical care in the area I live in. Not being taken seriously. "
1	Tests and always being fearful of the unknown. I don't know what my tests results will show so it makes me worry about what it could be.
1	First, how long am I going to wait. I know doctors have little regard for their patients time as I tend to wait 30 minutes to two hours for them to arrive. If I am  sitting in a doctor's office, I have a health issue, so of course I'm worried that it could be serious.
-1	The part that makes me most anxious is the time that I have to wait. :-)  Other than that, I feel like I am being very well taken care of and preventative care is important for all - I try to maintain my health.
1	Worried that I might get bad news or that I'm moving backwards towards progress that was made before.  It's almost like you don't know what's going to happen at each appointment.  Just deal with each one separately.
-1	I have no anxiety or bad feelings. If my tumor grows again, I will have targeted radiation/Gamma Ray knife to decrease the tumor size
-1	That there will be something wrong with me or something I didn't know about. The uncertainty of why I am there
1	Sometimes, I'm worried that the exam will show something bad...a disease or condition that will require expensive/extensive treatment. Actually, the first thing that stresses me is the weight check.
1	I almost always feel skeptical that I will get any good answers and it makes me feel worried that I will never find an answer.
-1	It's just something I don't like doing, even though I completely trust my doctor.  I think most people don't want to visit the doctor.
1	Might be something wrong with me that is serious.  I really believe that God put all cures here on earth and you must follow what he intended.  I think a lot of doctors should not be doctors but went into medicine for the money.  Very disturbing.  I think most medications do more harm than good.  I believe in prayer and natural medicine.  Western medicine is so overrated and people should really research alternatives.
-1	If I am going because of symptoms and I do not know the cause, then I would tend to be worried.  The unknown is always a little worrisome. 
-1	Because I want a solution to my problem and i'm not sure if she can solve it. I worry that I have to keep suffering.
1	I have had so many of them refuse to treat me I am scared every time I walk in. I have had to travel around states and the country finding care. I am fully aware I may not get treated and not to take it personally. I am tired of being called crazy or a liar when I am really sick and NOT feeling well.
-1	I don't feel anxious. I see my primary care twice a year for routine visits. I see other specialists And am proactive about my health and always have been
1	I don't go to the doctors enough to feel any thing, I'm of the mind set if it ain't broke don't fit it. I guess if I really needed medical service I would use it but I know I must leave this place one day that's a given and I don't plan on spending a lot money on medical I will you go when I go.
-1	A doctor who says nothing and you are trying to read their body language to gauge if you have a serious health problem.
-1	Only the thoughts of what lies ahead. What will they discover, and what are the problems. The unknown when I see concern by the doctor.
-1	I feel most anxious before the uncertainty of answers. I understand trained medical professiols are not supposed to let on emotiolly about the prognosis/diagnosis of a patient. Still, I rely on the small nuances in their expression or tone, body language, etc. to gauge the real severity of the situation.
-1	the possibility of hearing bad news from him and having to go home worried about my health situation
-1	
1	He glossed over my concerns, ignoring my questions.  He insisted his analysis was correct despite the fact that the lab work does not support his claims.  He forced me to take a drug I do NOT want in my body, knowing that I am forced to see him until my divorce is final & I can choose a new insurance plan.
1	not sure what the problem is, embarrassment, fear of health issues, fear of needles and other medical treatments, pain and tension
-1	I am healthy so going to a doctor's office does not make me anxious though when they take my blood pressure it is usually higher then normal. So subconsciously it may bother me a bit.
1	nothing really anymore thanks to my beautiful fiancÃ© and brand new baby girl daughter Amelia who are lights of my life
-1	because I just am an anxious person in general - so this just how I feel sometimes during the day.  Since I am getting older and things are just breaking down, I want to be sure that over all I am still as healthy as I can be.
1	Waiting time and also waiting to be seen by a doctor and what they are going to say during everything and if there is anything wrong with you
-1	Probably just the blood tests I have to take.  They changed people and the new people aren't very good at making it quick and painless.
-1	Haven't lost weight. She recommended tat I do so. I began to do so, then my weight seemed to set at a certain weight.  Feel like I can't. 
1	The possability for bad news.
1	I once got diagnosed with diabetes and they wanted me to go on Medforin and I refused instead I relied on altertive therapy and next time I visited the Doctor they had NO evidence of this diagnosis.
1	If I think something is wrong with me. If I haven't been there in a long time.
1	I'm nervous that my medical issues may have worse.  I'm nervous about something else being wrong with me. 
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried about visiting a doctor, that's what I'm there for.  The only time I'm in any way anxious is when I've been tested and am waiting results.
-1	I really don't feel anxious. I go seeking relief, not fear.I think my biggest concern could be the possibility of a long wait which doesn't happen often now. Being Type 1 diabetic I am more concerned with A1C and creatnine levels but I don't really worry.
-1	I mildly dislike needles, and poking around in my private areas is more annoying than embarrassing, but I get over the annoyance and look away when they do the blood draw.
1	What makes me feel most anxious is being misdiagnose with a terminal disease like cancer or HIV when i never really had it. I'm scared to get vaccinations when i'm healthy because i feel it will only make me susceptible to those diseases. I believe the only thing that gets sick is your mind and if i begin to feel helpless due to a misdiagnosis, my immune system will get weaker and the virus will be easier to take over my body & emotions.
-1	I don't really feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor anymore. I'm pretty cool when I go to any of my doctors. On my first visits it was just normal gitters because you have no clue what the doctor is going to say but that soon fades. 
-1	
-1	The thought of maybe them finding something wrong. 
1	I seem to get very anxious when seeing my doctor because I always forget what I need to tell them. I am usually worried about what I may find out at that visit. I sometimes feel worried that the doctor may think I am a little crazy because I do not know how to explain a certain symptom. I am sure they know most of the time what the patient is talking about as they have normally seen that problem before. But with myself I am not good at explain a certain pain or feeling. But as far as actually walking in the office and talking with the staff I always feel comfortable. 
1	I am always afraid that the doctor will find something very, very wrong. I used to watch a lot of hospital shows, where you go in for a hiccup and you end up dying. I have since stopped watching those and I have been less afraid.
1	 I am someone who worries and can overanalyze situations easily. The way I feel can be circumstantial. For example, if I'm in pain and don't know what's wrong, I'll be very nervous to visit the doctor because of what could be wrong. Fear of the unknown or what's to come. 
1	White coat syndrome, it makes my blood pressure go up ten to fifteen percent. The unknown but also satisfaction that I go to my yearly check ups and hoping o don't have to bend over for a test
1	I feel fearful and anxious when I go to doctors office over the test results I have to wait for after a two week period. I sometimes think the worst.
-1	The possibility that I may be examined health problems.
1	Just the thought that something could be really wrong with me and I can't figure it out on my own. I get anxious because doctors take forever to get to the point and they don't come right out and say what's wrong they try to ease it up on u especially if it's bad news  
1	You just don't know what is going on so you mind takes you to the worse place and that cause you to worry, before even hearing the outcome of what the doctor has to say.
-1	I really don't get anxious or worried when I visit the doctor. If there's anything, I do think about how much it will cost me out of pocket. 
-1	I naturally become anxious when I see doctors. My blood pressure is normally on the lower side, although it is still normal. When I go to my doctor, my blood pressure rises to 120/80 which, again, is still normal, but not MY normal blood pressure when I am relaxed. Also, I am worried he will be disappointed in slow weight loss since I began losing weight in February 2017.
-1	I feel most anxious about physical pain and examinations that may be ackward or embarassing. I've had two babies and found the exams to be surprising in their frequency and in the way they were not properly explained to me beforehand. I know it's routine to them but it's not to me.
-1	Nothing really makes me anxious  at the doctor office, but sometimes waiting in the wait room or waiting on doctor makes me anxious. 
-1	Sometimes I go into a doctor fearing the worst when I go into see him. There have been times in the past with previous doctors that their first diagnoses wasn't always the correct one. For that reason alone I'm weary sometimes.
1	You want to get good news not bad news.You never know what to expect. You need to know if there is something wrong.
-1	waiting for my appointment is a very stressful situation. The longer i wait, the more anxious i become. As i become more stressed and anxiety builds, the waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me to become even more stressed.
-1	I only felt nervous when my doctor told me that my daughter is small for her gestational age. Shes also my ob gyn doctor 
-1	I feel the most anxious when I have to wait awhile to see a doctor.  I usually have other things to do, and my day does not revolve around seeing a doctor.
1	Given the nature that I see him, sometimes it can be hard when waiting for test results. It can be hard between after the tests and before I see him to get the results. Concerned if things have changed and if so for better or worse 
-1	I am pleased to see my doctor especially if everything is going ok. I do as my doctors asks and when it comes time for checkups I am ready and waiting just to see what my prognosis will be.
1	When they act like they don't know what to do , or taking so much time one procedure to complete, waiting forever for results. 
1	I am anxious because I know I am overweight, and I dread being weighed and measured. I am anxious about my blood-pressure reading and blood sugar readings, as high blood pressure and diabetes run in my family. 
1	waiting rooms and seeing other patients in sad and debilitating  conditions while wondering about my diagnosis
-1	Advising me about future examinations such as pap tests which I don't like  I Have no issues at this stage of my life and really don't feel I need this procedure/
1	It is the uncertainty that makes me feel very anxious. I don't know what the outcome is going to be and the possible associated costs to treatment also are a cause of concern. I feel that I may be criticized or judged for certain personal choices.
1	Are they going to be honest? Is this doctor actually a doctor for the right reasons? Who can be trusted? Why can't we find a middle ground as far as chemical drug treatments and nontraditional healing?
-1	that there maybe something he has found on a test i  had for him and if maybe there might be bad news about what he may have found out
1	I have always been afraid of going to the doctor.  I am very fearful of pain and doctor's visits always has been related to pain in my mind. I think  I have phobia maybe.
-1	I have overcome any fears or hesitation which plaguey younger years. I look forward to being declared totally fit and healthy.
1	I feel as though the drs. may find something seriously wrong with me. I am afraid of the things the tests and labs will show.
-1	Usually I am anxious if I am having new symptoms and I'm afraid something serious may be wrong with me
1	Just being there meaning something is wrong just puts me in an anxious mood.
-1	I feel anxious when I have been waiting for a long time and I have a symptom that is bothering me, such as pain. I just want to stop feeling the pain, but I'm dwelling on it because of the long wait in the waiting room.
1	Not knowing what is next and what to expect in some situations. To have other people to be the ones to figure out things and me have no control
1	I worry that they could find something not good .  I worry that they will want me to get tests done I don't want.
1	There are a few things that seem to make me feel almost anxious or even worried when visiting the doctor's office. One of those things include diseases that can be spread from patient to patient.
-1	I don't really get anxious or worried, I just get bored with the long wait and the hassle of it.  The only time I've felt anxious at a doctor's office was when I was getting my cheek biopsy because they were thinking it was skin cancer (it was). And then the surgery and reconstructive surgeries made me feel anxious because I was worried about scarring.
-1	I just always feel a little uneasy and nervous waiting on a diagnosis. The feeling of uncertainty is always a bit unsettling. I try my best to not let it bother me to much.
1	Everything get a good result is all I want to hear because it's scary when you get the results in the club in the pillows
1	There were times when I had not been to a Dr for a few years. When I did decide to go for a check up and breast exam, I was afraid because it had been so long since I had been to a Dr.
-1	M  My .i me bad news When I visit the doctor I am most anxious that she will give me bad news.  My medicine she prescribes for me only manages my symptoms.  
-1	The only thing that makes me really anxious would be getting shots or have blood taken.   I am in relatively good health so I don't usually have health problems so I am not usually worried when I see a doctor 
-1	I am worried that the doctor's office will tell me I'm not trying hard enough to be healthy or belittle me for being overweight. Despite exercise and trying to eat healthy, I cannot lose the baby weight and am worried that at a dr. appt., a nurse or doctor will act condescending because of it.
1	In the back or my mind there is always that idea that I could have some life altering disease that the Doctor will discover.  Because of my family history, I have a fear that I will develop some sort of cancer, and he'll find it, and tell me I'm termil. 
-1	I don't generally feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office. I trust the physician and I don't have any serious ailments so I don't really have reason to worry.  At worst, sometimes I forget to bring my insurance card or have to do paperwork. The paperwork is always the worst part.
1	When I was pregnant and I had upcoming test like for diabetes, group b strep,and etc. I get worried because I wanted to have a healthy pregnancy.
1	mainly not knowing what might be found since in our family history we have a little bit of everything that has come up in one form or another. 
-1	I am worried that something may be wrong with my main organs or an issue with cancer and I need to see a different doctor.
-1	I am always worried about getting bad news or bad test results. Doctors offices always just make me feel uneasy. 
1	I now would worry about being misdiagnosed since my Mom's experience. I would have anxiety as well. I am nervous about going to doctors now. I am nervous about bringing family members - specifically my son - to doctors or hospitals now.
-1	Mostly just when I have to get shots or have tihngs happen that might hurt in some way. Normal things are completely fine
1	Of course that something will be wrong health wise or that something will need to be done that I cannot afford. 
-1	finding out that I have a new medical condition that we can not treat or cure. Having to take more medication on top of what I already take. 
1	When I visit a doctor I feel the most anxious at the waiting. Waiting for the doctor to arrive and waiting to receive information about my condition. I wish the process was much quicker so I wouldn't have time to worry something awful might happen.
-1	When I'm not feeling well and have no clue whats wrong. I have had cancer twice already, so illness really scares me.
-1	I feel neither anxious nor worried when visiting the doctor's office. In fact, I feel like the doctors are not going to look hard enough or listen intently enough and under- or misdiagnose me.
1	I worry about what the doctor might find. I feel much more at ease once it is over and I am given a clean bill of health. Until then, I get nervous about anything that might be going in my body that I didn't know about. 
1	Whether or not they will find something wrong how long tests take make u nervous or certain procedures
-1	A little anxiety or worry at the doctor's office arises when (although you try to avoid it) it is revealed that you disagree with what the doctor is suggesting. They tend to become rude or completely unhelpful after that. 
1	When my doctor does a pap smear, I get anxious and nervous, he makes me comfortable and good, he is gentle
-1	It's a plain quiet and sterile atmosphere.  The decor isn't too relaxing to be waiting in. I always fear a routine checkup will end with bad news
1	I never know if she's trying to give me meds that she pushes on other people and not really help me since she doesn't pay attention to me 
-1	I am usually most concerned that the doctors will find some health issue that I was not aware of or that I am not taking care of myself well enough.

-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried. I love going to the doctor's office and love interacting with the medical team. 
-1	When I visit the doctors office, I sometimes wonder or worry about what new problem they might find. After all, as I age, I find my body is starting to break down and betray me in different ways i never dreamed of.
-1	Typically I'm neither anxious or worried when visiting the doctor. If I do become anxious or worried it most likely because I'm going into surgery, which in that situation anyone would be worried. But if I have faith in the doctor I have nothing to worry about.
1	I get worried and anxious when I go to the doctor due to the uncertainty of what is going to happen next.
1	I always think the worst possible outcome when I go to the doctor. Because I read all kinds of health information online, I tend to think that I have the illness and my doctor tries to remain optimistic with me and not to think the worst all of the time.
1	I'm nervous I might have something serious. Or thatnive waited to long to correct a problem that I currently have.
1	I worry that I won't be properly treated because of my race and the fact that I'm not good at explaining my symptoms because I get nervous around strangers.
-1	When I go in for a preexsisting condition I some times get a little anxious about the results as the results can can because of life style changes

-1	I am not usually anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I understand any questions and the answers involved in my care.
-1	This is a simple answer. The waiting makes me anxious, sometimes the longer I wait the more people come and I don't like Alot of people around me at once, so that would definitely be the issue I have.
1	I often worry that they will discover something is wrong with me.  I also worry about how much the doctor's visit will cost and whether or not I will be able to afford by bill when I check out.  In general, visiting the doctor gives me high anxiety.
-1	What they will find in their tests and examinations and sometimes they even have misdiagnosis because they confuse you with another person sometimes.
-1	I worry that there could be something more wrong with many than there really is.
-1	Nothing much just that feeling comes out of no where fam mind your business please and thankyou and please
-1	I know I am a fairly healthy person I try to watch what i eat and exercise at lest three times a week, but even with all that you never know if the doctor finds something that is alarming. I never rule out a possibility of something bad occurring, that is why I try to limit these risks by choosing to live a healthy lifestyle.  
-1	I am more worried that the might find something wrong with me. I don't really ever think about being sick until I go to the doctor's office. 
-1	I always have a tiny worry somewhere in the back of my mind that whatever small ailment is bothering me is actually a symptom of something huge and very serious, like a tumor or something
-1	There is always a concern that the doctor will find something wrong with me that is serious.  He could discover something that turns out to be fatal.
-1	
1	hearing bad news such as my health worsening or something more is happening and there will be bad news and it will be too late to reverse the issue
-1	simply my reaction to being in a doctor's office.  especially troublesome because there are no windows.  the problem is the environment, not the doctor or the nurses.  and i detest getting my weight checked (i am overweight) and hate the blood pressure cuff-it hurts
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried during a doctor's appointment is serious, potentially life-threatening conditions. For cancer screening, I always become worried about what the doctor may find.
1	My sister in my eyes are super nice picture of the group and logout and my brother and I will be deleted from the movie Enchanted the day of school
1	Waiting for results of my blood test knowing that any changes can decide whether you need a new medication or further test is needed based you being out of the recommended score.
1	I'm overweight, I don't like getting on the scales nor hearing about it. Otherwise not much else bothers me.
-1	Well now adays I am mainly anxious that the costs of the visit will out weigh the need to go in the first place, I am a woman so I am technically now a pre existing condition.
-1	If something is wrong when i feel i can't diagnose it myself, i know me and my body, i can tell if something is wrong
1	I might get information I don't like about a medical condition. I might have to have an awkward conversation with the doctor. The doctor may have to examine me, and an unfamiliar person doing that is not the most comfortable situation. 
1	Sometimes I get anxious over whether or not something is wrong with me, but mostly I get anxious because I have social anxiety disorder.
1	Pap smears make me very uncomfortable. However I know they are necessary so I get them done. If there was another way that was more accurate and less invasive I would be for it
1	Me personally, I have social anxiety disorder. So I feel uneasy just leaving my house. I feel like mine gives the most worst case scenario much of the time. I end up worrying a lot until they get the test results back. I have been told I might have cancer. False alert. I was told I have diabetes and had to stick my finger twice a day for a year. Just to have another doctor tell me I didn't have it. etc.
1	telling me that my cholestrol is high because i dont like taking the medicine she prescribed even though i have told her that i have bad side effects and my insurance will not cover the expensive medicine.
1	Feeling embarrassed by something that is going on with me I guess. I think I am more anxious about that than anything else. My health is pretty good, and if it wasn't I don't think I'd really fear that. The money, also, the money makes me extremely worried. I fear having to pay thousands of dollars for my health.  
-1	Drawing my blood when it is needed for lab work. I just do not like getting stuck with needles. I do not like the lab tech searching for a vein into which a needle may be inserted. I just plain do not like seeing a lab tech when I have had to be in a fasting state!
-1	
1	I don't feel too anxious or worried during a visit because I know my body is generally healthy. However, I always know there is a chance something is wrong, which is why I wrote neutral.
1	There is always the concern that you might have some serious health issue that you didn't spot and that a doctor may notice. I also am not a fan of being touched by those I'm not close with so I get a bit anxious due ot the amount of physical contact involved in most appointments.
-1	I think it is just the fact of the unknown. Everyone comes across health issues at some point in their life and im just nervous waiting for mine. Worrying that my blood test will come back abnormal or the doctor will hear something in my lungs or see a lump somewhere. 
-1	I always think they will find something I didn't expect before entering. No one likes hearing bad news about their health, because it could be worse than they thought. I deal with any issue that comes my way, but it's a normal reaction to be worried that something is wrong, especially when feeling bad.
1	I just hate being examined and having to visit the doctor in general. Life would be easier without having yearly exams to have to go to. :)
1	Having my doctor shoot down the possibility that something may be wrong with me.  I worry that because of her, I won't find out about a medical condition until it is to late.
-1	That at age 72 he may have some bad news about my health.  My mother has Alzheimer's and it's always worrisome to me to know I may aquire the same disease.
1	The results of my blood work can cause me to worry a little, but not much...I know that I just need to focus on the issues and do my best to make sure my health improves
-1	I am sometimes concerned that my condition may have worsened or that my current treatment is not working as well as hoped.
1	The doctor always takes a long time but they're always in a rush to leave. They always write things down but don't communicate. They don't make eye contact and they're always leaving and entering. 
1	That I will have to get shots or blood drawn. Those both make me nervous, or that someone will say something about my physical condition that is negative like I need to lose weight or I will get diabetes or something.
-1	I'm afraid of hospitals due to my childhood. I had to visit them a lot, so that gets me anxious already. I feel like I'm going to mess something up.
-1	I really do not feel anxious or worries visiting my doctor.  he does not pressure me into any tests that I don't want.  He gives me options and explains each option in detail, answers all my questions and is ok if I refuse to take his advice
1	He'll put me on some medicine and try to be scary to me because I'm fat and uglier and obese. I'm sacred of doctors 
-1	what makes you feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is just general anxiety. Or general worry nothing specific
1	Sometimes I'll get nervous to hear bad news or even getting shots. usually to see doctors there's a wait. so i'll get anxious while I'm waiting.
-1	nothing. i try to keep myself in shape. so there is never a worry or doubt in my mind. he is a striaght shooter and tell me things how they are. so no need to worry
1	that something wrong will be found that will require surgery or/and hospitalization. I can better put up with discomfort than the thought of either of the above.
1	they don't explain what they think is wrong with me.  they just want to run more and more tests that i can't afford.
-1	Nothing really, He'll tell me the truth and not beat around the bush.  My philosophy is it is what it is, and we'll go from there.
-1	just do not know ahead of time if I'm doing OK or not makes me anxious and nervous. Therefore, it's not a very pleasant experience to me.
-1	I always worry before a doctor's appointment. I always worry that I'll get bad news. 
-1	They usually have some difficulty finding a vein in one arm, but other people are better in other locations. I do dread my colonoscopies since the last one was painful. But not much else..so far, since I'm relatively young.
1	I just be nervous that it is something wrong. I hope that the news is not bad. it is the wait to see the doctor makes me most nervous
1	WHEN THEY TAKE FOREVER TO GET BACK WITH YOU REGARDING YOUR RESULTS, OR WHEN THEY CALL YOU BACK TO THE OFFICE FOR MORE TEST
-1	I don't like being touched by strangers, particularly in intimate areas of my body.  It is uncomfortable having to remove my clothing, especially for a female nurse or physician's assistant.
1	i was a iv drug user i could get bad news about effects 7 years of use had on my body. it can be scary at times but i'm hopeful toreturn to good health
-1	May never know what they'll tell or do to you. So it makes me feel those reactions. Even afterwards when you're done.
-1	since I am getting older, I worry that something else will be wrong with my health. Problems that arise with age.
1	I fear that they will find something seriously wrong with me, and they will want to prescribe drugs that have serious side effects.  I also feel that the mind has alot to do with how healthy we are, and once people know that they have a serious illness or disease, they give up, so to speak and go downhill rapidly.
-1	Whenever they give me the results and state that something was wrong or I have an issue that I need to take care of.
1	I have not taken good proactive care of my health- and I would be extremely anxious that I have some condition like cancer or heart disease. I feel like I would be mostly alone and struggle badly to fight any condition or disease well with the mindset and resources I have at this time.
-1	I usually worry about money (insurance) and what problems/solutions may come out of the visit. Sometimes I have a bad day and being out of the house makes me anxious.
1	Wondering if they will they get frustrated. Will this be fruitless and a waste of money. Can they help me.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor unless I fear that I have a serious problem, which means that I would be more worried about whatever the problem was (or could be). If I have any idea what I'm there for there is no worry.
-1	I have not had success with overcoming my low thyroid disorder, so with every visit I am concerned with the extra expenditure, and not having success with my health.
1	depends on how serious the problems are and the medicine you have to take if you are worried no need to worry if the problem is minor
1	I am overweight and have high blood pressure. I am not exercising and doing things i should in order to get fit so i dread hearing that my health is not better because of my poor decisions. 
1	Whether I wasted my time and money or if this will be one of the few times Iâm actually provided a medical solution to whatever Iâm there for. 
1	when the doctor tells me I have to have open heart surgay or I have kidneys going bad or I have to have a knee replaced or a hip replaced
-1	good stuff so sweet things gotta make it happened in this earth going threw it in the world  weak stuff wack
-1	Just the general routine of having the physical and examition because it's such a persol matter.
1	I worry that a simple problem is actually the beginning stages of something serious. I also worry that the doctor may miss something that leads to prescribing the wrong medication.
-1	
-1	I don't usually get worried.  there was a time when I had my self convinced that I had ovarian cancer.  I went to the doctor to talk to her about it.  That day I was worried, but it wasn't anything about my actual doctor that gave me anxiety. It was me self-diagnosing myself that had me all worked up. 
-1	As this hardly ever occurs, well, ... hard to say. However, most times (very few), I've mostly felt more neutral, than anxious. Any anxiety would be related to waiting time.
1	i am just curious. i want to know what help i will need. I also want to know if there is something i should be concerned about
1	I worry that they are going to tell me something is wrong, that I am sick or dying. Just a general fear of receiving bad news.
-1	The only thing I can think of that makes me anxious or nervous is getting blood work results back after a test. 
-1	usually when I have to go to the doctors office, it is because of an injury or an illness. This most of the time means that I am in some sort of pain or something is uncomfortable with my body. being that this is the case the majority of the time can cause the stress level to increase more than normal. by no means is it the doctors fault. It is simply the fact of the pain or uneasiness caused in my body, that cause me be stressed in wondering what is wrong with myself, or if and when the pain or illness will end.
-1	Sometimes I am anxious to see the doctor out of fear of receiving bad news.  My largest concern would be hearing that I have a terminal illness or that something else is wrong with my health.  I would just prefer to positive news when it comes to my health.
-1	I have PTSD and have been nervous talking about it, which is the reason I've most commonly gone to the doctor recently.
-1	In medicine, not everything is 100%, but very close. So naturally, when someone goes to their physician they are there for a particular reason, so I find it natural for one to feel anxious or worried because fear for the unknown. Iâm general, everyone needs to go see a doctor, for not only maintaining a healthy life, but preventing bad from occurring, and these types of feelings occur, along with excitement and pride when all comes out good. 
1	"I am most anxious when discussing symptoms and/or test results that do not conclusively provide a diagnosis. I have had a few experiences where my doctor at the time assumed that I was simply ""anxious"" and refused to take my concerns seriously. I was later diagnosed with a serious illness. It is my fear that I will be perceived as having a mental illness that causes my distress, or as ""drug-seeking""."
-1	I am often afraid that a doctor will not take me seriously. I have had experiences where doctors ignore my input and disregard my feelings.
-1	I don't feel animus,nervous or worried. My doctor puts me completely at ease and we proceed with the exam/visit in steps.  He lets me know when things will happen and why they need to happen.  There is no fear with him.
1	Because of my pre existing condition I suffer extreme fatigue, yet so many of the doctors want to prescribe me meds that have fatigue as a side effect, like gabapentin. I have to explain that I won't take medication that will fatigue me because I have a small child to take care of. I can barely function as it is with my level of disability, I don't want things that make it worse. Also I have a liver issue Gilbert's syndrome, that affects how I process medication. I've had weird side effects, for example to stemetil for nausea and was told by my doctor they only saw that in children or people with compromised liver enzymes. I have had bad reactions to all types of anti depressants from tri cyclics through SSRIs, which caused me in the former to be almost comatose and dissociated to in the later case have uncontrollable muscle spasms. I feel disbelieved by doctors and dread seeing them because they always want to give me drugs that give me adverse effects. The drugs that don't bother me so much they won't prescribe. For example NSAIDs completely mess up my stomach and acetaminophen is bad for my liver, so the best drug for pain relief for me is a small amount of codeine, not tramadol, not vicodin, not percocet, all the artificial opioids make me hallucinate, but codeine does not. However physicians wont prescribe codeine to me. I have complex over lapping conditions and none of my doctors talk or communicate with each other. I see a neurologist, a gastroenterologist, a urologist, an ent doctor, a breast specialist, an ob gyn. I get overwhelmed with all the advice and the lack of effective treatments for my diseases.
1	I just don't like going to the doctor. Usually the only reason to go to the doctor is for a bad reason. Unless you are having a baby.
-1	There is always some anxiousness and worry when going to the doctor so they can see what might be wrong with you........it's not always just the flu or some condition easily diagnosed.
-1	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor when I have something I need to get checked out and I'm not sure what will be found or the diagnosis will be.
1	That the tests will show the development of some serious illness.  And a worry that the person taking my blood will have difficulty drawing the necessary samples (this has happened several times -- and it is a blasted nuisance).
1	If I am supposed to be working on my weight and I have not or have gained weight. If my lab results are not good.
1	I always assume the worst. I usually think that something is going to come back worse then what I initially went to the doctor for.
-1	when they are talking about serious health problem. a words from him that might lead to a bad health issue. testing my blood for std and other lifetime problems
-1	I have always been nervous going to a doctor's office. It goes back to my childhood never knowing what is going to happen at the doctor's office. 
-1	I have met with my new Dr. one time and walked away confident and peaceful that he is my primary Dr. Time will tell.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office.
-1	Actually, nothing makes me feel anxious or worried. I have enjoyed reasonably good health and believe that so long as I try to take care of myself, I will be okay. I do understand better than many the vagaries of life and I can only control what I can control
-1	When he has s to run test and im not sure what the results are. When I have to get shots or transfusion
1	I always afraid of getting some bad news. I don't want to be told anything negative. I don't want to hear any bad results.
1	i don't think i feel anxious in just the doctors office.  Because of my mental illness i often feel anxious in public sometimes even at home 
-1	The only thing that I really worry about is that the doctor might find something that is really wrong with me. I might be very sick.
1	Fear of whether or not there's something wrong with me, and fear of how much treatment will cost. 
-1	I usually don't feel much anxious when visiting the doctor's office. Maybe because I used to visit the doctor's office when I was a child. The past experiences sometimes may make me a little anxious.
-1	I do not feel anxious when I visit the doctor. I am confident I will get good care and my questions will be answered too.
-1	I am not usually anxious in the doctor's office. I know that there is not anything wrong with me health wise, so I am always confident that I am in good shape. Occasionally I get anxious walking in, but that is it.
1	I hate having to talk to people about myself, and I feel like if I say something's been bothering me they'll treat me as if I don't know my own body and as if everything's my fault. I feel like they look down on me when I'm not in 100% top condition.
1	The unknown to me is definitely the worst part. I often think of the worst thing that could happen and it's hard to think of anything else afterwords. Sitting in the waiting room also makes me feel anxious because I keep thinking about anything bad that could occur.  Finally, when the doctor starts talking too fast or talks about confusing things i get nervous that I will not understand something.
-1	I sometimes get worried I'm going to get some bad news like there is something wrong that's going to cost money I didn't foresee. Also I get worried I might get some type of negative diagnosis sometimes.
-1	I am getting older. I don't have any of their difficulties, but pretty much all the males on my dad's side had high pressure, diabetes, and potential for heart disease.
1	I am scared he might recommend a procedure that I won't be able to afford, si I don't have health insurance.
1	I'm most anxious about receiving bad news.  I want to be happy and healthy and not have the ailments that already exist for me.
-1	I don't have at issue at all.  The only thing I don't like is like mammogram or pep smears that it could hurt.  Also fasting blood work could get me hungry.  Other than that I don't have any worry or fear.
1	Being told I'm not healthy.
1	I get worried about cost of visit and needed things after. I also get anxious thinking they will have nothing but bad news for me.
1	when I go to the doctor they take a long time and I have to go buy fast food because I get out so late that's why I don't understand why I have an apportiment and get seen late
-1	Nothing. It's better to know than not to. I tend to think that mostly good things happen to me in life, because has been my experience thus far, so that is how I approach all situations...including visits to the doctor.
1	Well, after examination you never know what will be the results. For that reason you definitely going to be unease and I know myself I'm kind of always worried about things that I don't know
-1	if I go in and have no clue what's going on. A completely new thing never experienced before and cant ID it well
1	I think doctors often seem to guess at what is going on with their patients, though it is an informed guess, they may not be making a careful assessment of their patients health and rely a little too heavily on previous experience to the extent where they may not recognize or are dismissive of other symptoms. They can often seem resigned to a bad outcome, and at the same time be uninformative about what is going on.
1	Nothing make me feel most anxious or worried going to the doctor. I like going to my door. My doctor happy every time I come to my appts.
1	simply i always think of the worst and when i am in the doctor i think he will tell me i am about to die
1	I feel most anxious about whether or not I will receive a bad diagnosis.  Often I let my mind wander into the worst of possible situations.  It would be horrifying to me if I received a diagnosis like cancer.
-1	I'm not usually anxious or worried at my doctors visits.  If I am there with a complaint I don't jump to the worst case scenerio
-1	Other than a routine physical the older i get the more i worry that there will be something wrong. I feel that the older i get the more i work to maintain a better state of health. In an emergency i am generally fearful of what the doctor is going to say.
1	Going to the doctors office is just an activity that makes me unsettled. Generally you go to the doctor to fix a problem, but if not then there is a good chance you may get sick after you leave since there are several other sick people there usually. If you have a specific problem you are struggling with (nerve pain, for example), it seems that they know more than the average person about causes and possible medications to help, but really they are just guessing about what might work and what not and it's just process of elimition. It's frustrating.
-1	Nothing worries or makes me anxious about going to the doctor's office . I am young and healthy so their is nothing for me to eorry about.
-1	I feel anxious just because I want to be sure I am doing everything in my life to help change my current health status. Anxiety is something I feel like I could have the power to stop if I was in the right mind set and in a better place in my life. I'm very hard on myself and that tends to get to me as well.
-1	Iâm just really scared of getting hurt like receiving a shot. Iâm also scared of hearing results such as me having a bad disease or something really scary happening
-1	I think the side affects of a potential prescription would make me feel anxious and/or worried most. To deal with this- I usually ask questions and try to get a satisfactory answers from Doctors and/or nurses. I also try to learn my options on the prescriptions to see if there is any other alternatives. for instance- the generic version of a branded medicine would make any difference etc. This sometimes help me deal with the level of being anxious or worried.
-1	I am worried that I am just another customer and that I am the only one who truly cares. I wish medicine was a much smaller thing and that doctors practiced more independently. 
1	The unexpected . Not knowing what the diagnosis is or if a prescription is necessary and what the total cost will amount to.
1	I am fearful of any health conditions I might be diagnosed with, nervous about the vitals, taking of blood, and of the office in general.
-1	When I had gained weight over the winter and I get the spheel about being out of tolerance. Other than that I have no concerns. 
1	Their job is to diagnose an illness to a patient. Many patients are misdiagnosed. I don't want them to say something is wrong. I know my body. 
-1	I hate going to the doctor it's just the anxiety of taking test and not getting the results that I'm supposed to geI hate going to the doctor it's just the anxiety of taking test and not getting the results that I'm supposed to get. I knowing that my primary doctor on th I knowing that my primary doctor or the nurse will be angry with me for not getting the results on supposed to have and not staying on top of my heels not working out or eating the correct or proper food.
1	I feel most anxious or worried that my doctor will find something serious wrong with me.  Something life threatening.
1	Not knowing how my numbers are going to look is a big concern for me.  I try to eat healthy, but I have to admit, I fall down  quite a lot.  I have hypertension and eating right has a lot to do with keeping that in  tact. Then there's my weight which seems to have a mind of it's own.
1	That they won't give me the answers I am looking for. Also, that they can't provide the services that I want.
-1	The possibility if having to get my cervix checked , I'm pregnant , I hate cervical exams They suck !
1	Giving blood. I have thin veins so if I don't get a good nurse that can find a vein the first time, it takes a long time and I'm bruises up and I get dizzy.
1	I wouldn't want them to find that I had a debilitating disease. No one wants to endure a life threatening disease that would wipe out one's savings and place a strain on family.
1	A doctor's demeanor and how nice or mean he will me makes me scared. It also makes me scared that they won't be able to diagnose properly.
-1	Not knowing what to expect from the appointment, or test results.  
1	I am the most anxious about possibly having to have blood drawn, or anything else with a needle. Additiolly, I am sometimes anxious about the doctor finding something majorly wrong with me. I worry about coming into contact with other sicknesses while at the doctor's office in general. 
1	I get anxious when I worry about whether the doctor will assist me in a way that I personally agree with or if they will demand I do things that are out of my comfort zone, such as taking medications I do not wish to take or taking tests that I find to be dangerous.
1	What makes me anxious about my doctors appointments is sometimes I have to tell what's really going on and scared she will judge me. 
-1	The past experiences with my doctor. Howw she views me. Something i think u views me as more of a number than a perso n.
1	I hate needles. I am very much scare of them. I have to go to the Doctor if I have to go for a shot I weather not go.
1	I usually don't feel nervous about anything when going to see a doctor. The damage is already done I'm just waiting to find out what is wrong.
1	I worry that they will not help me deal with my health issues but will send me away with no help. I feel that my health concerns are rarely taken seriously enough. 
1	I feel anxious or worried when i am uncertain on what is causing my illness or concern.  Sometimes i fear the worse.  My doctor usually ease my mind. 
1	Just the idea of going to the doctor makes me anxious and worried that some major medical condition will be found even though this is probably not going to happen.
1	I am anxious that my health is already ruined. I think about death too much and I am anxious that I am going to die
-1	I don't like the rectal exam , it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I also worry a little about the results from my bloodwork.
-1	Any thought of health issues makes me anxious and give a little anxiety to anybody not just me. It does not have anything to do with my feelings of the capabilities of my doctor
1	Sometimes when visit my doctor ,there's a fear of the unknown. Feraing that there may be something wrong
-1	I worry about callbacks from the office for medical tests like mammograms and Pap tests. I am relieved when all is good.
1	I only go to the doctor when I can't get better on my own so by the time I go I'm afraid it's something more than it really ends up being 
-1	I don't like going to the doctor's office anymore than anyone does. Not thinking they will find something wrong with you but the fact that it is uncomfortable to have someone checking all over you.
1	  If someone there or around is ging to get me sick.  If someone will give me the wrong diagnosis.  If someone will give me the wrong medication.
1	I don't go to the doctor unless I really have to. It's expensive. So because I can't go for check ups when I need to, I always worry that something major could be wrong.
1	I worry that there might be some bad result or that I might be sick and not know it.  I get scared that the test being performed might not have the result I want.  I get nervous days before doctor appointments.  And if I have a procedure done I worry even more because I have to wait for the results.  The waiting is the thing that really makes me worry, if I know I am going to have to wait for some results I lose sleep the week before I have to go in.  Losing sleep makes me even more anxious and by the time I get to the appointment I am really uneasy.  Not knowing the outcome really makes me scared.
1	I'm really not certain as to why I feel this way towards doctors. Perhaps it's not knowing what's going to happen or what they might say/do (especially if going in for a physical).
-1	Honestly it's the extra time in the waiting area that is the only thing that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. 
-1	I feel like they might found something bad. I also think that I may have a bad condition.
1	Even though I trust my primary care physician, I still worry about my health. I worry the doctor might tell me some bad news about my health. I worry a pain I have might be cancer or something else serious. I worry about pain and death.
-1	I AM WORRIED THEY ARE GOING TO FIND SOMETHING MAJOR THAT IS WRONG WITH ME.
-1	I am sometimes anxious because they may find out something that is wrong with me that I am unaware of. Going to the doctor is just is a stressful thing.
-1	I worry a little that they might find something wrong. More than that I worry about having to make choices and advocate to get the treatment I want. 
1	The actual exam. I just don't like people touching me that way.
-1	That I will have something seriously wrong with me that will take me away from my damily or cause oin
-1	What makes me ferl most worried about my doctor's appointment is not achieving the goal that we set or that things got worse
-1	Waiting for the results makes me anxious. Or waiting for a long period of time to see the doctor makes me uneasy.  It makes me really anxious just sitting there waiting 
1	I have social anxiety, so just getting to the doctor and actually going are tough for me. I feel so much anxiety when I need to visit my doctor, 
-1	I'm always a tiny bit worried when I'm at the doctor just because I worry they could find something wrong that I didn't expect but for the most part, this is not something I'm too worried about and I trust that most of my doctor appointments will go generally well as expected.
-1	I worry that I may have a serious medical condition. This is usually fretting about nothing, but I continue to worry anyway.
-1	I feel most anxious or worried when it comes to work or challenging situations that I have to handle.
1	I am anxious  that the doctor will find a problem. I especially worry about a recurrence of cancer. I also worry about having to have invasive testing or blood work. Waiting around for the doctor to come also makes me anxious.
-1	I am usually very calm and do not feel anxious as I do not have any major problems to be worried about.
-1	I worry that my doctor might find something wrong and the exam itself is a bit uncomfortable. A visit to the doctor is never really something I look forward to.
1	No real reason other than that I am diabetic and am always afraid my A1C will be too high and I will need more serious treatment.
-1	I just get nervous because it's the doctor.  I worry only because they might find something wrong or something that is serious.  I think that's only normal.
-1	Its the waiting for results that gets to you, especially when the nurse calls and tells you the results are in but won't tell you the rexsults
-1	ONE THING THAT MAKES ME ANGRY OR WORRIED IS ABOUT THE HEALTH TIPS WHENEVER THEY PROVIDE ME , BUT I FOLLOW THEM RARELY WITH THAT WHILE I GO FOR A CHECKUP I AM SACRED ONLY FOR THAT PURPOSE .
-1	I usually not worried unless there's something in my gut telling me there is something seriously wrong with me
1	That it will be more serious than I thought and my life could drastically change for the worst. I also worry that there can be a treatment for my problem but my insurance wouldn't cover it. I hate insurances, I think they are evil, and you can not consider a doctor appt without considering consequences from insurances. 
-1	They could find that something is wrong with me.
-1	I get worried that there is something seriously wrong with me, potentially lethal.
-1	Because I am getting older and am reaching the age when all of the men in my family either have died already or been diagnosed with cancer, I am anxious about that history and the likelihood that it is ineveitable that it will happen to me, and that this likelihood increases with age, and it will be a doctor visit that fisccloses that the end is coming soon.
-1	I am not anxious, but I have had a biopsy before and that did cause a bit of anxiety. In that case it was just hoping that the biopsy was benign and not cancer. The anxiety stems from unknown health problems that could be present.
-1	What makes me anxious about visiting a dr. appointment is the wait. I see and hear sick people and worry Im going to get what they have. I also feel uncomfortable being in a confined space with people that I know are sick
1	Going to the store and going swim. Its summer nd its already hot. SPlashing through many winds and doing alot wimming in the pool on te way home.
-1	Just having to know what really is going on with me can be a source of worry. It's always uncertain until the doctor gives you confirmation of what's really going on with you. Until I know, I am waiting and that makes me anxious. And obviously depending on what I end up learning about, that can make me even more anxious.
1	Now that I am getting older, I worry they may find something that could be serious.
1	Honestly for any physical exam it would be getting on the scale. It really sucks because I work really hard on my body and I have been gaining muscle so I know I am going to weigh more, but I don't want to. 
1	"The underlying thought ""what if they find something""! It's a universal fear and it is what puts off most people. The worry starts when the nurse and doctor start with the small talk and only abates when it's over and they say you are fine."
-1	I don't usually feel anxious unless there is something going on with one of my children that I am uncertain of.
-1	It really depends on what I am going for.  Most recently I had to go because I was having knee pain related to an old injury.  When you go to a new dr and say you need strong pain killers some times they think you are just trying to get drugs
-1	I feel most anxious when I'm going to have to have blood drawn. I have a thyroid disorder, so it's fairly often so they can check my TSH. I don't like needles and I am a lot better than I used to be, but I always get a little nervous about the stick.
-1	I get a little worried when my doctor recommends something I don't want to do (like a colonoscopy). In general, however, I am not worried at all. My doctor knows that I might not agree with everything he says and I always have the option of going to another doctor.
-1	only if tests came back positive.my doctor has the ability to make me feel confident & relaxed with her.
1	I feel anxious because I am a person that is reserved. I am quiet so it is hard to open up to somebody. 
-1	Im most anxious that the doctor will miss something important, just give me a medication that I don't need and then push me out the door to fend for myself.
-1	The main thing that makes me feel anxious about going to the doctor would be if I were waiting for test results to determine if something was wrong with my health and what was wrong with my health.
1	The fear in the back of my head that they will find something drastically wrong.  I am worried I will get bad news. 
1	I get anxious about having procedures done, such as surgeries, blood being drawn, shots , etc. i do not like waiting for results.
-1	waiting a long time (passed my appointed time) to see the dr knowing that a needle stick is involved (I hate needles)
-1	The long wait
-1	I get worried or embarrassed if it's something super gross that I need the doctor to look at or I have a question about. I worry other doctors might know about it and think I'm weird, even though I know they've seen just about everything from their patients. 
1	Because you never know what kind of information they're going to tell you so you have to be prepared for any kind of news
1	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor is the fact that I might have a medical condition that will cost a lot of money to cure or a long time.
-1	I guess I am sometimes anxious when I feel I might have something wrong with me. I get a bit worried about what it actually is and whether it is dangerous. Otherwise I am never worried about the actually doctor's office visit itself.
-1	There is always a small risk present in many interactions. I am afraid that something will go unchecked sometimes.
-1	There's always a bit of worry that something is wrong that I didn't notice. I just like to be fully prepared.
-1	I am afraid they will find something wrong with me.  I don't want to find out a have an expensive or deadly issue.
-1	I would say the only thing that makes me nervous is the fear of the unknown. Sometimes you may not know what to expect. You always hope and pray for the best regardless of the situation.
-1	I've never felt anxious or worried at the doctors office I completely trust my doctor he's never failed me yet
-1	I GET ANXIOUS AND WORRIED ABOUT STUPID THINGS. MY JOB, MY FUTURE, MONEY, MY FUTURE RETIREMENT. BILLS
1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the unknown.  I always feel worried that the doctor will discover or test for some life-threatening or life-changing condition that will dramatically affect my life.
1	"Mostly I worry about how the doctor will perceive me and whther they judge my bad habits. I sometimes worry about getting bad news about my health but I think that is normal, and it will only increase as I get older. I worry that they will rush the appointment and not answer all of my questions as well. I have to check the time they come in for billing purposes because they will bill me for ""expanded visit"" which is supposed to be like 20 minutes but they stay for only 7-10 mins. This is unfair and I do worry about it."
-1	I don't feel dread with most doctors. I dread getting any sort of OB-GYN exam for obvious reasons.  (It's weird, intrusive, and unpleasant.)  With new doctors, I worry about being dismissed as not knowing my own body or not being taken seriously.  
-1	to tell me what is wrong with me, or being upset because i haven't changed anything on my life. or the things that will be prescribed when I'm done with the visit. and paying the bill
1	I'm usually most worried that I will receive some bad news. I've had a lot of health problems in the past and always feel like the worst possible scenario is going to come true.
1	What worries me the most about visiting the doctor is when I go in for something that i am not sure about what is going on
-1	Just worry there maybe worse news on my COPD but other than that I am not that worried.I love my doctor and she takes great care of me and has been 1 of the best I have ever been too.
1	i HATE going to the doctor and hospitals. i was in and out of them nonstop as a kid with very serious health problems.
-1	I was worried I would have to have a lot of tests I couldn't afford to figure out what was wrong with me.
-1	I don't like getting my blood drawn. I hate needles.
-1	The results of tests or blood work and knowing the possibility of something major could be going on. 
-1	If I had symptoms of what I considered a serious illness, I would be anxious or worried that I could not be treated successfully.
1	I feel anxious about going to the doctor at any time.  I am not a fan.  I can become a little worried about the idea of tests or anything out of the ordiry.
-1	The idea that a stranger is going to examine me and that he has the ability to diagnose me with illnesses or a clean bill of health.
1	If im having a txt done for something. It takes so long to get the results back. The wait is unbearable. The wait has me on pins and needles.

-1	Nothing beyond whatever I'm there for.
-1	Even though I'm very healthy overall and generally feel pretty good, there's always that gging idea in the background that they may discover something seriously wrong that isn't currently presenting any symptoms. It's also just an anxious situation in general when another person you don't know well - or know at all - is examining your body and mind and peering into some persol and private things, even if you trust them to be objective and professiol about it.
1	A diagnosis of a disease. Finding out I'm going to die. Stuff like that is scary you know? That's all

1	I am worried that my doctor will discover that something is wrong with me and that it is very serious.
-1	Just not knowing what is going to happen.  I always have a hard time when I don't know what to expect.
1	One of the main reasons I don't have a primary care physician is because I never liked going to the doctor as a child. Having physicals scared me really bad and I'm probably traumatized. So I am in no hurry to go to the doctor for any reason. If I get sick I just wait it out. 
1	I am always afraid that they are going to find something seriously wrong that I am not aware of.
-1	none just get it done and leave either they fix it or they don't but I hope they can cause somethings I can't fix
-1	The only time I feel anxious at the doctor's office is when we are going over results of a test that I was already worried about to begin with.  I generally never feel anxious at the doctors because I have taken the time to make sure that I am dealing with the best in medical care.

1	I have anxiety to being with, and any kind of scrutiny amplifies it. When the doctor is performing a checkup, I feel like I am in the spotlight and being judged. 
1	You just never know what the doctor might think or suggest or tell you. Fear of bad news. I think it's natural to feel this way.
-1	I am most worried that they are not going to listen to what I am describing as my actual problem. And only listen to key words that I might say. 
-1	Well when i get there and i take blood test i just be hopein it good news and not bad and i start pacein back and fourth and wat make me anxious is to get ouy of the doctor office

1	I am always anxious or nervous that something is wrong with me, or that they will find something that is abnormal.  I also just get uneasy in hospitals/doctor's offices in general.
1	What makes me feel the most concerned about visiting a doctor's office is that they likely don't know what to do, but will gladly try a few things that will end up costing way too much. A person is lucky if they don't end up feeling worse, being told there's nothing wrong, and/or walking away having to take a bunch of expensive pills. No, thank you.
-1	That the exam will show that there is something wrong. such as cancer which I have gone through before.
1	I am overweight and I know that the doctor will say something about that - and that may be what is causing some issues.  I just don't want to hear that I have something really wrong with me.  Most of that is just in my head, but I still get worried that it may be true.
-1	I am most worried or anxious when I am discussing new or different symptoms regarding my health.  I feel this way until my doctor and I discuss these concers.
1	Having to pay the cost of going to the doctor. Another thing would be like knowing that the doctor will say that something is wrong.
1	 it can  be stressful when they dont care  and they are amazing and nice and love it   they are special and caring
1	They can do some much texting and I hate it and they can ask a lot of questions fell out paper work always
1	Not being able to afford the cost of the visit. I worry about being harassed about payment in the future.
1	When I visit my doctors office what makes me feel the most worried is that I will be told that I have a chronic illness. I worry because both of my parents suffer from illnesses and I know that they are hereditary. My mother suffers from high blood pressure and my dad from diabetes. I want to avoid both of the illnesses for as long as possible, but since I am overweight I have a higher chance of developing any of these illnesses. Therefor on my annual checkups when I go for my results I do get nervous and anxious because I don't want to be given bad news. 
1	I am always worried in unfamiliar situations, and doctors are people I do not know well that have to get close to me and ask personal things about my life.
1	i've had high blood pressure and chest pains. i've had pretty serious kidney stones. when i go to the doctor because of some pain, at my age i always worry whether it might be heart disease or cancer. haven't had anything that serious yet, thankfully.
-1	I feel anxious that they'll find something else wrong with me. I hope that I'm doing the right things and that I don't walk away with unexplained tests or something else that I need to watch out for. 
1	A few things. I get anxious because I'm not sure I'll be able to express all of my concerns, because I'm worried they won't take my concerns seriously or will dismiss them, and because I might leave without any answers (because they don't know what is wrong). I also get anxious when talking to people anyway, and doctors are worse than most people. They are busy and I worry about taking up their time. My symptoms are weird. I'm afraid I'll just look crazy.
1	Being judged, etc concerning my health conditions. I am an inactive alcoholic, but often receive judgement for it. Or Drs tend to ignore my other issues like anxiety.
-1	I do not feel anxious at all visiting the doctor's office.  I feel perfectly comfortable.  I have nothing else to add.
1	The whole think.  The waiting, the gowns, the sterile environment.  It makes me very anxious.
1	Sometimes I worry about being diagnosed for something greater than I first believed. I have an over presently fear of getting some horrible news whe ever I have a check or I go in for an exam. It makes me nervous not knowing what I have of rmight need. The suspense of waiting for the results of and exam make me anxious.
-1	Well I have the normal worry of hoping that I don't have a serious conditions when ever blood tests etc are done. We all want to avoid bad news and pain. I know the irony is that avoiding the doctor heightens our chance of bad news when we finally do go. I learned this first hand when I when I had the emergency, telling myself that the pain in my chest and difficulty breathing was nothing to worry about. It turned out to be more serious than I thought.
1	i feel anxious for work, children or new start. it is very important for me. or my family have problems
1	I would normally be anxious about my weight, my blood pressure, and my other health indicators. If the numbers are not good I might get scolded by the doctor, or worse, they might indicate I am not healthy. I would also feel anticipation to hear the results because I would be hoping for good numbers instead of bad ones. I would feel worry that I might get health news that I do not like.
-1	What makes the most anxious is when they're running extremely late and I have to sit there and wait.  It gets me upset that they don't care that I've had to take time out of my day and they should be courteous to others as we are to them.
1	What would make me feel most anxious is taking test, removing my clothing, getting shots or being told that I have a disease. Most doctors office visits are stressful for me because I have chronic anxiety, however, sometimes I am able to calm myself down during the office visit. I do worry about germs of other people as well, and worry later if I could get sick from them. I usually rush home and shower. 
-1	
1	The unknown is what makes me worried whenever I have to visit the doctor. I never know if I am going to get good or bad news so that is what usually concerns me. 
1	My blood pressure always goes up at doctors.  Know will have to wait for results.  Sometimes doctor acts like his time is more important than you

1	finding out something bad about my health
1	I feel anxious or worried because I would hope there is nothing wrong with me internal or external. Just the thought of going to the doctor's office makes me scared and nervous because I don't want to be delivered any bad news.
-1	 Not knowing what the outcome will be. Wondering if they will be able to figure out what's wrong, and give me the proper treatment. 
-1	How much the cost is going to be, and what my blood pressure is - although that seems to get me worked up and drive it up more, ha.
-1	Visiting the doctors office rarely makes me feel anxious. If at some point I do feel anxious it might be because the doctor will tell me that I will have to undergo treatment that is not the most convienient for me at the time or I am unfortunately diagnosed with a condition that is not curable. 
-1	it is the whole  getting undressed and having a stranger look at your hoo ha. I do not get respect and the doctors do not listen
1	The only time I feel this way is when I am not sure what is wrong with me or just want to make sure everything is right when I go for my diagnosis. 
-1	I'm always worried that my doctor will find something horribly wrong with me like cancer
-1	I often worry like every one does that there will one day be a horrible diagnosis. It's a natural fear. 
1	It usually is what the doctors decision is. I am always worried about something serious. At my age things can go bad. 
1	I never look forward to seeing what it says on the scale, to start. Then the pressure I feel about the decisions I make about my own health seem to come under scrutiny and that makes me extremely uncomfortable. I can't wait to be done with the appointment.
-1	They may find something wrong with me. The wait may be too long and too many sick people around. I feel anxious if my initial blood pressure number is too high due to weight gain sometimes
-1	In the back of my mind i worry that the doctor will find something terribly wrong with me like cancer and that is scary. But this is not at the forefront of my mind and i do not think of it often

-1	To have to doctor tell me something serious like I have cancer or HIV is scary because that means I'll be dead sooon

1	"I have always had ""white coat syndrome"" I just get nervous because I don't know what is going to happen or what treatment I am going to get and if it is going to be unpleasant"
-1	That something is going to be wrong with me and it will be long term and it will be too late to do anything for me because i didn't listen to the advice of my doctor 
1	I am mostly worried that my care will not be effective or that I don't receive the best care locally. I travel two hours away to a large city for specialized care that is muck better
1	I feel more worried if the doctor states that another problem has been discovered in my body. This could be the result of some laboratory tests which were redone.
-1	Not too much makes me irreparably anxious when visiting the doctor's office. I don't like parts of examinations like pap smears, but I know preventative care is important and my doctor has never made me feel needlessly uncomfortable. 
1	then I visit my doctor office I afraid to get bad news about my health and very glad then I get good news
-1	I know there is always the chance of bad news. I do not put my self in the expectative state of mind, but I am aware of the possibility.

-1	I only feel anxious or worried when I know I am about to receive a shot.
1	I always anticipate hearing no so good news. Better to expect the worse that way you will not be too shocked or disappointed.
1	That they are going to find something alarming or that they are going to give me some piece of advice that will be difficult or unpleasant to take.
1	Sometimes I get embarrassed and that's why I feel that way. I'm not always willing you share my problems
-1	Not knowing what's going on. Waiting for results. Receiving bad results would have anyone worried, so many thoughts rushing through your head, ex&gt; is it doing to kill me? Is in incurable? How would these issue effect my life?
1	How much it's going to cost because even with insurance it's expensive and unaffordable for most normal people 
-1	Nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing. Absolutely nothing worries me anbout going to the doctors office. In fact, I am excited to go to him that I might receive a clean bill of health. 
-1	I'm afraid that there may be something wrong, so I'm worried they find a health condition. Especially if there's something going on in my head, I usually think the worse like a tumor or something drastic. 
-1	I fee anxius about visiting a doctor since i dont want any bad news, and i fear being diagnosed with something that would cost lots of money or would be deadly
-1	l am not l go to the doctor because l have too not knowing why make me easy not knowing what could be wrong 
-1	How I will be treated by the doctor and if the doctor will give me the right diagnoses. I hate to have to deal with doctors who believe their patients are too stupid to know whats going on with them and who will not listen to the patient.
-1	What kind of news I might get. I worry about what they'll say about my unhealthy lifestyle. The might say something about seeing other doctors.
1	I have a stalker and I don't trust due to not knowing who knows him. I don't give out any personal info to avoid being found. 
-1	i would say a fear of getting bad news. a fear of being judged. i don't like to be touched also so that makes me anxious.
-1	If I'm just going for a regular check-up, I'm not worried at all. However, if something is bothering me, I tend to think the worst, so I do get anxious. It usually turns out to be nothing, and I've worried my self for no reason, but that's my personality. I'm always worried that whatever I'm dealing with is something bad. It can never be simple.
-1	I am most worried or anxious when one of my kids are sick, we all see the same doctor. Even so, I still have confidence in my doctor's advice.
1	I am usually a little worried that they will find something wrong. Especially since so many of my recent visits have been prenatal - I always worry about the health of the baby. 
1	If I'm worried about money what my bill is going to cost me. Also it depends on the procedure that has to be done
1	I often have to have physical examitions and blood tests.  The blood tests especially incite dread, anxiety, etc in me simply because I know they will hurt.  Even the physicals give me discomfort though.  I also worry about what thing I will have to correct my doctor on this time.
-1	Family history of blood pressure issues. This always crosses my head as I been told that while my blood pressure is still within the normal range , it is in the higher borderline. The second this that pops to my head is that you never really know if everything is 100% fine. You may feel fine but may still be sick.
1	The fear something is wrong and I'm not prepared for the results. I feel if the results are bad, I will not be able to mentally handle it. 
1	I am naturally an anxious person and I worry a lot, even when there is nothing to worry about my mind just starts going and I start worrying about a lot.  So just going in to the doctor's office makes me anxious.  I will worry something horrible is wrong with me.  I am not anxious about seeing the doctor as my doctor is great.  Its just everything that goes along with it.  Mostly just the thoughts in my head.
1	The news could be get or bad,And what kind of disnois i might get,or the type of medicines be prescibed.
-1	the whole experience can be unnerving and shaky butalways work my way for thru itno matter what happens
-1	I have never felt anxious or worried when I go to see my doctor. The only way I would be if he found something wrong. He has never made me feel anything but trust and loyalty. I am very pleased with this man
-1	If I have some new problem that is just showing and we are seeing it for the first time. I know we will figure it out
-1	The feeling that they will judge me for my life choices, even if I strongly believe they are the right choices for me. I don't tend to do things willy nilly. I try and do my research and make sure I have informed opinion or choice in something I personally participate in. I don't always eat right, and even if I eat bad once a  month, I would feel like I need to justify my decisions to my doctor. I also have a general sense of anxiety, so any unknown situation will make me worries, usually for no good reason. 
-1	I'm always just a little worried something really bad will come up in the visit. I try to be completely honest about my physical condition, but I fear the doctor might discover something really serious about my health. I'm in a career field where my physical health (and lack of prescription medications) is extremely important, so I wouldn't want anything to come up that would affect my work.
-1	I just hate going to the doctors it is not pleasant. So many other thing I'd rather do. Always afraid of the what ifs
1	I hate going because I expect the worst and I'm just totally uncomfortable sitting and waiting, I get anxious and bored pretty fast. Then I hate interacting with the nurse or other workers and the doctor himself. I always feel insecure.

1	I feel anxious or worried that I may find ou bad news. I worry that some of my bad habits may have caught up with me. I am concerned I will receive bad test results 
1	I feel most anxious when I know that my appointment is going to last a long time. Even when I know my procedure would only take five minutes, I know that the entire appointment will take at least an hour. I also feel anxious to get things over with. Anytime I go to the doctor I'm never excited, but who is. I don't know anyone excited for shots, pap smears, and sickness. In addition, I get worried that maybe I have some disease, particularly an std. I get worried that it may be something serious or incurable. 
-1	nothing makes me anxious about visiting the doctor. i like going to the doctor's office. i just don't like the waiting time there it is too long
1	I usually imagine a worst case scerio, so I am worried about finding out something is seriously wrong with me. I also worry that the Doctor wont take my concerns seriously.
-1	The sterility.
1	If I see a bump or yuck.i fear cancer because I don't want my family or anyone to die.i love all of them very much
1	I worry that I won't bring up all relevant health information and we will miss something important. I know a lot of diseases can be asymptomatic, so I am just concerned that small things might actually be related to an underlying issue.
-1	I seldom feel it. Maybe because the doctor is gorgeous or maybe If I'm afraid to find out that something bad is happening to me which I'm very thankful that it hasn't happen to me yet.
1	because im scared there going to do something wrong and ill have more problems then i had before coming in there.
-1	The chance of receiving bad news I suppose. I have cancer in my family and it is always a worry of mine. 
1	That I will not get the proper care I require. I have had multiple instances where I paid for an Urgent Care visit, waited for hours to be seen, and was sent home with nothing but instructions to rest and take an OTC pill, only to end up admitted to the hospital the following day. Such instances include: heat stroke, kidney stones, broken ankle, severely infected sebacious cyst, etc. None of these instances were taken seriously by doctors in the urgent care center.
-1	I think I know how things will go, but there's always the possibility that I've missed something. I am never 100% confident in my ability to judge.
-1	that I will be faced again with another serious event which would change my life completely.  Facing unknowns can generate feelings of anxiety.
-1	It makes me feel sad makes me feel just very worried of set tired exhausted very very and I believe that I don't want to be worried anymore
-1	I had to have a colonoscopy and I did worry because they found a polyp and that it would take 2 weeks to get the results. Everything turned out okay!!!
-1	Always wanting my labs to show specific numbers pertaining to cholesterol, vitamin D and sugar levels- so I usually do both mentioned.
-1	Everyone that visits a doctor get anxious or worried, if you don't, something is wrong with you.  Anxious, because I want to be taken at my time of appointment, not 30 min. later.  Worried that she might find or see something that she hasn't seen or heard before, that is natural
1	Will I hear  bad news again or will I need more tests scares me. I've had open heart surgery and don't want to go thru that again...6 weeks in hospital.
-1	It's uncomfortable to go to the doctor period. I get anxious from the time I call to set an appointment, to the time I leave. Fortunately, I don't go to the doctor enough to not be anxious. I don't think it's because I fear they will find something wrong, but just that it is an uncomfortable situation.
1	My high weight and my failed gastric sleeve. I dread that the most of all.  Otherwise my blood pressure and depression
1	Obviously that there is a serious condition. I rarely go to the doctor, so if I'm there I am likely in a lot of pain and in a state of worry. So while I am there I am thinking about what could possibly be wrong.
-1	Well since you are not in the medical field  you have to rely on the doctor for some answers , you can not be to sure
-1	That he might find something or I might have something new going on. Lately I've been worried about my cholesterol. I've been wondering if my cholesterol is going down. I'm eating healthy and taking my medicine, but is that enough. I be thinking the doctor going to say my cholesterol is actually higher
-1	The only thing that makes me anxious about visiting the doctors office is that something may be wrong with me. 
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious  or worried when visiting the doctors office.th er e is nothing to fear 
1	That he or she will find something wrong with me that I did not know about. Also, that they would tell me what I am doing to stay healthy is not good enough or not working.
1	It is just an uncomfortable feeling. I don't think anyone looks forward to going to the doctor.
1	I am just anxious and apprehensive when I go into new environments and have to deal with people that I don't know and situations that are uncertain, that includes doctor's offices.
-1	that I may not have made the desired progress or that my tests will reveal some other medical issue.
1	"There are certain types of doctors that are just uncomfortable to visit.  I am fine with my eye doctor and sort of o.k. with my dentist but other doctors do make me apprehensive. I don't like being that ""vulnerable.""   This applies to general practitioners, chiropractors, etc."
-1	I feel most anxious and worried when going to the doctors because I want it over with.nerves run through a woman.
-1	I don't like to wait, I get dread when they do tests. It's never easy waiting and trying a guessing game or knowing test results.  
1	worried of my results or what they will prescribe me or what processes i will have to go through to benefit my health
1	Uncertainty.  Anything can happen. I could be walking out of there and know that I will be dead in a week or I will no nothing more than I did before. 
-1	If I have something that I know has been bothering me for a while that could potentially be major then I worry a little more about it.  If it's just a routine ache then I don't let it get to me at all.  However, if it is something that is deeper say in the chest or stomach area that could be serious then I'm more likely to worry.
-1	Only slightly anxious when getting a Pap smear done or when I was pregnant and getting checks for dilation. It's not particularly comfortable for me to have someone down there and the procedures are sometimes slightly uncomfortable.
-1	when i go the doctors office the past i was over weight diabetic for about ayear and i would get an earful everytime. this last appoint was months later and my conditions had changed dramatically. i had unknowinly dropped 20 pounds in 9 weeks with a1c 10 dropping 10 points as  well. the doctor stopped his lecturing 
-1	The only things that makes me feel anxious or worried are the results I may receive, sometimes I personally go and google my symptoms ( which isn't always the smartest thing to do) and it usually gives me some of the worse diagnosis of what could potentially be ailing me. So when I get to the doctor's office my mind is always focused on those things I've read it could be. So I be anxious to get seen to be told what it really is and worried that it's one of the things I think it is.
-1	When i have a upcoming doctors appointment i sometimes be fearful because i don't know what to expect
1	Your doctor should listen to your answers and offer you suggestions for managing your anxiety symptoms. A family doctor, however, does not specialize in mental health conditions and may not be qualified to treat you. He should provide referrals to psychiatrists or psychologists in your area that are better qualified to work with you and create a treatment plan for you.
1	I'm diabetic so I'm always worried about my A1C, and all the other things that can go wrong when you have that desease
-1	i do not feel anxious or worried when i visit the doctors office, i am always ready to hear whatever they have to tel me
1	Other sick people there, the wait times are long, whether the doctor has an accurate picture of my medical history.
1	I worry that they might find out I have a medical condition or disease that I will have to deal with. I am also nervous they might say I have not been taking good care of myself, like not exercising enough or not doing enough to watch my cholesterol.
-1	I usually don't feel anxious or worried when I visit either of my doctors. They are there to help me and I rust their descisions.
1	it makes me worried when i don't go as often as i should. So i know there is a possibility of being deficient in something that i could have prevented had i went like i was supposed to.
1	Anxiety is one of my diagnoses. I get quite anxious before I get there. Long wait times to see the doctor don't help. The doctors that rush, specifically my pain management physician, and don't seem interested in listening to me leave me feeling misunderstood. I have to fill out the same 3 forms every time I go, but I'm pretty sure that they aren't looked over. So, when I see her, I feel anxious the whole time I'm there. I don't like changing doctors, so I continue to go there. I need her services if I want to have some quality of life.
-1	Usually fear about bad outcomes or future illness.  I, like everyone else worried about what could happen.  Even though I know that my condition isn't contingent on whether I am aware of it or not, it's still bothersome to learn.
-1	Anytime I go I am worried . Its just my nature . I am a worrier . There is a lot of family medical problems . So anytime I go I cant help but worry and think about the possibilities that I could have something major wrong with me . I am worried that the routine check up will end up with me having cancer or something horrible like that . It all makes me anxious . I am also worried that we might miss something . That I forget something that I wanted to talk to her about ,so we end up missing it . I feel like she does a good job but I worry a lot about dying young like my father . The whole thing is pretty nerve racking but so far so good . She makes me feel like everything is going to be ok .
1	That I will have to spend a lot of money and I won't be able to afford however much it cost to pay off my medical bill, especially for unnecessary 
1	"I have what I would call ""doctors anxiety"".  I tend to always get nervous when I go to a doctor.  Once I'm there, and start seeing the doctor, I usually feel better and less anxious."
1	That i will get a bad diagnosis. That i may need to have an uncomfortable procedure performed. Or maybe the amount of money needed wont be enough 
-1	What makes me feel the most anxious about going to a Doctors office is having to wait for lab results. The wait always gives me anxiety because I want to know that I am ok.
-1	I'm a anxious person in general. But when I go to the doctor am a little more anxious I think just because I'm afraid she might find something bad, like cancer.
1	If I am not feeling well sometimes I'm worried that there might be something more serious wrong with me and it makes me feel anxious at times when I go see them especially when I have test's done and I go for results 
-1	I generally don't have a lot of axiety about the doctor. I do worry that when I have issues, it will end up being a wild goose chase of tests and other doctors without getting an answer
-1	I am mostly worried that my weight or blood pressure or something may not be normal and there will be further testing to be done.
-1	The thing that makes me feel the most worried is thinking about how long the waiting is going to be. I cannot stand to be kept waiting.
1	I would be worried about how I'm going to pay for the visit, and whether the problem would turn out to be something that I would never be able to pay for. 
-1	I don't usually get anxious when I see my doctor.  I might get anxious if I see a new doctor b/c I don't know how he will treat me.
-1	I don't really feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office. I believe the more positive you feel the better you will feel no matter what the news is it will be what it will be.
1	Haven't been in a long but I've been taking care of myself. And I'm not sure what come from that hopefully all good things.
1	What makes me feel most anxious in where he is with the weather is bad,I got a lot of stress on me or if I just know in my gut that something isn't right.
1	Due to the fact Iâve already had 9 surgeries on my shoulder Iâm always worried I might need more. Iâm only 25 and Iâve had 3 shoulder transplants so it always makes anxious when I go.
1	The main thing that makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor is the fact that I have to sit right next to other people that have things that may or may not be worse than what I already have. A little more space between chairs would be sufficient in my opinion. I'm also anxious when they check for other things than what I came in for .
1	The most worrying experience would be getting bad news or news about a problem that will be hard to fix. Also, getting news that will include discomfort or inconvenience.
-1	Getting on the scale and seeing how much weight I have gained since my last office visit is worrisome 
-1	Mainly just the fear of a bad diagnosis. 
1	I feel most anxious about the fact that there may be something wrong with me that I have not noticed or realized yet and that can lead me to be concerned. 
-1	well if it is not my own doctor I guess the thing I would be worried about would be judgement or not listening to me.
1	I am incredibly anxious to begin with and I'm not a huge fan of going to the doctors. I hate the unknown, but I hate bad news even more. I also get scared of being judged by the doctors and nurses. 
1	I'm most worried about the germs at the doctor's office and catching something from others. I don't want to get sick, even if I already am. 
-1	I feel anxious because I don't like needles, shots, or pricks, and I never know what to expect when I go to the doctor's office. Other than that, I am not usually too worried. 
1	Shame, afraid that I will be judged for not taking better care of myself. Anxious based on past experience when the doctors wouldn't listen to me and couldn't figure out what was wrong.
-1	I feel most anxious about getting a bad diagnosis. But on the flip side I also feel anxious that my doctor will not take my symptoms seriously and will think I'm overreacting (it's happened to me too many times).
1	My family medical history and not very great, so I am fearful that I will get diagnosed with something. Anytime I feel less than perfectly healthy I have a small amount of concern. Being in a doctors office is often an uncomfortable experience in general.
-1	I think it is a normal feeling when visiting any medical facility. I am not usually anxious about result or findings, just generally anxious.
-1	If they look at the chart, and then exit the room immediately. This happened when I had interl bleeding from a wrestling accident. I immediately knew it was more serious than I initially thought.
1	If I don't get a straight answer or the look on the Doctor's face is expressionless, which tends to get me feeling worried and anxious
-1	No really very worried. He is easy to talk to. He does seem to rush me out so sometimes I have to really think before i get in there. Never have to wait much.
-1	It doesn't really apply because I'm not anxious or worried when I go for appointments.
-1	It is not the most comfortable environment, and I may have a medical condition I am concerned about.
1	the thought of being in a doctors office makes me think of being sick and that is not something that I like to focus on
1	I am afraid of needles so Im always worried about that. I don't like getting undressed it makes me feel overly exposed. Most of all im afraid that the doctor will give me bad news.
1	I do not like the possibility of being told that there could potentially be something wrong it me. That stresses me out a whole hell of a lpt
-1	There is nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried about seeing my family physician. It might be different if I was diagnosed with a very serious illness. Then I might feel some of the negative emotions you were asking about in the previous question.
-1	When I really don't know what is wrong with me and something I see my doctor who is telling me something I know is wrong. I have never asked for a secomd opintion, but I think I will.
1	because I am just a little scared about my results that I may or may not be getting back. And that is my answer fot this question
1	Not a big fan of being around people in general,but like my father am a master of illusion.      Never worried or anxious, only phobic.
1	Just the feeling that I get when I walk in the door it's just a worried feeling like something going to happen to me or the people in the waiting room and it's always to quiet all the time 
-1	What makes me a little bit worried about visiting the doctors office is that he will find something wrong with me that I was unaware of.
1	That the doctor is going to find something very wrong with me.  I worry that if I am sick that I might have a serious illness. 
-1	Having someone poke me and hover around me. I like my space.
1	The fact that my GP doesn't listen to me.  And the fear that they find something wrong, I dont go to the doctor unless i need a physical or it is for an illness
-1	I am anxious over  the fact of trusting this person or not. Today's doctors care more about what pill they can prescribe over actually doing some work.
1	Well first I need a doctor I can trust with what happened to my body when they want to put meds in my body
1	i am always worried my blood pressure number may be bad, or he tells me i would have to go on another medication
1	The thing that i might not feel comfortable with the different tests that they do. Especially i don't like poking my hands for blood tests and i don't like the fact of them asking too many questions which might not be necessary.
-1	I am only allowed 15 minutes & I have all my questions ready to ask before I get there.  He is very patient with me & usually spends more time than than with other patients.
1	I'm always afraid something terrible is going to happen. Like the doctor will tell me that I have some terrible incurable disease
-1	I am worried if they will have to give me a shot that day
-1	But doctors can make a different kind of mistake. What I found strange when I first started running the health anxiety clinics was how many patients had been told they had a fatal disease when they did not!  Rather than making the mistake that everyone worries a doctor might make, namely missing the diagnosis of a deadly disease, their doctors worried them unnecessarily by diagnosing deadly diseases that were not present. That happened to me once. I had a swollen leg. Being a health worrier myself at that time, I had already made sure by repeatedly testing myself that I did not have the fatal kidney disease the doctor, when I finally got around to visiting him, informed me blithely that I had. I was able to dismiss his opinion out of hand.  But I have had patients who forever after worried about the disease they were told they had.
1	I get anxious and worried alot about exams and blood workm i do not like needles or shots. I am afraid of getting bad news
1	I'm worried that they won't look for what is wrong with me and think it is all in my head. I'm scared they might find something bad wrong with me and I'm terrified of having painful procedures and tests done. 
-1	I am worried with the test result.  Worried on what if I have the non cure disease of what if I'm dying.  That's awkward but it's really what I feel.
-1	I'm not quite sure what it is, but every time I go to a doctors appointment I always feel a little trepidation. Its not that I'm worried they will find something wrong with me, but there is just always this sense of anticipation. It is completely illogical, and I know it. Maybe its perhaps that even though doctors are associated with caring for one's health, they are also associated with sickness and disease. 
-1	Don't know if you going to get bad news  that always  the anxious and worry  part about the trip to the doctor offices  not knowing  what information  you going to receive  back
1	I am terribly afraid of needles. Ever since I got my blood drawn for some tests earlier in this year, I realized that it hurt me so much that I was just afraid from then on of doctors And the whole nine
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the long wait in the lobby and after waiting for so long, the doctor only gives you a small amount of time. That doesn't provide you enough time to ensure all questions and answers are given. 
-1	I feel anxoius or worried when I visit a new doctor or can tell that the doctor is not as knowledgeable about my specific condition. I have a lot of autoimmune conditions that go hand in hand and each one can affect another but if a doctor only focuses on one, he may miss something. I require experienced doctors and am more reluctant to try a treatment proposed by an less experienced doctor.
1	That he will find something wrong that is serious. I'm at the age where that could happen at any time, and I've seen it happen too many times to my friends. So I worry about it every time I go.
-1	Fear of the unknown is always the scariest part. Blood work can often reveal unexpected problems. Another thing might be that there is no known way to treat a condition. 
-1	I know I take good care of my health but with my families health history you just never know what results could be of a test you have. The waiting game is tough.
1	I think I always worry that I will have something unexpected wrong with me. There is such a bombardment of cancer awareness that it almost feels inevitable that we will all get it eventually.
-1	the waiting and getting prepare for service or physical the waiting get me anxious and the time it my tame for ,y doctor to start the process
1	"My doctor is a part of the LDS Church, and I am too, but not ""active."" He is a high council member in the Church and has pressured me and tells me I need to go to my Ward (or church). I can't make this stuff up. I felt it stepped over the line or patient/physician relationship. It make me really anxious to go to another appt with him because I knew he would know I haven't been to church, or paid tithing, etc."
-1	I am not anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. I have specific medical issues to address. I address those issues when I visit the office.
1	That they'll look down on me and brand me a drug seeker, or not believe what I'm telling them.
-1	I think what makes me feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is thinking about what the physician is going to say to me and if they physician wants to prescribe medications or have me undergo any tests, such as blood tests or sonograms.
-1	I hope that I haven't gained weight and I am always concerned about my blood pressure the worst part is just getting to the hospital traffic can be horrible
1	I feel anxious when I visit a new doctor and they do not know me or my health issues. I do not trust many doctors due to medical malpractice and the fact that some doctors just want money.
1	I am worried about what kind of conditions that the doctor might find that I don't know of. I am also worried about things like high blood sugar and type two diabetes. I wonder if the doctor is judging things about my body, like my weight. This is often something I think of, the doctor judging my weight... I feel like I even hold back from going to the doctor because of the feelings of being judged. 
1	What makes me worried is i would not like nothing to be wrong with me. I be worried that my doctor would tell me that i have a disease or something like cancer.
1	just the fact that I am at the physicians office and I know it is going to take a long time with my doctor visit. I get anxious or worried that she is going to say I have to have something done like a shot or bloodwork. I am not afraid of needles but I just do not like going to the hospital to get those things done. 
1	Well what makes me feel anxious or worry is that they might find out something new wrong bc with me n I would have to take another pill
1	The thing that makes me mist anxious is needles those sharp little pointy needles that they have makes me anxiety
1	that my DR. will tell me that my health is deteriorating, that my diabetes is getting worse and that I will have to go on insulin
-1	Getting to my appointment on time.
-1	I am worried that my A1c levels will be way too high. I try to keep my blood sugar as close to normal as I can but have been having problems lately because I was taken off of a dangerous medicine Actos
1	i dislike any procedures that involve needles or injections.  plenty of general procedures really aren't very pleasurable. there are plenty of other places i'd rather visit than the doctor's office.  
-1	I don't have anything that makes me feel anxious it nervous when visiting my doctor's office. I have no reason to
1	I usually visit the doctor's when something's wrong, so I am always anxious to find out what it is.  In addition, I fear nasty diagnoses, painful tests, or having to take some horrible drug.  I am very relieved every time I leave a health care building alive and ambulatory, as I feel that just going there presents some level of risk.  For me it's basically a choice between two evils-- the disease or the doctor.  
1	I sometimes fear that we will discover something that will have morbid consequences.  It is somewhat irrational when I have no underlying symptoms.  But I cannot help it.
-1	I have always been anxious at the doctor's office, from when I was an infant.  Nowadays, it's not so bad, but mainly the sterility of the room, and the hyper-awareness of my body, plus being poked or prodded at, makes me nervous.
1	What makes me worried is what the results are from the exam I just had.  If I am sick or have a pain and I see the doctor and he does some type of exam, x-ray, blood work, etc., then the results are what make me anxious.  
1	If there would be something in the results that was unexpected and it would create some anxiety
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried about visiting a doctor's office is that he might tell me that I have some serious disease
1	I'm always afraid they will find something terribly wrong that I wasn't aware of. Lots of issues have no warnings or so subtle you never think it's anything substantial.
1	When I'm visiting my doctor's office I feel most anxious or worried about my AC-1 reading, blood pressure, high cholesterol and my blood pressure
-1	How invasive things can be. That's what prevents me from going most of the time. I'd like to be able to discuss things with a doctor remotely (say, online) and then if a more invasive visit is needed we could arrange for a face-to-face. 
1	I'm the most anxious when I have no clue what could be causing my problem or if the doctor or nurse doesn't seem to know either. Also I get anxious if I anticipate bad news.
-1	I don't feel anxious when I see the doctor. I go in to the office with a good attitude. There is always a chance that he could find something seriously wrong,but I will face hat when it happens,not before.  
-1	Sometimes just the unknown. It takes awhile in the doctor's office to wait. Also, what if on the off  chance there is bad news healthwise? Those are things that comes to mind.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctor is the wait time. I get anxious about the price of the bill
-1	They are almost always running late. There's just something about a doctor's presence that creates anxiety.
1	I get anxious when I see my doctor because I don't know what could happen usually when someone I knows go to the doctors they tend to get bad news each an everytime and I don't like that its not kool 
1	Sometimes I go in and I know I get nervous I guess that's everybody my blood pressure goes up since sometimes you know my leg bothers me so that's where it starts at
1	I am scared because at any moment, they could diagnose me with something that is bad and it could make me get scared.  I don't want to die and they could say I have a condition that will kill me.
1	"My doctor says I have classic ""white coat syndrome"".  My blood pressure rises considerably and I am flushed when I first go in."
-1	I feel worried, because I am not sure I get the best medical advice. Some anxiety comes from realization that my doctor doesn't incentives to give me his utmost attention.
1	When visiting my doctor for a routine check-up I'm generally calm and comfortable. I feel slightly anxious concerning lab results because that's what tells the true story. Visiting the doctor due to an illness causes the most anxiety because I know something is wrong. 
-1	As I age, new health conditions occur, or a condition becomes more of an issue, which causes anxiety sometimes...
-1	Sometimes I feel anxious or worried because I don't know what to expect. I'm worried about the potential prescription that the doctor will prescribe me
-1	I felt this way becausr or seemed like the doctor didnt take the time to hear all of my symptoms and he uses a computer to give him a diagnosis for whats going on with me
-1	I do not like needles, and just about the last three or four visits, I got a shot. I hate the wait for the nurse to stick the needle in.
-1	Are they going to be on time or are they going to keep me waiting around for an extended period of time?
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when at my doctor but when it is a doctor I don't know I do feel worried .I also feel worried when they perform a test and I need to wait for the results
-1	nothing really. If im in good health I shouldnt be worried. but if there is something of concern he would take the time to explain and suggest better lifestyle choices.
1	Well personally I don't like to be touched and I don't like to be spoken to in a demeaning way. I'm very bright, I'm in a Ph.D. program for pete's sake so it makes me worried that physicians think I'm stupid but aren't even nice about it and don't try to explain in  a way that would make sense to me or don't even take the time. Also the being touched thing is obviously a huge source of anxiety as well which stems more from my personal history. Like I'm 22 and I still haven't had a pap smear because I just can't do it. And I had an older male doctor as a kid who didn't explain what he was doing and was examining me and it was just a weird and difficult experience and it's hard to advocate for yourself with a doctor when they always think they know best. Sorry this answer is so long I hope it kind of made sense! Also bruh I don't understand health insurance for the life of me so that makes me worried too. I hate spending money so having to pay $25 for a copay when I feel like the doctor didn't even do anything makes me cranky and anxious about my budgeting. 
1	I fear a bad outcome. Especially when I'm feeling unexplained aches and pains. I tend to worry and think that the diagnosis will be the worst
-1	I am worried that the doctor might find a problem that has persisted for a while but has been unknown to me because there were no symptoms. I worry that the problem could be expensive to treat, or that it might be debilitating. I am not worried about talking to the doctor. In fact, I'd rather know about a problem sooner than later.
-1	I am not anxious about the doctor themselves just about how much it is going to cost me that I cannot afford in this day and age
-1	Anxiety or worriness is not really an issue. But being realistic if a person may require needle shots or blood draw, sometimes its difficult to get used to receiving those treatments, but you know you have to do it if it is required.
-1	Just the thought of finding something out wrong.
-1	The sick patients make me worried. You go in for one thing and leave with something else. The hospital lobby is considered the dirtiest place  ever.
-1	I feel anxious at a doctor's visit whenever I think there might be a possibility of something being seriously wrong (like the time I found a breast mass) or if I feel like the visit and/or tests might be very expensive.
-1	losing my job and income is first thing comes after Doctors In a few sentences, please describe what makes you feel most anxious or
-1	Just worrying about what might be wrong with me. I hate to be sick, but I trust my doctor.
1	I have copd and it is a illiness that has no known treatments that will cure the illiness.  I know that I am living on borrowed time and I am going downhill fast. each time I see the doctor and I hear that my condition has worsened I worry about how much time I have left.
1	I worry about what the doctor might find wrong with me. I worry whether the doctor will make a mistake or whether they will listen to my concerns. I get very anxious having to wait a long time for the doctor to examine me. In that period of time, all kinds of thoughts go through my mind. 
-1	Them finding something out that could be really wrong with me. I want everything to be okay and get a good report.
-1	I have no fears or worries of any diagnosis of any conditions I may I have. I do fear the lack of being told of anything I may have or the lack of proper research into symptoms I may have. I also distrust when I have procedures done on me and I'm told it's nothing. Especially after I research the finding they found and find there is some type of alarm to the findings they came up with.
-1	I am not anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I like that I have a woman doctor because I feel I can talk to her about anything, included issues only women have. I feel comfortable if I need to be physically examined because she and I are women. I feel she better understands women's issues because she probably had/ has them two.
1	I feel most anxious when the doctor can't give me an answer right away. Whether it's due to waiting on a lab result or needing more information
1	I usually do not have anything serious wrong with me so that is not a worry. However, I am always just a little bit afraid that they will find something new is wrong with me that I didn't even know about. I know this is not likely but it is still a fear of mine. 
1	Doctors tend to have cold hands. that's the weirdest part about the doctors, is them having to touch you. I don't mind I mean they're just doing a job but its just weird. 
1	because of the unknown and also do to seeing and watching many programs about doctors do not help either this makes me jittery.
-1	Mostly I am worried about unseen or unknown health issues that might show up in an examition. If I am unsure what caused the problem that brought me to the doctor's office, I will usually have some sort of concern or worry. If I have a general understanding or notion as to what is wrong with me such as a flu, I am typically not too worried at all. 
1	I have white coat syndrome so it happens without a lot of reasons. Sometimes, I fear that they will find something wrong or that I will have something wrong that they won't catch. Cost used to be an issue but I have great insurance now. 
1	I'm worried, I won't get a solution to fix my health problems. I worry that they will judge me based on my condition.
-1	I really do not get anxious or worried when I visit the dotor so this really does not apply to me at all. I am very comfortable going to the doctor.  
1	"Can I just repeat the word ""everything"" ten times? My health keeps getting more and more... interesting as time passes. Nobody knows why I can't walk more than a few feet. Nobody knows why I'm nauseated all the time. Or why I trip over my own shadow on a regular basis. After a while, you get really tired of doctors saying to you, ""Wow, that's really weird."""
1	I feel most anxious or worried visiting the doctor's office when I feel like something can go wrong or I may hear something from my doctor that I don't want to hear.
1	Worried about any symptoms I have been having and if it might be something serious. I get anxious about blood tests because it is often difficult to draw blood without sticking me multiple times
1	When they are scowling and in a bitter mood. It's not my fault but they still end up taking out their anger on me. It greatly pisses me off. So i go home think whether or not they truly told me what I needed to hear
-1	That the doctor may be over looking something or not considering all the available treatments available for my condition.
