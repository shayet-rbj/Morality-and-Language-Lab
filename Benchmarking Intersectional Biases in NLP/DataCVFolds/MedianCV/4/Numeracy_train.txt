After working in the medical device industry for 12 years I was much more comfortable talking to the doctors and asking questions than my parents were.

For dinner I had white rice and black beans with diced tomato, cilantro, avocado, and cheese (which isn't the healthiest choice but damn if it doesn't taste good).
1	I figured out that a medication I was taking had really bad side effects and that I no longer needed it.  I'd been free of the symptoms it was treating for 17 or 18 years and the side effects included depression and blood thinning and such.  I have been off it for 2 years now and have had no ill effects.
1	I worked as a certified nursing assistant through college. I worked in the newborn unit, and learned some medical knowledge through experience.

1	Passing the CPR test in health class when I was younger took a basic knowledge of health and the techniques that were taught. 
1	I was taking medicine for strep throat that it turns out I was allergic to. So I took some bedryl to treat the side effects and went to the doctor's as I soon as I could. I'd been through enough medical scares with my children to know what to do in a situation like that.
1	When I first started college I was a nursing student

1	"Well if 85% of positive mammograms are false positives, then they aren't really good are they???? I'm proving the high fruit raw lifestyle works. Teeth have stopped decaying out of my head. Dentist would tell me to not do one of the those ""crazy"" grape diets. Yet that style of eating is the ONLY that reverses extreme acidosis in people. The amount of idiocy and low consciousness medical professiols have about human nutrition and health is ridiculous. I suppose it doesn't help that our food system is poisened with pesticides and GMO, certainly makes it harder for those who TRY, to even get well."

-1	after being told I have diabetes and learning from both my doctor and reading website, I was better able to understand and mage my diabetes. My diabetes is now what my doctor calls controlled diabetes. 
-1	When I had allergies and I had to look up online what can help treat it and went to the store and got an over the counter product that can help.

1	I learned how to draw blood from my wife because she became a phlebotomist, this is the most medical work I have learned by letter her practice drawing blood on me. 
1	I do not know. I've had a few medical issues in life but have overcome or live with the consequences of them today, so I rarely think about 'what I know'. I don't know what that means, 'demonstrate'....to who? I don't need to demonstrate to anyone, I just need to take care of myself.

So I went to the doctor and had it checked out and sure enough I had the same disease.

1	I went to the doctor with an issue that I had been having.  Because of research I had done on my own time I was able to tell the doctor what I thought was going on.  This lined up with further tests the doctor did and he was able to give me a diagnosis and treatment because of the information provided.
1	My grandfather passed away from cancer years ago. I discussed cancer and the effects of it on the human body with my parents. To this day I try to talk to them about the causes and origins of cancer with them.

-1	I had severe migraines years ago.  I noticed that certain foods would trigger them  more so than others. I found that by not eating certain foods, I could reduce them and not have to take daily medication.
1	That is really hard.  I have torn the ligaments in my ankle several times throughout my life.  So after it happening a time or two, every subsequent time I know right away when it happened, I could just tell the way it felt and I could differentiate between that and just a sprain. I have taken first aid training a couple of times.  
-1	When I was a teeger my Mother cut her hand while cooking. I immediately found something to make a tourniquet to stop the bleeding and we got her to the emergency right away. The doctor asked who did that and I said it was me. She commended me for taking the right steps to stop the bleeding and cover the wound. This demonstrated that I had knowledge that I had learned in first aid.
-1	A few years ago a friend of mine had a really bad boil. I had experience with draining and getting rid of boils. So I showed him how to drain it and it went away.

1	I was having severe headaches,  not migraine but pretty intense. I looked up probable causes so I could go to the doctor armed with proper questions and description. It was sinusitis and was cleared up pretty quick. 
1	My husband had to have major surgery a few years ago.  He was in the hospital twice for a week each time.  I studied up on all the factors around his illness, and how to help him recover when he got home.  The doctors were very helpful and caring.  
1	This is a tough one.  I have a son and there are times when I have to figure out what is bothering him and how to provide him with relief.  This is one area where my previous experiences and knowledge help me.
1	I had a burning sensation in my esophagus that lasted for days.  I called my (then) doctor.  He prescribed me something over the phone without seeing me and said it would be ready at the drug store. When I went to the drug store, there was nothing there.  I trusted my instincts, did the research on the medicine he was about to prescribe (which I would have had to take consistently for GERD).  I looked up tural altertives to this problem.  I had arugula salads, and 100% pure aloe vera juice, and the problem was gone in a day, forever. Things like this is why I don't trust doctors entirely.
1	When I gave birth to my second child, I felt I had a much better understanding of newborns and what sort of conditions might crop up. When the doctor told me he had high bilirubin numbers and was slightly jaundiced, I didn't get upset like I did with my first son, because I knew that this was a common occurrence that rarely turned out to be serious. I was able to understand what the doctor was telling me and able to enjoy my son's first few days instead of stressing out.
1	I have basic understanding of medical knowledge of simple diagnoses. Plus I can use my common sense to calculate the rest.
1	One time a coworker had a stroke at work.  She couldn't speak, but I had her squeeze my hands and one hand was barely functioning, so I knew she was having a stroke.  Somebody called 911 and I stayed with her.

1	I was trained how to heal wounds on a battlefield. I helped take care of injured passengers when a bus got knocked down on the highway. I bandaged many severe injuries using a first aid kit from the bus..
1	A friend had been given antibiotic eye drops for her son's pink eye. She told me that in the past they had worked well, but this time they were not working as quickly. I asked if her son had recently had a cold, and she said yes. I told her that some pink eye is viral, in which case the eye drops will not help.
1	I had 2 heart attacks so I learned a lot about cholesterol. I did the diet thing and exercise and it made no difference at all in my numbers. So I take meds. They work. So I learned about hereditary stuff. No much you can do but take your meds.
1	I was hearing a lot of complaints from my brother about how his stomach was bothering him. I convinced him that he should go to a doctor and have it checked out even though he couldn't afford the cost of treatment. He found out that he has a stomach ulcer and now he is doing much better from eating carefully.
1	"I always take care of my fiancee when she gets sick, giving her the right medicines to improve soon. I have no particular experiences to talk about but I have basic knowledge of what to do if you get hurt, if you feel sick, if you feel ""weird"", if you choke or stop breathing."

1	While I have my own health issues, my husband has even more of them. And since he's a bit less capable of taking care of everything himself, I am the one who takes care of coorditing a lot of his healthcare. This means compiling information for new doctors, doing paperwork, and giving information. This experience has given me the insight (generally) to know what kind of information is important to a doctor.
1	As a child I had sinus and ear infections almost monthly which led me to doctor visits very often. I believe I kept getting them because they over prescribed me antibiotics and lowered their effectiveness. Since I have been on my own I have never been to a doctor once. When I feel like I'm getting sick I rest and take vitamins and minerals. If I do get sick I just rest and get through it.
-1	A weight loss to reduce to a normal body weight through proper diet and lifestyle.

-1	I have been diagnosed with a lot of health issues that taught me about them. I used to have a lot of different issues going on, and I was on a lot of medications that I learned a lot about as well. This taught me most of what I know about health and issues.
1	I've taken a few health classes over the years - mainly in high school. Taking tests in those classes helped me to remember and establish the things I've learned through those classes, especially when I had to do research papers for those classes. It was my freshman year of high school, and I didn't save the work I was doing for much longer after the school year was over (my laptop at the time broke down by the time I went into college anyways), so I can't recall it exactly now, but I remember acing the course.
1	My daughter has type 1 diabetes. I have read extensively about this condition and the best ways to thrive with it. When we go to her endocrinologist, I feel very knowledgable about her condition and always understand what her doctor recommends.
1	I had problems with fibroid cysts and speaking to other people who have the same medical issue helped me a lot.  My doctor refused to do a hysterectomy at age 42 on me (although I already had two children and was divorced and not looking to have any more children).  I had to go to another doctor and they found I had 15 cysts in my uterus and did a hysterectomy for me.  So getting a second opinion really helped me.

So I have no medical training or expertise, but I often talked to people with diabetes and they would tell me a lot about their lives. I had a family member with no insurance who was telling me that she was having some symptoms that she thought might be diabetes. I immediately went and bought her a glucometer, and her blood sugar was way above normal. I recommended that she go to the hospital emergency room because I knew that level would be a huge deal, even for someone diagnosed with diabetes.

I have no knowledge or medical issues. as for health? same thing- experience.
1	Researching a diet that would eble me to lose weight, lower my blood sugar ( I was pre-diabetic) and lower my triglycerides significantly.  Being able to decide on a ketogenic diet after careful research demonstrated my knowledge of health issues.

1	A few years ago I sustained an energy after doing a workout that involved weightlifting. Based on the pain that I was experiencing and the sorts of movements that aggravated the pain, I was able to correctly deduce that the pain was caused by tendonitis.

1	One time my mom described some symptoms she was having, and some awful diseases her doctors were checking her for.

1	My most recent involvement with medical professiols was with the births of my daughters. Everyone was very kind, professiol, and happy to help with whatever questions we had. Otherwise, I have more or less been able to stay healthy and not have to visit doctors often.
1	I wouldn't say that I have a whole lot of knowledge, but I did convince my mother to see a doctor when she had a small mole.  It turned out that it was a small tumor and she was able to get it removed with long lasting issues.

1	I had to give a presentation about CRISPR, the gene editing tool, explaining how it's different from other methods and why it's capable of completely curing genetic diseases.
1	I don't really have much knowledge. My mind runs away with everything and makes me think symptoms are more serious than they really are. So over the years I've learned to deal with that. I suppose that's my best answer. Whenever my heart skips a beat or I get chest pains I've now learned to ignore them and that's it's just my anxiety. Problem is what if it isn't? I just hope if and when it is more serious that I'll be able to tell the difference. But as far as medical knowledge goes I have very little. The use the internet which is my best friend and my worst enemy at those times LOL.

-1	My dad had many heart attacks before he died.  I learned to recognize the signs that he was having a heart attack, early in life.  I then went and took First Aid to make sure I'd be able to help if we were every out together and he needed help.  Well, he ended up having a heart attack (his last major one) in the car with me, my mom, my husband and daughter.  I watched his behavior change and when I saw what was happening, I reached forward in the car and pushed the stick shift to neutral.  I then ran out of the car to the closest store and screamed for them to call 911 for an ambulance because my dad was having a massive heart attack.  I then got back to the car, tried to get his arms raised and undid his tie.  He couldn't respond and was having major difficulty breathing and I made sure he hadn't swallowed his tongue and gave him mouth to mouth until the ambulance came.  He did die later on that night despite everything that was attempted to save him.

My parents also relied on me to help them make the decisions regarding my father's care.
-1	I was shown ultrasound images of my lower back due to chronic lower back pain, was given options regarding addressing the back pain and/or it's symptoms and I ultimately chose micro back surgery.
1	I haven't had many experiences that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues. The closest I've probably come to having an experience like that is that when someone I know talks about a medical condition, I usually know what it is already and they don't need to explain. I also have some basic first aid knowledge if that counts, and I've used it a couple of times during my life.
1	"Years ago, I had gallstones so bad that it blocked my bile duct. I turned yellow, my urine turned brown and I was in terrible pain. I had no idea what it was, but was quickly diagnosed and rushed in to have the stones ""scrubbed"" out. Two weeks later they removed my gallbladder. Recently, a friend began complaining of similar symptoms. I ran through all my previous experiences with her and she headed off to get it checked. Sure enough, she had gallstones. I'm no doctor, but was glad my experience could help someone else. "
1	Twice in my life, my doctors have put me on medications that were bad for me.  One, I was trying to get pregnt and she told me Accupril would be safe for that.  I had asked her at least a dozen times.  I found out that was not true and stopped the meds and a month later got pregnt. The other time I was given lisinopril and told it would protect my kidneys.  My kidney function basically tanked over the next 9 months going from 99% to 43%. I did some research and found out other people were experiencing the same thing.  I stopped the drug on my own again and in 6 months my rel function was back up to 80%.

1	when i was in my 20's, i had to deal with endometriosis and infertility. i talked to doctors and everyone i could about these issues. i read books and searched the internet for anything i could find about these issues. i felt like i knew more than my fertility doctor did!
1	I know for a fact any time I pee and it is painful I have a UTI. Its something I have gotten many times before and it still happens once in a while no matter how much a try to follow all the rules for not getting one.
-1	If a family member or myself have a simple medical issue they usually ask me what to do, and I almost always can help out or at least stop them from worrying. For example, my father in law had a high blood sugar reading and I helped him get it down and advised him to get tested for diabetes
1	When playing hockey there have been times when I knew if an injury was serious or not.   It comes with age and experience and not just levels of pain.   When you learn your body you can tell when something is really not right or is just a soreness that will go away.
1	"I've been dealing with clinical depression for over 12 years. During that time I've done significant ""reading up"" on anti-depressants (been on 6) and into CBT. In fact, I just started CBT on-line [ MooyGym ]because I live 60 miles from my doctor. And I've learned a *lot* about how the brain works (or doesn't)."
1	One day in the shower, I felt a lump in my breast.  I knew that my mother and grandmother had cystic breasts and that a cyst feels round and soft compared to cancer which can feel more irregular and hard.  Although I made an appointment to go see my doctor and they ended up giving me an ultrasound and mammogram, I wasn't very concerned because I knew the likelihood that this was cancer wasn't a lot because of the things I knew.
1	I had for years digestive issues and a sour taste in my mouth in the mornings. I also seemed to have a slight cough. I pretty much knew it was GERD, but held off for years going to the doctor for it. When it got unmageable and filly went through the tests, I was correct in my thinking.
1	I had a dog who was dying of heart failure. He was on lasix and something else for a year. He slowly declined until he could no longer get around. He could only have so much lasix or his kidneys would shut down, too little and he would swell with fluid. Less than a year from that. The exact same thing happened to my grandfather. So I knew the stages that would be happening to him because of the dog's issue. Lo and behold he lived a year just like the dog and passed away the same way as the dog. 
1	I was going into surgery to get my gallbladder removed.  I wanted to know what was going to happen before, during, and after the surgery.  I did some research online.  I talked to the anesthesiologist before being put out and talked to him about the drugs he was giving me.  He asked me if I was a medical student or a nurse because of how much I knew.  I told him no, I just did my research.
1	"I have been a chronic opiate user for about 16 years. I have Hepatitis C, most likely as a result from using my same needle repeatedly when new ones were not available. I was blessed to be able to get to go to a doctor that prescribed me Suboxone (new medication treatment for heroin addiction) and because I did a lot of research on treatments for my particular issue, I knew to alert the doctor that I did have Hep C because the ""blocking agent"" in the Suboxone (keeps you from being able to experience euphoria from opiates besides the buprenorphine in the Suboxone), the loxone, has reportedly effected liver function in some people. Now the doctor is going to watch my blood labs to see whether or not I can stay on the current medicine or if I need to switch to a similar version of the drug that does not have the loxone in it."
1	I just learned some stuff through school, or just reading. I don't go to the doctor that often. I never had any major medical issues. I don't have any family members who have major medical issues either.
1	I just research stuff on medical websites, and talk to my doctors. I've had a couple minor issues in my life where I've been pretty back to back with doctors, so besides all of that, nothing really.
1	Signs of infection in a wound. I had an ingrown hair that got infected. The area got red and swollen and pus started to build up under the skin. It took a while for the wound to heal after it was excised due to build up. So I learnt about how to know when something is infected and signs and symptoms associated with it.
1	A couple of months ago, I started a keto diet. This diet is similar to the Atkins diet. The major difference is you add more fats and healthy oils. After a week or two of no sugar and lows carbs, you're body will go into Ketoisis. This uses stored fat instead of carbs for energy.
1	I was speaking with someone at my church, who mentioned that their son had scoliosis. I asked her how severe it was; what the degree of the curvature was. She was surprised that I was that knowledgeable about it, and I told her that my son had it as well so I knew about it.
-1	I remember a friend telling me he suffered from very strong headaches that made him sensitive to light and sometimes sounds. He complained that the pain was a pulsing one. You could always describe it as throbbing. I mentioned to him that it sounded like a migraine headache, something I suffer from. I told him to see his doctor to make sure, but it sounded like a migraine to me. Turns out that was what it exactly was.  
-1	When my husband was sick, he would not go to the doctor or hospital-I knew he was close to dying and called an ambulance, he had septic shock and they had to warm his blood with a plastic topping he was that close to death.
1	About 10 years ago I self-diagnosed my Autism Spectrum Disorder. I was filly professiolly diagnosed about 8 years later. During that time I learned more than the doctors who refused to listen to my concerns.
1	I had a two day stay at the hospital. I was treated for low sodium,because of a drug interaction. I had to answer a lot of questions and i learned a lot.
1	My mother was diagnosed as pre-diabetic and had blood pressure around 200. She was put on meds that turned her into a zombie, but necessarily to save her life. I read up on her medication and found that over long periods of it could have negative effects on the kidneys and had her go back in to see about a different medication, they did tests and found high amounts of protein in her urine because of the medication and was at high risk of kidney damage.
1	I was the caregiver and advocate for my father who was dying of lung cancer. I dealt with his doctors and the hospice nurses daily for many months.
1	On one of my doctor's visit, the appointment had to end early because of an emergency. The doctor didn't have enough time to explain to me in person all the questions I had, so he gave me a small booklet instead. I had no problem understanding the material without any help from healthcare professiols.
1	I have learned that the food you eat and the exercise you do are very important to your health. It keeps your body strong and your stress level low. 
-1	This may seem a bit odd, but my mother was a nurse and once told me that you can judge health by stool samples. As a result of being told this, I would not allow my children to flush the toilet until they were past the age of 10 so I could check their stools each time they went. If they had a loose stool, I varied their diet. If their stool appeared hard, I varied their diet. Also, when they had too much energy, rather than assume they needed medication, I had them exercise - it worked every time. And one other instance, my younger son was slow to talk. An in-law suggested something was wrong. I explained he had no problem communicating what he wanted or needed and, thus, nothing was wrong. I was right; she was wrong.
1	I was able to effectively communicate that an insect bite on my hand wasn't a mosquito but was a spider bite. 
1	Falling from tree, paralyzed arms, assumed broke back, walked slowly for help. 
-1	Showing my sister proper ergonomics for her while doing desk work.
1	I have self treated illnesses that most people believe you need to go to the doctor for. 
-1	i just had to listen to doctors and do research on my own
1	I've taken a few atomy classes in college. Besides that, I don't have too much experience.  
1	I honestly cannot think of such an experience.
-1	When my aunt was experiencing lymphedema, fatigue and body pain I knew that she was experiencing blockages of her lymphatic system and that she should see a doctor. As it turns out she had metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes.
-1	When my younger son was sick I remember taking him to the emergency room when he was a baby. He had a fever of 103 and it scared me! I was told that if his temperature went above 104 than to bring him in, other wise I didn't need to. So now if he has a fever I alterte Tylenol and Ibuprofen. 
1	I interned at a cancer research center where I read a lot of documents on health/medical issues.
-1	I have worked with children for over 15 years.... In that time I have seen many many cases of teething, ear infections, and even hand foot and mouth. I can spot these symptoms and many times I have told a parent I thought a child had hand foot and mouth in the very early stages and they do have it after seen by a doctor . I am also great with ear infections after my years with kids, if a kiddo is teething and fussier then normal and the parents are worried about ear infections I tell them to wait since there in not a runny nose.
1	When taking my son for a follow up appointment after getting croup, I felt I could understand and communicate with the doctor about all of the medications given and treatment protocol. 
1	I have asthma. When I was about 15 someone explained that my difficulty breathing was due to too much air in my lungs, not as it seemed, too little. I used this information to train myself to breathe in more shallowly and breathe out more completely. It seems to help when it gets bad.
1	When my aunt was sick with cancer a few years ago, I read up about information from John Hopkins to see how I could help help and then told her about it and provided literature. It showed her how she could alleviate pain through a lot of methods that I persolly assisted her with, and later it her cancer went into recession, happily.
-1	I have had a few health issues that caused me to speak with doctors.  I was always able to have my questions answered. I understood information 
1	When a friend of mine had an allergic reaction, I had helped to take care of him as the ambulance showed up. 
1	As a teeger when I felt a pain in my right side I knew that I needed to get to my doctor as soon as possible, because it could have potentially been appendicitis. It turned out to be something different, but I knew enough to get to a doctor and have them give me an examition. 
1	Someone had fallen at my place of work and was a pale yellow color and also was clutching his chest. I called 911 and had the people that were already on the floor with him trying to see if he's okay, to prop his head up and leave him still until emergency services arrived.
1	My daughter frequently has rashes and I have taken her in a few times to have them checked out but they are just eczema. Now I am able to diagnose that myself. We also are able to handle small issues at home like colds and mild fevers with confidence.
1	I worked in a residential care facility for 11 years as a certified medical aide. It was my job to dispense medication according to doctor's orders, as well as provide medical care to patients who had medical procedures done like surgeries, for example. We also had clients who would have to do certain things to prepare them for the procedures, which usually included a list of doctors orders like fasting, colon cleansing, etc.
-1	I was having inflammation in my sweat glands and I researched what my symptoms were and I found out I actually had a skin disease and my doctor ended up diagnosing me with what i had found
1	An experience that occurred that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues would be when my mother was telling my about some symptoms she was experiencing which raised some red flags. I was extremely concerned with the symptoms she was describing so I insisted she speak with a medical professiol to be examined to find out what were causing her symptoms.
1	Several years ago I was having trouble getting pregnt. I had to go through a bunch of fertility treatments including giving myself shots. I researched everything and spoke with medical professiols on many occasions. Not long after my first child was born, I had a friend going through the same exact thing that I had gone through. I was able to explain a lot of what she would have to do and what it would be like for her since I had just gone through it.
1	Nothing special, It's just migraine.
1	I've lead a very healthy life however I've had 2 brothers who both passed from cancer. My oldest brother died first and I was the only relative to be there for him. Because of that, when my middle brother passed I had a working knowledge of questions to ask the attending physicians and what to expect when the time actually came.
1	When my daughter fell and hurt her ankle, I was able to stabilize and care for her until we were able to get to a night time clinic for professiol care. The doctor on staff confirmed that I had provided the correct temporary care for her.
1	For a good portion of 2015, I was sick. I had a fever, cold, body aches, etc. at least twice a month. Last year, I started eating about five cloves of raw garlic every day. It's a killer on my breath, but I haven't been sick since.
1	I have some experience dealing with IBS which hasn't responded that well to conventiol treatment. I have been able to learn about ways to mitigate it without having to take drugs.
1	I was sick with flu and stuck on work/travel.  I filly insisted home-time so I could rest, eat fruit, granola, yogurt, and take vitamin C.  I was better in less than a day after being sick for a week.
1	I have  had issues with my teeth. due to that i have some knowlage or antibiots and pain killers. 
1	When my mother doted her kidney to my aunt, I feel like I learned a lot about medical issues. The entire family felt the need to educate ourselves on the issue. Overall, I feel like I became much more comfortable with the medical environment as a result.
-1	I recently went through surgery to remove some abnormal cells off of my cervix and this opened my eyes to better women's health.
1	I do not really know what this means. I have looked up symptoms of my SO and convinced her to filly go to the doctor.
1	In the past, I have had kidney stones. During the emergency room visit, I was given an IV of an anti-inflammatory drug. I was also told to drink plenty of fluids and was forced to urite. I was able to successfully pass the stone.
-1	When I went to the doctor and I understood what he was saying without Leigh man's terms 
1	
1	My mother is 93 years old and has dementia and my husband and myself are her caregivers. We monitor and take care of her health including her type II diabetes and blood pressure. She has had various health issues including hospitalization due to falls and from all this experience we have learned much on how to cope with and mage her health and safety as well as being aware of complications and things to monitor
1	When I needed emergency surgery after a twisted intestine due to gastric bypass I was able to follow along with what tests and procedure information my doctor was going to do and perform.
-1	My daughter has a history of passing out and when it happened the first time she had a battery of tests that told us that nothing was wrong with her. It happened several more times and while teachers and coaches freaked out when it happened, I informed them that it was likely caused by my daughter being under the weather - having a cold come on or a low grade fever - as that is what caused these episodes previously. I knew this because of the previous doctor visits and asking questions while at these visits. 
1	My youngest daughter fell and she thought she broke her wrist. It was swollen but not deformed and she was able to move her hand and fingers. I iced it and waited a day and saw no bruising, so I assumed it was sprained and not broken. I guess I could have been wrong, but in this situation I was right. The swelling went down with ice and the pain was gone in a couple days.
1	My wife burnt her arm on the stove.  I put it under cool water and then applied aloe vera to it and bandages it.
1	After i was diagnosed with Type II diabetes (three years ago) i got little to no help from my Dr. So, i took to the net and learned everything i could about it. One thing i learned is that i can deduct the fiber count from the carb count and that will be my total net carb intake.   When i was at my Dr's office and mentioned this, she did not seem to know about it or was surprised that i knew about. 
1	Strokes and high blood pressure run in the family. When my mother called and said her right eye vision was blocked like a curtain had been pulled down half way I knew we had to get her to the hospital quickly. She was having a TIA. She had many of them during her last 2 years alive. They usually lasted only minutes.
1	
1	I have given birth 4 times. Each experience was different and I had to know about what I needed to do in each situation. The options open to me for pain relief and how they could affect me and the baby. 
1	A friend of mine was displaying all the symptoms of anxiety but didn't think anything was wrong, that it was just a rough patch she was going through. I helped her and showed her medical stuff that made her go to the doctor and get treatment. She's feeling much better now.
-1	
1	I just go to the doctor and have seen people be diagnosed. I know basic stuff
1	My daughter was stung by a wasp last August. We were celebrating my ex-wife's birthday with her when this happened, and she has a tendency to panic about things. I thought she was just comforting the little one upstairs, but when I went to check she was on the phone with 911 concerned about allergic reaction. It had been long enough that it was pretty clear our daughter wasn't going to have any kind of serious 911-warranting emergency reaction so I helped the operator convince her that she was overreacting and calm her down.
1	I have a undergrad degree in human biological sciences. This degree is essentially a pre-med degree. 
1	I enjoy reading articles on health from many sources. My mother is also a doctor and tends to explain things to me about medical issues. Even if I ask her a general question, she wants to give me much more information than I asked for.
1	I had a condition in which my ear produced wax without stop. A friend of mine started having the same problem as me some years later and I was able to help him in solving the problem.
1	I remember a spring where I was constantly congested and had itchy eyes. With the knowledge I had about my symptoms and exterl factors, I guessed I had allergies or hay fever. I felt confident in knowing why my body was like that.
-1	I've had to sanitize and bandage a few of my own wounds that weren't serious enough for stitches.
1	what i typically do to help my hypertension is read a lot of nutritiol labels. i try to keep my sodium intake fairly low (a lot of salt makes me really bloated anyway) and i always look at fat and carb content. this is something i do every time i buy a packaged food that has a label on it. if it doesn't have a label, i look it up on my phone if i am shopping. this helps me be much more knowledgeable and aware of what i am eating.
1	I have taken advanced biology classes in college.  I also read a lot about health issues, so I feel I'm fairly knowledgeable.   
1	One experience that demonstrates my medical knowledge was that I lost about 30 pounds over two years and gained a good amount of healthy lean muscle. Getting fit involved learning about and counting calories, choosing healthy proteins and carbohydrate sources with enough fat, and learning about exercise. Through this learning process, I was able to lose this weight in a healthy way, and improve in my efforts at the gym greatly. 
1	In general, I have little knowledge of health and medical issues. The only thing I can think of to describe is a time in my early twenties when I went on a no-grain diet. I had read about the diet and what it entailed, and while looking back, I think it was a poor choice, I was clearly acting on knowledge (however misguided) of a health topic. 
1	My teachers spent considerable time with me making sure that I understood word problems. While I cannot proclaim to be the best, I can say that I am competent.
1	I worked as an Arizo Paramedic for 10 years
1	I had a knowledge of health issues when I saw a spot on my mom's hand. I knew the ABCD method of detecting skin cancer, so I told my mom she should get to a doctor because it fit all the criteria. Sure enough, the doctor said that it was skin cancer after he performed a biopsy and she had surgery to remove it. Luckily it was still in the early stages, but the doctor said I should be proud of myself for noticing and knowing the criteria, because if I had just brushed it off, it could have gotten a lot worse. 
1	calling 911 when I had a heart attack
1	My husband is a T1 diabetic, my daughter was born with spi bifida and my grandmother is blind. I have a lot of experience with hospitals, doctors, and their forms.
-1	MY HUSBAND WAS FEELING DIZZY AND FELT WEAK. KNOWING THAT MY MOM'S FAMILY HAD LOW BLOOD SYMPTOMS AND AFTER CHECKING HIS BLOOD PRESSURE, I KNEW HIS SUGAR WAS LOW. SO, I GAVE HIM ORANGE JUICE.
1	I had bronchitis and was told to take a medication. I took it as instructed and the symptoms went away in about a week. But, I continued to take the rest of the medicine as instructed, despite feeling good.
1	When I was diagnosed with asthma, I had no idea what it was and it really tested my knowledge.
1	My friend broke his arm a few years back. I was the only one around so I made a splint out of sweater and some wood. When we got to the ER, the nurse complimented me on my splint.
-1	Well one occassion where i was having severe headaches everyday for about a week without stopping i knew something was wrong. I went to the doctor and i already was hoping for them to do a head scan to see what was wrong. They showed me i had severe chronic migrane and i needed to start taking a few medications . I totally understood everything when it comes to my health and how much i know my body
1	I went with a relative to the doctor for a medial emergency. The doctor made assumptions and gave them the wrong diagnosis. They began ordering all kinds of tests that were for the wrong things. I told them what to really check for based on the symptoms and I was correct. They canceled the tests and changed the diagnosis. 
1	I was a witnes of a car accident,two weeks ago. I stopped to look after the drivers and there were no bad injuries at first look.One of them was limping and complained about some pain in his leg.I told him to sit down ot lie down,while we were waiting for the ambulance.
-1	When I decided to get into shape. I did all my due diligence and learned the value of eating clean and exercising regularly. By learning to restrict my calories and exercising to create a caloric deficit. This not only helped me drop the pounds but helped with my asthma. 
1	I have two elderly parents who live part time in Florida, where I live, and I am usually called upon to help them if there are any serious health issues that come up as the rest of my family lives up north. I have more than once had to spend time in the hospital as the only receiver of their health info for the family.
1	My child was sick and caught croup. My wife freaked out and said we should go to the hospital, I told her there was nothing they could do and to just make a doctor's appointment instead.
1	When dealing with my children I have to fill out all there medical forms and deal with there illnesses or injuries.   I would say just having children you learn a lot by raising them about what is severe and not.  You know when the doctor needs to be called or visited.
-1	When I was twelve years old, a drunk driver hit the car my mother was driving while I was in the backseat. I have very few memories of the accident, but I do faintly recall a serious but calming face as I was gently lifted out of the car. The paramedic held my hand as we traveled to the hospital. I was in the hospital for several weeks and that same paramedic came to visit me almost every day. During my stay, I also got to know the various doctors and nurses in the hospital on a persol level. I remember feeling anxiety about my condition, but not sadness or even fear. It seemed to me that those around me, particularly my family, were more fearful of what might happen to me than I was. I donât believe it was innocence or ignorance, but rather a trust in the abilities of my doctors
1	when i found a lump in my right chest  just below my nipple. I knew that breast cancer is rare for males, but not impossible. So i went to the DR. to find out what he thought. He fealt it was nothing major, but had tests done just to make sure, which i figured was likely when i went in.
1	A few months ago my son had a sinus infection. After trying traditiol over the counter options we had little result and made a doctors appointment so that we could get an antibiotic. The doctor confirmed that it was a good idea to try to clear it up without antibiotics first, but that he would most likely need them at this point.
1	I guess I would return to my earlier statement in that I am a mother who spent a lot of time dealing with everyone's health issues in my family. I have also taken care of helping my parents because they are aging and get confused. I wouldn't say that I feel completely comfortable with everything related to health decisions, but if I have questions, I ask and I also do a lot of research before I make decisions. I have had to do additiol testing in the past for health issues, and I felt comfortable with my choices after I dug deeply into the issues myself. Ultimately I am the one who wants to decide what happens to me, either good or bad.
-1	i was diagnosed with high colestoral, I was given Lipitor and took the drug as proscribed.  On the next vist to the doctor my colestoral was within acceptable limits
-1	I do not have much medical knowledge.
1	A co-worker cut his leg at work one night and was bleeding like a stuck pig.  I got a flatbed cart and told the boss.  I ran with the cart to my co-worker, had him lie on the cart holding a towel to his leg to apply pressure, and got a cardboard box for him to elevate his leg.  By the time the boss got there, he was ready to transport to medical.
-1	I was able to detemine if some one has a cold has opposed to an allergy, by the type of symptoms and the pollen count at the time.
1	I used to work in a pharmacy and was presented with various customers on a daily basis that would have questions about recommendations for various ailments. I had confidence in my ability to direct them to different over the counter medications. Of course, however, there are limits to what I was legally able to say to them. 
1	I was discovered to have high blood pressure a few years ago.  I started taking medication and my BP was lower but I felt terrible.  No energy at all.  So I went back to the doctor and described my symptoms so he put me on a different pill and now I'm doing fine.  I guess that demonstrates my understanding of making sure I get the right medication for me.
1	My college did a free health screening that I participated in, and while I was being explained my results I was able to correct the medical student on several items.
1	My father is a doctor and my mother is a nurse. I'm not the best with math however. 
1	There was a time that I fell and hurt my wrist. I couldn't twist my wrist or bend it without pain and I knew that it was more than just a sprain. I figured it was broken and so I went to the hospital to have an x-ray.
1	I got bit by a tick and contracted Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever so I went and looked it up and learned as much as I could about it and even offered information to my own doctor.
-1	Probably when I had to go for lab work and had to find out about my thyroid. I knew I had a high TSH level, but my Free T3 and my Free t4 was insanely low too. So I had to tell my doctor about those and she was shocked and said I was right. So now we not only look at my TSH , we also look at my Free T3 Free t4 too. Because you can have a normal TSH but have low Free T3 and Free t4 in hypothyroidism. I feel my best when my levels are optimal, not just normal.
1	When reading the paperwork on a new medication, I discovered that it was Not advised in someone with my other conditions. Called and told the doctor.
1	Every time I go to my doctor I have long conversations about health and medical issues. Sometimes I even remind him of new ways of doing certain procedures. For example, a few years ago I went in to get tested for STD's. I did not have any symptoms but anytime I am sexually active I get tested. Before the test was given I reminded my doctor that bacterial STD's can now be tested through urine and the old invasive procedure was no longer necessary.
1	I honestly only think of times my children were sick, just knowing from experience what was a serious symptom and what most likely was not.
1	I have high cholesterol that I mage with diet, exercise and homeopathic remedy Polycosil. I understand that my LDL is very good, so that helps my HDL even though it is over 200. I get annual blood tests and track my HDL and LDL and compare it to weight. My doctor and I also discuss these results. As long as my LDL stays high, I do not need to start taking a statin to reduce my cholesterol.
1	"At one point, I was reading on the appearance of ""floaters"" in one's field of vision out of curiosity since I experienced them very irregularly.  Within a few months, my mom complained to me that she was seeing them very frequently, and I tried to explain to her the potential causes for them, including retil tearing.  Because of this, she went to the doctor and was told she had almost experienced a severe reti tear in one of her eyes."

1	One of my daughters was born with heart defects (ASD, PDA, Coarc) - I got a crash course in medical issues during her 2 heart surgeries.
1	Last summer I had some strange symptoms that fit the description of a heart attack. Though I'm relatively healthy and young I went to the hospital anyway, and what followed was two days of test and abnormal results and medical jargon thrown at me from every direction. I was moderately able to figure it out and to start offering other symptoms that I had experienced previously but didn't think could be related to help the doctor filly make a diagnosis. 
1	I have a minor in Community Health so I am a bit more in tune with medical issues than most. Whenever I have any medical problem I research it on the internet heavily so I usually know quite a bit before getting to the medical office.
1	I have high cholesterol myself and educated myself on the effects of statins and eating right when I discovered that I had it.
1	The 2nd time I got cancer I pretty much knew what I would have to go through. I knew it was not going to be fun and I knew I would have tons of tests .It was not a good time in my life.
1	It was just a few days ago, I got a sore throat. I knew I gargle warm water with salt it would go away. Then few days later, no more sore throat.
1	I got a job at 22 at University of Michigan Medical Transcription department that paid well because I passed the medical terminology test (my mom is a retired nurse and my dad is a retired hospital administrator).
1	When I asked to be induced with my first son.  I knew something was not right.  My glucose test came back fine but I had every symptom of GD and the OB would not listen to me.  Once my due date hit, I was able to be induced.  At the time of delivery, I had gained 100 lbs, had a ton of swelling, high BP, extreme thirst and ended up having an 11 lb baby,
-1	well i try my best stay out of the hospital  and keep from being sick  i like to stay in good health

I was thought I knew the causes so I asked them if they were running everyday and if they continued running after pulling the muscle. When they answered yes on both counts I explained that they needed to add rest days to their routine and that the hip pain was the result of the body making unconscious corrections in running style due to the pulled muscle. I recommended they take a week off to heal up and some NSAIDs to keep swelling down. The recommendations were effective.
1	I had an experience with a situation where my husband was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and was medically induced/placed in a coma.There was no action on the part of the team at this hospital to help correct the problem.

He was airlifted to the facility and recieved a coilb procedure to seal of the bleeding. He survived.
1	I really don't know how to answer this question. I really can't say I've had an experience that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues. If I have a problem, I will either make an appointment with a doctor, or I will research online and probably attempt to treat, avoid or ignore whatever issue I am facing depending on its severity.

1	I woorked in a hospital as a night shift computer operator. Part of my function was to print the bills. What an eye opener as to the horrible cost of medical care in the US.

What a mess!

1	I was given a course of antibiotics to take for 20 days.  Even though I felt better after 3 days I continued taking the medication because I knew the bacteria may still be present even though I was no longer feeling the symptoms and stopping early could increase the chances of creating a drug resistant form of the bacteria.
-1	I am 41 with three kids. I have a mother who gets sick, my grand parents who have been in an out, and those who i interact with on facebook., My knowledge of medical is really based on what i have had explained to me within those visits. I use to enjoy watching medical shows like ER, because I feel like I was able to learn something. 
1	There haven't really been any experiences like that. I don't want to make anything up. I've been to a doctor like 3 times ever and I never had to do anything to demonstrate my knowledge.
1	When my dog was sick I figure out that we was either allergic or was having a reaction to certain kinds of food. He had symptoms similar to allergies. 
-1	when i get a cold i know that things to do to get myself well. i know the foods to eat. i know to rest and what medicines to buy.
1	About two years ago I awoke one morning with a large bump on my back.  It was very painful and pus was oozing out of it.  I went to the minute clinic because that was fast to get into.  The lady just said it was probably a bug bite and nothing serious.  I hadn't ever had a reaction like this to a bug before and knew that where the bump was, on my back near my spine, that I needed to get another opinion.  I got into my normal physician about five hours later.  he said it was good that I came in because it was severely infected and the infection area was getting very close to my spine and getting into my blood stream.  If I hadn't known something was worse than was diagnosed at the minute clinic I could have easily ended up in the hospital.

This progressed to affect my nose, left foot toes, and sometimes my nipples, with severe episodes causing my fingerils to develop waves and my fingers to develop painful lesions that scarred. I researched and figured out that I have Rayud's syndrome and that constriction in my blood vessels was likely due to stress, cold temperatures, etc. Through diet and exercise, I have reduced the number of episodes that I have. 
1	I am overweight and I am always told that I probably have diabetes before they ever test me. They always just assume and I tell them every time that I don't. I do not have any of the common symptoms of diabetes besides the fact that I am overweight. In the end they are always shocked that I turn out to be right and that diabetes is not the problem.
1	Years ago I had problems with my stomach. Based on the symptoms, I was pretty sure that I knew what the problem was. After double checking online, I was even more sure, so I went to the doctor. It turns out that I was right and the doctor let me know that it was good that I came in when I did, so he was able to help me.
1	I have borderline high cholesterol.  Although the doctor did not go into detail with me about my cholesterol levels, I understand the relationship between HDL and LDL and triglycerides to know that my high cholesterol reading is not necessarily alarming.  I also understand what I need to do to improve my cholesterol reading and independently (without medication) took some measures that lowered my cholesterol level by 11 points over a year.

1	I was diagnosed with diabetes three years ago. I took a diabetes education class at the local hospital and did lots of research on my own about diabetes. With this knowledge, I was able to learn steps I can take and things I can change about my lifestyle to help me mage the diabetes. Through carrying out these changes I lowered my A1C considerably and brought it back into the normal change. It has stayed there and my blood sugar levels have been consistently in the normal range. This is partially a result of the medication I now take but also a result of eating a much better diet and exercising more, which I learned how to do through my research.

Turns out, my daughter had developed an allergy to tree-nuts. My husband is deathly allergic to eggs, so I had an idea of what a food-allergy reaction looked like & how serious it COULD be. I'm also aware that allergies can develop or fade away at any age, or stay the same for life.
1	i honestly dont know what to put here, i dont feel ive ever shown something like this in a significant way
1	My child had been ill with a fever, random usea and fatigue. After the fever and usea had passed, he was still extremely fatigued and had swollen glands.

The area that was in pain and her symptoms lead me to believe she had a hernia or cyst that was causing the pain. After she was admitted it turned out it was a cyst that cause the pain. It was nothing serious as I kept telling her. 
1	I have been able to diagnose and override a doctor when my brother was on the clinic, and It turned out that I was right.

1	I felt that I was going to faint after I had spent a long time standing up in a particularly hot office. I had had similar experiences  before, and had researched the subject of the vasovagal response and the best action to take in that situation. I quickly got to the ground, elevated my legs, and tensed my leg muscles as I had researched.  As a result, I didn't faint and was able to stand up again and resume work shortly afterwards.
-1	The most important experience was when I took my state board exams for my PTA license. I had to be well versed in medical terminology as well as diseases and the causes and treatment for each one. Most important was knowing what muscle controls what part of the body. 
-1	I worked as a medical transcriptionist in the radiology department at my local hospital. I had to type doctor's dictations regarding patient x-rays, MRI's, CT scans, and ultrasounds. I learned about a lot of health and medical issues from typing these reports, such as broken bones, spine or joint conditions, and many types of cancer.
-1	When I had my first heart attack I was in really bad shape. When I got out I was given all of these different types of exercises to follow every day in order to keep me in tact with my health.  It was difficult to keep up with. I had to get family to help me out with my schedule.  I learned so much during this trial about things I didnt even know about my own body and health. 
1	The second time that I got pregnt I felt as though I had a great knowledge of the process. This is the only medical issue that I am very familiar with. Now that I have friends who are pregnt I get to show my knowledge.

1	I have not had many experiences in my life to help my knowledge of health or medical issues. I am studying to become a nurse, so I have taking a couple of Atomy and Physiology courses that have helped a bit. My grandmother is also a nurse, and I am sure just talking to her has had a little bit of an effect on my understanding.
1	Most of my knowledge of health issues would have to be because of my husband who has several of the health issues that you listed in your examples/questions above. He has diabetes, high cholesterol, has had stints put in twice and was diagnosed with prostate cancer, high blood pressure and others. He doesn't fit the norm for most of these, not overweight, gets plenty of exercise and is active, etc. So I have learned quite a bit through his treatments and issues. 
1	A couple of years ago, I had some kind of a bump on my upper leg. It kind of freaked me out, not knowing what it was and how it developed. But instead of worrying too much about it and running to the doctor I just watched it to see if it began to hurt or get bigger. I didn't want to scare myself or my family too much about it so I just waited. I also didn't look anything up online, knowing that that would only make me much more anxious and scared. Eventually, it went away, as I believe it was just from stress or something.
-1	Once I had a tiny growth on my thyroid. One doctor (who was slash for cash happy) wanted to rip it out. In light of the fact that I'm a singer, I instead elected to monitor it once a year. There has been no change in the 6 years I have been monitoring it.

-1	I was diagnosed late in life with beta thalassemia minor; up until that time I had always been considered anemic but no one ever considered the cause.  With my current doctor he asks for blood tests every 6 months.  Every time he discusses the results with me he gets concerned about the anemia.  Every single time I have to remind him that it is the thalassemia minor which is NOT treatable, especially not with iron supplements.
1	When my father was still around, he tripped over a shovel in the backyard. he couldn't get up, so he called me with his cell phone. I only lived about 10 minutes away so i drove over and entered through the backyard. his ankle was swollen pretty badly. So I helped him up and brought him inside. I knew we probably had to take him to the hospital to get it checked out, but him being a stubborn old man, he refused. I had him sit in a chair and brought another chair over so he could elevate his leg. I put a pillow under his foot and taped an ice pack around his ankle. We them argued for about 15 minutes about going to the doctor and I eventually convinced him to talk to an advise nurse. The advice nurse told him to elevate his leg and keep it iced. If it didn't improve within a half hour, to come in to be checked. 3 hours pass and nothing improved, so I eventually got him to agree to go to the hospital.

1	I have persolly been through two surgeries, one was an adenoidectomy and the second was to remove my gall bladder. My sister is also a nurse and we have discussed different medical issues. I also remember my experiences with my grandmother and her fight against cancer and diabetes.
1	Having children made me a pseudo expert in diagnosing health issues and adding to my health knowledge. Many times, my children would exhibit symptoms and if they appear benign enough I would go online to check symtoms to self diagnose. While doing that, I've read up and gained a lto of knowledge on many different illnesses and its treatments. 
-1	i think just going to the doctor all these years and listineing to her has really educated me in so many things but i google a lot of symptons too and learn a lot fron the internet web md

My son was in a coma for thirteen days, I gained some knowledge while he was in the hospital. I do not think I have a great deal of medical knowledge. I did sell health and life insurance for a few years so I know some of the terminologies but not that much on what each condition details.

As a person who is treated for depression, I have read up a great deal about the condition, where I even volunteer to counsel other who also experience depression.

Her stomach pain went away for several years before flaring up again.

On Friday, the doctor had me come back to the office for a check up.  I asked if I had been given RhoGam (since I have A+ blood) and was told I was not.   The day I was seen was right before the office was going to close for the Easter weekend.  Had I not asked about the RhoGam and had they not rushed to filly give it to me, the 72 hour would have been missed due to the Easter break.  This doctor knew my blood type but ""forgot"" to give me RhoGam until I asked for it!"
1	I hurt my wrist and had to decide whether or not to make an appointment with my doctor or go to the emergency room at a hospital. I called my doctor and described my symptoms. They asked me about the location, appearance, and other details, and I chose to make an appointment rather than go to a hospital.
1	I used to have to help my grandmother often with her diabetes issues so I am familiar with what most people typically have to do. One day while I was at work, an older coworker of mine started to feel faint because of low blood sugar. I was able to get her something to eat and helped her restore her blood sugar levels back to normal.
1	This one here has; it's likely shown how inept I am at math.
-1	When I had a bunch of fertility tests done. I had to go over everything from my cholesterol to vitamin deficiencies. 
1	My son had a sore throat recently.  He had the sniffles due to allergies and I thought that was the issue at first, but when I took a flashlight and looked at his throat, it was very raw.  Also, he was running a low grade fever.  I knew it must be strep.  Sure enough, the doctor confirmed it.  
-1	I have had a lot of UTI and kidney issues over the years. i was diagnosed with a UTI a few years back and took medication for it but i didn't feel that was right and kept researching my symptoms. Everything was pointing to stones and a few days later i passed a kidney stone. I learned all about the causes, effects, and preventatives to kidney stones
1	"I guess I would have to say one of the million or so times I had to deal with medical situations with raising three sons.  Looking back, it seems like one or the other of them was always hurt or sick!  They did keep me on my ties.  if we had ran to the doctor every time they ""stubbed a toe"", I would still be paying off doctor bills."
1	I have worked in a parasitology lab.  This has given me the knowledge to know the symptoms of various parasitic diseases as well as the ability to positively identify various blood stage parasites in blood smear. 
1	I once had a severe earache. I also had a sinus infection. I deduced that I had an ear infection. The doctor confirmed I had an ear infection.
1	My son has minor asthma symptons so I did some research and ended up understanding the causes and treatments.  There was a time when my son was having some chest pains and having a hard time breathing.  I couldn't find his inhaler so I had him stand in front of the freezer where I learned that the cool air helps with the breathing.  
1	One experience I had that showed my knowledge of health issues was dealing with the hospital when I had a kidney stone. It took 8 visits to get them to listen to me, and search what should have been the first step. I knew they were wrong, and being neglectful, so I pressed them further, and made them do their jobs.
1	I actually had a bacterial infection in my lungs and had went to a doctor who claimed it was a cold. I tried telling him I had no symptoms of a cold and he would not budge and told me to get some Robitussin or something similar. I ended up going to ER where I was diagnosed with a bacterial infection and receive the proper anti bacterial  medicine and within  two days the cough started to subside. Most Dr's just don't bother to spend the time anymore to ask and simply generalize what they think it is based on whatever may be widespread at the time as opposed to your symptoms.
-1	I will say it was when grandmother was diagnosed with brain cancer. Her brain swelled up and there was a medication that could be given her to lower the inflammation on the brain but she had diabetes and this will increase the glucose level. She was 75 years old and I expl to the doctor that based on what I read online the chances of her going into a diabetic coma were almost none. Based on what I read there is a little chance of a person with a high glucose level who is over the age of 70 going into a diabetic coma almost non existing and also she was going to die anyways, the tumor was not operable and it did not respond to radiation.
1	I was quite athletic when I was growing up. Did a lot of weight training and exercise physiology. When I injured myself and had to go to physical therapy. Everything that the therapist was talking about made perfect sense to me, and the verbiage and actual motions used during the exercises were all ready within my muscle memory.
1	I just listen to what my doctor tells me.  If I don't understand, i just ask questions.  I saw my doctor, last week for a check up.  this applies then.  I have no real knowledge of health or medical issues.
-1	I just do a lot of research. I read a lot of books on medicine, illnesses and the medical profession and ethics. I watch a lot of documentaries on the topic also and my mother was a nurse.  
1	I was able to take a basic health class and passed it with a high grade, as well I have learned CPR and basic nutrition. I am able to take my own blood pressure and keep records of it and take my basic vital signs.
1	I helped my mother through a breast cancer fight and pallative care for pancreatic cancer.
1	I felt congested and had pain in my chest.  I could feel it when I inhaled.  There was a gurgling sound.  I went to the doctor and told him I had pneumonia.  He said he'd be the judge of that.  When the x-rays came back.  He agreed.
1	I have ran many marathons successfully and taken care of all recovery that had to do with it without any outside help.
-1	Well, my parents is not very healthy person.  When their was sick, I always took them to see the doctor.  That doctor later become my neighbor and friend.  So he kind of explain and teach me about the medical issues. 
1	I demonstrate my medical knowledge from what I learn from my doctor to other people when the topics come up, for instance with my other friend's children are sick or hurt.
1	"I recently learned I have the MTHFR genetic defect from both parents (homozygous). I researched the genetic mutation issue and came to understand that my body does not ""methylize"" properly. In particular, my ability to convert folate to a useble form is compromised by about 70%. This has an effect on the efficiency of many methylation and detox pathways in my body. This also means I am more suspectible to certain health issues (fertility issues, depression, heart and vascular disease, Parkinson's). Some experts believe there are dietary and nutritiol options that can help to offset some of the effects of the ""mutation."" I am pretty well versed in what they are at this point."
1	I have never had an experience like this before. 
-1	when I was having an extremely hard time breathing I knew something was wrong, I went to the hospital and discovered that I had two PE's in my right lung. I knew it was more than my asthma and I knew it was in my right lung.
1	My daughter has had recurring fevers over the last few years. We've been to our pediatrician and specialists multiple times trying to discover the cause. It's led me to do significant research on auto-inflammatory syndromes, comparing her symptoms to those of the various recognized disorders. While certainly not a doctor, I feel fairly knowledgeable on auto-inflammatory disorders as a result.
1	Recently I've seen that I have more health problems if I sleep less, and my health is better if I sleep more.  So I've been trying to sleep more because sometimes if I sleep less my ear starts hurting.
1	I was feeling a shortness of breath. The doctor thought I was having an asthma attack but here it was just because I had not excericsed in a while and this was catching up to me. I had to slowly bring my excercise up rather than jump in right away.
1	I had a pain in my neck that was getting worse and I figured it was because I was using my tablet and my head was at a angle that was causing me problems. I started setting my tablet at different angle and over the course of a couple of weeks my neck pain faded and then completely went. If I would have still had the pain after a couple of weeks I would have went to the doctor, but since that time I have never had any problems with it again.
1	when my husband had to have surgery i had to help him fill out the paperwork and try to explain to him when was going to happen and how i would take care of him
-1	I have completed a c program several years ago, I have also taken a medical terminology course and enjoy medical tv shows.
1	i sometimes kinda diagnose my aliments using google,however i am not very good at it. when i was a teeger.my girl friend at that time was babysitting a 7 year old boy,who fell off a swing and broke his arm.she called me first since i was only a few houses away,and asked me what to do.i went over there and his arm had a u shaped fracture.i told her to call an ambulance.thats it,thats all i got.
1	I learned knowledge of health or medical issues as I was raising my children.  Also my parents had health problems early on because they smoked, ate food that was high in cholesterol so I've learned what not to eat and to exercise to stay as healthy as I can.
1	When I talk with doctors, I seem to understand medical terminology. I notice how similar conditions have similarities in their me. Also, I notice that drugs that control similar aspects have similar pre- or suffixes. 
-1	I take my kids temperature and if its high i give them medicine.
1	I had leg swelling, and red blotches above my ankles, so I went to a clinic that open.  The doctor there told me that I had cellulitis, but I didn't think so because there was too much pain involved.  I decided to go the hospital ER and get a different opinion.  After the results of the tests, I was informed that I had three blood clots in my outer vein.  I was given antibiotics and a list of doctors to see for the recommended surgery.
-1	I get migraines so it's interesting to see what causes it 
1	Sometimes the math of medicine is a little bit confusing and you have to be very careful not to make any mistakes.
1	I was being evaluated for high risk pregncy due to a blood clot early on.  I had done a lot of research prior to visiting the doctor so that I would have knowledge to understand what the doctors were going to recommend in relation to how my pregncy would progress and how my birth would be.
1	I was able to lose weight a few years ago when I realized that I needed to. I lost about 30 pounds, which was my goal. I accomplished this weight loss by avoiding junk food, eating more fruits and vegetables, and walking every day. I still follow these healthy routines so I can stay fit and healthy.
1	When my son broke his hand and required surgery I needed to be able to understand the doctor as well as the aftercare, etc.  
1	I did my own research on some skin conditions. After successful application of ointments I discovered during my research I felt quite competent about self-treatment of those skin conditions.
-1	I worked in the service as a nurse aid and learned a lot about the basics
1	I was trying to figure out my results from a blood test.  Much of the information was abbreviated or included terms I was not used to, so I would use the internet to look up the definitions to help determine the results.
1	I was diagnosed about 10 years ago with possible cervical cancer.  The doctor sent me in for a myriad of tests.  I filly had to have surgery to remove the cells that were cancerous.  I followed up ahead of time on all the possible outcomes and any side effects.  Surgery was the best outcome to remove the cells and not have it spread.
1	I had two C-sections. Once when I was 23 and one when I was 27. After the first one I tried to look up a lot more information about C-sections and surgery in general, because I figured I would need another C-section with my second child. I was a lot more informed by the time I had my second C-section, which made the process a lot easier and more comforting for me. I knew what was about to happen, so I did not have to worry as much as I did with the first C-section.
1	My fiance was out of town visiting family and he started feeling sick. Each day that I talked to him he sounded worse. I filly convinced him to go to an Urgent Care and he was diagnosed with an Upper Respiratory Infection.
1	I don't know a lot about health or medical issues.  When I have questions I refer to professiols or any other reliable source of information.
1	I found out I have Restless Legs Syndrome a few years ago. My doctor had some recommendations, but I did a bit of my own research and found out that low-normal levels of ferritin (stored iron) can exacerbate it. I was then able to follow up with the doctor and get a ferritin test, and confirmed that I should reduce my frequency of doting blood and take an iron supplement when I do. That helped reduce the intensity of my RLS symptoms.
1	I can comprehend health materials as I am very good in science and math. I always look at ways to reduce my risk.
-1	When I was younger I had a terrible problem with heavy menstrual flow, cramps and fibroids. I did my own research, and worked with a conventiol and altertive health care professiol to obtain the results I needed to get rid of the problem. Today I am fine and in great shape.
1	Using online resources I determined that I had a zinc deficiency. So I purchased a zinc supplement and shampoo containing zinc to improve my general health. 
-1	i was shoot in the leg and i know to tie my leg up to stop the bleeding
1	The increasing pain, stiffness and swelling in my big toes and ankles was an indicator that I had a problem with arthritis, since it was persistent but fluctuated in intensity depending on the weather, not due to trauma or recent injury, and consistent with the development of arthritis in my aunt when she reached the age I'm at now.
1	Getting preventive care and treatment.  Understanding the blood work data, the colonoscopy and all related.  To be able to know what I needed to improve on and to watch.
1	When I was told I had high cholesterol not only did I understand the changes I would have to make I also further researched the issue to make sure I was on the best diet and treatment possible and brought up with my doctor a couple of concerns I had. I was proactive in trying to understand this issue and with work, I did.
-1	When I started breaking out in like a rash and skin kept growing I thought it was psoriasis based on what I had seen before and I turned out to be correct when I went to a dermatologist.
-1	I told my mother to get a flu vaccine as I knew it was helpful.
-1	I whought I had a sinus infection, went to the doctor, and that was confirmed 
-1	I am learning about health and medical issues every day. I have several medical problems that I see a doctor about monthly and I frequently have to go to specialists for this test or that.
-1	I received training as a home health aid and participated in certifications such as CPR and First Aid training.
1	My best friend found some thickening bellow her collarbone. I told her to immediately go to the doctor because I knew there's a big possibility that it's a breast cancer. It turned out to be nothing scary but the doctor told her that I gave her a good advice.
-1	We often have health fair's at our church and when i checked a child's temperature it was at 102. I knew this was kinda high and alerted the nurses. 
1	After an off-road motorcycle mishap I knew that my leg was seriously damaged.  My leg had been wrenched around under the heavy bike, and I had actually heard a sp.  Once we were able to get the motorcycle off my leg it was obvious to me that there was a serious fracture, perhaps a compound fracture, as any movement would result in a feeling of bone grating together.  I decided that the best thing to do was to keep my tall, heavy boot on to stabilize the lower leg.  I was uble to walk due to the pain, so my friend carried me to the shade so that I'd be out of the hot sun and we elevated the limb.  He went for help leaving me with food and water, I was hungry, but resisted eating much in case surgery would be necessary when I ended up in the hospital.
1	This is a tough question for me.  I dont ever remember an expeience that has demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues.  There were a few times when I knew that one of my children needed to see a doctor, but in these times, my knowledge was intuitive rather than inherant.
1	Not sure if this is what you are looking for but true story. A few years ago I experienced severe pain in my feet that lasted for weeks. I looked up the symptoms and was reasobly sure it was something called plantar fasciitis (sp?). It HURT. I went to my doctor and he agreed with my assessment. Unfortutely there doesn't seem to be an effective treatment other than stretching and not walking (or walking as little as possible) for many months to allow the muscles in the foot to heal. Near the end of the appointment my doctor offered me a shot of cortisone for the pain. I was surprised and promptly refused. The problem with the cortisone shot, in my opinion, is that it simply masks the pain and might lead me to overdo it during a time when I needed to rest, thus making the injury worse instead of better. It took over a year for the problem to go away. Even though I suffered through the pain I feel I made the right choice because the cortisone shot might have made the recovery last even longer!
-1	I saw him live with my mom
-1	I cannot actually say that I can. After basic stats like one out of ten are mingled with ideas like false positives I lose confidence in my ability to be certain of their meaning. I think I actually deal in comparative strategies like value judging. For example 30% blockage of an blood vessel sounds terrible in and of itself but if the info accompanying that is stents are not used until 55% then that is how i gauge it.
-1	when my boyfriend was complaining about symptoms in his hands, i suggested that he had carpal tunnel. i knew this because my mom had similar issues with her hand/wrist and it was very likely carpal tunnel. he went to the doctor and he indeed had carpal tunnel. 
1	I have a family with a medical background on both sides of the clipboard.  This survey is mostly simple math.
1	Knowledge of my medical condition has helped me to avoid putting myself in a situation where I would be endangered. I know that I will put myself at risk if I do certain things that would increase my heart rate. I also need to slowly raise my health level through proper eating and strengthening myself to make my heart work less. Therefore by overhauling my nutrition and by avoiding those situations I have demonstrated knowledge of health issues. 
1	My family has a long history of medical issues, primarily autoimmune diseases. It has been imperative we stay as healthy as possible as many doctors are not knowledgeable in this field. Treatment is typically left to us and in several cases had better medical knowledge been obtained, lives would have been extended. One family member was lost due to a medical mistake, another to incorrect diagnoses, and another has had quality of life severely impaired because of incorrect diagnoses. I struggle with my own health and have two children with a complex medical history. I have also become the primary caregiver to my mother who is now severely impaired. If I am not fully aware and knowledgeable then the risks are simply too great. It's worth it to me to learn and understand all that I possibly can.  
1	I try to stay abreast of my health knowledge on different topics. I especially try to stay abreast of my own health issues and concerns. I read on online and see what the current news is in the medical industry.
1	An experience in my life that has demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is when I researched an upcoming procedure for my husband and got information about it and gave him suggestions as to things to bring up with his doctor.
1	I helped to take care of my diabetic brother when he was little. I had to use nutritiol labels to determine how many carbs he had eaten and then figure out how many units of insulin he needed to take. 
-1	When I was in health class and gave a presentation on joints and arthritis.
1	The best example that I can think of was when my young daughter started having bed-wetting issues long after she had learned to go to the bathroom herself. The doctor did some tests and ruled out a UTI, which I was familiar with, then wanted to rule out constipation. She did this by doing some x-rays on my daughter. Sure enough, she just hadn't been drinking enough water and was really constipated, which was putting pressure on her bladder. This whole thing was pretty easily understandable, and was explained well by our pediatrician.
-1	Never
1	It was a time in summer, when one of my friend started feeling dizziness while playing in sun. We helped him to get him under the shadow and had him drank some water and after that he was felling better.
1	When I helped a family member that had very serious issues I took the family member to all the medical appointments and stayed in the hospital through all the surgeries with them.  I don't know if that demonstrates knowledge but I learned a lot of knowledge doing it I think.
1	I think you have to have somewhat of an understand of medicine otherwise you can't trust if your doctor is right or wrong 
1	There was a time I had an ear infection but since it was my first in my life, I didn't exactly know how to explain what I was suffering from to the doctor, this made my diagnosis hard because I didn't really know what was going on but my glands in the neck region were swollen, so my doctor tried treating different stuff till I actually found out on my own with the help of the internet that I had an ear infection, then went back and told my doctor for proper medication.
1	Once when visiting a doctor I was asked if I understood everything and explained everything correctly to my doctor.
-1	When I was diagnosis with cerebellar ataxia.  I never heard of this disorder nor did anybody I know.  I have done a lot of research over the past five years including a couple facebook groups.
1	My significant other had serve pain in his back for sometime and they gave him an MRI. We received a copy of the CD and looked at the imagery at home. I was able to tell him what was wrong with his spine prior to receiving the phone call from the doctor. At the appointment I discussed with the doctor the options for treatment and percentage wise how rare the condition was. Already knowing about some issues and being able to research and learn about the possibilities of treatment, it was easier to understand what the doctor thought was the best option and for us to make an informed one confidently and in a short period of time.
-1	just what i eat and looking at labels. trying to stay within the 2k calorie of a daily intake of food and try to eat more healthy.
1	I have chronic shoulder pain that has been worsening for 25 years.  I know nothing can be done except pain pills.  I do not take them because I know I might become addicted.
1	An experience was when I was having high blood pressure. I am at a normal weight and exercise regularly. I went to the doctor and he wanted to put me on some pills which I read had bad side effects. I went home and read about it and found that l-arginine lowers your blood pressure and since it's an amino acid there's no side effect. I started taking it and my blood pressure got lowered and I didn't need to take the pills that were prescribed.
1	One time I was stabbed in the. Because I knew that it had hit one of the main arteries I new to go to the hospital immediatley.
-1	When i had a stomach bug. I knew that steps i had to take in terms of what kind of food i should eat and which ones to avoid.
-1	I have moderate experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues. I am somewhat confident.
1	When my wife was pregnt I felt like I was able to understand and comprehend all that was being discussed about the pregncy.
1	I went to the doctor for a cut on my hand, I needed stitches but the blood wouldn't stop. The doctor didn't know why and was about to give me medicine to make my blood clot. But I told him that I had taken aspirin. I knew that aspirin thins my blood and makes it harder to clot. So I told him and it saved me from having to take medication I didn't need. 
1	I had premature children that were 10 weeks early and were male. The fact that they were male they had a lower survival rate then if they were female infants since female infants tend to be stronger. My sons were on oxygen and until they were down to 20% and weened off a respirator they were at risk of vision and other health conditions.
1	My husband was having pain in stomach and he was useous, and he was bloated. I thought it was an ulcer but the first doctor he went to could not find anything. My husband wanted to just take aspirin, and wait until the pain went away. I was adamant that he not take aspirin because it would do more damage. And that he go to another doctor. He went to my doctor, and she found the ulcer. 
-1	I have administered first aid and CPR to several individuals 
1	I found my mother passed out on the toilet.  I knew there was something about pressure on the vagus nerve that could make you pass out.  I remembered she needs to get blood to her head so I put her head down.  She came to a little and we were able to get her to lay on the bed.  Then she became totally awake and  responsive.  We still went to the emergency room, but she was fine.
1	My experience is based on news stories, persol experiences, family experiences, now outdated first aid courses, and college biology. I have used my knowledge to determine when I or a family members need to go to a doctor or emergency room and to reassure and explain  information to my niece and nephew. 
1	Being pregnt and giving birth to my children gave me good experiences with medical fields and medical documentation. 
1	"I'm not really terribly interested in ""wet"" sciences. Because, frankly, ""Eww."" I understand what I read and I don't leave the health of my children to chance, but I don't go out of my way to seek out new medical knowledge."
1	I was in a long term relationship with someone with Type 1 diabetes, so I learned a lot about insulin resistance, carbohydrates, and the glycemic index. 
1	i have been around the medical field for about 20 years, but when it comes to being a patient i am like a novice. it is very hard for me to process being sick, i mostly have denial over it. as far as knowledge, i now a lot about health from working in health related fields.
1	I don't know much about the medical issues I have before I'm dealing with them in the hospital. I've had an infected foot that I didn't know how to treat or take care of and it got out of hand and landed me in the hospital. 
1	I was a Medicare Specialist customer service rep for an insurance company.  I was frequently in contact with Doctor's offices and hospitals to help a patient seek clarification on diagnosis, coverages, prior authorizations, appeals, etc.
1	When I had my second child I knew quite a bit about HG which is extreme morning sickness that I had had with my first.  With my second I knew how to handle it better and knew what I needed to do to keep it under control.  
-1	When my father had a stroke
1	"After my third in-vitro cycle resulting in no viable follicles via aspiration, I knew something was very wrong.  I knew I would need help getting pregnt, but to have ZERO follicles aspirated after seeing 18 on the ultrasound was very unusual.  I saw many specialists about the problem and their best answer was ""You're a medical anomoly"".  I did research myself, and thought that maybe I had what's called Luteinized Unruptured Follicle Syndrome.  When I brought that information to the ""specialists"" they agreed that must be my issue."
-1	My sister has epilepsy. I have gotten her through many seizures while waiting for an ambulance to show up. She had one seizure that was really bad once and i turned her on her side and held her until the shaking stopped and she started to wake up right as the ambulance got there.
1	A dentist was wanting to do serial extractions on my son.  I was worried about the wrong teeth getting pulled.  I got online and printed out diagrams of teeth labeled with numbers and letters, then I double and triple checked with the hygienist to make sure everything would get done right.
1	I was hiking with a friend and he fell down the hill and broke his leg. I was able to make a splint for him to keep his leg still and I kept him hydrated until help arrived.
-1	I read a lot information about diseases on line.
1	There was a time when i saw my brother bleeding and i knew i had to stop the blood
1	I have offered advice before to a friend regarding dehydration. I let them know the effects and that it is important to drink water.
1	During my first pregncy my blood pressure continued to rise in my last weeks. Suddenly I began to have rapid swelling in my legs, hands, and face. I knew that this could lead to a massive complication and risk the life of my and my child. I told my doctor my symptoms, she ran some tests, and I was induced the next day. 
1	I can't really think of any examples.
1	I took a C class a few years ago when I was exploring different things, and I thought it might come in handy to know this stuff anyway. I already knew most of the things on the tests, but it was good practice to know how to take BP and the other measurements. Other than that, I can only say I usually do research on a condition that a close relative might have, so I can send them the info if they're interested. But it's frustrating to not have access to some of the medical research materials online.
1	My dad sprained his ankle one night, he wanted to start applying heat pad on it immediately, I told him not to. For the first 48 or better 72 hours of sprain, you better apply ice pack first to reduce swelling and tissue bleeding, then use the heat after 72 hours. 
1	I haven't had an experience that demonstrated my knowledge in medical issues. 
-1	I could just tell from having bronchitis in elementary school, that once again in High School it came back. The cough was a different cough than just being very head-cold sick. 
-1	when i was getting checked for my blood pressure i knew what it meant when they told me the measurements 
1	Just as much as the normal person I think. I take care of a Type 1 Diabetic child so that has to count for something. 
-1	Knowing that I recently had a blood test of  Vitamin D, and the results from lab stated in bold and labeled Low,  and I had been feeling little depressed and totally not functioning to my full capacity, especially with memory, I'm thinking it may be a result of low serotonin, and I myself had some previous prescription of Vitamin D, and within a few days I after taking, I was feeling a lot better.   I'm not sure what to do about the letter I received from the doctor's office stating my results were all normal,  I don't have exact figures but my level was like a 1.1  and  normal was starting over 3,  anyway.  With being a past medical transcriptionist, I have learned meanings of a lot of medical terms, no way an expert, just general of course.  
1	I cared for my parents who both had cancer. I studied medical terminology. I volunteered at a hospital. I have read a lot about health care issues.
-1	
1	I once took a friend to the emergency room because he was experiencing somewhat significant abdomil distress.  It turned out to be severe heartburn, but I think a 'better safe than sorry' approach is worthwhile overall.
-1	After the Christmas party in 2012, I had a severe flu that took a couple of weeks to heal. All of the symptoms of flue went away but the cough stayed for more than a month, my whole body was sore from coughing.  Only until I realized myself that the new blood pressure medication I was taking could be an ace inhibitor, of which I was educated by my younger sister who is a nurse.  I called the doctor's office to clarify, and it was then, doctor replaced my medication with Losartan Potassium and the coughing went away immediately.
1	I don't know that I've had an experience that demonstrated my having a knowledge of health or medical issues. I support a single payer option for healthcare but that's just an opinion based on politics and economics. 
-1	When I do not have the information I need I go to reliable sources on the internet and research the health subjects 
1	I was told by my doctor that I was allergic to something, and I knew it was ragweed just from reading about reactions and figuring out where and when I would get them.
1	My blood sugar used to be in the 250 range, so I started taking 40 mL/cc of insulin in the morning and at night, and my blood sugar has now dropped to the 80-125 range. I have to monitor when the blood sugar gets too low at night, and when it rises too high in the day.
1	I have high blood pressure, I noticed one day that my blood pressure was above 190. I quickly went to the hospital because I know that a very high blood pressure can lead to having a stroke. 
1	A few years ago, a nurse practitioner prescribed buspirone for my anxiety. I reminded him that psychiatric drugs in general tend to affect me much more strongly than they do most people, and suggested that I should start at the lowest dose possible. He wrote the prescription for the second lowest dose available. When I got home with the medication, I broke the tablets into quarters for the first week, then into halves for the next week. I didn't have any adverse effects, but did not really see any positive effects either, so on the third week, I took whole tablets as prescribed. I got very useated, extremely dizzy, and found it nearly impossible to stay awake. I continued at the recommended dose, thinking that maybe these were side effects that would wear off with time, but they persisted. I tried to reach the nurse practitioner, but he was on vacation and I didn't feel comfortable discussing it with anyone else in the office, so I went online and looked up information about the medication. I learned that what I was experiencing were symptoms of a severe overdose of the medication. Going to an emergency room was recommended, but I felt certain that no one would listen to me if I tried to explain my drug sensitivity and that they'd probably think I took some illegal drug. I'm aware that some psychiatric drugs recommend tapering off rather than stopping abruptly, so I looked for this information online and found that while it's not recommended to stop abruptly, in some situations it may be necessary. I decided that this was one of those situations, so I stopped taking the medication. The symptoms decreased appreciably within several hours, and though there was some lingering dizziness, everything else was more or less back to normal within a few days.

I gained this knowledge through media and websites that I most recently frequent.
-1	We have some potential issues with one of our children when they were in eutero, so I had to read a lot about a particular condition. I feel like I gained a lot of knowledge.

1	Last year when I fainted. It happens from time to time and I could tell it was happening from the world blackening from the outside in. I was in the kitchen and started lowering myself before my body gave out so I wouldn't fall and hit my head and I started calling my boyfriends me since he was home with me. I already told him some years ago that this happens and just get me some water and maybe a cold towel for when I wake back up.
1	I was at the scene of a car accident. The occupants in the car were not in any further immediate danger. Thus, I instructed others arriving on the scene not move any of the occupants in the car until the paramedics arrived. I know if someone is injured and improperly moved it could result in furthering the injury significantly. 
1	I looked up symptoms I was experiencing due to pain in my leg, and found it was most likely cellulitis. I went to the emergency room. When I was seen by a doctor, he concluded the same.

1	"When I was 37 years old, I discovered a flat but palpable tumor under my  left breast. It was found to be ""hot"" and otherwise suspicious, plus I had other small spots show up in the mammogram in my right breast. Biopsies were done and no cancer found, but the surgeon, at the time, recommended bilateral, subcutaneous mastectomies. After talking with my husband, my PCP, and others, plus doing a lot of research, I filly decided to go ahead. One year later, I was referred to a reconstructive surgeon who placed silicone implants under both breast flaps.  I still have those same implants and I'm now 81. I've had no problems with them. Of course, the various doctors get the credit for good work and incredible support for me, but I also take credit for studying the issue and making a hard decision that I feel helped keep me safe from cancer all these years."
1	I was supposed to play golf one morning, but when I woke up I discovered that my back was bothering me. I tried loosening it up with some light stretching exercises, but that didn't help. I knew that the violent twisting involved in a golf swing could aggravate my back and cause real injury, so I cancelled my tee time and allowed my back to rest. Ialso used a heat pad to it, and by the next week everything was better and I was able to play.

1	I am caregiver to my elderly mother for many years. She literally has issues from head to toe. I put out her meds every day. Her doctors trust me to make minor dose adjustments. Even 0.5mg can make a difference. So often doctors prescribe in increments of 25 mg or 50 mg, resulting in overdose. The dose has to be customized for each patient. 
1	I noticed a place on my husband's face that was diagnosed as a sun spot by 2 internists and a dermatologist. It was very small and was not growing on the surface. I had my husband go to a new dermatologist, who also thought it was nothing, and have it removed. It was cancer! Took 2 cuttings to remove all cells and many trips to a reconstruction plastic surgeon to fix his face. We are now down to two trips a year for skin checks and have been clear for almost 5 years. I do not know why I felt so strongly about this spot, but I had my husband insist it be taken off even if it turned out to be nothing. Melanoma is nothing to fool around with. 
1	I do not have a specific incident. However, my parents taught me to : Take a second opinion whenever I am faced with an important medical decision. Ask questions to the doctor about the purpose of the medicien, side-effects etc. Do your own research about the medicine.

1	I went through dengue before because I visited a country with many mosquitoes, and there was a time I shared this experience. When people started asking me more about it, I felt like I knew everything there is to know about it since I did my research after being sick and I also know what I went through. So even for that one medical issue, I thought I had a lot of related and useful knowledge.
-1	I took the initiative to find out about the medical issue that I had. Then I took an appointment with my doctor to discuss the issue & see what steps could be taken o prevent it. I made a schedule to work out a way to avoid me having the issue in the future.
1	I was having significant issues with sleeping, staying awake, headaches, extremely fogged thinking, body aches, etc. I did a green juice fast for 16 days after doing some research online. On the 12-day of the fast, every problem disappeared and has not returned, even after 5 years.
1	I was having mouth ulcers, interrupted sleep, hot flashes and irregular periods about a year ago. I immediately knew it was a hormone imbalance and the start of perimenopause.  I knew that I needed to go to the physician and get a hormone replacement therapy if I was going to start feeling more normal.  I went to a gynecologist since they are more equipped in handling this type of problem.  I know that for heart and bone health it is important that I take some kind of hormone replacement because Osteoporosis does run in my family.  I also knew I needed a supplement with not only estrogen but progesterone.  So I was sure to notice the physician gave me the right prescription.  And to save money I also knew that I could cut the pill in half since the best therapy is the lowest dose that relieves symptoms.  I cut the pills in half and they seem to be working fine and have relieved the menopausal symptoms.

1	Having to go see a specialist doctor and being able to converse quite easily with them about various conditions I had was due to research and learning as much as I could so as to have at least a general knowledge base to work with.

1	I read online.  I educated myself about treatment.  I learned a lot and asked the doctor great questions about my recovery.

I recently helped an older gentleman who had tripped, fallen, and split his head. I knew to limit mobility until help arrived, and I knew to watch for signs of concussion (i.e. vomiting, blackout). I was able to help limit the loss of blood while we waited for the ambulance and kept him comfortable.

-1	My doctor was considering putting me on medication for high blood pressure and I was scheduled for an appointment to see her. When I did see her, I requested that she put me on a specific medication called Losartan since I did research on the medications my health insurance covered that had the least side-effects.

But that was not the first option he gave me.
1	I was working in a commercial kitchen with volunteer staff and someone cut their finger while chopping vegetables.

He looked some things up and eventually he reluctantly agreed, and I was eight. The rash was cured.

1	I think the most memorable experience I can think of is when I started experiencing acute pain in my general groin area & started frantically googling the symptoms, prior to going to an emergency room, which were actually very hard to narrow down.

1	My mom got very sick, and the doctors admitted him for one thing, when in reality it was something entirely different that was bothering him.

When I found that there were white spots on the back of my throat, I knew that it could be strep throat and went in to the doctor. The test came back positive for strep throat. 
-1	When I was younger and my mom was sick. I did a lot of reading and research because I wanted to make sure my mom was going to be ok. I took care of my mom knew what medicine she needed. I knew when she needed it and when she had to go to the hospital I knew what to tell the doctors and nurses.
1	I can't say that I've had a significant experience that would demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues. I have a general knowledge and attempt to get some regular exercise, but always ask relevant professionals because it's better to understand what I don't know than to not know and think I know.
1	I fell out of a tree and hurt my neck. I didn't actually think I was hurt that bad but I made myself stop what I was doing and think about it.  Then I realized I could have hurt myself badly even if it didn't feel like it at the time. I ended up having somebody take me to the hospital (they didn't think I was hurt much either).  I ended up have a shattered vertabrae in my neck.  good thing i went to the hospital.
1	I don't really have any experiences that demonstrate medical knowledge.  I just try to do what my doctor and the government tell me to do to maintain good health.  Overall, the strategy has worked, and I feel that I am in good health.
1	A few years ago, I found out my dad had diabetes. Now we know more about it and my sister and I are more careful with our health so that we don't get it in the future.
1	I had a c section and a few weeks later after a long car ride my right leg was in a great deal of pain. It turned purple and swelled up. I went to the ER and said I had a blood clot and I was right.
1	I actually do not have very much experience about any particular medical issues I have had many medical issues as have my family but we were so busy trying get to figure out how all the systems worked that it was hard to focus on the actual medical issues.
1	I had to take care of my mom when she had meningitis and was able to navigate the different specialists and tests she needed
-1	When it comes to physical there are not that many. But it's more of the emotional ones that I have a better understanding of.
1	My wife is a nurse so I often consult her if I feel like I'm in need of medical attention. I have seasonal allergies so it's not uncommon to have sore throats, runny noses, and coughing at various times of the year. Occasionally, those symptoms are very severe. In the fall, I have a severe cough that was not going away and she thought that it was just allergies. I couldn't take it anymore and felt that it was probably worse and went to the doctors - it was bronchitis.
1	After becoming dehydrated my heart was beating more rapidly and harder. After drinking plenty of fluids it went back to normal.
1	I had some issues with anxiety attacks after eating. I realized that these were happening when I would eat a lot of carbs. It led me to learn about hypoglycemia and the effects of low blood sugar on the adrenal system
1	During my last visit to the PCP's office, I was asked to fill out a new form of medical history. I found that most of the terms showing on the form seemed to be familiar. I did not have any troubles to complete the form. This was very different from the first time when I was asked to do such a thing.
-1	Before I thought about having my last surgery I read online and in medical journals about the pro and cons of the procedure before having it done. I wanted to know the facts for myself before making that decision.
1	I have a wife with severe COPD and a heart condition that developed while she was in the hospital for her breathing.  I spent many hours talking with the nurses and the doctors as well as on line researching her conditon.  I was able to visit with her for 12 hours a more a day while she was in the hospital and monitor the care she was given.  A few times my research paid off such as the time they wanted to clean her room and I had to ask them to not use areosal due to her COPD and the fact that the areosol triggered it.
1	I had cancer at a younger age and through that episode I learned a great deal about treatments and the advantages of lifestyle changes, proper nutrition, etc.  I read about my disease and gained enough knowledge that when my Dr's spoke about meds and treatment I understood fully 
1	My mother was very sick most of my childhood, so I picked information here and there from her pamphlets and also her doctors. Also, in college I was in a Physician Assistant program where I started to learn a lot about health and medical issues. To get into that program, I had to shadow a doctor or PA for 500 hours, so I also absorbed a lot of information from there. 
-1	The only situation I can remember right now is that once I helped my mother understand the instructions for a treatment that she needed to have at home
1	When I was pregnant with my first child I developed a small lump in my breast. My doctor suspected that it was likely to be normal breast changes with pregnancy, but because of the size, density, location of the lump, they recommended an ultrasound to verify that it was not something more concerning. I went for the appointment and after the ultrasound it was determined that this was likely just a cyst. I felt very comfortable with that assessment as I have had numerous cysts myself, and I have a family history of them as well. 
-1	Whenever I think about experiences in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health and medical issues, I think about my grandpa having a heart attack. I remember sitting in the living room of my grandparents house with my grandpa and grandma and then all of a sudden my grandpa started rubbing his chest and saying that he had a tight pain and I continued asking him questions and trying to figure out exactly what it was that was wrong with him and if he needed to be taken to the hospital and eventually, I told him that we needed to go because he was having a heart attack and it turned out that he had.
1	My husband and I are currently trying to get pregnant. We tried a new method called invocell. During the process, 12 eggs were able to be retrieved and inseminated. At my age, 80-90% of those should have become embryos. Unfortunately, only one did and it did not implant. This means that something is wrong with my body that caused so little of those to become embryos.
1	One night about three months after I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, I took 20 units of Humalog (short acting insulin) instead of 20 units of Lantus (long acting insulin) before bedtime. My boyfriend got upset and called 911. I ended up in the hospital for three hours having my blood sugar tested every half an hour, and paid $700 for the privilege. The next time I took the wrong kind of insulin at night, I did the math, made the appropriate amount of toast, slathered it with honey, and didn't tell the boyfriend.
-1	I have an auto-immune disease and I researched to learn what to do, eat and which medication would make me feel my best. I also spoke to others with the disease and got input from them as well. I also found a doctor who helped me understand my disease better. 
-1	I experienced tachycardia (rapid heart rate) in my early 20's. This ailment can be caused by a plethora of different things, and it can be overwhelming worrying about what the certain cause is. I did an immense amount of research on my own in order to better understand how to prevent this. Later in life, I met someone who experience the same problem, and was confused. I was able to provide temporary relief to this person because of my past knowledge and experience with tachycardia.
1	I try to stick to the healthy diet and exercise a couple of times a week to be healthy. So i don't really have a lot of experience of health issues.
1	When I delivered my third child, I went into the hospital knowing exactly what to expect. I was prepared to fill out all the paperwork given to me, had all my medications noted, and had a very seamless delivery since I had been through it twice before. I was even allowed to leave after one night instead of the usual 2-3 night stay since I knew what to do. 
1	I was seriously injured when I was 24. I subsequently had to go through many tests and medical procedures which has given me much higher than average knowledge of doctors and medical procedures. I have an artificial disc in my back, arthritis in the facet joints, scarring on the nerves, and other problems that I still suffer with due to this injury and it has been over 16 years. 
-1	I was having some stomach/reflux issues and my current doctor kept telling me there was nothing wrong. I did my research, and found a new doctor. It turns out that I did have a problem, and it would still be left untreated if I had not switched doctors.
1	I fell on my right hand one night and heard a pop. I knew I broke a bone in my hand - not just a sprain or minor injury - because my finger was unable to bend without pain and my knuckle was misplaced.
1	"I was on vacation with friends, and my friend's teenage daughter got sick with a high fever. We were in a third world country, and the resort's on staff ""doctor"" looked very young and unprofessional (she was wearing jeans). The doctor was going to give her a shot. I stopped her and knew enough to ask first exactly what was in the needle. Thankfully I asked, because the doctor actually could not answer the question! She said it was ""something like aspirin"". I advised my friend not to allow the shot to be given. Instead, we brought her daughter back to our room and gave her Tylenol and gatorade, which we purchased from the gift shop. Her daughter was fine by the next day."
1	One time I demonstrated knowledge of health issues by helping care for my cousin who has diabetes. I researched and asked questions, and learned where her blood sugar levels should be and what she could eat and couldn't eat at certain times and helped her measure her blood sugar.
1	I have to keep track of my dad's health information such as weight, body temperature, and medications after he received a liver transplant last year. The anti rejection medicine that he takes has to be taken every 12 hours for the rest of his life and he has to adjust the dosage based on his monthly blood work. I help him a lot because I want him to stay healthy and I enjoy helping him.
-1	I have had testicular cancer before and I gathered all the information from many doctors.  I just support forums to gather anymore information.  I also reached out to people that I knew had cancer. 
1	All of the years I have worked as a nurse. Twenty years is how long I worked on  medical floor in acute care. Experience is everything.

1	My friend was having trouble breathing and I've had experiences with a family member that had panic attacks. I told him that what he was experiencing was likely a panic attack and to calm down and breath.
-1	I cant say for sure that I have had an experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues. I prefer to trust my doctor and/or nurses that are available to demonstrate their knowledge.
-1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues happened when I discovered that I was allergic to barley. After consulting medical sources, I was able to communicate to food servers that I needed gluten free meals that did not come in contact with cross-contaminated foods containing wheat or rye.
1	First, I have a degree in Psychology and i'm a certified Professional Educator in the state of Florida with certifications in Biology and General Science. Second, my family members and I have had complex health issues in the past. For me, my health concerns have increased in the past ten years as i've aged and i've had to have both corrective and emergency procedures performed on me.
1	I went and got a flu shot to lessen the chance of getting the flu, and also lessen the symptoms if I did get the flu. It's important for everyone to get vaccinated, especially to protect those who can't.
-1	My daughter has a hemagioma that was rupturing, I knew how to stop the bleeding as well as preventing rupturing again. I made sure I knew all about this red blood filled birthmark.
-1	When my dad was having stomach pains. I told him what medicines to take and what to drink to help calm the pain.
1	A few years ago I had a friend that was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and she was admitted into a cancer treatment center. She was very worried about what kind of processes and procedures she would go through. I was able to talk to her about what she may experience because my father was also diagnosed with cancer and I watched him suffer through it for 6 months going through all sorts of different treatments. Because of my experience with my father I was able to talk to my friend about what she can expect and how hard the process is going to be.
1	I can tell the doctors the side effects of many antibiotics and what drugs you shouldn't take with them. I know drugs in clinical trials that the doctors don't know about. I am the mother of two children with serious health conditions. This is a huge part of my life. I run a support group for others dealing with the same things. 
1	i noticed i had some sort of rash under my arm when i first started college.  i did some research online using several reputable websites.  i figured out what i probably had was a mild skin problem called eczema.  i saw that a doctor can prescribe a cream for this.  i made an appointment and my doctor prescribed a steroid cream and it worked great.
-1	My daughters both got super high fevers. Once the fevers went past 100.4 I started giving them fever reducers. If the fever lasted more that a couple days or they developed other symptoms I took them to the dr right away. My 18 month old got a Hugh fever with no other symptoms. I did research after the drs sent us home with no answers. I concluded she had a virus call roseolla and I was correct. 
1	A partner I had at the time was starting to show signs of an Addisonian crisis (she was diagnosed years before with Addison's disease), and was starting to become delirious. I injected her emergency medication into her thigh and we went to hospital. 
1	there Was a time that I caught a food borne illness and was throwing up every five minutes for 5 hours. I was so pale and so dehydrated that I knew I had to go to the hospital. I had my husband drive me to the hospital so they could give me nausea medication and rehydrate me. They said that if I hadnât shown up to the hospital there would have been dangerous being so dehydrated.
1	after a while of taking various medications, i did research on each one so that i could gain knowledge on whether or not i needed to keep taking each one, or whether i could lower the dosage. i used this knowledge to have an indepth conversation about the medications with my primary care physician on the next visit.
-1	I was having sever pain in my esophagus and was unable to swallow food. The meds my PCP gave me caused an allergic reaction and I went to the ER.
1	Once when I was visiting my father he began to have numbness in his extremities and moderate chest pain. He believed it was just heartburn, but I convinced him to go to the doctor and he did in fact have a mild heart attack. From that point on I was instrumental in maintaining his cardiovascular health by helping him maintain a diet and exercise. He is now much more conscious of his health and willing to consult a medical professional about any questions he may have concerning his (or any immediate family/friends) overall wellbeing. So, by demonstrating applied knowledge concerning heart health I have effectively prolonged my father's life and very likely those of the people he spends his time with.
-1	When I was 24 years old, I went to the doctor to get my yearly physical exam.  Up to that point, I had been having them for 6 years without any issues but this time, the doctor called me the following week to tell me that I had an irregular pap smear and that the pap had shown that I had precancerous cells.  Because I had taken anatomy for 3 years and I was pretty enlightened on how the different type of cells all line up in  woman's reproductive parts, I instantly knew that it was serious.  I did not complain or argue when he got me into a specialist for the following week.  The specialist advised that he had to do a LEEP which again, I was familiar with so I had some comfort only because I knew what the process entailed.
-1	Not too long ago I was told that I had scar tissue on my liver.  This was caused years ago when my gall bladder ruptured.  I already knew what scar tissue was and how it could affect my liver.
1	I have hidradentitis and once on a weekend a nodule swelled up to the size of a soft ball. I had to  go to an urgent care and while they were not educated in my condition I was able to coach them on the normal course of treatment.
1	For some reason or another, I frequently get UTI's, so I pretty much recognize the signs.  I was able to inform others what to do when they got them. I explained to them what to drink, eat, and whether or not they should go see the doctor. 
1	These examples shown in the survey were simply mathematical equations. Someone who has no experience with health and medical issues would be able to figure these out.
-1	I had pains in my chest in the heart area so I went to the clinic and they said it was because I was very overweight. I was actually 250 lbs-80 lbs overweight. I was very scared and asked them to check for blood clots around the heart. They put me on high blood pressure medication and told me to lose weight. The chest pains subsided but I still have a lot of weight to lose.
1	When I had an upper GI endoscopy and talked to the doctor about it after we went through all the biopsies he took and the pictures from inside my stomach I actually understood and he was impressed!
1	I am the father of six children, and have been in the military for 14 years. Constant training from the military as well as the plethora of issues that having that many children have has made me quite well versed in medical issues.
-1	A time I can think about that demonstrated my knowledge about a health issue is when I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. After I was diagnosed with high blood pressure, I went home to do some research on things needed to lower my blood pressure other than medication. At the time, a doctor I had did not tell me to make any lifestyle changes, instead just put me on medication which had me sleepy all of the time. A few months in, I was taking my medication and came to the doctor and got it checked and it was normal. The doctor asked if I was consistently taking my medication and I also explained that I was also making healthier lifestyle changes in which he was very surprised.
1	I once had to have my liver enzymes tested. I was told that it needed to be at a certain level before I could be sure that I did not have chronic Hepatitis. I was able to follow-up with the doctor and get my test results, read them myself to know that I did not need to schedule a follow-up visit.
1	A few years ago I got kicked in the kidney in a soccer game and it was bruised. I knew that rest and inactivity would help the situation, so that's what I did. The body is made to heal itself in most cases. 
1	I had been experiencing pain that some doctors told me was in my head. I had done research and was fairly certain it was a certain condition. I finally got a doctor to listen to me and they confirmed my thoughts.
1	I don't really have any experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge.   Maybe just trying to help my fiance lose weight and lower his cholesterol and blood pressure for his annual checkup. In six months I really helped him turn things around by changing his diet. 
1	I studied a lot of science while I was in college. I took a lot of corse and I'm familiar with many of the terminology.
1	I was diagnosed with PCOS at age 18, so I know a lot about insulin resistance, hormonal issues, and blood sugar as I actively work to prevent myself from developing diabetes. I also worked as a receptionist at my endocrinologist's office for a year.
1	The other day at work my coworkers and I were discussing the flu because a lot of people thought they had contracted it. I had done some reading on the flu, knew symptoms, how long it should last, etc. but many of my coworkers did not. They claimed to have gotten the flu, when in reality they just contracted some sort of virus that had similar symptoms to the flu.
1	When I worked in a physicianâs office, a patient told me that he did not understand his blood pressure. I explained to him how he had high blood pressure and showed his history. I saw that ate a lot of fatty and sugar foods and made no effort to improve his eating habits. In addition, I saw this his sugar level was high and that he did not have much physical activity. I went over all of the information with the nurse to confirm that everything I was reading was correct. She confirmed that the information was correct that I was giving to the patient. 
-1	I can't think of a time in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues.  (I am usually fairly good at figuring out my dog's health issues, but that doesn't help your survey results.)
-1	WHEN I FOUND OUT I HAD TWO CYST IN MY OVARIES, I FELT SCARED BUT WHEN I GOT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I NEEDED AND WAS VERY INFORMED I FELT GOOD ABOUT IT. 
1	When I found out that my daughter had asthma, I made sure to find out everything I could. That knowledge helped me when she was wheezing. 
1	When I was diagnosed with diabetes I was already fairly knowledgeable about how to manage symptoms because of literature and websites I had read previously. Knowing that diet and exercise were the key components to managing diabetes helped me stay relatively healthy.
1	Every quarter I teach a section on mental health. We cover underlying causes of psychological disorders, both biological and environmental, as well as symptoms and treatment.
1	I have correctly self-diagnosed certain conditions I have had or still have such as an hernia and blefaritis to name a few. I took a nutrition course at the University that completely open my eyes about healthy eating and has helped become the health conscious person  that  I am today. I believe that nutrition course should be mandatory starting at middle school at least.
1	I was told all kinds of things by emergency clinics but they could not pin point a certain condition I had. For example, I would experience flu like symptoms for days and even weeks before the symptoms would slowly go away.
1	I visited a doctor at my college campus a few years ago. She told me I needed to diet, and asked me what I was eating. I had come to a realization that I had been eating too much fast food. When the doctor told me about a diet plan, I asked questions, and she seemed of the opinion that I knew what I needed to do. I follow much of her advice, and began losing weight in the first week.
1	I dont know much about health or medical issues at all.  Recently I found out that I have pmdd.  I spend a lot of time to research on this issue.  I'm taking some medication for pmdd right now.  I have paid very careful attention to how my body react to the medicine.  
1	When I broke a bone in my foot my blood pressure readings were high.  Doctors and staff tried to put me on blood pressure medications.  I waited until after my injury was healed and until after I was able to start jogging again.  My blood pressure readings went down, and I successfully avoid the blood pressure medications.
-1	My grandpa had merca in his blood due to diabetic sores he had on hes feet. He was in the hospital for along time and even had to get some of his toes cut off due to this issue. 
1	When I had my heart attack, I really did not have conventional symptoms, but I knew something was wrong. Though I am not one to go to the doctor frequently, I nevertheless called 911. The EMTs didn't think I was having a heart attack and told me I could go to the ER or not, depending on what I wanted to do. I almost didn't go. I knew though that something was really wrong. I elected to go and went into cardiac arrest before we got to the hospital
1	I honestly don't have much knowledge of health or medical issues. I have chronic migraines that I take daily preventative medication for. I also have specific things I do when I do get a migraine so all of my medical knowledge is really about my specific condition.
-1	There was many times that i had certain symptoms and i would read in books or study online about the possible ailments. I usually figured out the specific illness myself even before the doctor could.
1	After each of three babies, it was important to bring them to their many well baby check-ups. After my middle child experienced some difficulty with weight gain (he was gaining weight but not at the amount expected), I was on alert for the same issue with my third child. Indeed, it happened to him too, even though he did not have the gastric reflux issue that my middle child had had. By being on alert for it, I knew to take it seriously when the doctor pointed out the weight issue, even before the doctor was seeing it as much of a problem. 
-1	Education and training. I've worked in a hospital, not directly with patients but we are thoroughly informed and trained on basic medical courses.
1	i was diagnosed with colon cancer when i was the age of twelve, some ninteen years ago. Since day one i kept a journal of each day that owuld include how i felt, what i ate, what if any medical procedures i had done that day and whatever medications i was on at that time. I took every oppurtunity possible to learn as miuch as i could in regards to my doses and not once over the past twenty years did i stop doing this
1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was when my mother was complaining one night of having weird visual hallucinations of small bright lights. I took her blood pressure because she has a history of high blood pressure and it was about 170 systolic. I was concerned because her baseline systolic was around 130 on medication. Because of my knowledge, I was concerned that she may be at risk for stroke and her blood pressure was very high. I retook her blood pressure because if you get an abnormal reading, you should always recheck under the same circumstance. She had a headache also, so after rechecking her blood pressure was still around 170 systolic. I told her that we need to go to the ER because I was concerned about how high her BP is and her risk of stroke. She also smokes cigarettes, so her risk is increased. Her symptoms could have been dangerous and the abnormal visual hallucinations could have been aura for an oncoming migraine, but I didn't want to take any chances. I took her to the ER. She ended up being fine. 
1	My son has autism and because of my experience with preschool aged children and training I had taken, I was aware of the possibility fairly early on.  I noticed different traits he had and was able to have him diagnosed before he turned 4. 
1	When I was extremely overweight and I was feeling like crap whenever  I ate a lot of carbohydrates.  I started researching insulin resistance and pre diabetes and hyperglycemia.  I had all of the symptons of it and I went to the doctor and they confirmed via glucose test.  I ended up losing all of my excess weight and my glucose is perfect.
-1	Almost everyday I have to help friends out with some kind of medical or health knowledge, I'm actually really well studied in this subject. I just am not good at math. I can't say there's been many situations in my life that I have actually had to put use my medical knowledge,  cause honestly I haven't really done much or been in situations that people could end up injured.
-1	The heart doctor's P.A. said that I seemed to know a lot about heart issues after I asked several questions related to a condition.
1	One experience that demonstrates my knowledge is understanding terms given to me by my doctor when he was explaining my hypertension diagnosis. As I was a biology major in college, I have understanding of much of what he was saying. I also have a family history of hypertension so I know a lot of the terms as my mother was very familiar with it during her life and I heard her discuss it while she was living. 
1	My son was born 12 weeks premature and had a birth defect (sagittal craniosynostosis). During this time I learned a lot about medicine and how to interpret medical information as I needed to be able to understand it to make decisions for his care.
1	I was having recurrent infections, but one of my previous doctors keep telling me it was a yeast infection, but the symptoms I was experiences are more like bacterial infections.  I try the medication but as I know the infection doesn't go.  Then I go a natural local and buy medications that treats that kind of infection and after a couple of days my infection was gone. 
1	When I was younger my doctor thought I had pulmonary hypertension, so when I went home I did tons of research. When I went to the specialist after that, he was very surprised that I knew everything I did and that he didn't have to explain things to me because I already knew about the health condition.
1	I do not have any such experience in which I demonstrated knowledge of health or medical issues. Only one such situation when I was able to diagnose that my friend was showing symptoms of chicken pox which was in fact right.

I followed the instructions for my first appointment and arrived on time. When the doctor asked my symptoms I was able to accurately describe them and we found out I was deficient in two vitamins.
-1	I recently broke my leg. The doctor has to describe the break to me and how to treat it. I understood the words he was saying the context behind the break. 
1	Very recently my mom was talking to me about her husband and how he wasn't feeling well. Not only could I carry on the conversation, but, I was also able to speculate what else may be wrong with him and knew better that he should not have been taking prednisone with ibuprofen. 
1	I have been to the doctor several times for various conditions. I have two kids that have gone to the doctor for check ups and conditions as well. My husband has bene hospitalized for a condition.
-1	When I was in the army I received many physicals and vaccines. I would ask the doctors many questions about the vaccines and I would later share the information with my fellow soldiers.
1	I had my appendix taken out and I was able to self diagnose what was causing my pain and I new about what was involved in the surgery.  
1	When I had my children, the first two were normal, easy pregnancies and spontaneous vaginal deliveries with no complications.  The babies had no problems and I was able to breastfeed easily.  My last baby had health complications during pregnancy (elevated blood pressure), during delivery (preeclampsia) and postpartum bleeding and trouble breastfeeding.
1	My first child was born with a cleft palate which led to othe finding and countless doctors, also multiple surgeries, many times medical professionals expressed that they where impressed with my grasp and understanding of things given the fact that I had no medical training.more so if I informed them I did not even have a full and proper high school education.
1	I believe I was able to effectively evaluate a time I was having a panic attack in turn because of that I knew what I needed to do to get out of the situation. I was accepting and knowledgeable that i was prone to these things and took steps to help identify when they were happening. 
-1	It has been a long trip with that for over the year I have rarely been ill and the couple time I spend a lot of time researching what and why and can it be resolve forever
1	Well my sister has had a couple kidney transplants. The first time I knew nothing. Know I know all sorts of stuff about it so when people ask me about blood types, transplant compatibility, the process, hospitals, etc. I know quite a bit to tell them. Especially if it is about one of the hospitals it happened at. I know that building like the back of my hand.
1	I had breast cancer a lot of years ago. At least I had the sense to go to the doctor when I found the lump, I guess, but the rest was kind of all Greek to me.
1	My grandpa  fainted, he has diabetes. I tested his blood sugar and i t was really low. I gave him some orange juice and he woke and was fine.
1	I had an experience when I was pushed into getting a health screening because Im obese, but I informed the professional that i am not diabetic, i don't have high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. Although im in my late 30' and hefty, I do exercise and eat healthy a lot. After they took my vitals, they were grudgingly convinced that I do know my stuff a bit.
-1	Im not sure if anything in past would demonstrate that. The only thing i can think of is that i guessed my brother was bipolar before he was diagnosed.

-1	I told my doctor what was wrong with me. I also told him the medication that I needed. I was right about the diagnosis. 
1	I had two back surgeries in my life for herniated discs.  I read a lot about the surgeries and about the condition so I could do my best when meeting with the doctor.  When the first surgery was done I was a novice and only knew some things but by the time the second surgery came along I was an expert.  When he showed me the x-ray of my discs I actually cut him off and told him what the scan showed.  I said there thats the bad disc and that portion needs to be removed in order to alleviate the pain.  I was right and he was somewhat impressed because it was different than the first surgery I had just read so much and looked at so many pictures that I knew what I was talking about.  I also knew that for this surgery they would need to use staples while the first one they used stitches.  
1	I teach math courses at a university so this is a common application. I've used medical procedures and false positives to teach my students about misleading statistics many times.
1	When I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia 20 years ago I started doing a lot of research in books and with people in general.  Doctors tried multiple medicines and I kept getting worst.  I finally started researching the medication and found that through reducing those and actually moving around more that I felt better.  Now we work on just treating major symptoms instead of everything that Fibromyalgia causes and doing exercises.
1	I was able to know that my son was having a manic attack. After his diagnosis of bipolar disorder, the next time he started with non-stop talking and behaviors that were unusual I knew to get him to the ER.  The issue was not going to resolve on its own.  The laughing at inappropriate times was not a joke, it was a sign of mania as well.  He wasn't just having bad behavior, this was a serious illness.  
1	My son was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at the age of 6. I was already someone who counted calories and read nutrition labels so my experience there made it easy to measure his portions and count his carbs accurately.

1	I had digestive issues a few years ago. I went to my general physician for treatment. Multiple sessions were unsuccessful so I asked for a referral to a specialist. I conferred with he specialist as to what the causes could be and methods of treatment. I made sure to be aware of what tests and medications were being suggested and how they would affect me. Through procedures, medication, and lifestyle changes, we were able to improve my health. 
-1	My friend was having a panic attack and nothing that I was saying was making her feel better.  I knew she needed air before she would hyperventilate and pass out, so I raised her arms over her head to help her breathe.

I reseached SF and found out that It was a rash that followed a fever. My daighter did not have a fever at any point during that time. However her grandmother washed her clothes in different detergent. I was able to extrapolate that the cause was the detergent and the rash cleared up soon after we bathed her and put her in different clothes. "
-1	In my twenties, I developed for the first time, symptoms of colitis.  I was told I would have this for the rest of my life and that only medication would keep it under control.  I began studying the different medications and reading what worked best and what didn't work for people with this condition.  This also lead me to learn about the role of probiotics in helping with gut flora which seems to help people with colitis.  I was able to bring this information to my doctor and he gave me a prescription only probiotic which has helped immensely.
1	Niece had a rash from a plant. Gave her an antihistamine and it went away until she had contact with the plant again.
1	Just last night my daughter said she had a sore throat. I looked at it with a flashlight. There were whiteish/yellow patches on her tonsils. I told her she may have strep. I know that the first thing a doctor asks when you take a child in for strep is if they also have a cough, which she did not. That's an indicator for them to actually do the strep test. Since she didn't have a cough, the doctor did the strep test on her this morning and it was positive.
1	I noticed that my son was having issues with breathing. After some determination, we found out that Abuterol seemed to help him resolve the issue.

After a consultation, it was confirmed that he indeed had Asthma.

1	"A common situation is when a friend of mine asks for advice on dealing with a running-related injury, such as ankle or knee pain. His question usually relates to whether he should continue running in the short term, since he is highly motivated to meet his mileage goals. Since I've done that in the past and exacerbated an ankle injury that way, I usually tell him to take the day off and do ""RICE"" (Rest, Ice, Compress, Elevate) the injured area, then test it the next morning to see if the pain still persists. "
1	I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and found that diagnosis to be a bit unbelievable. I did my own research, prior to the internet, and decided it was a bogus diagnosis based on my symptoms. I have not had any signs of rheumatoid arthritis and that diagnosis was over 20 years ago. 
-1	Before I graduated from high school I enrolled in a magnet program school. This school allowed us to get hands on experience in the fields we found interest in.

I chose to put up with my Psoriasis because the risk to my health from the drugs was far more detrimental than my actual condition.
1	I'm afraid that most of my health knowledge comes from Google. I can recall that I once wanted someone to eat papaya seeds when they had an upset stomach. People thought I was crazy.

I useed the vaporizer and it had some affect but I still had a tough time breathing. I knew I had only a couple options. As in try a couple other remedies or go to the hospital. I choose to humidify, put a hot towel on my head and meditate. It worked and didnt go to the hospital.

She was bleeding so I took it seriously. I called an ambulance and I applied first aid while waiting for it.
1	Many years ago I noticed something was wrong with my husband and sent him to the doctor multiple times. Every time they sent him back and said he was fine. Until years later, he saw another doctor who immediately sent him for an ultrasound. He had testicular cancer and had a tumor growing for the past several years. All I knew is if they couldn't tell me what it is, they couldn't tell me what it wasn't-- they had to check.
1	I had a herniated disc several years ago. Even though I was recommended to have a discectomy, I went to rehab for three months.

I mean, I know myself and I knew it was bad. People at work thought I was just calling out for no reason until I brought the note from my doctor, who was going to put me into the hospital if the last of 4 antibiotics tried did not work. It finally took breathing treatment, CIPRO, and getting a swab up my nose before I finally started getting better.

1	Most if not all of my information that I get about health or medical issues I get from my doctor or my friend who is working to be a medical professional. Any questions I have in those subjects I ask them. Rarely do I get information anywhere else. I think I have moderate amount of knowledge about health and medical issues because of what they have told me. I wouldn't call myself an expert or anything close to that. I will still continue to get my information from medical professionals. All in all there's no experience I can say that shows off my knowledge. I just get a piece of it time from time.
1	I can't really think of a specific situation.  If something is wrong with me like a feel a pain that I hadn't had before, I'll look up online what might be causing the pain.  Then I'll decide whether it's serious enough to see a doctor.
-1	I have had some personally specific injures and illnesses that I think i know a little more about than other ones but aside from that I dont have anything to go off of.

Last January I enrolled in a medical course where i learned how to measure liquids in a syringe, how to read needles (cc's and ml) as well as how to do medical billing for hospitals and doctors offices.  Since learning this knowledge it has enabled me to have intelligent conversations with others as well as help myself be more knowledgeable about my health and the health of those around me
-1	I had to go to the doctor last year when I was having upset stomach and feeling very anxious. The doctor thought it had something to do with my kidneys, but I just had a feeling it was anxiety. I think I was right because it went away when the stress went away.

Due to previous experiences with dehydration, I was able to recognize when I was losing too many electrolytes and got a friend to take me to the emergency room, where I spent 9 hours getting rehydrated.

I was so tired I slept a couple hours and then took his pulse and blood pressure. It was so low Im not sure how I got him to the car. But the doctor said to go home, put him to bed, he'll be fine with the meds we gave you. He was in ICU for 4 days and then in the hospital 10 more days after I just brought him home.

-1	The only thing i can imagine with my minimal knowledge was when my youngest had over come their bought with the hand foot mouth disease and a friends children contracted it at their daycare. I was able to advice her what we had been advised, the benefit to her was a reduced down time in illness. Her children seemed to get well a bit faster, maybe because i had been able to give her advice on what helped us. I do not have a lot of knowledge nor have i had many sitiuations present themselves for knowledge to be gained... yet!
-1	When my sister was little she had a lot of issues.The doctor would diagnose her with inner ear issues (not infection) to behavioral issues, but I read about sensory processing disorder and thought it sounded like what she might have. I told my mom about it and she asked the doctor how to get her tested. The doctor said it was a made up condition to explain behavioral issues but my mom asked for another opinion. That pediatrician referred her for testing and she not only got a diagnosis of SPD but a few years later we found out she has autism. If I hadn't pushed my mom to have her tested it she might have missed out on early interventions and her sensory issues would be labeled behavioral.
-1	When I was diagnosed with IBS I had to learn how to change my diet first and foremost. I had to do some research because at the time I was told it wasn't a disease and could not be treated (ten years ago). I had to figure out what aggravated my condition and learn to cope with it.

I also noticed that I became a lot more thirsty and lazy than usual so I stopped and considered my risk factors. I know that my family has a high history of diabetes and hypertension (and high cholesterol), so I took it upon myself to buy a blood pressure monitor and measure my blood pressure over a period of a week. It was not favorable, so I talked to a nutritionist and made a healthy eating plan as well as an exercise routine. By monitoring it further, I successfully decreased my blood pressure significantly and it has remained in safe levels since I have continued my routine.

1	I honestly don't really think that I have any. Outside of regular checkups I haven't ever been to a hospital. I guess the closest thing would be that I have a daughter, and I've had to read and talk to doctors about her. However she's only been to hospital once for something other than I regular checkup so I don't know how much experience that really gives me either. Overall I think just my general ability to understand things is probably my best experience.

-1	My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago and at that time I didnt know much about it. Over the years I have educated myself all about it ans In turn that has given me the knowledge to take preventive measures for myself. A few months ago my aunt was diagnosed as well. Science has come a long way since I first learned about it so that knowledge that I had from the experience with my mom helped me to be prepared for any questions that my aunt had during her process and I think the fact that my mom went through it too help me as well to get through it.

Though she was an adult, I knew she was incapable of handling this herself and rushed her to the ER, which the doctors said was good and immediately gave her treatment to bring down the temp safely and quickly. I was her advocate and wouldn't stop explaining her other symptoms, which they ran extensive tests on after I insisted and found the root cause. It was at that point they were able to correctly give her the medicine to properly treat her condition.
1	This is difficult to identify. I can only describe it definitively as the moment that I had children of my own to take care of. I care so much about them that I learn about things that I would otherwise ignore. I want them to be healthy; therefore, I learn as much as I can about health and medical issues. While not objectively logical, it is a function of love.

The next day I went to visit her and saw that her hands were in poor condition. She had removed the bandages and several of her fingers had open, weeping wounds. I thought a couple of them might be infected. She refused to return to the hospital. Later a visiting nurse came and confirmed possible infection. She also convinced my aunt to return to the hospital. Fortunately she was able to make a full recovery.
1	I knew the technical terms used by the doctor during my husband's cancer treatment.  I also knew the doctor was not keeping up with the latest science and he confirmed that to be true, given his schedule.
1	I worked in a rural hospital that served as the local area cancer treatment center on the weekends.  I would sit for hours and register patients for treatment the following day.  I would have to file lab and xray results into their charts.  This was before everything went paperless.  I spent a lot of time reading notes and diagnosis because I worked a lot of second and third shifts.  I was still in college and I tried to make the most of my time when I was a work.  
1	My brother had been in the hospital and he didn't have insurance. We lived in NJ at the time and they add an additional amount onto your bill as an uninsured patients fund. I believe it was about 50% of the bill. I called around and after much effort discovered that uninsured patients weren't required to pay this part of the bill. It was only for insurance companies. I eventually received a form from the state of NJ and had my brother complete it and he mailed it. After we received the response, I still had to travel to the hospital and show it to the billing office because they were still refusing to adjust his bill. After I provided them with a copy of the response, they eventually adjusted his bill and he was able to pay the rest of the bill with the assistance of a plan he had that paid him for every day he spent in the hospital (about nine days). Sorry, this is the only experience I had that was related to your question.
1	One time I was not feeling well and I was able to go online and look up my symptoms. The tentative diagnosis I gave myself matched what my doctor thought.
1	"I was told I have high cholestrol and needed to make changes to improve that. I knew that it meant i had to get my bad cholestrol ""LDL"" to below 100 and the good cholestrol ""HDL"" to above 50."
-1	When I had an STD scare, I had to look for issues and symptoms in certain places. I had to research and use my common knowledge on the issue.
1	I have absolutely no idea what you're asking. But I'll give this a shot. I recently saw a neurologist for another shot at figuring out what's causing the muscle weakness I've been experiencing for more than four years now. I was able to give her a timeline of symptoms, severity of the problem, list the tests that have been performed, and ensure that she understood everything. I asked her about a specific test, and she agreed that would be a logical next step. 
1	while at a restaurant, a patron was signalling that she was choking after eating a chicken wing. i recalled learning the heimlich maneuver in school, and i was able to successfully perform the procedure.
1	One time, my nephew cut his hand and was very nervous.  I proceeded to not only stop the bleeding, but give him a lesson in basic first aid.  This involved methods for stopping bleeding, barriers to infection, and treatment of bruises or sprains.  He found this lesson interesting and informative and demonstrated these skills later on when injuring his ankle a few weeks later.
1	Once my gums above a certaion tooth became swollen and inflamed and it really hurt. I had no idea what it was but then I realized that a cavity that I had neglected to get taken care of was to blame. I went to the emergency room and they took an x ray and confirmed that it was an abscessed tooth.
1	My pregnancy required that I ask my doctor lots of questions about symptoms that I was experiencing. I frequently went to each appointment with a list of questions about what was normal and what was not. My doctor was impressed that I had learned so much about pregnancy and pregnancy complications.
1	Woman problem. I had my period for 8 months straight before my doctor got me into a specialist (gyno). I was quite confident when I was able to go back to my doctor and repeat what my gyno had said and understood what I was talking about. hyperplasia is the overgrowth of uterine tissue, which was causing that issue, but I also had multiple cysts at different times on different ovaries, but not in my uterus.
1	I knew I had knowledge of health or medical issues. When I pretty much diagnosed myself and told my doctor what was wrong with me. She ignored me and treated me for something else. Well I was back in there after my treatment was over and asked her to test me for what I thought was wrong. The testing showed I was right.
1	I had gained a lot of weight at one point, so I decided to lose the weight. I went on a diet and exercise program I made up for myself. I reduced my calories and fat consumption. Also, I decided to start running most days. I lost around 100 pounds in about 9 months. During this diet I was kept very close tract of my calorie consumption. I was ware of how many calories different foods have.
1	A few times, I had feelings in my chest that might've been mistaken for a heart attack, but I knew I didn't have any accompanying symptoms, so I didn't panic just yet and call 911. Only once did I nearly have to use my CPR training on someone before EMT arrived. 
1	I was able to bring up some possible causes of what I may have been suffering from to my doctor. When they explained things I was able to easily understand and ask questions.
-1	I don't know , just accepting the fact that I have to go to a doctor and let them diagnose the problem seems good enough. The fact that I'm not someone who goes on the internet and tries to solve there own medical problems means I'm doing better than a lot of people.
-1	I have been Type 1 diabetic since I was 10 years old. This really helped when my nephew was diagnosed because most of my family is semi=aware of what to expect. My nephew still calls to ask questions sometimes and I am happy to help.
-1	I have a thyroid issue where my body doesn't produce calcium. Ive had this issue for about 15 years. I have to see the doctor regularly because it can cause seizures.
1	An experience I has that demonstrated my knowledge of medical issues was when I cut my finger, and due to a rather large snowstorm, was unable to leave to possibly get it looked at. I went ahead and washed it out with hot water, and disinfected the cut on my finger. I also went ahead and elevated it slightly and applied pressure until most of the bleeding had stopped. I had somewhat skimmed the top layer of my skin off, so it looked a lot worse than it actually was, and in this situation I was able to control my thoughts and use basic first aid, rather than freaking out about the situation and causing myself to panic.
1	I was at a festival and a person was experiencing dizziness and nausea. I noticed that the person was wearing heavy clothing even though it was a hot day. I asked the person if they'd drank any water that day and they had not. I thought that the person may be dehydrated and overheated and told him he should slowly drink as much water as he could and to place a wet towel over his head and neck. 
1	My brother was recently in a car accident and in the years preceding I volunteered by Special Olympics, therefore I understood how to work a wheelchair, transfer a patient from a bed to the the chair, and other such apparatus know-how. 
1	I don't necessarily have knowledge of these issues. Whenever I or my family members have issues I usually research on the internet or consult with doctors or people who have been trained in this field.
1	I had an auto accident a little over two years ago. I was rear-ended, and although I had no scratches or bruises, I did hit my head hard on the headrest and the rear impact caused pain in my back within the hour. I knew to apply ice and knew to rest until I could be checked out by a physician, which somewhat controlled swelling. Plus I knew to seek treatment immediately for rehabilitation and to reduce any muscle damage/scarring.
1	When I started working out I learned that muscle building is most effective when gaining weight. After researching the topic, I found that weight gain is decided by one factor only: calorie count. The weight u gain is the difference between the calories you intake and the calories you consume. 
-1	I was seen by an orthopedic surgeon for a chronic ACL tear and osteoarthritis in my left knee. I did physical therapy, and when I was released from therapy, he told me I'd be back in a couple years for a knee replacement. I told him not to hold his breath. Came home, and started walking longer distances - 4-6 miles a day. I lost 20 pounds, and took several anti-inflammatory and ligament strengthening supplements, and kept walking. That was 16 years ago, and I still have my knee, thank you. By the way - the doctor I saw needed to lose about 50 pounds.
1	Several years ago my father was in the ICU after being unfortunately caught in a store robbery. He was shot 3 different times and the medical issues were immense. I was successfully able to listen and understand the doctors as they were explaining everything to my family and I. Other family members came to me to explain it better in layman terms to them. 
-1	I studied medical assistant program and it has given me some knowledge of various tests and procedures as well as health and medical issues. It has also helped working in this environment and from reading and office/hospital visits.
-1	I had a bad cut on my hand that probably could have benefited from having stitches. I took care of it on my own, however, from previous experience with bad cuts. Through proper bandaging, cleaning, and maintenance, I was able to heal the cut in about two weeks. 
-1	"My husband had severe pain in his left side after a pleurodesis procedure. He also had a fever, an elevated white blood cell count, and constipation. The doctor insisted it was just ""residual pain"" and the body's response to the procedure, while I kept arguing that it was more likely he had an infection of some kind. The doctor refused to do any blood work or send him for a CT scan to be sure, so we left that hospital AMA and went to another facility's emergency room. They found out my husband had a ruptured intestine, which required emergency surgery. He died 22 days later of sepsis from that rupture. Doctors don't always know everything and should learn to pay attention when their patients say something else is wrong."
1	I have borderline cholesterol issues.  So I have done a lot of research on eating properly  to keep that from going up.  I actually had it go down into a very normal range.
1	I hade to remove my gallbladder afte experiencing pain and found that I had multiple gallstones so I went through many tests and a medical medical surgery
-1	An experience in my life when I demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is in being able to assist when people are having seizures. 
1	I don't have a good knowledge on health medical issues. I take my doctor's advise or someone in the medical profession like a nurse. I know that because I am diabetic I need my blood sugar to be between 180 to 80 to be normal after eating 2 hours ago but within 4 hours or eating. In the morning before I eat it should to between 80 to 120. I know I should eat between 45 grams to 60 grams of carbs per meal, and 15 to 20 grams for a snack.
1	I honestly cant think of one where I have but Im always willing to go the doctor if something is wrong
1	my brother is a diabetic so once my friend was telling me he wasn't feeling well and he described  his symptom and   from my experience i could tell he had low blood sugar
1	After tearing my ACL in 2012, I ended up re injuring it once again in 2013 and had to have two surgeries. By the second surgery I was already prepared with what I had to do for recovery and rehab. 
1	I had been vomiting every morning for 4 months. I saw 6 different types of doctors and none could give me a diagnosis or any relief. I did my own research and discovered Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome. I brought the empirical guidelines to my doctor and have had successful treatment since.
1	i was in an auto accident and fractured 3 bones in my hip pubis illium and ischium and because i had taken an anatomy course i knew exactly where those bones were.  And why i was in so much pain
1	My family has a long history of diabetes, heart disease and breast cancer knowing this has helped me recognize sysmtoms, prevention and care for those disease also.
1	When I got hired to work security for a large corporation, they put us through a special version of the CPR training so that we can be informed and help if anything were to happen while we are on post. I had previously taken the CPR training because I spent some time working at a hospital briefly and they required it. I demonstrated my knowledge by completely acing all of the tests and the demonstrations they had me perform, and even helped out other people who were having difficulties performing the tasks.
1	I was a caregiver for my mother-in-law when she had cancer. So I would go with her to her appointments and I always took along a notebook and made sure to ask questions and write down the answers. It was really important that we understood and remembered everything that was said. I am not sure if this is the kind of answer you are looking for, but I believe that the communication between a doctor and patient is the crucial factor. My knowledge is that I know that I don't know, so I have to depend on my doctor's knowledge and expertise.
1	I understood helath issues when I got a UTI. My doctor fully explained everything that was going on with my health at the time. I told him I fully understood and took the extra steps neccessary to nclear up my issue.

1	I had a growth on the side of my torso that became inflamed every 3-4 months. One time it got very inflamed. I didn't know what it could be, so I went to doctor to have it checked. 
1	I am a Standardized Patient for medical students and have been for over 15 years. I have portrayed a multitude of cases including blood clot, sinusitis, pregnancy, appendicitis both during pregnancy and not, gallstones, pediatric meningitis, etc, so I have a fair amount of knowledge above the regular person not in the medical field.
1	I've always had problems with cramping during my periods, and have had a history of ovarian cysts.  I had multiple exploratory surgeries to remove the cysts.  The cysts came on a cycle of approximately every five years, I would have surgery every five years to have them removed.  Finally after quite a bit of research and discussion with my doctor it was decided to do a partial hysterectomy and remove my uterus to see if that would break the cycle.  this worked for ten years, at that time I started getting the cysts on my ovaries again, with the pain being 75% of the month.  it was decided that my ovaries needed to come out to prevent this from happening.  By my doctor being informed on what the best course of action was for me I was able to keep my ovaries for a longer period of time, therefore not having to take synthetic hormones until absolutely necessary. 
1	I worked at as a physical trainer and had to help monitor heart rates and health concerns while people were exercising.  I was also trained in CPR.
1	When I was told I was pregnant. I immediately started taking folic acid, I scheduled my doctor's appointment, I stopped drinking alcohol, and I started trying to reduce my stress.
-1	Try to use common sense and math skills.  It will be better for use to understand the number to be more accurate.
1	As someone who grew up with family members in the medical field and being around people who often had to take medication, I feel that I've had enough early exposure that I'm not uncomfortable around medicine. I'm also in pre-nursing at the moment so some of the pre requisite classes I've taken as well as advanced reading I'm undertaking have given me some insight and knowledge into these kinds of things
1	I do not have any experience at all regarding health or medical. Everything I know if from experience or looking it up online or in a book. Or asking my mother.
-1	I was eating a lot of food in the past and I was gaining a lot of pounds. I noticed I didn't fit into my clothes and my body was changing as in body weight. I began to exercise and decrease my food intake to the point where I lost a lot weight.
1	Before surgery, I had asked the doctor if me having a high platelet count would cause an adverse reaction. I knew that platelets were involved in blood clotting and surgeries can have a higher risk of blood clots (due to not moving around, etc.). I did not want to have blood clots and also wanted to make sure that the doctor was aware of my condition. Thankfully he said the chance was very minimal; however, I was still told to keep my compression stockings on for a few days following surgery.
1	My son when he was young began choking on a grape in a restaurant.  I was able to perform the Heimlich Maneuver on him successfully.
-1	I had to be proactive when talking to my son's doctors about a medical course of action for him due to his kidney issues.

1	I was recently in a car wreck last year and went to see the doctor because I had pain in my back and neck. I explained to the doctor that I had a previous back injury (bulging disc) from a sports injury and that I had pain in the same places but not as severe. After we did x-rays and and MRI he explained that there was no serious damage done to my vertebrae and I fully understood the situation because I had been through it before.
1	I have raised a family , with two children, who are now 34 and 36 years old.  I faced and dealt with the whole spectrum of childhood mishaps, common illnesses, and accidents, thank God successfully.  Mainly I got good at discerning when medical help was absolutely needed and when I could handle it myself with  ordinary first aid and care.
1	Recently I had a tubal ligation.  I was talking with a friend who was slightly misinformed about the potential side effects of the procedure.  Since I had recently learned a lot about it, I helped to correct her.  She stated that in most cases, the blood vessel supplying the ovary would be cut along with the Fallopian tube.  I informed her that not only was this very rare, if it did happen to someone she knew, they could probably sue for malpractice.  My doctor personally assured me, and she has done so many procedures she lost count a long time ago, she had never seen it happen where the blood vessel was cut.  So I let my friend know about it, and she was pleasantly surprised.

-1	I am a runner and when I received injured to my foot I would study resources relating to the anatomy of the bones and muscles in my foot so I could pinpoint what was going wrong and how to fix it. Later on, when I would go to my podiatrist, they would explain possible symptoms to me. I was able to hold a comprehensive conversation because I had learned much about how the foot works and learned the jargon necessary to convey a detailed diagnosis.
1	A friend asked me where she should go for prenatal checkups. I felt that my doctor was knowledgeable and caring so I sent my friend to that doctor. The friend was pleased with the doctor.
1	My knowledge about health issues, starting with myself, was when I had my wisdom teeth pulled under general anesthesia at the age of 22.

I've had a C-section, Appendectomy, Gall Bladder removal and taken care of my mother with dementia to her last days on this Earth.
1	My mother had Parkinson's Disease and I unfortunately had to learn about Parkinson's Disease and he stages of the disease itself. 
-1	I was overweight for a period in my life.  I did what I could to lose it by eating healthy and working out.  I got obsessed with staying fit.
1	I have learned that to reduce your weight and improve your health is to reduce the amount of fats and carbohydrates in your diet.  So I changed my diet to reduce those types and food and I reduced my weight and improved my blood pressure.   My plan is to continue you this year since I want to lose another 20 pounds.

The concussion lead to a few complications that I was unaware of, but learned about them and have been able to deal with them because of the information I learned and received.
1	I have found bee propolis and elderberry to be very effective in treating the common cold. While on my job I have in many instances seen people who were sick quickly recover after I give them a couple of capsules of these. They are effective because they enhance and boost the immune system to fight the virus.
1	I had some shoulder pain that I had researched a lot on my own before I went to the doctor.  The analysis I was able to give about the type of pain and the motions that caused it helped us pinpoint it much more quickly than if I hadn't done so.
-1	An issue I had one time when I was around 16 and discovered a lump mass in my right breast and told my doctor. 
1	I was told by my doctor to get a shingles vaccine but since I had already thoroughly read the warnings on the prednisone pamphlet that the pharmacy gave me I knew that someone taking prednisone had to be off of it for  at least 6 months before taking any live vaccines.  Knowing this saved me from having a severe case of shingles.
1	I don't know if I could do that the best I can come up with is that I know some good ways to prevent myself from having a seizure and I can also feel when they are coming on in time for me to get somewhere safe. That is pretty much the extent of my knowledge I don't know how to do much that is not related to that is pretty much my life.
1	I can't think of anything particularly demonstrative. After experiencing certain conditions, I am better able to determine whether I am experiencing the same thing again or having a new experience.

When that happened I knew what it was and went to the dr and followed their advice of using a sling and taking pain medication at the specified intervals.

1	My daughter had her blood work come back and the doctor said that everything was fine. We got home and I got looking through her paper work from discharge and I seen that one of her lab results was higher than it should have been according to the paper.

The concept of experience generally refers to know-how or procedural knowledge, rather than propositional knowledge: on-the-job training rather than book-learning."
-1	I started getting painful bumps along the left side of my forehead and over my eye. At first I didn't know why but by the second day I realized that this could possibly be shingles given that it was painful and only on one side of my face. I went to the doctor because it was so close to my eye and that concerned me and she confirmed that I was correct that I did have shingles. Everyone was worried that they would contact this from me but I knew that if they had previously had chicken pox they would not get this and if they didn't have chicken pox they wouldn't get shingles from me but would actually could get chicken pox from having contact with me. My dr. confirmed that this was correct.
1	I have always been interested in health and medicine. I believe healthy living starts with the nutrients (food) you put in your body. Exercise and a healthy lifestyle in general is important to health success.

1	My sister was extremely concerned about a lump she found in her leg.  She called me very upset and scared.  I told her that it is very likely just a cyst and not anything cancerous and to not google it.  She went to the doctor and found out it was just a cyst, as I had told her and she was fine.  I don't really have much experience with anything medically serious, so this was the only example I could think of.
1	In high school, I did my health presentation on atherosclerosis and that taught me a lot about causes of plaque build-up and how the body manages it through a mixture of LDL and HDL fats. It was a half hour presentation and I used visualizations on a computer to illustrate the process. That project also showed me how I could use better sources of information that were available to me, like Nature and Scientific American to get a detailed understanding of health processes.
1	Well, one time I was with my friend who was high and I noticed he started having what appeared to be symptoms of an anxiety or panic attack. I assured him that he would be okay, (he thought he was having a heart attack). 
1	My daughter has Chiari 1 Brain Malformation. We've been to many different emergency rooms and doctors offices where the staff and doctors were not familiar with her condition. We have had to educate many doctors and healthcare workers about Chiari and how it is treated. 
1	One morning I woke up and felt extremely lightheaded. It was a hot summer day and I had not been drinking much water that week. I nearly fainted when I went to go use the bathroom. I figured occurred  because of the extreme heat and because I had been so dehydrated during the week. I immediately got me a cold glass of water and put on lighter garments. I allowed myself to sit and rest and made sure I had drunk plenty of water throughout the day. I did not have any other episodes like this since.
1	When I went to a doctor last year about painful anal fissures and haemorrhoids, I was already pretty well informed about them. This was due in part to having researched them in the past, both in how they relate to poor diet and how they can be caused or exacerbated by anal sex. I already knew going in that these would take a long time to heal, so I didn't expect a quick recovery. Furthermore, I was able to ask better clarifying questions during my appointment due to my prior knowledge, which helped me understand what I needed to do as well as diagnose the cause more quickly.
1	I was a caretaker for both my mother and my father in the last years of their life while managing my own health issues.  I had to learn many skills while caring for both my mother and father like how to change, service a colostomy bag, measure diabetic sugar level, maintain.  Also had to care for my own bipolar 1, meetings, etc. Dad had dialysis as well. had to learn all of that.
1	I had that heart problem several years ago and though it wasn't the cause of my problem, my cardiologist advised me to reduce my salt intake. I now know a lot more about sodium content in all kinds of foods & what is the recommended limit.
1	I went a course on how to provide cpr to a paitient no I am ready for when ever anything happens to one of my family members in order to administer CPR. I know that it can revive someone having a heart attack, and my father has had a heart attack so just in case it happens again I can bring him back to life again. I also spend a lot of time with my grandmother so it will be very useful to know this knowledge beforehand just in case anything happens. I highly recommend everyone taking a CPR course and learning about what it can do for people in danger.
1	Well, I had my first child almost two years, prior to getting pregnant with that child, I had an early miscarriage and learned that I also likely have PCOS which could make it difficult to get pregnant again in the future.  Prior to being diagnosed with this I did not know about this issue, but now through those appointments and talking with a couple of friends, I feel like I know a lot more.
1	I was told that I am underweight for my height, as such that I needed to eat more. As such I had decided to exercise in regular intervals as well as I did not want to experience negative side effects associated with overeating. So with the help of online resources I formed a meal plan that fits within a recommended nutritional profile/caloric intake for my body size. As with the previous questions it involves some light mathematics and a bit of research, but it is very much worth it knowing that I am in as much control as I can get in the maintenance of my health.

On my way home from her house that night, I became very ill and knew right away that I needed medical care because my body did not react in the normal way this illness would have affected a child. 
1	I was poisoned with palytoxin. I was hospitalized for two days. The whole toxicology came down and thought I was bit by a lionfish when in fact I was poisoned by zoanthids.

1	I had a friend/coworker who had a peculiar change in some patterns that I noticed. He was using the bathroom more often and constantly refilling his water bottle throughout the day. We are software engineers, and he also complained about issues he was having while typing on the keyboard, which he attributed to repetitive stress. I have family members who have had diabetes and suggested that he might want to see a doctor, as some of the issues mentioned above are symptoms. It turns out that I was correct and he is now receiving treatment for it.
1	Prior to my first spinal fusion, I had a list of questions for my doctor. He was surprised at the amount of research I had done in order to be informed. I asked specific questions about the XLIF procedure that he had proposed and what the difference in recovery times and success were in relation to other procedures. I asked specifically where the bone marrow would be drawn from in order to create the fusion. We had a great discussion and he was happy to answer what he referred to as very intelligent questions.
-1	I used to teach mentally ill about their illnesses in a group setting.  I have a bachelors degree in psychology which helped in this.

1	I had a strong pressure in my lower chest region. It turned out to be just gas and I was able to self diagnose. i went to the doctor anyways and they confirmed.
1	I had to get a blood test done to see if I could be diabetic. I had some signs and to help ease my nerves I was checked and given a clear bill of health. It just turned out to be a coincidence but I based it off of my dad and my aunt both of whom are diabetic.

1	When I wanted to lose weight I decided to start tracking calories and macro nutrients. Previously I had never really paid attention to food labels but to properly track my consumptions I had to purchase a food scale and weigh my food and keep a journal. I was shocked out much I was actually eating as you assume the serving size is much larger than what it actually is. Watching my intake I was easily able to lose 5 pounds with diet alone before changing my exercise to lose more.

1	One time, a friend of mine got sick. I went over to check on him and make sure he was okay and was able to get him to feel better by buying the right medicine, food and liquids he needed. That is about as much knowledge as I have and if I needed more, I'd have sent him to the doctor.
-1	I have asthma and my son has asthma. We were following the doctor's action plan but it wasn't working. I knew right away that he needed to go to the emergency room. He was admitted and they didn't start him on steroids. I told the doctor I knew he needed them.

1	I had a severe stabbing pain in the lower right side of my abdomen. It was unlike anything I had ever felt before, and left me literally doubled over in pain crying. I had a suspicion it was a kidney problem. I went to urgent care and they said, no it's nothing, just take an antacid. Less than 5 hours later, the pain was completely unbearable and I almost fainted while waiting at the ER. Sure enough, I was about to pass a large kidney stone and had an infection of my kidney as well. I was admitted overnight, given 3 bags of IV antibiotics, and a mild painkiller or antiinflammatory to hold me over while the stone passed.
1	I had a hunch that I was a test subject for a certain rare disease and had to go through a lot of hoops because I couldn't exactly pinpoint what was wrong with me, it included a colonoscopy at age 21 and various other random bullshit since I had no idea what was wrong with me. I learned about various random problems and diseases that may have been unrelated until I eventually dropped everything and continued to live my life as if I didn't have any of those problems. Usually a doctors visit is really simple but I had one that made me rethink my health choices for a couple years in various ways. The disease was called PNH.
1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health was when my girlfriend passed out due to low blood sugar. She became conscious and I instantly gave her candies I had nearby to bring her levels up and she slowly began to feel better. 
1	I had kidney stones that I needed to pass, and I went to the hospital and told them that that's what I thought was happening.

I went in pretty much knowing what the problem was just looking for a solution. 
1	My doctor felt a lump on my right breast.  I had to get a mammogram, sonogram and have a biopsy. Then I had another mammogram.  I got a call a day later telling me it was benign and nothing to be worried about.  I did research and asked lots of questions to the doctor and nurse.

1	I worked as a health unit coordinator for 25 years up until 2014 when I retired. A main part of my job was to have an extensive knowledge of medical terminology. I have worked in various departments in a large city hospital ranging from telemetry, medical/surgical and maternity.
1	I have had a total thyroidectomy. I have had so many issues with trying to balance my medications. Everything relates to the thyroid. I never would have known all this information without going through this.

1	I was a CNA. I worked in a nursing home for a while. I have experience with my own health issues in the back.
1	I recently went to the doctor because I had lost 20 pounds unintentionally. My doctor thought it might be related to a thyroid problem but I want to get my cortisol checked to see if it was an adrenal issue. She then ordered both of those tests. 
1	My brother was diagnosed with Muscular dystrophy and I use to help with him by providing nurses who were unfamiliar with disease with relevant information on how to deal with certain that issues that arises with dealing with individuals with muscular dystrophy.

-1	I don't really think I have had this other than knowing when not to, or when to call a doctor depending on the symptoms I am having the temperature. I haven't had this happen other than this though, so I'm really not sure what else to say about it. 
1	I had a stroke when I was 22 and I was able to understand why it happened to me and what things I needed to get checked out so it wouldnt happen again. I actually was a big advocate for myself because I had a stroke, followed by a concussion and a seizure but when I woke up 45 minutes later I had no residual symptoms. I had to convince the doctors and radiologists to look for proof that I had a stroke and I was able to find evidence of it so we could figure out more about why it happened.
1	I was able to tell a coworker what condition that they might have. They told me about some symptoms that they were experiencing. I was able to help them reach a diagnosis.

1	I had major heart surgery in 2006 to repair an aortic aneurysm, replace an aortic valve, and install a pacemaker.  Within a month of exiting the hospital, I suffered a DVT and had a bout of ventricular tachycardia.  After 12 years of ongoing monitoring and medication, I have gained a significant knowledge of the state of my own health.  I have also had other surgeries, and currently suffer from an arthritic damaged knee that needs replacement.  At sixty five years old&lt; I guess it is just the cumulative knowledge that a person gains through these experiences which has added to my health knowledge.
-1	When I was pregnant and had to get prenatal care to prevent gestational diabetes.  I also I to get prenatal testing to ensure nothing was wrong with the baby.
1	I just had shoulder surgery. I researched recovery periods, alternative treatments and risks of doing nothing. In the end I chose surgery.
-1	I somewhat have knowledge about my diastis recti. I would look it up on the internet before asking my doctor and I found out what I had because I didn't know if it was a tumor or cancer. My medical issue was easy to diagnose and I understood way more about it before going to the doctor
1	I once got a fever. I hydrated myself and decided to sleep early. I think that this helped me recover more quickly than if I had stayed awake. I also kept stimuli to a minimum so that migraines wouldn't happen.
1	When I was shopping for food, I used my knowledge of nutritional information to select foods that wouldn't give me too many calories, excessive sugar consumption, etc. 
1	I noticed one tiny drop of blood in my urine a while back.  I had a long bout with bladder cancer years ago so I first made an appointment with a urologist for a cystoscopy.  That was negative so I then went to a gynecologist and it was discovered that I had endometrial cancer and I had a hysterectomy.  One little drop of blood would have been ignored for a time if i hadn't had the bladder cancer experience.
1	Lowered blood pressure by changing diet. Found foods I liked that helped lower my blood pressure thst I enjoyed eating. Grains, fruits and vegetables are good for you.

1	I started doing a lot of research when I started having children. So I became very aware of different remedies and modes of service out there.
1	I took the test to detect the presence of the prostate cancer antigen knowing the high probability of false positives.  I was prepared to consider not taking further action if the test came back positive unless further symptoms occurred.  The test was negative, so no decision need to be made.
-1	I used to take care of my grandmother. Her mind was starting to go and one day she started having really bad hallucinations and talking nonsense. At first, I thought maybe it was dementia, but then I remembered that strange behavior and hallucinations can often be a symptom of UTIs in the elderly. I called her doctor and was able to get antibiotics. 
1	There are none. You can require a minimum number of character if you want to but that doesn't change the facts. I have never had serious medical problems so my medical knowledge was never put to the test. I don't have any medical knowledge besides common sense in the first place.
1	Several early college classes tested us on human health and medical issues. I also studied psychology as my major, so if mental health counts, I graduated with a 3.5 GPA. I would say that my grade demonstrated an above average knowledge of health and medical issues.

1	While practicing jujitsu I have helped a fellow practitioner that was injured make a sling and gave advice on heating and icing practices. In most sports I have done I have helped people out when they receive injuries, as I have experienced most of them myself. 
-1	I hurt my lower back quite badly, I knew that heat would relax the muscles to stop my back muscles from spasming so much, but its wouldn't help with the inflammation. So I decided to take ibuprofen for the pain but also because I know its a NSAID.  After the pain became more managable, I switched to acetaminophen since it would be easier on my stomach than ibuprofen. 
1	I listen and learn when I go to the doctor. I read information on the internet and what the doctors give me. 
1	I have taken a few classes on basic health and medicine.  I have regularly gone to the doctor all my life and have done quite a bit of reading on health and healthy activities.  
1	After I went through puberty, I started getting migraines every day. Since then, I have seen more doctors then probably most people will see in their entire lives. Not a single one took my concerns seriously.
1	"This was many years ago but my mom kept getting these burning, itchy rashes accompanied by hot flashes in the middle of the night.  She went to an allergist that checked her for everything and told her it was allergies.  I was reading about vitamins one day and saw that high doses of niacin is used in cholesterol medicines and causes ""flushing"" as a side effect.  I asked her when she takes her cholesterol medicine and she said ""right before bed"" so I told her what I'd found out.  She had her doctor change her medicine and hasn't had an issue since."
1	I had a severe reaction to an antibiotic a few years go.  A few months after it happened, I filled out my paperwork at a specialist's office and marked that I was allergic to the drug.  I realized when they were printing out a prescription for me that it was the same drug I had put I was allergic to and pointed it out.
-1	For years I have had to take regular PSA tests to determine if I was susceptible to prostate cancer. I additon levels that have gone up and down, I had an enlarged prostate which is a problem in itself - it can affect one's lifestyle since going to the bathroom several times a night can lead to tiredness and other problems -  but not necessairly life threatening. My doctor originally put me on a medication that dealt with the problems caused by the enlarged prostate but being uncomfortable with certain medications (this one I would have to take forever), fearful about the cost and after effects, I took myself off after one bottle. To make a long story short, after two bladder stone surgeries, I eventally had TURP surgery to deal with the problems caused by the enlarged prostate and while it was painful, I do not have to take any life long medication to deal with any problems.
-1	When I became very ill and everytime I ate I had pain in my stomach and had bowel problems I had hpylori and i had to go on a strict clean healthy diet no yeast and strong medicine I really  learned about my body and health and how to take care of myself I still struggle with stomach issues but have learn ways to keep myself healthier day by day 
1	When I was due to give birth to my oldest daughter I was given the option of having her turned in-utero because she was breech presentation and I was a week overdue.  Because the Resident that I was dealing with told me there was only a 50% chance that the baby would stay head down until delivery and she had never done this procedure before, I chose to have a C-section the next day.  When my daughter was born, she was quite large and all agreed that my decision was the safest and most appropriate for the circumstances.
-1	I was having very serious nausea for 3 weeks, I couldn't eat anything. Several people told me it was stress, or acid, but I knew it couldn't be that. I did lots of research and my symptoms were very similar to an under functioning gallbladder. I went to the hospital and had a test done, and it proved that my gallbladder wasn't functioning properly. I'm glad I went by my gut and not what others had assumed. 
-1	When my son was 17 he looked to pass out while playing cards with friends. But he was shaking with his eyes open. This to me was the sign of a seizure, so I made sure to put him on his side to keep his airway open so his tongue wouldnt block it and keep anything he could kick or hit away from him that could harm him till the seizure was over.
1	My grandmother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and I learned a lot from spending time in the hospital and hospice with her.  I would ask the doctors what things meant in her chart so I had a better understanding of what they were doing,
-1	I was taken to the hospital not too long ago because I was having abdominal pain. The pain was so bad that I had actually fainted. The doctor discussed all the different reasons that I might be experiencing the pain.
1	When I had to talk to my mom about a rare lung disease she has. She doesn't know much about it and wasn't sure that she was getting the right treatment. I had to research it more, which I could do because I could understand what I was reading.
1	When my spouse got the flu, i knew that it would be mainly because my spouse didn't get the flu vaccine. By God's Grace my spouse got healed from the flu. I had some knowledge about the issues and symptoms that my spouse was dealing with and I was able to help at the right time.
-1	When  I was experiencing pain in my jaw I instantly knew that it was an infection in my gums rather than the molar itself. I began to search for treatments and cleaned in between my gums and found a chunk of food that was causing the infection. I then cleaned my mouth with an antisceptic solution and the inflation went away in about a week.
1	When my dad started displaying symptoms of pneumonia, I immediately had him rushed to the hospital.  If I didn't know the signs, he would have gone into septic shock.  My knowledge of health issues likely saved his life.
1	My son complained of numbness in his pinkie finger. I asked him how his neck felt and he said it was stiff from using the computer. I told him he might have pinched his ulnar nerve and to raise his computer monitor. He did and the numbness went away.
1	The flu hit my family last week.  We had our flu shots so our fevers weren't extremely high (less than 101).  The accompanying symptoms were severe fatigue, cough, nausea and an extreme sore throat.  I was concerned because in the past my children have had atypical symptoms for strep throat (pain, nausea but no fever). However, I knew that a cough wasn't typical either.  I watched my son's throat for a few days and there weren't any unusual signs until last Thursday night when white spots started showing up.  At that point, my usual wait and see on a fever and cough symptoms turned into a doctor's appointment.  I've learned to wait out viruses but not to mess with what could be a possible strep.  Thankfully it wasn't strep but I knew what to look for and be concerned from past experience.  
1	My son had a sinus infection as a child and was having trouble breathing and my wife and i weren't sure what to do.  I turned on the shower, brought him into the bathroom and shut the door.  The steam helped clear his sinuses so he could finally go to sleep.  My wife was happy.

1	I had just had my third baby and was nursing him one night when I felt my left side go numb. I knew something was very wrong and the feeling lasted into the day. A few days later I could not walk and was slurring my speech so I went to the ER. I was positive I was having a stroke based on my symptoms but I passed the stroke test. After my MRI results came in they indeed saw that I had suffered from an ischemic stroke. 
-1	Honestly I probably get the most knowledge from watching documentaries on health and medical issues. Also two of my siblings are nurses and another one is in nursing school, so I never here the end of medical issues.
1	When my grandma had the symptoms of a stroke, I had to assess her and evaluate what was going on. I took her blood pressure, evaluated her speech, had to get her in a safe position, took her pulse, and called and explained to 911 and the EMTs. I had to explain everything to the nurses and doctors and my family at the hospital because she was unable to speak. I had to explain everything to several doctors as she was kept in the hospital for testing.  This also included knowing all her medications, dosages, times, routes. With the help of my descriptions, the doctors were able to correctly diagnose her with a likely causes. It was not a stroke, it was toxic encephelopathy.
-1	When my mother passed out on the floor I made sure she was breathing. I did mouth to mouth CPR. I also ended up calling the ambulance because she was unconscious. 
1	I have kids that get sick sometimes and we always have to make a decision about when they need to see a doctor or when they don't. I use my past experiences and current symptoms to make that decision. 
1	I have virtually no knowledge of health or medical issues.  I once learned, in a community college course, how to do the Heimlich maneuver. I've never had any opportunity or reason to use it outside of that one instance though. 
1	"I am a mom of 7 children, so I often have to make late night ""diagnoses"" using the internet as my source. Recently one of my children had a sore throat. I googled it and found images. I looked in her throat and determined that it was strep throat by the white spots on the back of her throat. The next day I took her to the doctor, and it was diagnosed as strep throat. "
1	I have had eczema since I was a teenager, and I know that when I have a breakout that I can't control at home that the best thing for me is oral steroids. I have had doctors that have wanted to prescribe something else, but I usually insist that they give me the oral steroid.
1	All of my knowledge is done through the internet. With how the internet is today you can search anything and many accredicted doctors will have information on what these symptoms can mean. People can also post on forums who have had the same issues and they openly discuss them for the world to see and learn from.
1	I I had an abnormal cervical screening.  I was diagnosed with PCOS, inferitility, and IBS.  You just kind of pick up knowledge as you go.  The older I get the more I am diagnosed with.  You just pick up knowledge of your body as you go along.

It could have been because he had pooped before he was born so there was poop when my water broke. It could have been because I tested positive for Strep B. And it could have been because I had a fever during labor. I later figured out it was because of my fever.
1	I suffer from chronic migraines. I often found a significant tension in my neck when these headaches would occur. I suggested to my PCP that I might benefit from seeing a massage therapist. He agreed and we found the massage therapy would help alleviate the headaches some. 
1	I suffer from RSD and it originally started in my left arm and hand after surgery to repair a broken wrist.  Within 4 months of developing RSD in my arm my left leg started to swell and turn red and blotchy which is a indication of RSD.  My leg was also cold to the touch and very painful when touched which is a definite sign of RSD.  When I saw my pain specialist and he looked he would not believe that it was RSD because he did not believe it traveled, however after finding a newer board certified doctor in pain management he did diagnose this as the RSD traveling and also said it was not in the stage known as CRPS.  I trust my instincts and what my body tells me even if doctors may not agree.

1	My doctor casually mentioned Kleinfelter's syndrome and was surprised that I knew what it was. I don't have Kleinfelter's syndrome, and I really can't remember why I read about it in the first place. We talked about it for a little bit and then moved on with the checkup. I have also printed out pertinent medical studies that I've found interesting on several occasions only to find that my doctor knew something about them already. Those moments were probably the times that fit this question the closest.
1	Several months ago, I woke up with a Soren throat.  My glands were swollen, and when I looked in my mouth, I could see the tell tale signs of strep throats in the back of my mouth.  When I went to the doctor, he confirmed what I already knew - strep.

1	A time when I got a very serious cut and knew to tie a tourniquet to reduce excessive bleeding until I could get to the hospital.
1	Several years ago, I had what appeared to be a bull's eye rash on my abdomen. Having read about Lyme Disease in the past and having spent significant time in the woods in recent weeks, I reckoned that it was likely that I had a tick bite which should be investigated. I went to the doctor before any symptoms (other than the bite) of the illness manifested.

1	My mother had lung cancer and eventually was diagnosed with diabetes due to chemo and eat habits. My mother was not used to her new diagnosis so her sugar levels were up and down. From what I learned in school I was able to help her with trying to get it under control.

1	I've had health issues in my life and my family has also had health issues. I've learned most of my knowledge through having different experiences while going through medical things myself or with another person.
1	Any time I try to explain neurological disorders, every face goes blank. I try to break it down even further and make it more simplified, but it seems as though thinking on that scale of body processes is something most people I've come across just can't grasp. Most do not understand the ties between injury, fever, swelling, neuron misfires, cerebro-spinal fluid, etcetera. I have to know theses things due to personal medical history..
1	One day I passed by a man lying in the street unconscious.  I recognized that glazed look on his face and came to the conclusion that he had a stroke.

1	I recently starting experiencing very bad migraines.  I had to go through all sorts of tests to see what may be causing these sudden headaches.  I had a Cat scan of my head.

1	My partner's dog tore her dewclaw and it needed to be bandaged while it healed.  After some time of bandaging, it still wasn't healing very well.

1	I assisted a relative in treated a flu, cough, cold by speaking to a doctor, reading online material regarding that diagnosis and preparing food for them to heal faster.
1	Probably the area where I know the most about medical issues is in terms of sexual activity. In college, I had to write a couple papers about the issue of sexual education, so I did plenty of research on the subject of STDs or teenage pregnancy. This is probably where I gained a lot of knowledge of health.
-1	I developed a blood clot in my twenties. When I walked into the ER I explained that I had a DVT due to the birth control pills I was taking. I had read the insert and I was correct.

I do everything in my power before resorting to the doctor because there's only so much the doctor will be able to do. 
1	I used to work in a healthcare company in data analytics. So I would have access to all of the patient information and procedural information for the tristate area to run predictive analytics as well as other things.

Additionally, I come from a family of medical professionals so if i had questions about a certain procedure i could always ask.

1	My dad had a massive stroke 10 years ago and my mom and sister were in complete denial about what was happening.  They wanted me to help get my dad to his feet because they thought if he started walking he would be ok.  I recognized immediately what was happening and called 911. My dad lived but he was never the same again.  His doctor showed us a brain scan that showed only a quarter size area of damage in his right brain.  It's scary that a quarter size area of damage could change someone's entire personality.
1	I went to the hospital complaining about light headiness.  The doctor told me that I had Hypertension.  He told me to diet and exercise before he considered prescribing me medication.  Ultimately my blood pressure returned to normal after following a stricter diet with exercise.
1	The last time I went to the doctor, I had strep throat. I was being checked up on and I needed to fill out paperwork at the beginning of my visit detailing some of my medical history and needs. This went smoothly.
-1	I work in a specialized and private hand clinic. Sometimes when patients come up to the window complaining of hand pain and such, I can instantly diagnose their disease. Of course, I don't have the license to clearly diagnose them and give them medical advice without an official diagnosis so I wait until the doctor can.
1	In general, I would just mention that I help certain family members with their own medical and health needs. This could include doctor visits, completing paperwork, understanding how to take medication, etc.
1	In my life, I have learned almost all of my knowledge of health from either my university classes or from medical websites online. The time this knowledge actually came into play was when I went to the hospital and listened to what hospital staff says to patients. Recently my father went to the hospital from an illness while visiting him with my mother the nurse came in to tell us what his condition was like. During the conversation, I had no problem trying to understand any of the basic terms or some of the more difficult medical terms that were discussed by the nurse.
1	A couple years ago I was discharged from the ER suffering from abdominal pain, and other weird symptoms like high blood pressure, and no insight really given as to what was causing this given by doctors. On my own, I was able to figure out that diverticular disease was leading me to experience eventual high blood pressure, and that it got worse the more that I ate, so I could avoid this by fasting when I began to have these kinds of symptoms. That's more than the doctors figured out, maybe I should be a doctor.
1	I have taken many courses on biology and health in general. I think that I know a decent amount about health care.

1	I have to go back to my osteogenesis imperfecta again as having lived with it for over 60 years now, it is what I know best about my own body.   It takes very little for me to fracture. At times I get what are called spontaneous fractures.   Medical professionals who are not particularly familiar with OI can't believe how little it takes for me to get a fracture nor do radiologist always understand that what I often get are tiny hairline fractures which are hard to see.  Thus I can be diagnosed as not having a fracture when I actually do.  I have to know enough to listen to my own body in those cases.
1	I don't know if it's really knowledge, because I did have to research to be sure and still go to the doctor for verification and treatment, but a few months after my daughter's birth I started having breast pain and woke up one night with terrible chills and fever. I thought it might be mastitis (I was breastfeeding) and after some reading online, found the symptoms sounded right. I went to urgent care, confirmed my suspicions, and got some antibiotics.
1	I am a testicular cancer survivor of 15 years. I had to make a choice between surveillance, chemotherapy, and adjuvant surgery (after initial tumor removal).

1	I usually research in internet when I find a health problem. After that I go to the doctor's office. Most of the times my research has given the correct result.

1	My 1 year old son had fever. His fever was 100 degrees. I knew that was a little bit lower for a medical attention. I used fever reducers for home treatment.
-1	My son was diagnosed with fever seizures. I understood that when he had a fever that I had to watch out for this to happen. I was told that I needed to treat any illness where he could get a fever aggressively. If he starts to feel warm or shows signs of his temperature rising he will get meds to have reduce that so it doesn't happen.  
-1	My experience in life would be that I was  a trained combat medic in the US Army, which in turn qualified me to be a paramedic in the civilian world if I chose to take the state liscensing test.
-1	Last year, I had a bout of diverticulitis. I had never suffered with it before, but I knew there was a possibility that it may show up. So I read on line, everything about the stomach, and knew that was it.
1	During nursing school, I did an internship with an Internal medicine Dr.  I was interviewing his patient before he went in to see her, and, while listening to her symptoms, I realized that she had all of the symptoms of an extremely rare disorder that I had just learned about that week in class. A week later, that Dr. informed me that my conclusion was correct, and she did indeed have that disorder.  
1	When I broke my ankle I knew immediately what to do having witnessed somebody else go through the same thing. I was prepared for the upcoming actions. 
-1	i went to get my eyes checked and i stated that the white stuff in my eye was drusen. The doctor was astounded that i knew what the term drusen met.
1	I think my level of experience is pretty common for a regular person. I think i learn more every time i go to the hospital, i get sick or anybody in my close circle gets sick. I also enjoy watching different tv programs that teach you more about how to take care of yourself. I also read a lot of articles online about healthy lifestyle. I took few classes about healthy cooking and nutrition   
-1	As I had said or described previously, through my experience I have been able to learn only the basics for medical cases. For example, a while ago I had some problems with my heart. These problems made me understand that I should drink a lot of water, always avoid strong emotions or dislikes. I understood that I could feel thanks to the problem in the heart dizziness and desire to vomit
-1	I have so many to choose from. When I was pregnany I was put on bed rest for 20 weeks. Was hospitalized 5 times. Had a bunch of different doctors. My husband and I researched progesterone and questioned why I wasnât on it. Turns out all the doctors thought I should be, but none of them did anything because they assumed one of the others had. So upon my urging we began daily treatment 
1	I have a daughter and she developed a skin rash on her legs.  I took her to dermatologist and the dermatoglist said that she had allergies and prescriped a wide variety of medicines for treatment.  But I did research on the diagnosis and my daughter's problem simply didn't appear to be what was described online.  As a result, I took her to a regular doctor who diagnosed her differently and we used the medicine prescribed and the problem cleared up within a week.
1	I have been dealing with anxiety for a very long time, so when a friend was having panic attacks. I took that information along with what i knew about her personality and told her that I thought that she had a disorder and she should go to a therapist. I was right and she got help for it

1	Probably when my step dad was complaining about a growth on his face. I have run across information in the past about skin cancer and immediately told him he should get that checked out.

-1	When I was went to the doctor and found out that my cancer came back, I was already familiar with what medicines I needed to take and was knowledgeable about my options 
-1	My son was born with bilateral megaureters resulting in reflux of urine and destruction of 1 kidney before birth.

1	I have studied the topic of physical health and nutrition quite a bit. I used various sources to increase my knowledge about how to be healthier, what foods to eat, etc. I used this information to make myself healthier and get in shape.

1	My mother had diabetes. She was diagnosed in 1972. I was 12. I had to make sure she took her shot, and that she ate enough, went to the doctor and would call the ambulance when she had too much insulin. There were no blood monitors and it was a shot in the dark. Sometimes she was too high (the highest  was 1250, and sometimes she was too low (once she was 25). I grew up fast.

1	I had been put on a new medicine by a new doctor that I didn't really think I needed to be taking from what I had read. She was a very new doctor and I wasn't sure she really knew what to do. The next year when I went for my annual checkup, I saw an older doctor that had been practicing for years and he immediately said that there was no reason that I should be taking that medicine and I should stop. He tried to explain to me the reasoning thinking that I would be against stopping but I told him that I had thought the exact same thing.
-1	During a recent visit, I was able to inform my doctor of a unbeknownst-to-her documented side-effect relating to wellbutrin.
1	When I found out that I had high cholesterol, the explanation by the doctor was quite complex. It resulted in it being a genetic disorder which was something I couldn't control.

-1	When I was younger in school I remember doing health projects. I had the project boards (tri-fold boards) and my presentations were well researched and sited. Later in life, I can recall even myself having to be re-educated due to advancements in science.

1	I was once out camping in the wilderness with some friends and had been drinking quite a lot. We were cutting up firewood with a saw when my friend sliced his leg open pretty bad. Knowing the alcohol had thinned his blood and the size of the wound we immediately started with first aid of a tourniquet using one of our belts. Foolishly we had no real supplies for cleaning the wound besides vodka, which I knew was better than nothing. After cleaning the wound up it was clear this would not stop bleeding without some sort of suture. We decided to use a cotton strip of shirt over the cut and some duct tape to seal it shut. This held up well until we were able to make it to the hospital for some stitches. 
-1	In all honesty, I can't describe such an experience, because I DON'T have a great knowledge of health or medical issues.  I'm not a doctor, or even a med student. The only account I can give you is when I broke two of my fingers at work (due to a rolling machine accident).  The doctor said that he'd have to burn a hole through one of my fingernails.  I immediately understood why... it's a common practice to prevent clotting and swelling of that area. Sorry folks, that's it.  That's all I can think of.

At the next visit, I told her I believed I had strep throat as well, and she told me there was no sign of strep and sent me out the door. Two days later, I was back in her office, and she then tested me for both strep and mono, which were both positive.
1	When I was pregnant for the first time my period was late and I was throwing up every morning.

1	Recently I encountered (along with several other people) a woman lying prone on the sidewalk during a day when the temperature was less than 0 degrees Fahrenheit. More or less spontaneously, we made sure that she was breathing, that she had a heartbeat, that someone had called 911, and then we did what we could to make sure that she wouldn't suffer too much from the cold by warming her hands in ours, talking to her and making her comfort level as high as possible.
1	"When my late father-in-law was dying of liver failure, I understood what the various symptoms meant in terms of the stage of the disease, and was aware of what would come next, and of his prognosis. For example, I realized that when he developed ascites, that this was a not a good sign and that he probably had limited time to live. When he later developed hepatic encephalopathy, I knew that his time was even more limited, and tried to help my mother-in-law in understanding this (as she was somewhat in denial about the severity of the illness). I never ""second-guessed"" his doctors regarding his treatment, I just wanted to understand what was happening. "
1	A few years back, I fell hopelessly dizzy and could not stand upright for a few days. The spinning was also came with a loud ringing in my left ear which also left me partially deaf. After doing some research online, I came to discover that the ringing in my ears was called tinnitus and that there are stones in my ears that are responsible for equilibrium that I must have knocked out of whack.
1	When my mother in law (age 99, had a heart attack 20 years prior) complained of a sore shoulder and nausea, and her feet turned blue, I suspected that she was having a heart attack. It turned out that I was correct - she had a massive coronary and went into full arrest. 
1	My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago and asked me to come with her to all her appointments. She asked me to make sure all possible questions were asked and everything was explained well enough for her to understand
1	My medical knowledge tends to relate around lower back and foot pain. For a number of years I had experienced lower back pain at a young age and doctors just told me there was nothing to do about it. I then went to se a chirpractor and he was able to adjust my back over a number of sessions. This relieved a lot of the pain I was experiencing. A number of years later I started having really bad foot pain and was told by doctor that it was plantar fisciatus and gave me inserts. This did not help and I basically self diagnosed and firued out that problem was being cause by my lower back. Started to do a number of streches and eventually pain receded. Then went back to chripractor to get an adjustment and this totally removed the pain from my foot
1	I developed a blister rash on the bottom of my feet and on my hands. From all the symptoms, I discerned it was probably dyshidrotic eczema. My primary care physician at the time had never seen it before and tried to treat it but ultimately sent me to a dermatologist. She took one look and said classic DE. 
1	When I have a headache or a sickness of some sort, I used to take ibuprofen or other painkillers like that. For the past couple of years when I get a headache or feel rough I will just drink lots of water and take it easy. I find that when I run a fever and leave a headache alone, I will usually get well much faster and even have a feeling in my body the next day like my body is no longer fighting something. I've come to feel like the pain you during sickness is literally the thing that's gonna defeat the virus and make you feel better sooner, and recently I've been around lots of sick people and haven't been sick in over a year. I feel that I've challenged my immune system like it's naturally supposed to be challenged, and strengthened it as a result. 
1	During my pregnancy, I found out that I had a condition that had a high risk of early delivery. Through research, I tried to best guess the chance I had at delivering and how much the prescribed treatment (progesterone suppositories) would lower it. I also looked up statistics on survival of babies at a given weeks gestation, to make me feel better at the chances of my baby's survival if I did go into early labor. In the end I was fine and stayed pregnant until my exact due date. So my son was born on his exact due date.
-1	this has never happened to me, i always research my symptoms and then go to the doctor to see if the internet was right or wrong. then ask the dr why its this and not these other things.;
-1	I have had a gastric bypass with many complications.  I have had surgery, multiple procedures, medications and lifestyle changes.  Using all of these, and the information I have been given, I am able to manage these problems.
1	When I went to see my most recent psychiatrist, I not only described my symptoms to her but also told her the kind of medications that I wanted to take. I had already studied a lot about my potential illnesses and what would be most helpful, and she prescribed everything I requested. I was at my most stable point after that, all because I gave my own input and knowledge about what was right for me.
1	I've had to demonstrate knowledge of a specific medical issue with my own doctor. I was diagnosed with something she had heard of but wasn't really familiar with. I would conduct research etc and report back to her what I found and she would record for reference with future patients. 
1	My mother-in-law was running a fever of 104 and I noticed she wasn't very coherent so made sure she went to the ER as soon as possible. I made sure someone stayed with her at all times since she was not 100% coherent.
1	I took my godmother to the emergency room for a mild chest pain, which was her compliant at the time. After reading the emergency test results and medicines prescribed, I was able to understand what her underlying medical issues are, which was proved right when we later visited her regular doctor as she explained everything to us. 
-1	I try to exercise, walk and eat healthy. I try to make foods that are good for me.  I try to take to my doctor about all the things I can do to make my life easier and healthy so I can live a long time

-1	I don't really have experience except from reading online and luckily I've only had two medical issues, both having to do with my kidneys. I've learned from the doctors and WebMD about supplements and dietary adjustments that would decrease my risk of kidney stones. Otherwise, I really do not have much knowledge on medical issues.
-1	I had my appendix taken out a few years ago. I had a lot of paperwork and discussions with my doctor and the surgeon.
1	I had a baby two years ago by c-section.  I was able to understand the explanations of why this was medically necessary and agree to it. I also was discharged with material that contained instructions about caring for myself and my son post-partum, and I had no trouble understanding the material I was given.
1	I used to be a certified nurses assistant at a past job over 20 years ago. Therefore, I received lots of knowledge while I was working with Licences Practical Nurses's and Registered Nurse's and taking care of geriatric patients on a daily basis at my past job. 
1	I'm not really sure, probably when I got tested for thyroid problems because I did a bunch of research beforehand. It turned out that I did not have any abnormal thyroid condition.
1	Blood pressure issues.  I know from seeing various family members who had severe high blood pressure what kind of issues can occur.  This was enough for me to decided to address my blood pressure issues with my doctor.

1	My mother was diagnozed with Alzheimer's disease at age 76.  At the time, I read that both high doses of vitamin e and hormone replacement therapy could slow the rpgress of the disease.  In addition, vitamin B12 shots administered monthly would also be beneficial.  I convinced her primary care physician to introduce these supplements into her protocol of care and she remained on a stable plateau of forgetfulness for the next six years, with marked improvement in her mood and sociability.  She died of pneumonia at age 82, before Alzheimer's progressed to its inevitable awful end.
1	I have had check up throughout my entire life. My father was also in the hospital quite often because of a couple different health conditions that he has. I also spent a week in the hospital when I was younger for about 2 weeks because I have a very high fever and pneumonia.
-1	When I was given my lab results while in the Drs office I asked them before I looked at my copies if everything looked good and the nurse said yes everything is perfect so I looked over the reference ranges on all tests done. I found 3 blood tests that were flagged as abnormal and one was really low compared to what the reference range showed for Vitamin D and I was very deficient on paper. I told the DR my findings and he said ohhh just go out in the sun more. Well I talked to a nurse practitioner about it on a follow up appt and she put me on Vitamin D3 supplements for 3 months and I really felt so much better after my level was up. 
1	I eat fruit and vegitables all the time. Because of this I never get sick it seems. I think washing my hands helps too.
-1	When I was in school, I got sick sometimes, and would have to see the doctor. I also had to do a lot of problems like this in school.
1	My first child was born premature. He was in the NICU for a month. During that time I learned, mostly through repeated exposure, how to read a lot of what was going on around me. For instance, I could tell if a baby nearby was have real bradycardia vs. a false brady by the sounds the alarms made.
1	I experienced chest pain on the left side of my chest, so I went to the emergency room thinking I was having a heart attack.  The tests were negative.
1	I had an unusual mole on my shoulder.  It was the same color as my skin but was an unusual shape and just looked very odd.  I researched skin cancer.  I went to a dermatologist and hew was able to test it.  It was cancerous and I had it removed.  
1	I suspected that my son had autism at a very young age. When I took him to the pediatrician, he did not think that my son had autism and did not feel it was necessary to refer him for testing. I persisted and was able to get my son tested. My son was officially diagnosed with autism at the surprise of the pediatrician.
-1	When my mother started experiencing tension types of headaches, I suggest she try to work to loosen the muscles in her neck and shoulders to prevent these headaches. She began stretching each morning and the headaches stopped.
-1	I was certified for CPR a while ago.  I never actually had to use it but I was in a situation where I I was able to assist someone performing it and help remind them of the proper steps, etc to keep them confident.
1	An experience that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues was when I took a pre test in my health class in high school. I did well. I like studying health for fun.
1	Many years ago I found a mass in my breast. I went for a mammogram, which showed something abnormal, then I immediately had a sonogram, which also showed an abnormality. I was soon after scheduled for a biopsy and it was found to be an unusual but benign cyst. I knew enough to do self checks and have it tested.
1	I have Multiple Sclerosis. One symptom I used to suffer from is extensive pain and numbness in my arms overnight. After extensive research I concluded that water fasting would help improve my condition. After 14 days of water fasting the symptom among many others has vanished.
1	I check my weight daily and some days it's increased substantially despite no real change in my diet. This seems to happen most often after I've eaten at a restaurant. Knowing that salty foods can cause the body to hold water for a longer period of time, I can conclude that restaurants use high amounts of salt in their foods and that shows up on the scale as increased weight from excess water in the body.
1	Previously I was thought to have hypertension.  My doctor wanted my cholesterol reduced by 15% in the span of 6 months.  I actively took medication and my cholesterol reduced by 40%
-1	I had an experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues when I had a sonogram on my thyroid. I understood what I was told by my physician and why they wanted to do further testing, due to the results of the sonogram.
1	An experience I had in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was when I when my toddler daughter fell from a tree and cut her arm. She was frantic but I observed that the cut was relatively minor, was an isolated injury, did not appear to need stitches and there were no apparent breaks or rapid swelling. I soothed her tears by reassuring her as I cleaned her cut thoroughly and applied pressure to stop the bleeding. Then I applied a sterile bandage to the wound and walked her through some gentle range of motion maneuvers to verify that her wrist and elbow were unaffected. Since everything checked out OK, I determined that a trip to a physician was probably not necessary. I cleaned and dressed the wound, changed her bandage over the following week, and her healing progressed without incident.
1	I had to determine whether to vaccinate my child.  This led to taking the risk of having autism.  I realized that research was trash and did it anyways.
-1	I have had wheezy breathing since I was a kid, but it was usually only when I was doing something particularly strenuous like hiking or riding my bike. When I got older, I did a good deal of research after experiencing bad wheezing while trying to get back into exercising again. I deduced that I likely had exercise induced asthma. I went to a doctor about it and they confirmed that it was that. 
1	When my daughter was little, she was prone to very high fever when sick, often over 104-105 degrees. I was aware that we were approaching dangerous territory.  Early on, doctors told us that we could overlap Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen every 4 hours because that would allow us to wait the recommended time between the same medication while shortening the time between medications.  We continued this practice, understanding that we were not exceeding recommended dosage, when she would have high fevers. 
1	My son was being evaluated by a cardiologist for a heart condition. The doctor was explaining to me that his pulmonary valve has stenosis and hence had a diagnosis of pulmonary valve stenosis. Because I had recently took a course in college on the heart and how it functions I knew what the word stenosis meant. I also knew the hearts structure and functioning. Without the course I took in college I probably would not have known these terms nor had an understanding how the heart functions or its structures. Because I had prior knowledge of the heart it made it much easier for me to ask questions of the doctor about the diagnosis. It made me feel more at ease when communicating with the doctor because I knew the basic medical terms when referring to the heart. 
-1	When my daughter got a skin allergy reaction when she was 5, i immediately knew  it was food poison by just looking at the color of her skin
1	I had a rash on my leg and suspected that it was Eczema. I went to the doctor and he diagnosed that.
-1	Well I do not have to much experience with examples that I are listed above but I do have basic knowledge of health and medical issues. Well primary my knowledge comes from my wife who is self taught health adviser. Also my mom is a health aid she have been working for 20 years now. Sometimes I do help her with her patients, I usually drive her and her patients to and from doctors appointments. So generally my experience comes from my family, which I am thankful for, because I found a lot of things that will be very useful regarding my health and medical issues.
1	My cadets used to have breathing problems occasionally when we would exercise. Sometimes they passed out. It was my duty to help them stabalize.
1	When my dad was diagnosed with kidney cancer, we both talked about the face that his 1 year survival rate was only about 15%. Particularly interesting was the fact that he had a rare form of kidney cancer and his next door neighbor died of the same cancer a few decades before making us wonder if there was an unusual cluster happening.
1	Recently had a rare winter snow storm in south La. and power was out for days, it was very cold. I knew I would get sick my lungs do not adapt to drastic fast changes in temps. Couple of days later I had a burning sensation in my lung with cough and congestion and a temperature. Called and got in to see my dr and I had pneumonia., I knew what it was before I went in. I pay attention to my body and am aware of my condition and what it means so I got in to the Dr quickly

1	I've had many experiences in my life where I felt I demonstrated knowledge of health and medical issues. A few instances that come to mind are when my children were younger. I use to be able to diagnose their issues with an 80 percent efficiency. This was mainly during the ages of one and five. I felt as they got older my ability to pinpoint their illness was not as spot on as when they were younger. I sometimes can make an educated guess as to what is ailing them, today. 
1	Growing up, our maid's daughter had epileptic fits. One night in the middle of the night, I was woken up by my sister who was frantic. Janelle, (maid's daughter) was having a fit and I knew enough to keep her from swallowing her tongue using a spoon and then driving her to the ER. (My parents were both out of town).
1	I noticed that I have a blue ring around my sclera. I knew that this could be due to an issue with my collagen. I went to several different types of doctors and was told by all of them that I have a strong likelihood of having a collagen defect. I was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos syndrome shortly after.

-1	I work with babies and children all the time. I had a baby come in one morning with a low grade fever and a white tongue. I immediately sent him back home with his mom, and told her he needed to go to the doctor that I thought he was showing signs of thrush. Sure enough, she got him an appointment, and he indeed had thrush. 
1	A few years ago, my youngest son, who was 7 at the time, was hit by a car.  He suffered a traumatic brain injury.  He was on life support and in a coma for 3 weeks. He then was placed in a rehab hospital for many more weeks.  I had to quickly learn what was happening around me, the machines, the medications, and the monitors.  Nothing existed outside of his hospital room.
1	My doctor told me that a new medicine I could take has a 25 percent chance to cause nausea.he said it would help me though if I wanted to chance it.i figured the odds were in my favor.
-1	Being a nurse is obviously the most prominent example of demonstrating my knowledge of medical or health issues. Besides that, having children has been another way of demonstrating my knowledge. I have also had a few health issues of my own. 
1	When my girlfriend got very sick with some weird symptoms, I was able to tell her which ones were concerning and which ones were perfectly normal. 
1	There have been many times in my life where I was able to assess my medical problem myself and avoid a doctor's visit because I knew there was no danger and I merely needed to ride it out. At the end of last year, I correctly guessed that my oncoming symptoms meant I had contracted strep throat, so I visited a doctor immediately rather than suffer through that for weeks.
1	I am a registered sonographer so I get alot of people sending me their ultrasounds to look at baby or tell them what the gender is ect. THis will get annoying after a set of time but when you see a ultraound of a friend that is bad. you never stop thinking about it
1	To be honest, I'm not sick very often and I haven't had much experience with any life-threatening diseases.  I don't call the doctor at the first sniffle, but I do call if I do need to go see him.
1	Within two weeks of each other I experienced a surgery to remove a lump in my breast and a procedure to remove a kidney stone. Within those two weeks, I learned a lot about my health and medical issues.
-1	I have had to have many medical tests along the way. I also dealt with a sick mother (kidney disease) and a child with medical illnesses since birth (premature child 26 weeks). I have had to have more than my share of medical experience. 
1	I went into my doctor to discuss my mental health options for anxiety.  I knew there was different classes of anxiety and depression medications, but I had a hard time figuring out what would be best for me.  My spouse had to help me figure out which would be safe for me so I don't have negative side effects like I had had before.  I couldn't separate the thoughts of the side effects to the physiological effects.  
-1	Someone was recently mentioning renal failure. I knew what this was just because my wife had explained it to me just recently. 
-1	After I had prostate cancer surgery and was in the process of recovering, I developed lympidemia in my left leg. For a large portion of my life I had been in excellent physical condition. As a result I knew that if after recovery I stayed active there was a very good chance that my swelling go down and stay down with regular exercise. This knowledge was gained through several sources including my doctors and previous trainers.
1	I gave birth to my son at 23 weeks (17 weeks early).  During his NICU stay, the doctor was trying to explain to me what problems we were looking at long term for him (ex: Cerebral Palsy, blindness, lung problems) but, before the doctor could finish I was already listing all the different possibilities to him.  He was amazed at my knowledge of the all that was involved in my having my son so early.
1	My knowledge on health and Medical issues is really only valuable to one person, me. I know how i feel, i know how i don't feel, I have a vested interest in my health and well being that encourages learning about whatever symptoms i may be dealing with at any given time, due to this i usually am pretty educated as to what i may likely have and why, or what i most likely do NOT have and why. I have noticed that doctors have seem to be thankful of this at many of my appointments and maybe even a little impressed! One time in particular i correctly diagnosed my skin condition and the doctor got it wrong in fact i had to really advocate for myself to finally get the medication that would treat the condition i was convinced i had, and finally when i saw another doctor he agreed with my diagniosis and treatment was immediately successful. The prior doctor had told me flatly that the condition i was concerned about was familiar to her and i DID NOT have it, in fact I DID! 
1	In boy scouts we had to learn and demonstrate first aid. I learned all the basics. Also in health class at school.

1	We have three kids.  Without preventive measures, if one gets sick, we'll all get sick.  Any time one of them has vomiting or diarrhea, we take precautions by sanitizing everything by cleaning and spraying disinfectant and quarantining when  possible.  By taking these measures, I'm sure we've saved ourselves hours of agony.
1	When my mother was ill I had to help her with her medical issues.  I did the best I could and I felt like a very competent person in regards to medical issues.

1	 I fell and scratched my wrist in my front yard one morning. When I put my hand in my pocket about 2 hrs later I was shocked by the pain from my hand. My fingers were swollen and red in just a couple of hours. I went to the VA clinic and was told I must have had a sting because infection didn't occur as quickly as that. I went home and tried to rest but I realized I was feverish.  I went to the hospital emergency rooms and they immediately admitted me with a MRSA infection. I was told that had I followed clinic instructions I probably would not have lived.
-1	I worked in the medical related field so I talk to doctor regularly regarding the product we sell to them. Also we had a health issue with our family member so that forces me to learn more about medical terminology and consequences of having certain diseases. What to do in order to prevent it. Of course, nothing is 100% preventable but work towards it will help. Importance of eating habit, exercise. Regularly visiting doctors for the checkup. Same way regularly going for dental appointment are some of the few proactive tasks.

1	My mother is a medical social worker and my father is a healthcare consultant. My mother in particular has influenced me knowing a good deal about medicine. I regularly went to the hospital with her from a young age and volunteered at her hospital as a teenager as well. I also had more serious medical problems in my late teen and early 20s that required a good deal of medical attention that made me more knowledge about medicine and tests and procedures than I ever cared to be unless I was attending medical school.
1	I fell down a flight of concrete stairs once and got pretty banged up but felt OK to walk and did not immediately go to the hospital because I knew that I did not have a concussion. I knew to go to the hospital the next day as my neck was extremely sore and my hand had bruised severely, and I knew that I had at least one broken bone in my hand.
1	My son was diagnosed as having ADHD but did not show many key symptoms. I took him to different doctors after having done my own research. I believed he was mildly autistic and it was confirmed many years later that he has Asperger's Syndrome.

1	My son was born with syndactyl (webbed toes) and his left hand was webbed also.  During that experience I did a lot of research in order to decide what to do for him.  We consulted with several different doctors and specialists.  (Part of that was due to us moving and having to find new doctors).  I felt pretty knowledgeable about his condition.
1	Well I can offer things like I am aware of how to perform the Heimlich Maneuver on a choking patient. Also, I know the modern strictures for performing cpr. Also I knew of a condition called Reye's Syndrome that affects children who are given aspirin.

1	I have Hypothyroidism.   I have been getting treatment for years.  I have normal numbers but still have symptoms.  My doctor does not listen to me even though I know my body better than anyone else.  This frustrates me because I have done my research and know that other people have the same symptoms as me despite having normal numbers
1	I have a good knowledge of conditions that i have had in the past. There was a time when i had to have a series of test done and through the research to find out what it could be i was able to help the doctor know what test to try
1	I broke my arm many years ago and was told I needed surgery to fix my arm.  When I reviewed the surgery the doctor suggested I realized that they wanted to put pins in my bones to hold them together and in turn it would dramatically reduce my range of motion in my arm.  I decided not to have the surgery and found a doctor who agreed to take a slow approach to healing my broken arm.  I spent nearly a year in various casts and my arm healed on it's own, with full range of motion.  Had I not taking the time and energy to research my arm and the suggested surgery, I may not be living the life I have now and my physical abilities would be reduced.
1	Wow, um. I guess when my son's piano teacher was diagnosed with the same breast cancer my best friend had just beaten the year before.

1	In high school I took a class called Medical Terminology that was of great help to learn the medical terms.  But since then a lot of time has passed and I have forgotten most of the information. Now I only now what I read or what someone else tells me about medical issues, or some of my own experience I have with the medical field.
1	I have a chronic endocrine disorder that I diagnosed myself based on research done in medical journals. I had been to a variety of doctors who missed the symptoms.

1	I have a lot of health problems and so does my family. I also have have a job in the healthcare field before.

First it was just not being able to remember but then she couldn't add and that was not like this smart individual so I asked her a few questions and I told her she needed to go to the doctor right away.  I was right she had a brain tumor that was causing her trouble.
1	When i was Dx with fibroids it was a scary time. I relied on my knowledge of medical procedures to be able to explain to family members the extent of damage done to my body. I was able to explain how the symptoms I was experiencing how they would have long term affects on my body. I was also able to make educated decisions on my healthcare. 
1	I was with my grandma when she was diagnosed with dementia.  Based on movies I had seen, I was able to question the doctor about what was to come.  
-1	I am Trained as AN CERT ( community emergency response team) member a program funded by FEMA and have basic and intermediate first aide training. I also assist at local red cross functions.
-1	I had a real bad sore throat a few years ago and I had a feeling that I had strep throat. I was correct with my diagnosis, I realized that I was having to much pain so I knew it couldn't be a regular sore throat. my thinking was confirmed by my doctor. 
1	I had a mammogram that was suspicious and needed a breast biopsy. I asked to have an ultrasound or MRI to confirm before surgery. They did as I requested and found it was a fatty tumor, no surgery needed
-1	well because of my health issues I was able to figure out my husband had diabetes and diabetic nephropathy and he was able to go to the doctor to get treated for it and he is doing much better
-1	my experience is very little, but when i do a medical exam i read the results online after going to my doctor and understand all
1	I had a ingrown toenail that I had to have a doctor remove a few years ago. I knew what an ingrown toenail looked like and the health risks that it came with.
-1	I was able to successfully nurse my bedridden brother who had suffered multiple injuries from a near fatal accident. I followed the doctors directions.
1	I can't be specific. However, I learned about edema in the hospital. I knew that this was a serious issue and could be life threatening. This information was instrumental in helping me to understand the facts of a condition. 
1	I had many experiences practicing as an emergency medical technician for a fire department. I would have to obtain histories, perform physical exams, treat some injuries, provide health advice, and come up with a differential diagnosis.
1	Apologies in advance if this isn't exactly the type of experience that you're looking for, but it's the only thing that I can think of that somewhat relates. Whenever I run across something that I don't know about (especially a health issue), I typically try to do as much research on it as I can. As mentioned before, I suffer from IBS. I tried to do what research that I could on my own, but I eventually had to cave and go to the doctor when it didn't seem to get any better (it's a good thing that I did, because I likely also had a stomach ulcer). Anyway, fast forward about half a year later, and it seems that my IBS is getting worse and my medicine doesn't seem to be helping that much. I go to the doctor again to get a different medicine, which also doesn't seem to be doing much good. In the meantime, I've been keeping a food journal and doing more research on my own. After a couple of months of pain, I figure out the problem--I've developed fructose malabsorption. After cutting out soda and other things high in fructose, the problem is as fixed as it can be.
1	After a mishap on the bicycle immediately after getting home I thoroughly cleaned the scrape and applied Neosporin then covered the wound with a bandage.  Over the next couple days I regularly cleaned the wound and watched for any signs of infection.
-1	I had to go to the doctor with my mother when she was having a stroke and I had to explain all of her symptoms to not only the doctor, but the paramedics and nurses as well. Explaining her symptoms directly helped them get my mother care faster.
1	I had a toothache and found out it was infected. They gave me an antibiotic to take for 15 days. I felt better in two days, but continued to take the antibiotic as directed, because I know that is what you are supposed to do or else a new hardier strain could develop.
1	When my mom had a heart event.  She had to be shocked back to life twice, and put into a medically induced coma for 2 days while her body recovered before they allowed her to wake up and took her off of all of the medications. I had to deal with all of the inputs from the doctor's on if she would wake up, when she would wake up, how should would be if and when she woke up as well as medications and after her open heart surgery, how to take care of her when she returned home.  It was 3 weeks of being in the hospital looking after her with my husband, pulling night shift and working to be a patient advocate.
1	When I was told about ear infections, I knew most of the information because I had had ear infections in the past. I knew any technical terms and what causes them and the treatments for them.
1	I had trouble breathing through my nose during exercise. It turns out, it was because I had a blockage in my nose called nasal polyps. I had heard about this from reading things online about congestion. I realized I needed to treat it with nasal spray so I went to my doctor about it.
1	I had a perianal abscess a few years ago. last year I started feeling like I was getting another one. I went to my doctor, explained what I was feeling and the doctor examined me. He told me I was right and started me on antibiotics.
-1	I was diagnosed with unexplained high blood pressure. Since there was no explanation, it has made it challenging to figure out how to solve the issue and avoid heart damage in the future.  
-1	I have had to have over 12 surgery's and many more biopsy's in my life. i have had bone grafts done to breast biopsy's.. i have a lot of experience in the hospital care world. Today i do home care for a quadriplegic between his and myself we have plenty of experince.
-1	In 2004, I took a bad fall in front of the hospital I worked at which resulted in a fractured right hip.  It required surgery and 4 weeks later after a rehab stay I was home and regaining my mobility and living life at a much slower pace.  It was the first time I was incapacitated and had to rely on others for help.  I knew that I needed to follow the dr's orders and almost 9 months later I was back to work.  I did everything as ordered and because I was familiar with medical jargon I was a good patient.
1	My mother is a type 1 diabetic which she got in her 20s. So since then she is well versed in medical knowledge and keeps on it. She kept up on me as a kid and into my 20s. I think I learned a lot from that and apply what I learned from my mom to own health. I also consult with her still. 
1	I went to college for nutrition/dietetic technology, so I am aware of the values of the lab tests and what they should be. I also know how I could improve my diet to lost weight and help my cholesterol numbers. I am also very aware of having to take care of myself and particularly my heart to help me live a better life. I have also suffered from depression, anxiety and PTSD for over 25 years, so I know how to avoid triggers and help myself so I can stay on a low dose of medicine.
-1	I have low blood sugar and my doctor explained the need for me to eat 6 small meals a day and make sure I eat complex carbohydrates and protein at each of those meals.  I understand that doing this will keep my blood sugar level and I will feel better.
-1	I eat very well. I know a lot about which foods are healthy and which are not. Every meal I eat is very healthy.

1	When I started feeling depressed, I recognized the symptoms from my degree in psychology and was able to seek out treatment right away.
-1	A time in my life when I displayed knowledge of health and science would be my freshman year of college when I passed Biology 2 with a breeze while everybody else was struggling to maintain a C average, that's when I knew I exceeded in science.
-1	exercising everyday for at least 45 minutes, h elps with your heart rate, sleeping rate, lowers cholesterol, muscle tone. stretching helps with overall well being.
-1	I was losing weight and had no appetite. I continued going to the doctor but everything seemed normal. I ended up in the hospital with PE's. A month later I found out I had thyroid cancer. The only reason it was found was because a scan was done looking for clots. My labs had always been normal. I understood the need for surgery to remove half my thyroid to prevent it from spreading and that the clots were probably caused from that.
1	I'm a Registered Nurse and took care of my husband when he was sick and dying.  At that time, the doctors communicated with me as a professional most of the time and respected my knowledge of medical issues.  We worked as collaborators.  
-1	Mostly just general information that a lot of people know. And I've also taken some classes in college that detail health things
1	I had an anxiety attack and anxiety issues that caused me to over think some things. I meditated and calmed myself down to help clear my mind and decided that what I was worried about is nothing. 
1	No specific past experience comes to mind. I am no health expert, though I suffer from several health issues. However I am confident enough in my understanding of my own health conditions, so that if someone were suffering from the same symptoms, I would definitely be able to give them some good recommendations on how to treat it, and I would be able to explain the cause of the condition and how it works.
-1	When I was 6 I was diagnosed with ADD. However, my parents didn't believe it was a real thing and I certainly did not want to be that kid who had to take medicine and stuff to be smart so we went about 4 years struggling in school and at home before we decided to do our own research and I fit a lot of the criteria. When I started my medicine it was nota  good experience. I tried about 8 different kinds before I found one that worked for me. It was a lot of going back and forth and working with the doctor to find the best approach for me and to figure out what to do. 
-1	I've been an advocate for those diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Neurologists all over the country give their newly diagnosed patients my phone number and email because they find that I'm better at explaining things than they are sometimes because I've lived with MS for 40 years. This doesn't say that I can do percentages anymore, but I have been a great  layperson neurological and psychological source to countless people I've been told for more years than I can count:-)
1	I am a veterinary technician student, so I demonstrate this knowledge all the time. I have a tendency to have my doctor talk to me in medical terminology. If I don't understand something because it is not used in animal health I will let her know.
-1	I had a pap done when I was 14 they told me my cells were abnormal that I have verbal cancer. They later tested me and said that I have HPV which could turn into cervical cancer years down the road
1	My insurance company wanted to charge me hundreds of dollars a year to recieve a vitamin that could be purchasd over the counter for the same effect but significiantly different price. I declined and purchaed otc and the results i needed came in spite of their recommmendation. I h a d to stand up for myself and be knowledgeable in what wAs available
-1	I was in a severe car accident and broke my pelvic bone. I was in the emergency room for 4 hours and I saw a lot that went on at the hospital. The doctors and nurses are trying to save lives at a timely manner to get people in and out. I was sent to a private room for 3 days then released. It was a very painful recovery but with the help of therapy I made it. I am thankful.
-1	My limited knowledge of health is thanks to my time in the Boy Scouts of America. We frequently were practicing and learning about first aid and what to do in minor medical situations.
1	I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and needed to learn more about this disease and my options in order to make an informed decision regarding treatment, surgery, etc. I researched the best area doctors and surgeons and got a second opinion before making my decision on how to manage this diagnosis. 
1	I deal with medical issues on a daily basis at work. I am a medical coder and biller. In order to bill the insurance companies correctly, I need to code the patient's illness and care correctly. However, a strong background in the medical terminology is needed in order to make sure every supply and illness is properly coded. I often need to assist my colleagues in  this area, I am the only one in the office who is certified, so the other secretaries look to me for assistance. 
1	When my wife said her stomach was hurting she was concerned she may have been having a heart attack but knowing that at her age that it was rare and the other symptoms i felt confident telling her it was because of the leftover pizza she ate
1	One time, my brother got sick while my parents were out of town. I took care of him by doing everything my mom would do for me when I was sick. I made him stay in bed, drink lots of fluids, and take some aspirin every four hours.
1	For about six years, I was the full time caretaker for my grandmother. I had to know what medications she was allergic to, and monitor her pulse and blood pressure daily, and I had to adjust dosage of some of her medications depending on what the readings were, per her doctor's instructions.
1	I helped my best friend lose over 100 pounds by guiding him thru calorie counting and eating healthier meals. His blood pressure went down, his doctor told him his BMI is now in a healthy range and he was no longer on track to need medication for diabetes. He was constantly asking me questions about how to proceed and went 100% by the advice and guidance I gave him.
1	I was asked my medical history by a new doctor recently and gave her a care description. Of my families long history of medical issues including some she had never heard of.
-1	I have had a lot of terrible scarring issues that are too traumatic to write about. I have very bad PTSD from everything and am constantly in fear. 
1	I've often had to monitor my own blood sugar blood pressure to change my dosages of certain medications because my doctors have me on a flexible dosage that I need to adjust based on my current numbers. 
1	I have two children.  Through experience and knowledge and I am pretty capable of knowing when to take them to the doctor versus just resting at home and when they are contagious or not.
-1	I was able to follow directions and change my diet to lower my cholesterol.  I was able to do this via my doctors instructions.
-1	I was on a plan going to Florida and all of a sudden I started sweating and could really breath, so of course the brought me one of those tanks to help me breath.  I went to the doctor when we landed.  They kept me overnight to run test they found an irregular heart beat, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. They pumped floods in my because I was also dehydrated.  Scary moment 
1	My dad is a diabetic.  I have conversations with him often about his condition.  I often give him suggestions on foods that he could eat that are low in carbohydrates to try to help him lower his blood sugar. 
1	My youngest daughter had a febrile seizure. We called the ambulance, went to the ER and then followed up with our pediatrician. Because of all the information I received during that first time, when she had a second febrile seizure two weeks later, I felt confident enough to remain calm, put her on her side, and just ride it out. I knew, however, that if she didn't come out of it within 5 minutes, that we should call 911.
1	My son has allergies and acid reflux and I have always managed his medical issues with medicine by measuring appropriate doses and managing his diet.
-1	My wife went to the ER and I knew what was wrong with her. The doctor's said exactly what I had synthesized from reading online and from institution.

1	I demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues when i started having symptoms of a concussion. I knew what to look for and what it was. 
-1	When I was a smoker, I had seen many commercials explaining how dangerous they can be. I also worked with a lot of people who smoked. Seeing them all begin to cough and hack made me wise up and kick the habit. 
1	I don't have an experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues. I guess when my mom was going through chemo I had some instructions on how to care for her, so I followed that. 
-1	I don't have an extreme amount of health experience or knowledge of health.  I try to stay up-to-date, like most people, but all we have to keep us up-to-date are statistics and calculations put forth by professionals in the medical field.  
1	When I had my daughter she was born with a different blood type than me and had very bad jaundice due to it. I had researched jaundice prior to her birth because my oldest child had it as well, so I had knowledge.

1	My sister was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, stage 3C. I was able to tell her about the different options for treatment. 
-1	I found out over 10 years back I had a mitral valve prolapse. I knew nothing at first but learned about this through research over time. I learned this can be a genetic defect where both heart valves do not close completely. I educated myself.
-1	the only knowledge i have about health issue is the ones my doctor told me about. that is what is making this task difficult for me to handle now.
1	I guess when I get sick I am able to know the difference between viral and bacterial diseases. I am able to know that I don't always get antibiotics (they aren't always effective or useful) and that I shouldn't ask the doctor for them.
-1	Once my knee was swollen up so bad and before we went to the doctor i looked up my symptoms via webmd and found out i had an inflammed bursa also i successfully diagnosed my wifes gall bladder attacks.
1	When I realized I have slightly high blood pressure, I made an effort to start exercising more often. I know that exercise is one way to help lower blood pressure. Since it is not too high, that may be enough without any medication.

1	I recently had to take my son to the doctor because he had a very high fever and a sore throat.  At the same time, he was showing flu like symptoms.  The nurse only wanted to test for strep but I asked her to test for flu as well so that we could rule out either or both.
-1	I was able to make informed decisions in regards to receiving eating disorder treatment. I selected the right treatment sentence for me. 
1	I was in a group of friends, when suddenly, one of our friends started to act strange. People were jumping to several conclusions of what it was, but no one really knew. I called 911, and approached my friend, to observe better. I reported to the operator that I believed my friend was having a stroke, and went through the standard diagnostics to confirm this, while we awaited an ambulance.
1	When my wife and i were trying to have a baby we had to do fertility treatments.  I used my knowledge of pre med and biology from college classes to help try to understand exactly what and why were were doing the different tasks.
1	I once started to feel sick and had symptoms similar to a cold. The cold lasted more than a week but everything except a cough remained. I felt like something was wrong so I looked things up and found I may have had bronchitis. I went to the doctor's office and they also agreed that I likely had bronchitis. 
-1	I was able to research a procedure that my husband had to have. It was a scary time because he had to go under, but the knowledge gained eased the stress.
1	I was having a lot of trouble sleeping for a prolonged period of time.  The doctor believed I need to take anti anxiety medication, but I was sure that I did not.  The doctor tried prescribing me two different types of meds at two different time points, but I declined both and opted for a sleep medication instead.  I took that for a period of time and then my sleep returned to normal, which it still is. 
-1	My son has adhd and i basically did extensive research and diagnosed that he had before it was told to us by a dr. I compared many different articles and symptoms to pinpoint what i thought it may be.  This help me understand not just what he has but how it's so many similar diseases.  
1	After having my child, over time the symptoms of post partum depression began to appear. Having dealt with depression in the past I was able to recognize the symptoms. After a few triggering events everything came to a head. It was probably 3 weeks of struggling to even get out of bed that made me realize that I needed to seek help. I first reached out to ladies in my mom group who assured me that I was neither alone or losing my mind. From there I had the confidence to reach out to my doctor. At my appointment I described everything that was going on and we were able to get me on the appropriate medicine that I knew from past experience worked for me.
1	One time my friend was having pain in his chest and thought he was having a heart attack but I informed him if it was sharp pain he was probably gassy. 
-1	I had a baby recently and spent some time in and around the hospital for sometime. I had some complications and had to run several test and had several month working on health issues.
1	I have had a lot of medical issues in my life which help  my knowledge. I also previously was an LPN for about nine years which help contribute to my medical knowledge that I have.
1	I have knowledge of health and medical issues in the sense that I typically know when to go to the doctor. I know what symptoms are associated with what illnesses, and I know what to expect from treatment. For instance, I had the flu a few weeks ago. After most of my symptoms had passed, my lymph nodes became so swollen that they were visible from across the room. I knew I was getting a secondary infection and went to the doctor. As I had predicted, they put me on prednisone and a strong antibiotic.
1	I take my blood pressure readings on a fairly consistant basis.  I noticed that my readings were creeping upwards and I was at the same time feeling other odd syntoms, such as my arm hurting.  I called my doctor and suggested I have a stress test to see if some significant was going on.
-1	I was feeling sick i had fever and flu symptoms. However something didnt feel right. I noticed my lymp nodes on my neck were swollen. I knew this could be a serious viral infection. I went to see my doctor and in deed i had a viral infection. My doctor gave me antibiotics.

-1	my life experience while i visit hospitals sometime i observe a few doctors and patients so i know what what its life to pay attention to all the issues and treat them 
-1	When I was diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, I  had to very quickly get familiar with a lot of medical/health terminology. A lot of doctors don't even know about the condition so it was on me to describe the basic concepts to them.
1	I feel I have the basic knowledge of health or medical issues. I am always leaning to learn more about human's body from medical side. And i can deal with small issues and make judgement about if i need more care
1	I had a missed miscarriage and was scheduled for a D&C the following morning.  A few years later a friend was also experiencing a missed miscarriage and her doctor gave her the option to wait and miscarry naturally or have the D&C.  I was able to discuss my experience with her and what I learned after my surgery was complete.  My experience was able to help her make her own decision.  
1	I did have a false positive mammogram. I did have to have  a biopsy, etc. but I stayed calm and went through the process to make sure that it was nothing.
1	My husband was diagnosed with serrated polyposis and frequently has colonoscopies to manage and monitor it.  He is often still groggy from the anesthesia when his doctors come to talk to us about the findings so I've largely taken control over understanding the condition and the information the doctors tell us.
1	I previously worked in the emergency room as a behavioral health technician. It was my job to behavioral and medical concerns. Abbreviations were commonly used by physicians, so I needed to interpret certain paperwork that patients gave to me from their physicians. 
-1	When I was in the field we trained us how to respond a patient like doing CPR, inserting IV fluids to the patient and Emergency response situation.
1	I cannot recall any experience that has demonstrated knowledge of health or medical issues because I am not familiar with these. At least I recognize which type of doctors I have to visit in order to get correct analysis and treatment. My most recent experience involved a pain I was having in one of my shoulders for a long time. I knew I had to go see an orthopedist who checked and diagnosed me. 
1	Recently my husband came home complaining that he ached all over. I realized that was probably the flu and got him to the walk-in clinic the same day. He was prescribed Tamiflu, which greatly reduced his discomfort.
1	Last month, I what seemed like pretty standard pharyngitis for a few days. However, one day it progressed into ear symptoms and tremendous pressure and I knew that I had a middle ear infection. I called the physician (spending several hundred dollars to confirm what I already knew), got antibiotics, and since I was proactive and caught it quickly rather than waiting, there wasn't any hearing damage or other lasting effects.  
1	My mother's diagnosis of a rare, life-threatening blood disease required I become familiar with several basic medical practices and procedures.
1	I mean, I take very good care of myself, and I often give people nutrition and health advice. I dealt with mental illness (depression and anxiety) for years until I finally decided I needed to tackle it from all sides and finally get rid of it. This involved a great deal of research and realizing just how important physical self-care was for mental health. This was something I had neglected for years, especially in terms of sleep and nutrition. So I finally started getting enough sleep on a regular basis, eating healthy, and taking carefully selected supplements that are helpful for mental and general health, and overcame mental illness for good.
1	I was having trouble having normal sleep patterns.  I didn't drink caffeine or do anything abnormal within 6hours of my desired bed time, yet i still never could go to bed at my desired bed time.  Worst yet I would experience symptoms such as a fast heart beat, tingly feelings in my appendages and high chest pressure when I laid down.  I figured out my above normal intake of sugar, caffeine, nicotine early in the day caused this and once I stopped the nicotine and reduce consumption of caffeine and sugar the aforementioned side effects stopped.
1	I decided to visit my doctor because I had a strange birthmark on my foot that I was worried about. My doctor examined the birthmark and told me that I shouldn't worry about it. However, I felt good about my diligence. 
-1	A couple of years back I had gone in for a routine mammogram and since some abnormality was detected I was asked to undergo a biopsy which , thankfully, was found to be negative. I was glad I had this test done.
1	I was walking up a steep hill and slipped.  I fell and skid on my knees for several feet down the hill.  My knees were cut up badly and there was dirt and rocks in my knees.  Based on my previous medical knowledge I just went home, cleaned the area out with soap and water.  Scrubbed the area down really well, applied antibiotic ointment and gauze covering and it healed on it's own.
1	I have had some first aid training in my life.  I have also had the experience of take care of my family and myself when someone was sick.  
-1	"When I was younger, I was diagnosed with Epstein Barr Virus and I understood what the doctor told me. He explained to me that it was incurable and that the teiters (I probably misspelled that) would never change, but God healed me and the test results did change. My doctor was in shock and He said, ""I believe what you believe""."
-1	My neighbor got stung by a wasp last year.  He was stung on the neck.  The sting was very red and swelling fast.  I took him to the emergency room.  He found out he was allergic and it waas a good thing I took him on to the emergency room.
1	I went for a physical exam and was told I had high blood pressure.  I already was familiar with the condition because there are people in my family who have the same condition.  I was aware of the type of medication that could be prescribed to me.
-1	When I went to the doctor and they explained to me the chances of heart disease, I new the numbers and understood the percentages right away.
-1	I diagnosed myself as having hypothyroidism because the symptoms that I was experiencing I researched and found that I had the condition. I set an appointment with my doctor and told her and she told me she had to do test to confirm what the ailment was and sure enough it was nypothyroidism
1	At my new apartment I would a sudden rash appear on my body at certain times during the day. In particular it would take place at evenings. My doctor initially diagnosed it as eczema. However what did not make sense it that why it would appear at certain times during the day.  Someone told me to give zyrtec a shot the next time it came up. I did so and within 10 minutes the rash went away. It was basically coming from the heating system of the new apartment that I had moved into. Basically I have knowledge enough to suspect whether something is eczema or tinia or something else. 
1	Many years ago, I had pneumonia that started with the flu, and ever since then, I have had annual flu shots (and, in the past decade, annual pneumonia shots as well). I am aware of the fact that the shots are only effective against a few very common strains of flu, but also know that if I do get the flu, it will be less severe than if I didn't have the shot. 
-1	When I was drinking in college I developed a bleed from my upper GI tack.  This was my first real trauma and dealing with a hospital for an extended stay.
1	During my junior year of college I had a cyst in my ovary. I was able to identify exactly were the pain was and what I thought it was based on the internet and using my instincts and all of the signs. 
1	Once I was shadowing a physician prior to begging medical school. The physician asked me (in front of the patient), if the patient started off with a throat infection, and eventually developed an ear infection, how did this come about? I responded with, either the eustachian tube, or a superimposed infection brought on by the weak immune system. He told me great job and correct. Patient looked at me with pride. 
1	When my mother was battling cancer, she had a black out spell. My daughter living in California called me to come home (I was in Utah at the time). I got their as quick as I could, about a day later, and went straight to my mom in the hospital. I talked over her condition with her doctor and he was confident due to my responses that I understood what she needed and I could take her home.
1	One experience in my life that has demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is when my grandfather started to suffer from a heart attack. I saw the symptoms. 
1	After years of going to the allopathic doctor and getting lots of tests done and very little answers, I stopped listening to mainstream medicine and started learning about naturopathic medicine.  I felt awful and had difficultly thinking clearly often. I started taking vitamin B-12 tincture, nascent iodine, and did a parisite cleanse (which includes micro-organisms, not just the FDA's definition of a parisite), and for the first time in my life I can think clearly by default and stopped taking prescription medication for ADD.
-1	I think I do well at assessing my own health issues. If I am dizzy or light headed I will try to eat sugary foods. If my symptoms are any worse I will diagnose them the best I can then see a doctor if needed. 
-1	I dont have alot of knowledge when it comes to health or medical issues. So im not sure what i would even write in this form here.
-1	I was told I had asthma and I exercised and took supplements and I no longer need medicine or feel the symptoms of asthma. I feel healthy now.  I trust in nature and god not the doctors !
1	As a hypochondriac I do a lot of research on different health issues, so when my friend was experiencing digestive issues, I questioned him regarding his symptoms and then accurately guessed his condition, which was later verified by his doctor.
-1	Both when I received the news that I had fibroids and it was causing infertility issues.  I researched the best options for dealing with them and consulted my doctor after that. I cut certain things out of my diet and then had surgery. I am hopping to be able to conceive in the meet few months. 
-1	I was told a few years ago that I needed to have major surgery, and what the recovery process would be like afterwards. So, I remember that I researched as much as I could and I thought ahead of any questions that I could ask when I sat down for my consultation with the surgeon.
1	I have suffered from depression and I started to realize it when my mood started changing and went from bad to worse. I was emotionally distraught and physically fatigued. From what I knew I was suffering from depressions and anxiety and went to my doctor. He prescribed medicines to address both issues and within a few weeks I started to feel better
1	A doctor told me to get the flu vaccine during pregnancy. My friend is against vaccinations, especially during pregnancy, and told me not to get it. I did some research on the topic and found out for myself that I should get the vaccine because the risks to my baby seemed to be lower if I did.
1	I had some odd symptoms last year that were not going away on their own, and was trying to find out information online.  I eventually self diagnosed myself with shingles, as what I had looked like the images I found online.  I went to the doctor for confirmation and a prescription, and he said it was indeed shingles, and prescribed me antibiotics which cleared it up pretty quickly.
1	I read about some research into a medication I was taking that indicated taking it at night was more effective. I mentioned this to my previous doctor; she looked it up on the internet while I was in the room and agreed I should try it. 
-1	Had an ache in my side for several days before I made it to the doctor. In the meantime, I took care of it as a kidney infection (correctly) because I knew that was where my kidney was and saw my symptoms.
1	My grandfather went to the urologist and had a PSA blood test done.  I knew from his results, being over 3.0, that this meant he would likely need a biopsy to test for prostate cancer.  I also knew that these tests could produce higher than normal levels if the patient has an enlarged prostate.  I asked to see his former results.  They were up and down a lot, which is typically a sign that there is NOT prostate cancer, but instead, an enlarged prostate.  I also knew that an enlarged prostate could be due to prostatitis, an infection of the prostate.  Sure enough, he went back to the doctor to follow up, and turned out to have a prostate infection.
1	I was able to recognize the early stages of ADHD in my eldest child due to caring for my cousin for many years when he was younger (he had the same condition). Since I knew so much about the condition already, I was able to sidestep a lot of the pitfalls that many parents of ADHD children have to deal with, since I knew what to expect and why.
1	I know that antibiotic is only effective against bacteria infection and should be use for viral or fungus infection. When a doctor prescribe antibiotic I should continue to take the medicine until it runs out even if I feel better only after taken it for a few days. 
-1	When I was in my friend's house and she began to have a big headache, I cured here giving a pill that quits most of headaches in an hour. She thanked me a lot and decided to buy this pill too. I'm always prepared to these cases because I know there are frequent.

1	 About ten years ago I was out at a bar with a friend of mine. We had a few drinks and then caught the bus back to my house. We were sitting in the living room trying to decide what to order for dinner  when he started to complain about feeling dizzy. He excused himself and went to the bathroom. A few minutes later I heard a loud thud and went to go check on him. The door was open and he was having a seizure on the floor. I pulled him by the shoulders out of the small bathroom and into the larger adjacent room. I elevated his head on my knees and stuck my leather wallet between his teeth. After about ten seconds or so he calmed down. He was kind of out of it so I called an ambulance for him. He was ok in the end but is now on medication.
1	I worked as a medical receptionist at an ear, nose, throat clinic for 2 years. There I learned a lot of medical lingo and how things are run behind the scenes at a clinic.
1	Years ago I had been having back pain. It had lasted for about a week, and initially thought that I had just pulled a muscle. I woke up one night with more than a mild pain and a fever. I knew that I likely had a kidney infection because of these symptoms.

1	When I was taking care of my grandfather when he was undergoing dialysis, I had to read plenty of forms and research the procedures, remedies, and prognoses online.

1	I was able to accompany my husband to the doctor and request a limited prescription for Xanax after researching fast acting medications that would allow him to be on a plane (he has anxiety about crashing) without ruining the vacation of the rest of us. 
1	I was having lower ab pain. I thought it might be constipation or some other easy fixed issue. I tried several other over the counter meds to fix the issue. Once it didnt subside for several days and got worse in pain, I went to an urgent care center. Rather than going at the first feeling of discomfort I tried a few methods myself before seeking medical attention from a doctor.
-1	I have a health condition. When  I went to the er I was very knowledgable of what the doctor was asking in regards to my condition. 
1	I was having trouble going to sleep at night which is very unlike me. Usually I fall asleep within five minutes. I reviewed what I had been doing and eating and realized that I had started drinking more caffeine than usual later in the evening. I stopped drinking any caffeinated beverages after 5 pm and my insomnia disappeared.

1	A friend of mine recently was having severe pain on her upper right side and wanted to wait it out. I'd previously had my gallbladder removed and knew that this was a symptom. I convinced her to go to the emergency room to be checked out just in case and I ended up being correct.
-1	I take care of dependent adults with disabilities and assist them with their medications and appointments this has helped me gain a little knowledge
1	I have grown up around medical professionals, as stated earlier in the survey. There are multiple experiences that show my medical knowledge. I have learned to set IV's, give injections, learned (put never performed) a tracheotomy, and more. For one specific example, I will talk about injections. My father was diagnosed with Low-T, and given a testosterone booster (that he later dismissed and stopped taking, in lieu of his beta blockers). My brother taught me how to sterilize the injection site and my hands, properly take precautions such as gloves, and how to inject and administer the drug (through a slightly forceful, straight motion, applying the dose over a period of roughly 15 seconds into the gluteous maximus).
1	I saw a podiatrist recently for fungal infection even though I knew that I could not treat it internally while still breastfeeding my six-month old daughter. I accepted the referral and went to the appointment to see what, if any, my other options were, and what the time table would be like to pursue internal treatment.
1	There was a time I went to the doctor with a certain set of symptoms and told the doctor I would like a prescription for amoxicillin and he agreed that would be appropriate for the symptoms and wrote one up.

1	Well, when I had blood in my urine, I knew I was either having a kidney problem or a bladder problem.  After having tests run, and getting to see both a kidney specialist and an urologist, it was found that I had bladder cancer.
1	I really can't think of a particularly good example.  I guess recently I've been watching what I eat and working out more, and as a result I've lost fat and gained muscle mass.
1	I monitor my cholesterol and calorie intake carefully.  I also exercise 5 days a week via walking or lifting light weights.  I do to my doctor, dentist and eye doctor regularly.
1	There is no one experience. Experience is built up over a life time. Obviously without medical schooling a person is limited on how much knowledge they could have. I would say I had a complex medical issue years ago that I used the Internet and doctors to attempt to resolve. 
-1	I remember once my doctor told me that my blood pressure was high so I have to change my diet and do more exercise and then my blood pressure came back to normal
1	My friend developed symptoms of losing weight, feeling tired, coughing, and sinus problems. I have known people with these symptoms who had lung cancer. I urged my friend to see a doctor, and he found that he did have cancer.
1	Both of my sisters died from ovarian cancer in their early forties.  My paternal grandmother also died from the same disease and it was determined that a genetic mutation was the cause.  I knew that if I was tested for the mutation, I would be able to make a more informed decision to remove my ovaries or not.  I was tested and opted not to remove my ovaries because I didn't have the mutation which lowered my risk for the disease.
1	My husband wanted me to take our youngest son to the ER. I told him that there wasn't anything they could do, I'll be told to push fluids and have him rest because it's just viral and had to run its course. Went to the ER in the middle of night and that's exactly what I was told to do, $200 later. 
1	so my grandfather had a lung cancer and it was stage 2  and doctor commanded chemotherapy but the family was against it  so it did my research and convince them that  chemotherapy show positive result .
-1	I just recently started to loose my hair . Handfuls of it . I began to read about things that could cause this . I narrowed it down to 2 things . Either stress or a thyroid problem . The stress didnt really fit . I wasnt overly stressed . Normal everyday stress nothing really a big deal . The thyroid issue seemed to fit . I had other symptons that i just dismissed . Dry skin , brain fog and fatigue . I called my doctor and she got me right in . She said she would need to do blood work but she would put her money on hyperthyroidism . After the blood work came back I got the call thats exactly what it was .I began taking pills and within a few months I began to see a improvement . my hair stopped falling out , my skin improved .

1	When my wife was having our daughter, I researched a lot of the different drugs and prodecdures that were going. I asked the nurses and doctors about what was going on and if there would be any side effects to the drugs. For her and the baby as well. I tried to be informed as possible with everything going on.
-1	Once a year, I usually get a very bad case of the flu and I never go to the doctor to get medication or to get a check up. I avoid going to the doctor so much and despise the thought of getting told bad news about my health that I just tough it out. It can potentially last for months at a time, and even though I know in the back of my head that if I go to the doctor's office they could probably prescribe a medication that could help me much faster than whatever is over the counter, I do not go. I know I am in the wrong and it really shows a lack of understanding when it comes to medical issues. 
1	I was watching a football game and a player landed awkwardly and his knee bent at a abnormal angle, I said aloud to myself that he probably tore his ACL, which in fact he did.

1	I sprained my ankle.  I did not go to  the doctor because I knew that I should ice it, keep it up and stay off it.   I also wrapped it.  I did not see why I should pay money for the doctor when I knew what to do.
1	I have asthma, so constantly throughout my life I have had to be very careful of my breathing so that I do not have an asthma attack, where my breathing gets super labored. I need to be mindful of my limitations so that I do not exacerbate my condition.
-1	Eleven years ago, I was having digestive issues. Because I received no answers from my physician, I took matters into my own hands. Yes, I self diagnosed. I kept a food diary and noted how different foods made me feel. I suspected I was gluten intolerant. When I removed gluten from my diet, many symptoms disappeared within one week. Later, I took a lab test and it found that I was gluten intolerant. 
-1	I was have some hormonal problems and I knew through research, that I was peri-menopausal.  I feel like the knowledge I had before seeing the doctor was beneficial for me so would come up with a plan together
1	I have very little experience and knowledge of health or medical issues.  I rarely go to the doctors, only once 1 year or if I'm really sick.
1	When my children have not been feeling well, I've been able to get them what they need to feel better. Ex. tylenol for teething, etc.  
1	Throughout my adult life, I have had to make many medical decisions.

I had to explain to the rest of my family what the doctors were talking about and how the procedures would go, etc.
-1	I have had unknown leg pain most of my life. I injured my back quite a few years ago, and I  have worked in a hospital a few years ago. I have take medical terminology classes. Biology classes.

1	working in a hospital and radiology office in the past has inhanced my knowledge of medical issues.  I did ultrasounds for 7 years,  and it taght me many things about healthcare.
1	I was having a certain problem that often can be mistaken for another very common health problem.  After many doctors visits, lab tests all coming back negative. There was still no resolution to my problem. With my own research and persistence I was able to present the Doctor with a possible diagnosis and once we both agree and I was given treatment my symptoms were almost gone or at least quite managable. 
-1	When I had my daughter my Dr. insisted we delivery 4 weeks early due to me having a previous classic c section to avoid the risk of going into labor. I researched the topic so I knew this wasn't best for my baby and was unnecessary. I tried to argue my point but the Dr. would not listen to me. My baby turned blue while rooming in with me and had to be put in the NICU for 21 days due to immaturity. Ten years later when I had my son the laws had been changed to not allow my baby to be taken more than 2 weeks earlier due to the NICU cost of doctors like the one I had with my daughter taking babies too early in situations like mine where there was a previous classic c section. My son was taken at 38 weeks and was fine. He went home the next day with me.
-1	I guess the only time  can think of was when I was a teenager and my friends little brother cut and scraped his knee. I knew to pick him up and clean the wound and bandage it so it wouldnt scar too badly.
1	I was at get together at a friends house and her parents were there.  We were outside playing volleyball and her father started feeling dizzy and out of breath and his heat was pounding.  I thought he might be having a heat stroke, so I made sure we put cool, wet towels on his head and around the back of his neck.  It turned out that it was a heat stroke and they told me that this probably helped to not cause him more harm from this.
-1	When I sprained my knee in a third world country. I had to rely on my own and online research.  I did not have the chance to go to the doctor because of the country.
-1	A lot of the time I am the one that suggest meds to my doctors after studying about them with the Physicians Desk Reference and other reference material. Most of the time the doctor will go with my suggestion
1	My boyfriend was complaining of swelling in his groin area, which was a concern due to the location.  I knew that lymph nodes were located in that area (along with several other areas of the body) and that it might just be that his body is fighting off a sickness.  Over the next few days he came down with a viral infection.
1	I used to experience severe constipation, bloating, and lethargy. I did not know why this was happening until I started to look into my diet. From there, I learned about fiber (and different types of fiber such as soluble and insoluble fiber) and I learned about the role of carbohydrates, fats, and protein (macronutrients). Since I didn't have a well-balanced diet, I constantly felt horrible and had constipation. Once I fixed my diet to include vegetables, beans, whole-grain foods, water, healthy fats, my symptoms went away and I've never felt better.
1	An instance in my life that demonstrated medical issues is when i was pregnant and put on bedrest  I was very aware of how to act, what to do and not to do.  I was able to carry to full term when only given a 30% chance of it
1	Three years ago i was diagnosed with severe osteoporosis. All I knew about the disease was that I did not want it. So I went online and researched extensively about the causes, treatments and prognosis. Armed with this new information I went to my doctor and we discussed in some depth what our best form of treatment should be. I then went back online and looked further, using my own research and the expertise of my doctor. We then came to a suitable treatment to best help me.
1	I have hemolytic anemia, the cause of which is not certain. I have had to research and learn on my own the possibilities which could have led to this situation and aid in my own knowledge to help my physician figure out what the next step is and how to control it.
1	I wife was diagnosed with cysts on her uterus. I was able to understand what this meant and what needed to be done to treat this medical condition. Everything the doctor told me made sense and I was not confused by the medical terminology used.

-1	I had been told by my primary care physician that I was anemic due to menustration. I knew from college that I was supposed to ask why I was anemic and I knew my pcp had just pulled it out of his ass that it was due to my menustration. I went to a new GYN and he realized that I was insulin resistant while the other doctor missed it.
1	After the birth of my son, I noticed that his skin was unusually dry and would not retain moisture from any of the varieties of lotion that I purchased.

-1	A time where I had I demonstrated my knowledge of medical issues is when I started to see a new primary care doctor and I had to explain to him about the rhemutoid arthitis that I have been diagnoised with and also explain about the uveitits that I have 
1	I feel like going through the process of having a baby has helped educate me in terms of health and medical issues. I read up on various medical issues that could happen during pregnancy and delivery.

-1	I learned a lot about health issues when my appendix burst. I had to do research on what to eat and what medications to take
1	In 2013, I went deaf in one ear after blowing my nose. I waited a week to see if it would get better. It didn't. I realized the cause was actually an infection I had had a decade earlier that never completely went away. A small participle of infection had remained in my sinuses for a decade, then moved when I blew my nose. If I hadn't figured that out, and relied upon a doctor to figure it, I might have have had the infection inside my ear pop my ear drum or worse.
1	I have had a history of lower back disc issues as a result of a lifting injury about 8 years ago. I have since seen multiple back pain specialists and physical therapists and have learned how the injury ocurred and what to avoid doing in order to not re-aggravate it. As a result, I try and pass on the knowledge to other people who are dealing with similar back issues and refer them to doctors that have helped improve my condition. 
1	My last place of employment did not even have a basic first aid kit. I carried a trauma kit in my car. So, anyone that had a minor injury came to me for assistance.
1	As mentioned before, I grew up in a family of doctors--my mother is a family physician and my father is an emergency physician.  I have degrees in psychology and social work and have worked in the health field for a long time. Not only that, but my children have recently had some medical issues that have forced me to use my knowledge. 
1	I do not have a lot of experience because i have been pretty healthy my whole life. My parents have only had a few issues that I know about 
1	My daughter had a urinary tract infection and I could tell by the pain in her urination. I knew this could be cured with some antibiotics and lots of pure cranberry juice to clear her system as well as better hygiene practices. We went to the doctor anyway to confirm and were told to do exactly as I thought.
-1	I worked in a prison for awhile and became well aware of diabetes because we were charged with checking blood sugar and providing insulin, if needed. 
1	I lift weights 3 days per week and do 4+ total hours of cardio per week, in addition to walking at least 7 hours per week (I have a desk job, so even though I'd like more than that, I am content with 7). I do this because I understand muscle mass is important, and can be harder to put on as one ages. Also, strength training can help with bone density, which is useful especially as women age. I also want good cardiovascular health. This is all because people in my family tend to live to be quite old (my great-grandmother is 96!), but not necessarily with a great quality of life, and I want to have a great quality of life as I age.
1	After suffering many broken bones I was able to diagnose thy I had a shattered finger bone after slipping at work and also tore two tendons (did not diagnose that) but could tell by the level of pain I was experiencing that a bone in fact was broken
-1	A time in my life that demonstrated I had knowledge of health issues was when I started taking care of my 81 year old grandmother. She was very sick with multiple illnesses and I had to learn about them all and learn about her medications and the things I needed to do to be able to take care of her properly.
1	When I was 19 I found out I had developed acute scoliosis, There was a former coworker of mine who kept complaining about the fact that they were having lower back issues constantly and ran down all the sympoms and the times they generally have them. I informed them of my condition and told them that they may at least want to get examined to see what it was but that it in fact was the exact same thing I was dealing with and that scoliosis may indeed be the cause. Well it was. I was able to discuss with them ways I coped and the things I've done to ease the pain somewhat.
-1	My experience in life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was the last year when I had to help a old lady in the street.
-1	I've helped others with mental illness. I've had pretty unique experiences with mental health that has led me to advising others. Answering questions for people. 
1	My dad was having some health issues. He was experiencing some ankle swelling. I knew this could be a sign of heart trouble. He went to his Dr and found out that he was having trouble with a heart valve.
1	I have supported my parents through many difficult and challenging medical issues. Ensuring that I stayed engaged in all discussions regarding care and treatment plans with their doctors and nurses when hospitalized has created my understanding and I've honed it with independent research and support from friends and family.
1	I cannot think of a time in my life where I had the chance to demonstrate my medical knowledge except to apply it to my daily life and try to keep myself as healthy as possible. 
-1	When I met a surgeon prior to going in for back surgery, I looked up many questions to ask the surgeon so I would know more about how many surgeries he had performed and how successful he was, as well as how long my recovery would take, and if there was a problem who to call. The surgeon broke everything down beautifully and in terms I could easily understand. I felt extremely comfortable prior to my surgery and confident in his skills.
1	When I correctly thought I had hyperhidrosis, went to the doctor and then he told me that's exactly what it was. One of the few times WebMD didn't make me super anxious and calmed my nerves.

1	When I was twenty five I had to make the decision to go through with an experimental surgery for my migraine headaches.  I was told at the time that I could either not survive the surgery or could come out paralyzed.  However, I knew that I required trying this surgery to try to improve my quality of life.  I had spent much time in headache clinics as well as a month inpatient in a special migraine unit in Michigan where they tried to solve my migraines.
1	I was a psychologist / counselor working in a family medicine clinic.  Many times I helped people understand what their physicians were suggesting.  Most common questions related to probabilities of different outcomes with different types of treatment.  The above question about the meaning of a positive test for breast cancer, and what to do about it was a common one.
1	When trying to get into better shape I knew what foods to eat and how much exercise needed. I knew what heart rate to target while exercising as well.
1	I had to speak to my grandmother's doctor after she suffered a mini stroke, as my mother wasn't at the hospital yet.  My grandma had already had a couple of mini strokes, but the strokes coupled with her dementia turned out to be devastating to her brain.  The latest stroke left her unable to speak, or walk.  She ended up being diagnosed with Vascular Dementia, and the doctor was in such shock with the diagnosis as my grandmother had been a high school math teacher.  The doctor ended up giving me advice as to how best to prevent myself from getting dementia.
1	I was experiencing a ringing in my ears. I scheduled an appointment with an ENT and after extensive hearing testing, the doctor confirmed by believe that I have tinnitus.
1	When my mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. We very quickly had to educate ourselves on what exactly that diagnosis meant as her doctor wasn't being very forthcoming. After research it became very apparent that she had a death sentence. I learned quickly with that diagnosis that you are ignored as a patient. I found that if you could engage the doctor's in speaking about the disease after I first did my own research and not simply asking questions that I was able to get further with them. For some strange reason, I had to demonstrate some type of knowledge of her health and medical issues before a serious, honest conversation could take place.
1	My then 9-year old son was using the bathroom a lot.  He was running to urinate about every 15 minutes or so.  After observing this for a few days, I asked him if he was also thirsty.  He said he was.  I told my wife that he likely had diabetes and that we needed to get him to the doctor first thing tomorrow (it was a Sunday when I was talking with him).  The doctor checked his blood sugar the next day and found that it was over 700.  We got his diabetes under control and so far, he has continued to live a good life (he is now almost 22).
-1	I cut myself once when i was younger and treated the wound with alcohol to prevent infection and wrapped it up to keep it clean. Washing it and changing the wrapping regularly. I once thought i had depression and went to the doctor to see if i had a problem with depression and the doctor agreed with me diagnosing me with depression.
-1	I have had my gallbladder removed due to gallstones. I have also had a c-section. I have worked in radiology for 15 years.
1	When my husband complained of pain in his abdomen, he wanted to just work through it and tough it out. I insisted he go to the doctor because his pain did not sound normal to me. It was persistent and much more painful than typical digestive problems. He did end up going to the doctor who then had him go to the ER.

-1	Very recently I felt strong heartburn in my esophagus, typically a doctor would recommend some anti-acids, but, given that I've taken some courses in college and know certain things about the human body, anti-acids were to make my condition worse because 90% of heartburn is caused by too little acid.

The doctor had to review all the medications again and ended up saying it was okay to take both medications at the same time after a thorough review. 
1	I scraped my knee. I washed it gently, to prevent infection. I found a clean old rag  to use as a bandage. I wrapped it around my knee and secured it with tape. Not too impressive, I know.
1	I work in healthcare as a patient care tech so i demonstrate my knowledge to my patients day in and day out.

1	When my ex attempted suicide due to a benzodiazpene overdose, I took appropriate measures such as making sure she stayed awake after I found her to reduce risk of brain damage.

After doing more research, I learned that he needed to do follow up blood work to check my levels.  He was not doing follow up blood work.  I took myself off of the drug and never went back. PCOS involves a lot of trial and error. I feel like the patient needs to be their own advocate.

1	My friend had a gallbladder attack and her doctor told her that she could avoid surgery if she ate healthy.

1	Sometimes I have a hard time breathing due to asthma but I can't tell if it's asthma or my throat is dry. I know that a sign of asthma is wheezing, so I breathe hard to see if I'm wheezing. If I am, then I use my inhaler.

Therefore, I learned how to test my blood sugar, count my calories and carbohydrates and make sure i was exercising.  It was required for my health and my unborn baby's health.
1	I had a length of time in my life where I did not have any health insurance. During this time, I could not go to the doctor's office no matter how ill I became, because I could not afford to pay for treatment. I had to rely on my own knowledge of symptoms and treatments and I became very good at finding reliable sources on Google for anything I might not know, like how to make home treatments. 
1	Once, my son was sick, and I took his temperature and looked him over and noticed he had a rash on his hands.

Three cardiac stents later, I am glad that I was able to recognize the location and unusual character of the pain and seek immediate help.

-1	When I applied for SSD I was able to essentially tell them what was wrong with me in the forms I needed to fill out. This helped them make a determination regarding my eligibility for disability. 
1	When I first made my initial visit to my doctor I came prepared with several questions.

She was rather pleased that I already had an established exercise program and watched the intake of sodium in my diet and encouraged me to continue on the path I was on.

1	When I was fifteen, i experienced some very hard cramps in my abdominal region. My mom kept asking what was wrong and how i was feeling and i told her that i thought it was my stomach itself or something that had to do with it because i wasn't able to poop. Turns out i needed my gallbladder removed because of the severity of the gallstone.
1	There have been a number of times. One time was when our son had an allergic reaction to pecans. He started breaking out in a rash so we gave him benadryl, called the nurse, and kept an eye on him to make sure his airway didn't become involved.

1	I have a chronic illness and have had multiple complications from that. I have a positive ANA, I've had a stroke yet I've had no heart or vascular disease, I have chronic fatigue, I've had extremely elevated liver enzymes where they go up and down. The one thing they do know I have is Hashimoto's auto immune thyroid and even though it hasn't been confirmed yet, I believe my stroke was caused by my Hashi's because it causes me to have afib sometimes. I know that if I have one Auto immune disease I could have others. I know that if my thyroid hormones are not at the right level they can cause all kinds of problems with metabolic processing that could include problems with my liver or my immune system may decide to attack my liver. I have figured out on my own that my body does not convert T4 to T3 and being on a medication that has both is optimal for me. And I've learned that sometimes blood work does not tell the whole story, that more than anything you have to listen to your symptoms and use those as a guide along with blood work.

1	I experienced three severe gum infections in a rather short period of time. The first two time I was treated with antibiotic. My PCP was very hesitant to prescribe each time, but especially so the third time.

1	When I started to get light headed after awhile was a warning sign that I should go to the doctors since this has never happen to me before. So I went to the doctors and explained what has been happening lately. He then tells me that if anything changed in my daily life. I said I started to work 2 jobs. He said it could be that you overworked yourself but he will still run some test. He told me to take it easy and rest. After a couple of days of rest I was fine.

1	A few weeks ago my roommate had a fever and felt ill. He thought that the fever was the issue and he would be okay if his body temperature was lowered. I explained how fevers occur to help your immune system fight off illnesses, and lowering the fever would only make it harder for his body to deal with the real issue. 
1	Well I suppose one of the best experiences of my life that demonstrates my knowledge of health and medical issues is the classes I took in college.  Between studying anatomy and physiology, doing labs on the same subject, and taking tests on everything, the fact that I passed I suppose proves my knowledge of the subject matter.  I also did a study-abroad trip in college with a group of nursing students in Cameroon doing health screenings.

1	After feeling rather weak, I knew from experience that I have tendencies to have a low iron count. So knowing this, I started uptaking my iron, looking for the most absorbent type of iron as possible, since they are not all the same. 
1	I've had asthma and allergies my entire life and can explain what is happening with my symptoms accurately to doctors in order for them to best diagnose and solve the issue. I also know which of the over the counter medicines tend to solve which issues quickest and most effectively.
1	An experience in my life where I demonstrated my knowledge of health or  medical issues is when I had jaw surgery. I have been going to the orthodontist since I was two years old. I knew a lot about my mouth and what was going on. Whenever I went to have the actual surgery, I went to a different hospital with different doctors. They were explaining to me everything that was going to happen but since I have been going to the orthodontist for years I already knew everything that was going to happen and could talk to the surgeons like I knew what I was talking about.

Well we were on a boat in the middle of the ocean and long story short there wasn't any doctors around unless there was a really expensive one and the lower level of the ship.  After being unexpected vacation we are not about to pay so we figure we would give this trick a try.  Surprisingly it was very hard to let the chef get us some baking soda.

-1	I hurt my knee back in high school. I tore my miniscus and was told it was the cartilage in my knee.

1	An experience that I can think of which demonstrated my knowledge of medical issues was my ability to successfully act on my symptoms when I had appendicitis. I didn't know what was wrong with me at first, but based on symptoms I'd heard of, plus knowing that I'm supposed to go to the hospital if I'm vomiting so much I can't keep liquids down, I suspected that I had appendicitis. This turned out to be correct when I got to the hospital and had to have an operation.

It is one area I feel highly knowledgeable in without ever having gone to school for it. I once was at the pediatrician and the doctor asked if I would be okay going to the next room over to talk to a mom who had just found out about her son. They thought it might be helpful for me to come in as an experienced mom in this matter. I really enjoyed it and the mom seemed to leave feeling at least somewhat better about the future.

1	I experienced symptoms of a sickness, fever for a few days, etc.  I remained sick for an extended period of time which caused me to think something was wrong.  I went to a doctor and it was determined that I had walking pneumonia.  I feel relieved to have gone early to prevent anything worse from happening.
1	When I went in after my first kidney stone attack, I was presented with a list of information about various liquids my body could take in. I thought coffee and soda were dangerous because of their high caffeine intake and they said in great amounts, that's true, but what is most important is water intake. So as long as I am balancing with enough water, it will cause me no problems.
1	I have two kids who have a history of reactive airways when they get upper respiratory infections.  On several occasions I have had to assess their symptoms, administer breathing treatments, and make decisions about whether or not we needed to visit the ER.  
-1	I recently have been doing research on the benefits of the ketogenic diet. I talked/discussed the diet with my Aunt, who was inquiring how I was doing, knowing that recently I had started this diet. I was able to tell her about how I needed to increase my water intake because my fat cells were no longer holding onto the water your body needs to thrive properly. I also told her the benefits of cutting out carbs decreased inflammation in your body, which is pertinent information because my family suffers from psoriasis, a immune disease that shows itself in the inflammation of spots on your skin. 
1	I have a friend who often comes to me stating that she is sick or unwell, but usually I ask her a series of questions starting with if she has had any water that day. Usually the answer is no, and she feels better after she drinks some water. My next question would be whether she has eaten, how she slept, and if she has allergies depending on the symptoms.
1	When my depression and anxiety were getting worse. I was knowledgeable about current medications and treatments (by personal research) and was able to use that information to better communicate with my doctor and set up a plan I was familiar and comfortable with.

When I went to my eye appt., I was diagnosed with dry eye and blepharitis.  So I guess I am able to figure out what my symptoms mean and be right about it. 
-1	Last december, I was having some really bad pain in my bladder. It was difficult to urinate, and I constantly had a burning feeling. And an urge to constantly go to the bathroom, even though I didn't need to. I remembered these issues from a previous time that I had a UTI. I called in to my doctor and gave him my symptoms. They were able to review my chart and see that I had a UTI a year prior and instead of having to go in for another visit, they sent in an RX for the UTI. (although it is pretty easy to diagnose a UTI haha). 
-1	I gave advice to my brother in law when he was diagnosed with cancer to not eat sugar, because it can feed a tumor. 
1	My stepson has been diagnosed with ADHD and his mother is pushing for anxiety and bipolar treatments.  I have had to educate myself on the diagnoses, medication, and alternative options to advocate for  him.
1	When I was still in high school I originally thought I had a sore throat. After a few days of taking over the counter cough medicine I felt that it was something more than just a sore throat because it was getting harder to swallow. I went to the doctor to have it checked on and found out that the nodes in my neck were infected and filling with puss and if it had gone untreated they would have caused serious issues that could lead to death.
1	I woke up one day to brush my teeth as my daily routine.  I noticed that my tongue had a white coating no matter how much I brushed.  Trying to scrape off my tongue led me to bleed a bit.  After some internet research, I was sure I had oral thrush.  When I went to my doctor, I specifically asked her if I had oral thrush and she informed me that I did.  I was quite pleased with myself that I knew exactly what I had.
-1	A few years back I was having pain in my right side. I have know a few people who have had the same issue and it was their appendix. So after going to the doctor and having a ct scan the doctor said I needed to have me appendix removed 
1	My husband had become very mean to me.   This is really unlike him.  So I brought him to the doctor, who said everything was fine.   His behavior continued, so I brought him to the ER and insisted he be checked over.  After blood and urine was drawn, come to find out he was septic. 
1	I recently found out I have Type 2 Diabetes. With my medical knowledge and research ability I have been able to keep my blood sugar within normal limits without the use of medication.
1	I studied nursing. I was able to help my dad through his cancer. I did a lot of research and asked a lot of questions about his specific illness and therapy. I was able to help him with side effects of his treatment
-1	I have had fertility issues because of increased NK cells, more than 5 years and visited 4 doctors, nobody of them told me how to reduce the level of the cells which block the possibility for implantation. Then I found a holistic doctor doctor who recommended change in the food diet and test for food intolerance, my ob-gyn doctor started laughing at this and said this is silly. But I did everything my holistic doctor told to me, I even started core gymnanstics and acupuncture and 7 months later I was pregnant with my first child, so I read tons of books, blogs, articled, I tried a lot of things and succeed.
1	 When my daughter was 9 months old she had a serious infection. I repeatedly brought her to the pediatrician and emergency room before it was finally diagnosed. Only after a doctor was convinced that her white blood count needed to be checked was the infection clear to the medical professionals. I needed to be insistent. I also needed to be able to accurately administer her pain meds and antibiotics once we were discharged from the hospital.. 
-1	This event happened in 2007 when I was officially diagnosed with PCOS. I knew I had it just by the systems I was experiencing. I conduct all of my research online and throughly read through any material and sources I could place my hands on. When I finally saw my provider she diagnosed me PCOS which I knew.
1	My close friend fell ill, and I was with him. I helped him navigate his serious illness by doing research while he was mostly incapacitated.

-1	The first time I experience vertigo was beginning of 2013. I was doing my homework and eating at the same time. All of a sudden, I started hearing sound like radio frequency on my right ear, and felt everything around me was spinning. I felt nausea. I could not stand up. I had to hold something as if I was moving around too. I went to the hospital, but all they could tell me was I had vertigo. I was so desperate because that ringing sound never stop even now as I typing this. I started looking online everywhere for a treatment, but it is hopeless. I went to different doctors several times a month to see if they can heal me, but none was able to help me. I am desperate. This has caused everything around me up side down. 
-1	I once went for a yearly physical and a couple of days later I was told one of my test came back abnormal and I was so scared. I waa scheduled for another check my another doctor and come to find out it was normal. I knew an abnormal test means something in my body was not working correctly and according to websites where I received a lot of medical knowledge on my scare issue 
-1	i normally research any potential side effect or condition on the internet to understand and ask the right questions before I go to the Doctor but I don't have a great deal of knowledge in one particular area. 
1	I was able to figure out which of my medicines were interecting negatively to cause the deathlike lethargy I was having. 
1	"I don't think there is one great experience that demonstrated my personal knowledge of health issues.  I guess one experience would be that I regularly get a blood screening on an annual basis to stay in the know about anything that may be wrong health wise and it always comes back with flying colors - all blood screening ""things"" in the green."
1	I had a mastectomy becuase of breast cancer. I don't know if it demonstrated my knowledge, but it did improve it.  I had to look up so many test results and what they meant, not to mention aftercare from the surgery.
1	I had thyroid cancer and became very aware of radio active iodine and the fact your thyroid is the only organ that sucks up iodine and TSH is some thing that everyone who has a thyroid removed needs to replace and what T3 and T4 was. I started a thyroid support group so I could support others going through this scary experience 
1	I determined that my on and off fatigue after changing my diet to much healthier was a result of lowered iodine levels as my eats lots of cruciferous vegetables lowered my body's iodine update. I took iodine supplements and felt better
1	What? I have no idea. I went to the hospital for a kidney infection twice within the past 7 years and the nurses were impressed with my knowledge...? Does that count?
-1	A lot of my knowledge has come from doctor visits, television commercials, articles in magazines, asking questions to people, and general curiosity.
1	When I was younger I had a terrible ear ache. I did not feel sick however and thought it could be something else. I went online and found that an infected tooth could cause an ear ache. I ended up needing to have root canal on the very back molar in my mouth.

1	When my Grandma was having an issue with her blood pressure (low, fainting) and my other family members were rushing around trying to find ways to get her to be responsive, I knew enough that she should be placed flat on the ground (an incline would've been better but wasn't available) with her knees up and held up and feet flat on the floor. This would raise her blood pressure, and in a few moments she became responsive. We still called 911, but she was responsive and alert for it, rather than having a dangerously low blood pressure.
1	I had blood tests done and found out that I had hypothyroidism, but when I went to an endocrinologist about it she dismissed my symptoms and concerns. I had to advocate on my own behalf and tell her why all of my symptoms match with hypothyroidism
-1	I have been taken care of myself for a while. I know how to fill out medical information that pertains to me. If I need help, I can ask the nurse and they will help me fill out that I don't understand.
1	I am not sure that I have ever had the experience that you are looking for.  Any knowledge that I have of medical issues comes from after talking to either my doctor, or doing research.  I do not think that I have ever simply had knowledge of a medical issue.
-1	I had a room mate that had heart issues, i had to take him to his appointments and explain what was really going on, because he didnt know what to call it. he had high blood pressure and did not know what was really going on. It helped me to know about blood pressure!
-1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issue is that when I took my dog to the vet. I just adopted her and she was healthy and vaccinated. She had a previous history of fleas but when I had adopted her, she was flea free. Then after two week of having her, she started to claw her face so I looked it online to see what is happening and if I could fix it at home. The internet said it could be a cause of flea saliva and I could try to rub some vitamin E on it to see it it would help. It didnât so I took her to the vet and he just said the same thing about the flea and prescribed steroids like I predicted and sent her home.
1	My daughter needed to have a procedure done. I was already knowledgeable about this from past experience. I was able to explain everything to her in detail. I was able to answer any of her questions or concerns.
-1	I dont really have to much knowledge. just common scense and basic knowledge if things happen. I can tell if i really need to see a doctor or not.
1	I have been certified in first aid and CPR training. Those courses taught be a basic understanding of health issues and howto treat them. 
1	My mother was a nurse, my wife worked on an ambulance crew when I met her, and various other relatives have worked in the medical field for pretty much all my life, so I was subject to various aspects of medicine from an early age onward. Thus I learned (some) medicine through osmosis.
1	I used to have someone that worked for me and had seizures quite often. Knowing to turn him on his side, and help hold his head, helped him several times.

-1	When I first got sick I spent a lot of time learning about my disease and when my Dr first talked a lot about it she was impressed with the amount of accurate knowledge I had about it.
1	I started having a sore throat during the week at work. I knew it could be from exercising outdoors, that I needed to clean my fan, I had some type of cold or strep throat. As I weeded out the issues, I knew it had to either be a cold or strep throat. Once it really got sore, I was able to look in the mirror and see that my throat was really red and took myself to the doctor because I knew I had strep throat. I also woke up the next day (because I could not get into the doctor the same day) almost swallowing my uvula every time I swallowed. I was correct I had strep throat. 
1	demonstrated knowledge of medical issues would tend to come from conversations with medical professionals and their either agreement with what i think I know, or the redirection to the correct information.
-1	I had to use my knowledge on medical issues when I worked at a doctor's office. I worked there for a year and a half.
1	The other day when I was babysitting, I had a feeling that something was wrong with the little boy I was watching. He was feeling very sick and his mom believed it was just a cold. His cough was very bad, mucus cough, a very runny nose, a temperature in the hundreds and no appetite. His temperature started spiking so we took him to the doctor. Sure enough, he had the flu and was required to start taking antibiotics immediately.
1	I've had depression for a good portion of my life. Since there is constant research in this area i keep with with the new medications and read about how they could help me and then i consult with my doctor on if any may reduce the potential from side affects from what i currently take and do a better job then my current medications regeime 
1	My son was in the hospital for a month after he was born.  During that time we got very familiar with the monitors and terminology that the doctors and nurses were using everyday.  
1	Someone was saying they were guaranteed not to get the flu since they'd had the flu vaccine. I had to explain that having the flu vaccine could reduce the probably of getting the flu significantly, but they could not say they were never going to get the flu. It would be less likely, but could still happen.
1	My husband is a disabled veteran, and his neurologist is a foreign medical graduate who can barely speak English. I have to point out mistakes he made in reporting my husband's responses just about every time he sees this doctor.
1	There was a situation when I developed some issues with my neck and things became misaligned.  I went to different specialists to improve this area.  I finished a course of treatment with doctors from three different fields, and learned to manage the condition.
1	I am an RN with 16 years of experience.  Before I went to college, I worked at a retirement home in high school.  I learned a lot from elderly people, and they would ask me questions about their medication and how to fill out paperwork.
1	I've been disabled with a neurological illness that is poorly understood since I was 18 years old. I often know more about my conditions than my doctors do, because I've done a lot of research over the past 31 years of being sick. My doctor in my previous country of residence, used to ask me what treatment I would think would be beneficial for myself before suggesting anything. She told me I should have been a doctor, I used to brief her on the latest research findings into my illness and highlight relevant passages for her to help her treat others she saw with my disease.
1	I was once talking to the doctors about a blood test that I had taken for past signs of Tb. Since I had taken this test before, I knew a little bit of the different ones that existed, as well as some knowledge of how they worked. This was for a job that I was applying for, and the doctor was impressed that I had some prior knowledge. I also asked questions about follow up steps, such as whether I needed to take a chest x-ray. Due to my knowledge of the situation, it made it much easier for the doctor to explain to me what I needed. 
1	I don't know that such an experience exists as I have very little knowledge of health or medical issues, I only know when I feel something is wrong with my body. An example would be that once I had sudden onset shortness of breath and I knew that was abnormal so instead of waiting to go the doctor, I went immediately and was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism. 
-1	I was at home, alone, eating soup when I tried to swallow a lentil, but it got caught in my throat. I realized that I was not able to get it to go down and I could  feel it in my throat. I drove to the local fire station and the firefighters took me to the local hospital. After several hours, and a few tests, the attending doctor said there was nothing there. I was admitted, however, and the specialist for stomach problems listened to my story, and did a balloon endoscopy in the late evening. Sure enough, he found the lentil.

1	I figured out what to do when I got hit in the eye with a baseball. Ice was put on it, along with a tight bandage to stop the bleeding.  Then, heading to the hospital to be sure.
1	My sister-in-law said there was like green stuff when she sat down on the toilet (she was 9 months pregnant). I told her that could mean the baby was in distress and she should get to the hospital.
1	When I sprained my ankle playing soccer, I used my medical knowledge to know to put ice on the sprain 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off for the first few hours. Then the 2nd and 3rd days, I put heat on it, and wrapped up the ankle to stabilize it and prevent further injury.
1	my partner has Graves disease and was exhibiting symptoms of thyroid storm, a rare but fatal condition. I spoke with 4 different doctors over the phone in the ER who all said it was so unlikely she was probably fine. I took her to the hospital anyway and good thing because she had thyroid storm after all and almost died. 
1	I have actively participated in medical conferences and do biomedical research as a career. I have written a grant proposal on the role of pharmacogenomics in treatment for preterm birth and regularly read medical journals. 
1	My toddler son got sick over the holidays this year. It was a scary ordeal and we called the physician when his fever hit 104. I knew to call if his fever hit this high because of my limited medical experience. We were able to follow the doctor's instructions on our next treatment steps and have him diagnosed. I was able to keep calm and handle this situation because of the knowledge I possess.
1	My mother has several health issues (along with being a bit of a hypochondriac) and I have been to several doctor appointments with her to manage her paperwork and explain things she doesn't understand. 
1	I have been trying to reduce the amount of sugar in my diet. I have read that eating a lot of carbohydrates just turns right into sugar which can upset the bodies blood sugar balance to the point that it is much worse for you than fat. (As long as not excessive fat) So I have reduced carbohydrates as much as I can besides just the basic recommended level. I also try to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables to get necessary micro nutrients. I also have cut back significantly on the amount of red meat that I eat and have replaced it with chicken or pork. Some weeks all I feel like I eat is chicken and broccoli. I also try to exercise regularly and get in a moderate jog/run to exercise my cardiovascular system. I also monitor my weight to make sure to notice any changes or patterns and to drink more water. 
1	I rolled my ankle pretty badly during a soccer game. I figured I might as well go to the doctor even if I knew they would just tel me to ice it and stay off it as much as possible and then give me some pills like they did before. I went in and they did the exact same thing they did the last 2 times. X-ray on my ankle, then gave me crutches and the best way to ice it.

-1	I had frequent visits to my doctor throughout the years, and she is very patient and is willing to give information out in hopes to helping others. I have learned a ton from her just from visiting her when I'm not feeling well or if there is something wrong with me. 
1	I was a boy scout, and played football through college.  I have seen lots of cuts, broken fingers, dislocations and I have been under the knife for knee and ankle surgery.   I have general knowledge of medical issues. 
1	My son had a fever over 102 degrees at less than 1 month old.  I went to an urgent care, and then the emergency room for service, as this was a very unsafe temperature for child so young.  When I was in college, I had meningitis.  He was presenting similar issues, so I approved a lumbar puncture as well as a urine sample, blood sample, and sinus culture.  He was diagnosed with viral meningitis and given fluids in hospital.
1	A few years ago I determined that I was feeling really lousy and that the reason was that I had gotten overweight and didn't exercise enough. I wound up losing 30 pound in 2 months and felt great. Not only did I do the physical work required but I studied a lot about diet and timing of exercise to maximize the benefit.
1	Knowing that if I had a basic gold antibiotics  would do nothing for me since colds are a virus not a bacteria .
1	I have low iron. I've been able to raise my levels by changing my diet and limiting items that cause issues with iron.
-1	I really don't know what to write because I don't really have very much knowledge of heath or medical issues.  I guess I try to eat healthy.  There was one time where I had to take care of a wound that my husband had.  The nurse on base showed me how to change his dressings and I did until he was all healed up.  That is really the only thing I can think off.  When I go to the grocery store I pay attention to nutrition labels and try to avoid foods with added sugar, too much salt, and loads of carbs.  Fat is ok because we are doing the keto diet right now.
1	Once I was visiting a parent who just had surgery. They were still waiting to be seen by the doctor post-operatively. I was noticed that the partial oxygen on the monitor to be low (in the 80s), so I called a nurse, who then called for oxygen. The oxygen levels came up and everything was deemed fine. 
1	My dad was diagnosed with lung cancer and I was the one to take him to his appointments and procedures . He was in his 80 so I was the one to ask questions, take notes and help decide on treatment.  
1	My daughter was born with gastroschisis.  I did a lot of research on it, so by the time she was born I was well aware of what to look out for, what to ask the doctors, and what things to be worried about. She was in the hospital for over a month, and during the time the staff was constantly making comments about how well versed I was in my daughter's condition. It made me feel more comfortable going home with her when she was discharged knowing that I had learned so much about her condition and was comfortable knowing when something didn't seem right or if it was something that was normal for babies with this condition. 
1	I recently was on a flight to Philadelphia when the very pregnant woman in the aisle across from me tried to stand up and fainted, ending up in the aisle. I put my jacket under her head, loosened her coat and took her pulse which was slightly fast. I saw no signs of contractions in her belly and chalked the episode up to being too warm, possible dehydration and a drop in her blood pressure when she stood up too quickly. After a few moments she came to and after a drink of water, she was able to return to her seat and comfortably finish the flight.
1	I went to get a blood screening and the doctor talked me through what needed to be done, however I already knew most of the procedure and what would be done with the blood, being put in a centrifuge to separate it and test the different parts.
-1	I know nothing about medical issues. I just know it's probably not a good thing to do drugs constantly and eat junk food and go for a run every now and then.
-1	I used to work as a certified nursing assistant and worked in a retirement home caring for elderly residents. Part of that training was obviously taking vital signs. Years later my husband got sick and he was in the hospital. A CNA entered his room to take his vitals and his blood pressure was extremely high. I asked her if she was going to retake it. She said she would consult with the charge nurse, I told her - why don't you just retake them now, that blood pressure is too high. She retook the blood pressure and he was fine, but I am glad I had the knowledge I did to ask for a re-take.
1	When my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. You go thru life experiencing thehighs, lows. The good days after chemo, the bad days. The hours you spen itting with your wife thru chemo process.
-1	I once dated someone who had the flu and was about to develop pneumonia. He smoked cigarettes. I informed him of how his lungs worked and that he was paralyzing the scillia in his lungs and that's why he couldn't expel a lot of the mucus or phlegmn that was building up in his lungs. I told him that if he stopped smoking they would start to work again.
1	Around two years ago I received lab work that my blood pressure was on the higher end. I consulted with my physician and decided to reduce sodium intake and exercise more often. A year later for my next check up my levels had fallen back into normal range.
1	I am trained as a medical assistant so I have to be educated on many health facts and matters. I also am currently majoring in public health.
1	I was recently hospitalized for two weeks. I received multiple tests before it was discovered that my gallbladder function had ceased. In that time I became very aware of the procedures and tests which were performed.
1	Lots of medical appointments and lots of ads on tv and interest in the medical field. Good and bad doctors and doing my own research helps. 
1	My friend's and family usually ask my opinion on their health issues, ask my advice about which vitamins or supplements could help them with the issues they have. 
-1	After I applied for my current job, I had an interview with my current boss. She told me there were three candidates that she was considering but she chose me because of medical background. She also said I was knowledgeable about the things she asked me and that she felt like I'd be a good fit at her medical establishment. Two years later, I'm still here so I'm guessing I demonstrated a knowledge of health or medical issues correctly. 
1	I have dealt with infertility for most of my adult life and the struggle to have a child had made me educate myself not only into what is happening inside my own body, but into what medical science can do to assist me in having my own child.
1	When I got a concussion, I knew the symptoms to look for and when to go to the emergency room. I had enough medical knowledge about concussions to know when to seek help.

1	Based upon my symptoms, nasal congestion, temperature, and lethargy, I can figure out if I need to go to the doctor or if I just need to stay home. I am able to make an education decision about if I need perception medication or if over the counter medications will be helpful.  
1	I was enrolled in a medical class in high school and I passed the class with an A. It's the only experience that demonstrates my health knowledge because I do not go to the doctors often. I did really well in that class though and even now I try and stay knowledgeable about different conditions and their symptoms. 
1	I have relied on past experiences and diagnosis. I observed a rash on a friends child that looked a lot like the hand foot and mouth all of my children had prior. I informed my friend that it can be dangerous for pregnant woman to contract (given advice i was given by my doctor when I had been pregnant and my family had gotten it). I advised my friend to get herself and her child checked out. She did and the child was seen to have hand foot and mouth.
1	I worked as a medical scribe in an orthopedic office and demonstrated a proficient knowledge of the medical conditions that were regularly treated.

-1	I went to a doctor because i have been experiencing a lot of symptoms that showed that I have PCOS. I did my research, so when I went to the doctor to be diagnosed, I told her that I may have PCOS and she told me that I was most probably right. And I was.
1	I NEARLY FAINTED ONCE WHEN I HAD TAKEN MY DAUGHTER TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.  I HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO THE FLU AND HAD NOT EATEN BECAUSE OF HAVING TO RUSH HER TO THE HOSPITAL.  AFTER BEING FORCED TO HAVE AN EKG AND BLOOD WORK BY THE ER DOCTOR AND RUNNING UP A BILL, WHILE TELLING THEM THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG EXCEPT I WAS PROBABLY GETTING THE FLU AND HAD NOT EATEN.

1	When my son was hospitalized, I was able to understand what the doctors were talking about as far as anatomy and body function. This helped me to get a good idea of what exactly was happening with my son and what needed to be done to help. I honestly didn't realize I knew as much as I did until I started talking with them. There were still plenty of things I didn't understand but those blanks were much easier to fil because of my basic understanding.

1	Whenever I get truly sick for a prolonged period of time or feel it may be serious enough to see a professional I generally do my research first through google, webmd, and other resources so that I have a general idea of what it could be. Even if I'm wrong when discussing these possibilities with my doctor it helps give him a general idea of what it might actually be or helps narrow it down some.
1	I was sick so I looked for medicine in my house and found some by reading the label and seeing that it would make me better and feel better as well. I continued this method with buying stuff if I didn't have it or going to a doctor to tell me what to use if I needed to use something.
-1	I signed up for a CPR/AED/FirstAid and Lifeguard certification course.  One thing I had to do was explain to my classmates what CPR stands for, cardiopulmonary resuscitation which uses chest compression's to keep blood circulating until emergency help arrives.

1	About three years ago, my mother fell down while taking the trash out. She told me over the phone that her arm was hurting terrible, and that she felt a snap upon impact. When I came to check on her, I noticed a bulge on her arm where her bicep was. I had a similar injury in high school, and was positive she had torn her bicep. I took her to the doctor the next day, where she was diagnosed with a torn bicep.
-1	I don't have much formal training, just bits and pieces picked up over life. This knowledge came in handy when I fell out of a tree as a teenager. I dislocated my shoulder and it really hurt. First off, I knew I had to stay calm, stopped the bleeding and then proceeded to find help.
-1	When I started to get sick, I started to keep tack of what was happening to me and looking up online each things that was going on.

1	I have spinal issues. A friend was suffering from an injured lower back. She asked what i thought.

Turns out it was basal cell that is pre-cancerous if not treated and removed.  I have gone to the dermatologist regularly for 5 years and each year something has been found to remove.  Being proactive is important.
-1	One time along time ago when I was a little kid I had to go to the doctor for measles and the doctor thought it was chicken pox but I knew it wasn't so I explained what I knew and how I knew it and why so we could get the correct diagnosis. I think knowing and researching some yourself to help self diagnosis is a major help as doctors are human too and may not always have the correct idea based on your description of the symptoms you are experiencing  and could lead to mistakes being made early in the discussion.
1	When my son had eczema, the doctor just wanted to give him steroid cream and told me there's usually no cure. Instead I had him tested for allergies and found he was allergic to tree nuts. Once we eliminated tree nuts from his diet, the eczema disappeared and has never returned.

I had to have my gallbladder removed.
1	I had once had really bad cellulitis in my elbow region. At the time nobody knew what it was and thought I got stung by a bug or something. I knew it wasn't that and researched a lot of different possibilities. I knew I was right and I was as I was told I got cellulitis once I got to the ER.

I went to the chiropracter because I though my posture and neck alignment may be contributing to neck tension and pain.  This could be leading to frequent headaches.  I wanted to continue with the chiropracter but I cannot at this time due to money issues.  I started getting what I believe were intenstinal ulcers from the excedrin, particularly the NSAIDs.  It put me in extreme pain and cramping for days which I could not get rid of.  I went to see an emergency doctor who gave me pills to stop the cramps in my intenstine.  My sister had the same issue a few years later.  I found out my whole family gets migraines at a family reunion.  I started doing more research and found out inflammation could be a cause.  I started taking turmeric supplements for inflammation.  Within a month I had significantly fewer migraines and headaches.

It was a long recovery with still remaining issues that I continue to seek treatment and get educated about the body and recovery.
1	I accompanied my mom to get screened for breast cancer and she was given information about what to do to avoid ever having it
1	Most of my knowledge regarding health or medical issues is not from learning about them from doctors or reading about them on the internet, but rather it is from my previous experiences with them in my own life. When my friend was experiencing problems with frequent stomachaches and trips to the restroom, I told him that it sounded familiar to my own experience with the stomach flu. After being home-ridden for a week, he informs be that it was indeed the stomach flu and that my advice for him to take time off of school was important and necessary.

I had remembered reading about certain signs the body gives away that are an indication of other issues during my studying in the medical field.

He told me that I was absolutely right. 
1	My mother was recently treated for breast cancer and just had her third of four chemotherapy sessions. She was initially told that she would not need chemo at all and would just have to do radiation to lower the rate of recurrence after the tumor and a lymph node was removed, and then a month later she had to very quickly reschedule, messing up work and therefore putting her insurance at risk. All of the complaints I've given you so far are incredibly fresh in my mind.
1	I was diagnosed with a fibrocystic adenoma at 16.  Before I received the diagnosis, I was told by two doctors that it was just a cyst.

Instead of having to go to the doctors I called the 24 hour nurse service and told them I believed that I had a UTI.

1	I went to college for five years to become a clinical laboratory scientist. We learned a lot about the different disorders that affect the blood cells and other bodily fluids.

1	Well, when my dad was sick, I attended many of his doctors appointments, chemo treatments, etc. with him. I feel as if I picked up a lot during that time. When it came time for my dad to enter the hospice program, I was able to take care of him myself and home, albeit with the help of a nurse and other family members. I administered medications to help keep him relaxed and comfortable. I turned him in his bed to try to keep him from getting bedsores.

Asshole.
1	I have costochondritis, inflammation of the rib cage. I spent a year feeling really horrible and not knowing what the problem was. I started suffering from very bad health anxiety, went to the ER a few times thinking that I was having a heart attack or dying.

After almost a year of researching and trying everything to get better, I learned about costochondritis and finally got a diagnosis. 
1	Well about 10 years ago I experienced a staph infection on my leg that needed to be treated.  At the time I the cost to have it treated was well beyond my means as I was between jobs and my co-pay was infeasible. Luckly I knew to process of dealing with such an infection was to remove the core from the boil, disinfect the wound, place a drain, then cover it up and request some antibiotics.  I was able to lance the boil and do all the treatment work (I have a very high tolerance for pain) and requested my doctor prescribe some antibiotics.  When I arrived at the office he examined the treated wound and told me he was impressed I was able to do that myself and that it looked as good as the work he would have done.  He did suggest I let a professional do it next time as I could have hurt myself but still I managed to treat it myself.
-1	I've had issues where my tongue gets inflamed and swollen for reasons I still do not understand. Most doctors look at my tongue and focus on the top portion. I have what is called a geographical tongue. It has an odd design and looks cracked and spaced apart on the surface, kind of like the landmasses on the earth. Most doctors have not even heard of this and focus on that, as though it is part of, or the reason for the inflammation. This is one area in which I actually know more than the doctors, and frustrates me when they wont listen to my explanation.

I was able to immediately identify what it was and was able to get rid of them based on my prior knowledge.

I was able to clean her foot, apply ointment and dressed her wound. I did this for a few days with no improvement. When I went to do the same thing the next day, it clearly was getting worse. I advised my grandmother that it looks like gangrene and she should go get it checked. She did and was admitted to the hospital for gangrene. They would normally take the toe but because of her age they highly recommended we didn't opt for that solution. They ended up injecting her with some type of solution and gave her an antibiotic and dressed the wound. Whatever they did stopped the infection and she lived for two more years after that incident and passed away due to other reasons unrelated to the toe

1	Let's take flu shots.  I have opted out of getting a flu shot.  I have never had one before, however this year I was tempted.  I understand that the flu shot is only about 17-18% effective in preventing the flu.  This number is not very high.  I also understand what they are telling us is that even if we get the flu, the severity would be reduced if we were to get a flu shot.

After the years of doctor visits to neorologists for so many of my own neurological problems I was able to see correlating patterns between he and I. I was able to get him seen by a developmental pediatrician much sooner than I would have were I unexperienced in such matters. I consequently obtained a diagnosis that allowed me to request specialized services at school at the earliest possible grade. As well, I was able to help at least 2 friends see that their kids had some issues or symptoms that similarly called for a more proactive approach with their respective healthcare resources than if I hadn't pointed it out.

1	Well for a long time I kept getting a burning in my chest. Doctor and I were not sure what was causing it. Initially we both thought it was bronchitis as I also had trouble breathing. After inhalers and steroids didn't help, we thought it might be heartburn, as I've had history of acid reflux and stomach issues. So after being on prilosec for a bit, I noticed I still had the burning in my chest. It was then I noticed that it occurred when my heartrate went up.

1	Uh, I dunno. I don't get sick very often and when I do, it's just for a few days and it's never that severe. The worst time I can recall is when I got food poisoning a few months ago and that lasted one day (one horrible, puking day). I've never had an experience that I would say demonstrated high knowledge of medical science.
1	When my best friend was having a problem, he thought it might be an STD or some other infection. I told him about my own experience with prostatitis.

However, I was able to make it there on time and get sorted out while the doctors giving me prescription to help ease the pain.

-1	Once, I was prescribed an antibiotic.  I informed the doctor I was allergic to penicillin.  After reviewing the prescription, I got it filled.  The pharmacy I visit has my health information on file.  After turning it in, I was called to the front and informed the medicine was in the same family as penicillin.  I had no idea what that meant.  The pharmacist explained that I was probably allergic to it.  I was so mad! I had told the doctor what I was allergic to! If the pharmacist hadnât warned me, I could have been in big trouble. So mad!

-1	I grew up with a bi-polar mother. Over time I realized I was bi-polar by some of the traits I was starting to exhibit.
1	Having a baby definitely made me more knowledgeable. From start to finish, I learned about my changing body and building a baby inside of me. Many things were different after I had the baby and learning about the signs and things to look for on a growing baby or just sickness in general. You learn a lot becoming a parent so it definitely makes you pretty familiar with medical issues.

1	I don't consider myself to be especially knowledgeable in health or medical issues. I have general knowledge in the areas of nutrition from a class I took in college. I try to choose healthier options when I go grocery shopping because of that like ground turkey over ground beef. I know sitting for extended periods of time is bad for you, so I try to get up and walk around every hour or so (I work an office job). In terms of medical problems I have gone straight to the doctor for a mole that started to look abnormal because I know that can mean cancer. For the most part I just try to make sure I take all preventive measures and get all required tests for my gender and age group.

I've taken him to emergency for what's turned out to be pericarditis, and for TIAs. I talk to his doctors. He's still alive, so there's that.
1	"I have had to advocate most of all my life for my early onset medical problems at a young age. I had to speak to that ten percent of those medical staff who were apathetic, disinterested, and hateful about not giving me certain medications that caused my health problems to get worse. I am glad that I learned from a few other ""good"" and honest doctors to 'gently' research my conditions and medications that I take."

1	I was talking to one of my friends and he was mad his insurance quit paying for his crestor and forced him to start taking another drug (I'm sure it was atorvastatin). He told me he needed to get a massage because he has a personal trainer and his muscles felt sore and weak. I asked him if that was normal or did it just start recently. I asked if it started around when his insurance stopped paying for crestor. He said now that you mention it, it did! I said it is probably your new cholesterol drug because statins have a tendency to cause muscle weakness or aching. So his doctor filled out a prior authorization detailing the effect of the drug they recommended and he went back to his crestor and the muscle issues went away. 
-1	"My father passed away last year after a unexpected medical issue. My husband and I being the only medically knowledgeable parts of the family were able to ask about his liver and kidney status and brain function.

1	One experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues involved a group of friends and myself hanging out. The guys in the group were being rambunctious and wrestling inside the house (something which was not recommended). At one point, one of the guys tripped and fell hitting his head on the corner of the television. It immediately began bleeding and he was unsure as to what he should do so he immediately came to me. My suggestion was to first stop the bleeding (apply slight pressure to the area), check his cognitive functioning/vision, and make sure he didn't fall asleep, and stay positive/encouraging so he would not panic. After a little while the bleeding stopped and we further assessed his state. I gave him ibuprofen and continued to monitor his state for the next couple of hours making sure that he knew we could go to the hospital if need be.
-1	Five years a go I went in for a checkup because I kept feeling dizzy. So I went in for blood work and other tests.

1	Last week I had pink eye, I know like many, the medical term is conjunctivitis, I knew it had viral and bacterial forms (and found out allergic as well). I knew that an antibiotic could help if it was bacterial in nature and over the counter medicines could treat the symptoms. I knew that the secretion that comes with pink eye is typically called discharge. I knew the cornea was the part of the eye that shows irritation. And some other stuff you get the idea.
1	I don't know if I have any experiences as such. I remember having a cough that was pretty bad and I coughed very hard and heard something snap in my side and was a deep pain. I had bruising in the area and just knew that I had separated my ribs in that area. It was confirmed later on.
1	"I was getting sharp cornea pain years after a corneal injury.

We also came up with an exercise plan, where my family member joined a gym and went multiple times a week. He lost a lot of weight and felt a lot better overall. His blood test numbers improved at the doctor.
1	Every time that I see a new doctor I have to explain my traumatic brain injury and the effect it has had on my life.

1	My child had foul breath and an ear ache. It was clear to me that she had strep throut but the doctor didn't think so. She ordered the test and it came back negative. my daughter then developed a high fever and i brought her back a few days later. Her strep test finally came back positive.

-1	Relating effectively with patients is among the most valued skills of clinical care. As a beginning clinician, you will focus your energies on gathering information. At the same time, by using techniques that promote trust and convey respect, you will allow the patientâs story to unfold in its most full and detailed form. Establishing a supportive interaction helps the patient feel more at ease when sharing information and itself becomes the foundation for therapeutic clinicianâpatient relationships. 4 Because illness can make patients feel discouraged and isolated, âA feeling of connectedness with the doctor, of being deeply heard and understood, reduces this feeling of isolation and despair. This feeling is the very heart of healing

-1	"When the government inverted the food pyramid in the early 1990s, I told my children to ignore it. Replacing proteins, fats, etc with carbohydrates would create US epidemics of diabetes and obesity in the US -- it has. 75% of the brain is myelin, myelin is 100% cholesterol. Statin drugs inhibit liver production of cholesterol, creating our epidemic of Swiss cheese-brained cadavers from Alzheimer's disease. A 6.4 cent 100 mcg vitamin K tablet - size of saccharin tablet - prevents required blood serum calcium and blood  serum cholesterol from bonding at the molecular level into vessel plaque. When I had to tell a doctor that I had a strep throat, he took a culture, then didn't know what to prescribe because I'm allergic to penicillin. His PDR was no help to him, and he finally asked me what was usually prescribed for me, and wrote the prescription after again checking the PDR for correct dosage by weight, after asking me my weight. I was 20 at the time. Want more? Despite foreknowledge of both grandmothers dying of uterine hemorrhage and special care being taken for my first two deliveries, I suffered a uterine hemorrhage with my third child and ""died"" and I'm here only because I responded positively to resuscitation. Further idiocy? Second hand smoke was disproved in 1999, but they keep beating that dead horse. I smoked a pack of Marlboro reds throughout all three pregnancies, and gave birth to healthy, perfect, over 8 pound babies, a girl and two boys. Start looking for the correct reasons -- like minerals missing from the diet because they're never replaced in arable soil -- for birth defects."
