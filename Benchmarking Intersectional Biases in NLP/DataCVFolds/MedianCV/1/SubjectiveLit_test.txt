I am good at asking for information and paraphrasing what the physician says.

-1	When it comes to just myself I am confident that I can make the right decisions. Sometimes I may forget my insurance plan numbers or something else but I can definitely ask questions without issue. So even if I am unsure or confused I have no problem making sure I understand before I leave.

For over 30 years, I served as a volunteer Paramedic and took advantage of every learning situation possible.

When the doctor prescribes a medicine, I make sure to understand the purpose of the medicine. Also, I go through the leaflet that arrives with each medicine to understand the side-effects of the medicine.

1	I feel confident in getting information on most things at my healthcare providers location and over the phone. The biggest complaint that I have is with billing. My bills are never up to date (on their end) and so I never know what is going on.
1	I have no trouble understanding basic health problems. I worry about my health a lot, but do everything I can to maintain it.I exercise 5 or 6 times a week, don't smoke and at a good weight.

While I am in the appropriate place, if I do not know what is going on, I will ask questions to understand what is going on, so I can make the best decision for  myself. My going home care, I always speak to the doctor or nursing that is discharging me, to clarify everything that is going on, to ensure I have a good understanding. After going home, if I have any follow-up questions, I will call to get assistance.

It is helpful for me to have someone with me to rephrase what is being told to me. I also find that I do not always remember to ask questions if there is something I wanted to know, so I usually prepare ahead of time with someone who can remind me about what my questions were.

-1	Oddly, my father is in the hospital this very week with kidney failure and pneumonia and I had to provide end of life, resuscitation information and fill out a great deal of forms in the past 7 days. My mother is a nurse and I've grown up around health care professionals so I have a lot of personal resources I can draw on if I have questions, I also feel I'm fairly intelligent and can do my homework on the internet to ask relevant questions and look  up issues and procedures after I talk to a health care professional to be fully informed.

-1	I feel like I understand the doctorâs and nurseâs explanations sometimes. The only hardship that I have when they use medical terminologies or expressions that I am not familiar with. Anytime when this happens I can just ask them for further explanation and they help me understand the situation better most of the time. The only thing that I really do not like is that I feel that the doctors are always in a rush and by the time you have a question they have already left. This is not personal it is because of the healthcare system is about the money as well.

-1	Some of it is fine, but most is very hard to understand
1	I have been through some major surgeries, and have some chronic health conditions that I have been dealing with for many years.  When these conditions first arose, having no previous knowledge of most of the information that was given to me, it was somewhat daunting to try to understand everything presented to me. I had excellent providers then, and all the information that I needed was provided by someone in the process.  Currently, I feel that I am experienced in these situations now to know enough about my situation.  I  also remain very confident in the information provided to me by professionals.

-1	I feel I have 100% of the basic capacity to understand, and make appropriate health decisions. If I don't understand all components I have the ability to research whatever it is I am having a hard time with. Sometimes in order to understand something you have to ask a few questions, research a few things, and be willing to put in work to understand how to assist yourself. Health care related documents can be a hard task to understand , but with that being said its better to understand then to pretend to understand and mess up something major.

-1	For the most part I think I'm pretty capable. If I don't understand something, I'm not afraid to ask. Also, I tend to search for help online quite a bit and often find my answers there.

1	I am fully capable of making decisions regarding my health based on information provided to me from my physician/nurse.  I never need assistance with understanding the information they present to me.
1	I feel like I am pretty informed and do ask questions about health care options. There are times that my doctor is uble or unwilling to address certain questions (i.e. supplements versus prescription meds; treatment side effects, etc.) and questions go unswered.  But I generally understand information I am given or I am able to find competent online sources to read further and understand.
1	I feel confident that I can understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I have never had a problem understanding information given to me by a doctor in the past. If I an unsure about anything I will ask questions until I fully understand.

-1	I think I can understand basic health information. I probably can process health information if it is not too complicated, I ask the right questions, and the health provider is willing to give me thorough answers. Obtaining health information is something I can do by researching online, but obtaining health information from a doctor would be difficult without health insurance coverage.
-1	I believe that often times, I am able to read and assess the situation that is provided to me in terms of my basic health information. The difficulty occurs when, if I have a health issue, and I wish to obtain further information, I don't always have the best understanding of what is then told to me.

-1	I feel like I can only understand the most basic results that my doctors can give me. Once they get into how much medication I need to take, what effects it will have in the long term the information just phases out of my head.

-1	Given the fact that I work in the scientific field, I feel as if I'm predisposed to have a good basic understanding of medical terminology combined with an exceptional command of the English language. The only problem arises when the care provider is unable to fully describe the mechanisms of drugs for which they prescribe. That would be one of the few circumstances where I need assistance in making the best decision for my health.    
-1	Persolly I feel that I usually have to head online and check a few medical websites or forums for answered questions for a better explation that i can understand.

1	I like to think that I am easily able to comprehend a doctors diagnosis. If there was any obvious question that jumps out to me, I always ask it. If anything is unclear I will be sure to have any advice/instruction clarified. On the off chance that I think of a question afterwords, I can usually read up on the subject to gain further understanding. My wife is very often with me and behaves similarly. If I was in a position that I could not fill out paperwork, I am sure she could handle the task.  Lets hope that doesn't happen though.
-1	I have a high capacity to read, understand, and comprehend health info and services, but sometimes I just don't take the time or put in the effort to do so. I am young, I have no major medical issues, and my vision/ hearing is fine.

-1	"I would give myself a ""B+"".  I understand just about everything, but when they start using very medicals terms / lingo I may start to not understand as well.

Once, a medical professional commented to me that he thought I worked in the health field.
1	I have no problems reading material from my medical provider.  I can fill out documents without any difficulty.  I am very open with my physician.  And, I ask questions and/or request explanations from my doctor.
-1	I recently had surgery and I felt like after every appointment (which were significant, including MRIs, physical therapists, anesthesiologists) I had to Google everything that was told to me. I would forget what I should ask when I was in the room, because I was too busy trying to process what the doctor or nurse was telling me. I know they're busy people but I wish I had more time to process and then ask questions.
1	I feel I have a good doctor and am able to openly communicate and discuss issues with them. I am open about my health issues which I think you need to be in order to get the help you need. I understand for the most part what the Dr says and what I am not sure of I ask questions. My husband will also ask questions which further helps with any questions that may arise or answers we may need. My husband and I share the same Doctor and we typically schedule appointments at the same time so the Doctor sees us together in an hour block.  This also helps us communicate better as we are both there and can both ask questions we may have
1	I am very confident that I am capable to take care of my medical needs and services.  I understand all that I need to understand.

-1	I feel that I have a good grasp on the basics of how the human body works. As long as it pertains to one of the systems, IE respiratory, circulatory, it is fairly easy to understand. When the illness in question gets deeper than that, to the smaller functions of the body, is when it becomes difficult to understand.
-1	I feel like I certainly have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as well as services however I would always have a little bit of uncertainty simply because you don't want to make mistakes regarding your health or the health of your children. I definitely think for minor health issues I can comprehend everything quite well but as things get more serious I tend to be a little more doubtful of myself.
1	All the time I am a retired nurse so I understand medical information and insurance information.i know where and how to get the information it I have a problem
-1	I feel that my abilities are more or less on par with the majority of the population. If I am given the tools and a rough idea of how they are used I feel I would have the capacity to navigate them.

-1	I am not afraid to ask questions when I'm uncertain about a medical situation so while I may not understand right away, I will get answers. In addition to asking a medical professional, I go to as many resources as I can to find out about the condition. That said, I would say I'm slightly above average in terms of understanding basic health information.
1	Anytime I go to the doctor for something, they give me pamphlets that describe whatever my issue is.  The same thing with prescribed medications.  Whenever I do not understand something, I can usually find an article about it online that covers what I need to know.
-1	Necessary health care means listening to the healthcare provider and communicating symptoms.  Sometimes I think healthcare providers are just too busy with large client bases to spend enough time on diagnosis and treatment.  I also think multidisciplinary teams should work with patients to prevent illness.
1	I think that my father did a pretty good job in all of my doctor's visits as a child to be able to understand what to do during visits so that I'd be able to go by myself when I got old enough. In general, I know my family's history and some of the specific issues that I want to double check with my doctor to make sure there are no issues there (cancer and heart issues). I know enough about services for the one issue I have with colitis and can adequately ask about that. I know where to go on the internet to get more information if something is unclear to me.

1	I feel perfectly capable of understanding the information provided to me. If I do not understand a piece of information I feel capable of asking the questions that will get me the answers I need.

1	I feel I can handle basic health information when it is given to me. I haven't had a problem yet with this situation. I usually only have a question or two for the doctors and nurses when I go to the doctor and most of the time it is just to get confirmation that I understood the information I was given correctly.
-1	I think I generally have the capacity I need. I had a traumatic experience last year that required profession mental health care, though, and at that time I was struggling to obtain the government assistance I was eligible for. It was too difficult at that time for me to keep on top of all the forms they kept sending me - I became overwhelmed and gave up even though I was eligible and really needed help.
1	Not afraid to ask questions of any medical professional and careful to weigh pros and cons when it comes to procedures, medications, etc

1	I have been for 50 years ,and will continue to do so.I make it a point to obtain all the information possible from my doctors .
1	I completed and passed the courses and tests required in my state to become a licensed vocational nurse.  Since I have completed this course, I have a much better understanding of the medical terminology used by doctors and nurses.  I am also more aware of what questions need to be asked so that any questions that you may have will be answered in a way that you can understand.  Typically, my family prefers me to be there with them during medical visits because of my better understanding of medical terminology.  
1	In most situations, I feel comfortable that I am understanding.  However, the older I get, I know situations may arise for more complex problems and I am concerned that I will understand everything I am told.
1	I have complete confidence that I understand basic health information as long as it is explained in words that I understand and not medical jargon.  I need plain, everyday english
1	I believe I can do so very well. I can understand and comprehend the necessary information to be able to understand what I should.
1	im young and i have the patience and the knowledge to be able to deal with anything medical related 
1	I have no mental problems that prevent me from understanding the written or spoken word.  I am nearly completely deaf, but my doc speaks louder and it is not hard to hear him.  And if I do not understand something he or the nurse says, I ask them to repeat themselves.  Same goes with any form I am filling out.  If I do not understand the question, I ask.  So, I would say I have 100% capacity to understand information, get information, process said information and make the necessary medical decisions.
1	Because basic health information really isn't that hard to understand. And i have a college education so i am capable. 
-1	I think if the problem is just basic health, I have no problems. I am old enough to have life experiences that make me understand the basics. It is anything above that level that creates problems.
1	Having come from a family that is involved in the medical profession, I know that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	I am very confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and service whether that information is being given to me by a doctor, nurse, or hospital so that I can make appropriate health decisions.
-1	I feel like I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I can figure things out by simply googling them or having someone who has been in my position explain certain things to me to make sure I understand what is going on. I am pretty on top of my health and am healthy to begin with so it isn't too difficult to keep it all straight. The only issues I really have is remembering my family medical history. That kind of messes me up in terms of telling doctors what is determined by my genetics, etc but for the most part I can understand basic health information.

-1	I think I can do it just fine. I am a native English speaker and I also currently work for a company that provides health services anyway.

-1	"I think that the doctors who I am a patient under are generally capable of explaining my problems to me. The forms are also easy enough to understand. The problem starts with me and my disconnect between doctors. I don't speak the language of medicine, and I don't know how to properly express symptoms. So there is a moment when the doctor asks me if I have any questions, but I say I do not. I only come to find out days or weeks later that I should have asked certain questions when I run into problems. For instance, I never used to consider the side effects of medications until I started suffering them, and when I did start to talk to doctors about them I could not just say ""tell me about the side effects,"" because they would only discuss the most common ones. If not for the fact that I suffered rare side effects, I would not have known that you have to push the issue in order to learn about the effects doctors feel aren't worth mentioning."

1	I am a retired RN and so I understand all the medical terms a Dr. or nurse might use and if need be I ask them appropriate questions.
-1	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand most of the time. Some times I don't get the answer I was looking for or expecting. I do make sure to insist and get the best answer from the doctor. On occasions the doctor comes in and out and does not allow time for asking the questions I want.

-1	I don't have the ability ti understand very well, I need help and explanations. Sometimes the doctors do not have time to explain and I leave with more questions than I did when I arrived.
-1	I can understand health information and make health decision as long as it's not made obtuse by using technical terms or covering pages with legal talk.

-1	In some regards I feel like I can ask my doctors questions.  However, to access second opinions and where to go for my children and what the waiting lists are like are very difficult to understand.  Especially for mental health care and education for children with disabilities and mental giftedness.  I've had a very hard time to get any information out of anyone as to where you can get adequate mental healthcare for an extremely gifted child without compromising their education and future career options.  This is extremely frustrating.  As well, wait times in ER's for children's mental health access is very discouraging as we've waiting 24 hours to get transferred to a mental health facility with a gravely ill child having mental health problems.  Why is there the disconnect? Why isn't mental health acknowledged and it passed off as a non-medical issue and labelled a behavioral issue as well.  Who can explain that to me?

I also have a degree in Biology that maybe helps me further understand some of the general information presented to me about health and anatomy. 
-1	I can understand most of the basic questions. The problem that I have is when the doctor or nurse use medical terms in which I've never heard of or when I'm filling out forms.

When they start using the medical names for conditions or treatments, I start to be lost, until they break it down for me to understand.
-1	I feel that I have the knowledge to understand about 75% of what is presented to me by doctors and nurses. They typically ask if I understand but to be honest typically when first presented with complex information it takes me a minute to process it.
1	Very clearly I need no assistance at all at help with filling out paperwork or assisting with other medical needs and cares

There are times when I am reading my online medical chart after I get a result in that I will need to call the doctor to understand what it is saying. Most of the time I will make an appointment after getting a result back, just so I have that one on one conversation with my doctor. It feel I understand better when they explain to me face to face. That is when I feel I process the information very well. Especially when they show me different examples of what is going on in my body. It helps when the doctor doesn't seemed rushed. I think when the doctor is rushed not a lot of information is obtained.
1	I do not have any problem dealing with my health information and services.  If there is anything I do not understand, I am able to find the person who can help me with the issue.
-1	My capacity to obtain basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is very high. The doctors and nurses try to give me as much information about my condition as possible and answers many questions I ask them. My capacity to process basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is kind of slow. I have to visually see what the doctors and nurses are saying to comprehend it. Just listening is not enough to register my condition.

I see connections and understand the logic of cause and reaction.
-1	I think I can understand the basic health information and services for the most part.  But sometimes the language used I will need some help with.  I don't need help all the time just some of the time.  I think that for most of the time I can do it myself.

-1	some of the things are hard for me to understand and i need a little help for me to give the paper work and i always needed help to maintain the learning i need to have .
-1	I believe I am able to fully do research needed to explain things I may need more information on health information and services. I will ask questions, ask family members, and will do research online.

1	I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information and services.  The challenge comes in when the doctors assume that all is understood and speak/move quickly.  Most of the time I am assertive enough to stop them and ask my questions, but at times I don't even think of the questions until I am out of the office or the doctor has already left the room.  Bedside manner isn't always top notch either.

When this happens i try to ask them to explain in more detail so that i can comprehend what is going on.  I feel confident in filling out medical documents/forms when needed. But, again if there is any confusion i just ask for it to be clarified.  Now, at the pharmacy, i don't always ask all the questions that i should. I usually refer any questions about medication back to my doctor/nurse. 
1	I usually understand information. I ask questions when I need to. I also look up whatever is discussed online to get more information. 
1	I can comprehend words and I know how to ask questions. The rest if this will not pertain to the question because I answered it and don't know how to stretch it out

-1	I think I can obtain the information I need. My issues are when they use medical terms that people outside of the field donât understand. Googling the term doesnât always work as some terms have contextual meaning. 
1	I did not always have health insurance, but shortly after Obamacare passed, I went to the private market to get my first health insurance policy. From the information at the website and the documents they sent me after purchasing my policy, I was able to fully comprehend exactly what my policy covered, where I could use it, and more. I've only had to use it once in the 8 years or so since I've had, but I was sure to get my questions asked regarding my policy at my doctor's office and everything went smoothly.
-1	"I have the capacity to process the information but many health providers do not provide much information regarding health issues and seem ""bothered"" by questions. Most of the time I have to request a print off of the info and just use google to answer my questions."
1	I can the capacity to learn anything I need to learn, process, and understand. Whether I fully understand or not it's my right to make decisions on my body whether I want to take something or have a surgery or not but it wouldn't be for a lack of understanding what's going on. 
1	I'm not dim, nor am I senile. I can understand very well what I need to, and I have a help line that I can call twenty four hours a day. Plus there is always  the internet at my disposal anytime I need to find information.
1	I am Certified billng & coding specialist with medical administrative assistant certification. Have training that allows me more resources if I need them to find the answeres to questions
1	I am extremely knowledgeable regarding my health care, since I was diagnosed with Lupus in 2009. I rarely have a problem understanding material, idf i do I ask for explanations.

-1	I pretty much understand most of the time, sometimes I do have to ask extra questions.
1	I have enough knowledge from the doctor or from internet sources to be able to make health decisions. I have one sister who is a doctor and another sister who is a nurse that I can ask too. 
-1	I feel very confident about my ability to make health decisions. All of my doctors belong to the same health system and have access to my medical records.  This is useful for when they need to prescribe something - they have immediate access to see what else I'm taking to be sure something new won't interfere.
-1	I have the general capacity to do so. But there are mitigating factors. I have issues with anxiety and I sometimes feel too anxious to ask questions I need to ask or to bring up topics I need to discuss. On the other side, medical professionals are often rushed and sometimes distracted. So sometimes I don't have time or opportunity to discuss the issues I'd like to discuss. Also, occasionally, I have been clear and direct in my conversation and had the medical professional sort of blow right past the issue.
1	I feel I have the capacity to accurately address my misunderstanding and to ask appropriate questions to resolve those issues.  I can adequately fill out any and all paper work that is necessary.
1	I understand everything.  This is a weird question.  I have no more to tell you about.  What more can I tell you?
-1	From the age of six, when my father carried me into an Arkansas emergency room, I have been intrigued with medicine.  Although my major in college was in Business, the desire to work in the medical field was always on the back of my mind.  At the age of 42, I enrolled in some basic medical classes, just to see if I would really enjoy the subject.
1	I feel that I have the ability to process and understand medical information to a great degree. It certainly helps that I have a spouse that works in healthcare that helps me understand any items that I don't fully comprehend.
1	I have great capacity. I have no trouble understanding the medical language. I have no trouble asking questions if need be.
1	I think I can make appropriate health decisions because I'm always willing to ask questions and if I don't personally agree with a treatment option, I challenge it or get a second opinion. It's my health, and I have the right to ensure I'm getting the best possible care. 
-1	I feel at though I have the basic capacity, I need help.  The issues are so complicated and important, I always fear that I am not getting the whole picture, and really appreciate having someone around who can help explain and ask questions.
-1	"The problem is a lot of information is put into pamphlets to look good or really be read by people who already have a good understanding of medical lingo. I dont need a word that uses every letter in the alphabet twice. A lot of stuff uses too much lingo and can make you feel inadequate. Makes you not want to ask the question because ohh this person doesnt know what ""dnkfnepehdnlopidkodnghineocian"" means. Why are you wasting my time if you dont know that. If I cant pronounce or read the word then I am not going to ask about it at the office."
-1	As far as basic information, I think I can do OK.  I don't currently have any medical conditions and have not had any serious ones so far.  I am alright at looking up information online, but I know not to immediately think that my condition is too serious since most symptoms have some rare disease or issue that is fatal or life threatening.
1	I have great confidences that I can process health information. If anything is unclear I will simply ask about it to make sure its clear. 
1	I am confident that I have the intellectual capabilities to understand any information presented to me about my health care. 
1	I generally understand what is said to me. If I need extra help afterwards I search on the internet to find information.
1	I've had a lot of experience with doctors and hospitals, etc.  I generally don't need any assistance but am not afraid to ask.  People come to me for help with medical issues.
-1	I feel like I'm pretty god at understanding my medical conditions and history. I'm young enough that I don't have a ton to deal with.  I will ask the doctor when I visit if I don't understand something.
-1	The internet has made it easier to look up information about many minor health conditions.  It is the life threatening ones as well as the proper procedure to recuperate from treatment for these diseases and conditions (ie avoid infections) that I would need to ask questions to the professiols.  
1	I feel fairly confident in my abilities regarding health and medical information.  I ask any and all questions I need to in order to understand the information being given to me and I'm not afraid to question a doctor or nurse regarding their information.  I am eager to learn and the health and medical fields have always interested me.
-1	Because I have some cognitive issues, there are certain times I need help to understand new information.
-1	I feel I pretty good understanding when I talk to a doctor about 90% of the time.
1	Regardless of my tendency to try to not make any waves I am an intelligent person and am able to grasp and understand things quickly.

But overall I feel that I am capable of getting and understanding any information I need to make informed health decisions.
-1	I have the full ability to answer, process, and obtain basic health information. I sometimes get confused because the medical jargon can be such that it's difficult to process, especially be pregnant - there are a lot of terms I'm unfamiliar with.

-1	I am very competent at understanding this kind of information for myself. if anything, speaking with doctors is the part I find challenging because they can be confusing and misleading sometimes.

1	I think I have a good grasp on everything I am told in my doctor visits and any other visits to a healthcare professiol. If I have any problems with reading information that I'm given, I feel confident that I can ask the doctor or other professiol and they will give me a good explation. I also do a lot of reading and research on my own about medical conditions I have and what I can expect in the future due to these medical conditions. I do reading and research online and I also ask people I know who have the same medical condition(s) as me about their experiences. Using all this information, I feel really good about the questions I need to ask my doctor or areas where I need further explation and information. All of this also makes me feel confident about any decisions I need to make about treatment options. 
1	I feel I can understand medical directions because I've had a lot of expeirence doing so. I also had a mother who is a R.N. nurse who can help me if I needed it.
-1	I feel like I have the capacity to get, process and understand basic health information and services that are made available to me. Even though I don't have access to healthcare services, I always felt like I had such an option when I did have access to enough information to make sound health-related decisions. I was able to ask questions about my health and get adequate answers.
-1	I do understand some things but I always take someone with me to better understand.I feel between the two of us we can usually figure out what was said.

-1	I have the ability to do that. I am capable of taking information from a medical professional and being able to carry out the orders of the professional who issued the orders.
-1	I dont understand alot of it. I do not think they are truthfull in what they say per my experience. WHen you ask for them to clarify they just go on and on and I still dont understand.

-1	I dont have a problem asking for more confirmation or to get further understanding - the doctors most of the time seemed annoyed.
1	I have access to my lab reports, visits online. Sometimes I don't understand the lab tests, but I can call the doctor's office for answers.
-1	I have a basic understanding of how to make appropriate health decisions. But sometimes there are conditions that I could use help to better understand in order to make smart decisions, but doctors are I  such a hurry to get you out of the door you're more likely to get an answer by Googling, and even then results are dubious. 
-1	i always attend to my needs so i go to the doctor .i get alkl the pills everything i need aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

1	I feel like I understand basic questions amd conditions and I'm comfortable enough to ask when I have concerns 
-1	Sometimes I feel the need to research information outside of what the nurse or doctor provides. They're not always thorough when they explain conditions or health concerns. They're especially vague about medications. I don't feel it is enough to just explain how and when to take medication. I should be thoroughly informed of possible side effects before it is prescribed. Once a medication is prescribed the doctor always seems reluctant to change the prescription regardless of the side effects. Many times I have to choose between continuing a medication that has terrible effects and is sometimes ineffective to treat a condition or discontinuing it altogether. When that happens the doctor thinks I am simply not following their recommendation when it is really due to bad side effects that I cannot live with. I am capable of understanding and following the doctor's instructions but sometimes they don't understand why I am unable to continue with their recommendations.

1	I think I have full capacity to do these things.  I'm a competent person who understands medical and technical material and I'm perfectly capable of making my own informed decisions and getting information that I need.
-1	I feel as though I have a very good understanding of medical processes and health decisions because I do my research and know the general jargon that these professionals use. I tend to do research on things I don't understand so that I know what decisions to make. 
-1	I think I understand very well and google a new word that may come up.  My family has many medical problems and I feel very comfortable talking to drs.

-1	any answers needed can be obtained through research online if person answering the questions aren't being entirely understood.
1	I usually have no problem understanding what I am told. If I need to, I can usually get the doctor to explain it to me in a way that I understand. The doctors I have had are usually really good at explaining things in a way that I understand, so I rarely have trouble with any information.
1	If I have interest in finding out more about my health problem, I often search the internet before going to the doctor, and prepare myself with questions. Then I ask my doctor and try to get the best and most thorough answers. I ask her to clarify if I don't understand. I feel I am persistent and smart enough to ask the right questions and get answers from different sources/doctors if I need to, in order to make decisions for myself.
-1	I definitely am able to make my health decisions appropriately. I mostly understand the medical information. And when I donât I know how to find the answer online or ask a medical proffesional
-1	I feel like I have a really hard understand a lot of the health information and services. They use a lot of medical terms that I'm just not familiar with at all, and I  have a pretty difficult time compregending them.I also have a hard time finding out where to get this information, or who to talk to, or how to get something specific done. A lot of the time I just don't know where to look.
1	I can totally understand and process information. I have no problem understanding health information as I read up on things a lot.  What I don't know I look up information or ask.
1	I have the right to ask because itâs dealing with my health. You got to understand whatâs going on with you and itâs okay to ask even if you donât know whatâs going

1	As long as I hear what is being said I understand perfectly, but since I am hearing impaired sometimes things are not clear and I need them repeated.  
-1	I believe I am capable of understanding basic medical concepts.  I do get confused when medical professiols use jargon that I am not familiar with.  I do have a little more experience than some because my daughter had a major illness that required extensive medical attention for almost 3 years.  I do admit that when I am confused, I am sometime too embarrassed to ask for clarification.  
-1	I feel like I can communicate with a doctor about any health problems I might have, but my issue comes in with trying to understand everything.  Also sometimes you get materials that you can take home with you to read, and I feel like those materials just make me more confused.  So while, I may not understand everything, hopefully the doctor knows enough to properly evaluate and treat me.
1	Being a laymen, but having alot of information at hand, i would put myself at about 80 percent.
-1	I feel that I keep up to date with reading about conditions and always know I can obtain extra info from family and friends!

-1	I feel like I have the capacity to fill in any paperwork regarding medical needs all by myself. I don't really feel like those questions were very applicable to me at this point in my life.

1	I am capable to understand and process basic information. Anything I don't understand, my sister is a doctor so I can refer to her if needed

1	I think I get the information I need but I can't say for certain because I don't know what I don't know.  In general, when I'm visiting with my physician I feel free to ask questions and will often paraphrase what I've been told and repeat it back to the doctor or nurse to make sure I've understood it correctly.
-1	Most of the time I understand what is happening with my health, therefore my level of capacity to understand is reasonably high.  I do, however, tend to skip the minutia in RX documents as it is not written in layman language.

-1	I feel very capable of processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. However I struggle with obtaining information from my healthcare providers because I'm often intimidated by them and don't want to look stupid by asking too many questions. Or oftentimes, the provider will rush through our appointment so I feel as if I would be bothering them by any more detailed questions. 
1	I understand everything any medical professiol can tell me and ask questions if I don't.
1	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand the basic health information that is given to me. I suppose there are some times when I do not ask all the questions that are necessary but I can grasp the concept of what is being told to me.
-1	I feel like I have a decent understanding of the basic health information but I would like to gain more knowledge so that I can ensure that I am actively participating in my personal health.
1	I have full knowledge in basic health information. I have a degree in a healthcare field so I do not have to ask tons of questions at appointments.  
-1	I feel as thought I have the priciest amount of knowledge to understand information about Heath and make appropriate health decisions on my own.
-1	Sometimes when i see a doctor, i have a hard time processing the info. i can't ask the questions necessary to understand what is being told to me, my spouse has to be with me in the room. I believe it is because i am nervous being there, not because i don't understand them.

1	I believe that I have a relatively good understanding of many medical terms and conditions and the ones I don't I know how to search the internet to find the information that I need.

-1	I have been going to the doctor for my health issues for a while now and I feel I have gotten pretty good at filling out all the proper paper work but I do notice sometimes if I don't right down questions too ask I will become overwhelmed and forget to ask those questions the problem that I find id a lot of doctors and nurses are in such a hurry they make you feel very rushed and it feels like they are not listening to you that is why I always bring someone with me to help me remember everything
-1	I definitely feel I have the ability to understand and process my health information. I am of sound mind and pay attention. I tend to Google medical issues and problems before seeking a doctor, so I often have a general idea of what is wrong with me and even know some of the terminology before they tell me. Even after I am diagnosed, I do a ton of research to get more facts than the doctor would have told me and even hear or speak to others with the same problems.
-1	I ask anything I do not understand. My doctors and nurses are informative and helpful.
-1	I feel like with the terms and complicated medical lingo, I am not exactly sure what some of the meanings entail. Such as If I am diagnosed with a certain condition and need medication X, I don't know what that medication does, what the alternatives are, I don't even know how to pronounce some of these names. I feel like I am able to ask the doctors but can not fully grasp the magnitude of the situation without looking at the whole picture which is difficult to have someone explain to me in one visit. I feel like I need  a step by step diagnostic, of why this happened, what I can do, what the consequences are, what some definitions of the disease are, etc.

1	I feel fairly confident that I am able to navigate most healthcare situations in order to get the information I need.  I have rarely had any sort of complications when going to a doctor's office, pharmacy, clinic, or hospital on the occasions I have had to go.  If there is a question I have, I tend to almost always ask when I am at the doctor's.
-1	I don't need accommodations or help to obtain or process basic health information. However, when I need some specific information usually I find it difficult to obtain it.  Medical pamphlets are general and vague, doctors and nurses are busy.

I then listen to what they say and if I have a question I ask it. If I don't understand, I will try to have them explain it further or better. I then get other information on my condition and then I feel I am comfortable making a decision with the information I have received.
1	I feel like because of my background in Biology and my relatively comfortable health status, I can make appropriate healthcare decisions. I grew up with a mother who worked in the medical field and so I feel like I am able to ask the right questions and understand the answers. I am also able to evaluate internet sources if I need to seek out more information
1	I believe I have a higher capacity to get and understand basic health information and services because I have a degree in Health Information Management and I have worked in the medical insurance and billing fields for several years.  Some of the information can be hard to comprehend when dealing with foreign accents or the complexity of the issue, but can normally be understood after asking additional questions.
1	I feel that when the doctor/nurse/health practice employee explains things in simple terms I clearly can undertstand my information.

I start to have problems when things get explained through the technical terms since I have not been trained in the medical field.

So I make sure to listen carefully,  ask plenty of questions if I do not understand,  and do everything my physicians instruct me to do.

-1	I think I have the the capacity to understand basic health information, but sometimes I don't think of the right questions to ask until I'm home and I realize I should have asked more questions while I was there.

-1	I think that I could understand all of the basics...if I had a disease or some special new circumstances, that might be more difficult.

I have an English degree and teach high school reading, so I am more proficient at the English language than most people. When I do not understand something, I generally Google it to find the answer.

The one thing that completely flies over my head though is insurance. I can never tell if something is covered or not and it's a pain to have to try and figure that out so you don't end up paying a fortune if there is a generic that's cheaper somewhere. In my experience the Doctors and staff I've seen have always been kind, patient, and attuned to my concerns and willing to take a few minutes to explain what they suggest and why. That's really an important part because they don't need to go into all the technical details...just give me an idea of my options and a basic understanding of what they're trying to solve.

-1	"I feel that I have an ability to obtain the needed information if desired through my doctor or nurse, however, I do not always trust this information as they don't always seem to be the most up to date on new medical procedures, new findings, etc. Many times if I were to ask a question or try to obtain further information if they haven't heard or don't feel it's correct will dismiss it without concern just saying ""it's wrong"" despite there being research stating it isn't. I feel that my basic health needs are not always being met by my standards. "
-1	Doctor offices scare me and it is like right before a big test. My mind goes blank. I cannot process what is going on. I would often have to ask the doctor or professiol to repeat what they are telling me. I look like a deer in headlights when I listen to them. It takes me hours afterwards to process what was said.

1	I believe that I can understand almost all of the information I'm told. I would ask questions if I didn't know. If I ever had another question I would look online and see if it is similar. If it is wild I would call my doctor to confirm the information.
-1	I have the capacity to understand the basic decisions that need to be made in health matters. I run into trouble when it comes to weighing different choices that have to be made that could have different outcomes. For instance, choosing between different treatment options with different side effects. When a doctor will not give a strong recommendation either way it can be challenging
1	I feel that as a rule I get the correct information I need whether that be directly from the doctor or written.  Once I have researched any problems on my own, I will contact my doctor with any remaining questions.

The doctors are either too busy or just too short on their answers to provide me with an adequate enough answer. 
-1	I feel like I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions. Regarding forms, I sometimes have difficulty remembering family history and accurately describing symptoms but I try my best. Regarding doctors/medical professiols, I try to prepare questions in advance and ask for explations for anything I don't understand. Generally the most difficult part is getting the doctor to answer some basic questions before rushing out. I don't think they're rude, just definitely in a hurry. If there's still things I don't understand, I'll use google or call and talk to a nurse. I might not fully understand everything, but I trust my capacity to make appropriate medical decisions.
