That pediatrician referred her for testing and she not only got a diagnosis of SPD but a few years later we found out she has autism. If I hadn't pushed my mom to have her tested it she might have missed out on early interventions and her sensory issues would be labeled behavioral.
1	My now ex-husband had a genetic heart condition. Because of this, I had to become knowledgeable about cardiac problems.

1	Whenever I get truly sick for a prolonged period of time or feel it may be serious enough to see a professional I generally do my research first through google, webmd, and other resources so that I have a general idea of what it could be. Even if I'm wrong when discussing these possibilities with my doctor it helps give him a general idea of what it might actually be or helps narrow it down some.

1	When I was diagnosed with thyroid disease and the depression that is often related to the disease did not go away after being medicated and having normal results, I researched and found that I may need an addition medication to help with the absorption of the synthroid. I spoke with my doctor and he prescribed me the additiol medication to help me absorb the synthroid better. As a result, my depression did go away... which could have been due to my request...I also have had other chronic health issues that I am knowledgeable about only because I have been undergoing treatment for decades. I also noticed a friend having neurological side effects from long term haldol use. I told this friend that I thought he may have tardive dyskinesia which, as it turned out, he did...   Other than that I do not believe I have a great knowledge of health or medical issues.

He could only have so much lasix or his kidneys would shut down, too little and he would swell with fluid. Less than a year from that. The exact same thing happened to my grandfather. So I knew the stages that would be happening to him because of the dog's issue. Lo and behold he lived a year just like the dog and passed away the same way as the dog.

Because of all the information I received during that first time, when she had a second febrile seizure two weeks later, I felt confident enough to remain calm, put her on her side, and just ride it out.

1	4 years ago my mom had brain surgery for a tumor. After working in the medical device industry for 12 years I was much more comfortable talking to the doctors and asking questions than my parents were. Doctors are humans and normal folk, I am ok talking and questioning them. I think this is most important, even beyond knowing what to do or how to treat. I knew what questions to ask: follow up plans, treatment pathways, altertive options, long term side effects. And I was able to get enough information to plan.

I thought she was just comforting the little one upstairs, but when I went to check she was on the phone with 911 concerned about allergic reaction.

1	As a child I had something called PANDAS, which is a bad reaction to strep throat that leads to OCD and anxiety. So, now I'm very good at detecting symptoms of strep early on, and always go to the dotor when I have a sore throat, to prevent undiagnosed strep from hurting my mental health.

After a consultation, it was confirmed that he indeed had Asthma.

It worked, he could sing (nothing drastic or terribly clear however, enough that communication was somewhat possible.)
1	I have recently been experiencing very bad insomnia. I discussed possible factors with my doctor, and asked for bloodwork, which came back normal. I started charting my cycle, my alcohol consumption, my diet, and also considering my stress levels. After three months of tracking, I determined that alcohol was the main factor. I stopped drinking alcohol, and my insomnia has gone away.
1	When my grandmother was being examined by a neurologist he made her stand up and close her eyes and try to remain balanced. She could not keep her balance.

1	One time when I was younger I was around a friend that experienced severe burns to their foot.  They instantly wanted to run to put their foot under cold water to cool it off but I told them that doing so could result in a lot more pain than they currently were in and also tissue damage to the foot.
-1	I know almost nothing about medical issue. I usually Google on the Internet or ask a nurse. It always seems complicated

-1	I get migraines so it's interesting to see what causes it

I took a nutrition course at the University that completely open my eyes about healthy eating and has helped become the health conscious person  that  I am today. I believe that nutrition course should be mandatory starting at middle school at least.
1	Well, when my dad was sick, I attended many of his doctors appointments, chemo treatments, etc. with him. I feel as if I picked up a lot during that time. When it came time for my dad to enter the hospice program, I was able to take care of him myself and home, albeit with the help of a nurse and other family members. I administered medications to help keep him relaxed and comfortable. I turned him in his bed to try to keep him from getting bedsores. When he developed shingles, I kept him as clean and comfortable as possible. I understood what medicines he was on and what they were doing to and for him. I knew enough to understand the process that was taking place inside his body. Sometimes I wish I hadn't.

I knew which foods to avoid and which were best for me, and how to exercise to improve my fitness.
1	i have history of self inflected knee problems (sports).  as I was skiing few years back I broke my ACL and tore my MCL.

So I got myself back to my car, drove home, slept a good night with help some pain killers and called doctor the following day, monday for an appointment.
1	My TSH was very high -- it was 8.  My doctor wanted to immediately place me on a medicine to replace my thyroid.  I wanted to research it, and I learned that too much, not just too little, iodine could increase my TSH.  I had been taking 1/16 t. of kelp to get iodine (since I don't use salt), but it turns out that was too much. I stopped using it, and my TSH returned to &lt;1 within a couple of weeks. No medicine necessary.  Also, I was able to reduce my cholesterol to &lt;160 by diet alone -- by following a whole foods, high carb, no added fat, oil-free vegan diet -- so again, no pills, whereas he wanted to put me on pills immediately.
-1	Pretty decent considering my time in the medical field. I feel knowledgeable enough to have a good understanding.
1	I remember learning and reading about how to get rid of tics before going camping with my friend because I had a huge fear about them.

-1	I learned that while pregnant, you can get anemia. I was one of those people and when I was pregnant I had to take a iron supplement or when I go into labor I would have to have a blood transfusion. Luckily I listened to the doctors advice and came out with two healthy baby girls.

-1	I mostly just have stomach problems but people lots of them have the same problem as me but it's still serious
1	I was having lower ab pain. I thought it might be constipation or some other easy fixed issue. I tried several other over the counter meds to fix the issue.

Rather than going at the first feeling of discomfort I tried a few methods myself before seeking medical attention from a doctor.
1	Once when visiting a doctor I was asked if I understood everything and explained everything correctly to my doctor.

1	I was a caregiver for my mother-in-law when she had cancer. So I would go with her to her appointments and I always took along a notebook and made sure to ask questions and write down the answers. It was really important that we understood and remembered everything that was said. I am not sure if this is the kind of answer you are looking for, but I believe that the communication between a doctor and patient is the crucial factor. My knowledge is that I know that I don't know, so I have to depend on my doctor's knowledge and expertise.
1	I recently spoke with a friend about her abnormal period. Since I'm currently going through treatment for the same issue I told her what I had discussed with my Dr. I was able to give her an outline of the options for treatment.

1	Recently my Mother woke up ill and my step-father was taking care of her. He told me that she had a bad stomach ache and that it was probably her gallbladder as he had had gallstones and his symptoms were similar. The two of them were planning to wait until the attack was over and then make an appointment to see her doctor.

She said she would consult with the charge nurse, I told her - why don't you just retake them now, that blood pressure is too high. She retook the blood pressure and he was fine, but I am glad I had the knowledge I did to ask for a re-take.
-1	Hmmmm......I am not actually able to think of a specific incident where major medical issues were a threat or present.
1	I had an auto accident a little over two years ago. I was rear-ended, and although I had no scratches or bruises, I did hit my head hard on the headrest and the rear impact caused pain in my back within the hour.

1	I was on a medication that had a side effect of lowering blood pressure, and my doctor had added another medication at night that also had that side effect, which I was only to take if I wasn't at all dizzy. Since the second medication worked very well for the symptoms for which it was prescribed, I suggested possibly changing the other medication to something else, since it wasn't as good at controlling the symptoms for which it was prescribed as the new medication. My doctor agreed.
1	Three years ago i was diagnosed with severe osteoporosis. All I knew about the disease was that I did not want it. So I went online and researched extensively about the causes, treatments and prognosis.

I then went back online and looked further, using my own research and the expertise of my doctor. We then came to a suitable treatment to best help me.

1	I decided to try to treat some gastrointestil issues by changing my diet completely instead of filling up on steroids that my doctor wanted to prescribe me.

1	I used to work in the medical field many years ago. I have experienced many different health issues over the years, including a couple of rare diseases.

I have very few memories of the accident, but I do faintly recall a serious but calming face as I was gently lifted out of the car. The paramedic held my hand as we traveled to the hospital. I was in the hospital for several weeks and that same paramedic came to visit me almost every day. During my stay, I also got to know the various doctors and nurses in the hospital on a personal level. I remember feeling anxiety about my condition, but not sadness or even fear. It seemed to me that those around me, particularly my family, were more fearful of what might happen to me than I was. I donât believe it was innocence or ignorance, but rather a trust in the abilities of my doctors. It was as if my doctors and I had a silent bond. Now that Iâm older I fear death and sickness in a more intense way than I remember experiencing it as a child. My experience as a child sparked a keen interest in how we approach pediatric care, especially as it relates to our psychological and emotional support of children facing serious medical conditions.

I was able to explain that my grandpa was fully coherent, and that while that is a dangerous level, for him after 20 years of being uncontrolled and almost always over 300, the value that is an emergency has gone up, and whether he is in need of the hospital is more dependent on how coherent and coordited he is.

To this day, I still despise my obg for not listening to me.

Dentist would tell me to not do one of the those ""crazy"" grape diets. Yet that style of eating is the ONLY that reverses extreme acidosis in people. The amount of idiocy and low consciousness medical professiols have about human nutrition and health is ridiculous. I suppose it doesn't help that our food system is poisened with pesticides and GMO, certainly makes it harder for those who TRY, to even get well."

This time, the nurse there was much more concerned than my primary care and noticed that my resting heart rate was also high and I was likely getting dehydrated. This was especially concerning since I was pregnant. I knew I should probably seek a 2nd opinion since I looked up my symptoms and observed that they were worsening.

The best doctors are the ones that listen to what the patient is telling you, and if the doctor doesn't know let him do the research not the patient.  Example  I got staph went into shock.  No one could pick up on that.  That's sad even when I gave a urine tests.  They say so you took a pill and it went away.  No, after the shock it made my whole body ache and still does to this day I am stiff and tired and not what I was before.  Did the doctors ever study and find out what happens to people after staph.

I went in pretty much knowing what the problem was just looking for a solution. 
1	I was told that I am underweight for my height, as such that I needed to eat more. As such I had decided to exercise in regular intervals as well as I did not want to experience negative side effects associated with overeating. So with the help of online resources I formed a meal plan that fits within a recommended nutritional profile/caloric intake for my body size. As with the previous questions it involves some light mathematics and a bit of research, but it is very much worth it knowing that I am in as much control as I can get in the maintenance of my health.
1	When I first made my initial visit to my doctor I came prepared with several questions.

I've never had an experience that I would say demonstrated high knowledge of medical science.

I am able to educate more people on it now that I have some familiarity behind it.

-1	This may seem a bit odd, but my mother was a nurse and once told me that you can judge health by stool samples. As a result of being told this, I would not allow my children to flush the toilet until they were past the age of 10 so I could check their stools each time they went. If they had a loose stool, I varied their diet. If their stool appeared hard, I varied their diet. Also, when they had too much energy, rather than assume they needed medication, I had them exercise - it worked every time. And one other instance, my younger son was slow to talk. An in-law suggested something was wrong. I explained he had no problem communicating what he wanted or needed and, thus, nothing was wrong. I was right; she was wrong.

I mean, I know myself and I knew it was bad. People at work thought I was just calling out for no reason until I brought the note from my doctor, who was going to put me into the hospital if the last of 4 antibiotics tried did not work. It finally took breathing treatment, CIPRO, and getting a swab up my nose before I finally started getting better.

1	"When my late father-in-law was dying of liver failure, I understood what the various symptoms meant in terms of the stage of the disease, and was aware of what would come next, and of his prognosis. For example, I realized that when he developed ascites, that this was a not a good sign and that he probably had limited time to live. When he later developed hepatic encephalopathy, I knew that his time was even more limited, and tried to help my mother-in-law in understanding this (as she was somewhat in denial about the severity of the illness). I never ""second-guessed"" his doctors regarding his treatment, I just wanted to understand what was happening. "

1	When taking care of my children my wife and I try our best to research their health and provide the best care for them.  For smaller items and conditions we will research solutions and provide care ourselves.  If it is something more than we can handle we will take them to a medical professional for care.
