The medical profession no longer practices ""the art of medicine,"" but instead treats patients with mandated bureaucratic protocols: RA treated with Prednisone, leads to Prednisone-induced diabetes, diabetes requires wound care, wound care requires continuous antibiotics, which cured the RA.

0.844400	"I feel capable enough to understand everything that is given to me, and sometimes go beyond the materials that are given to me by my physician, as I feel that sometimes these materials are ""dumbed down"" for the general public, and I prefer to get more scientific, in-depth information about health and illnesses."

0.916700	I feel very confident with my answers, mostly because if I don't understand something I am very good at looking it up on the computer. But I mostly comprehend what they tell me. Also I am like a very smart person.
0.650000	If I dont understand fully what the doctor says I do alot of my research online .Some doctors explain things in medical terms which is not easy for me to understand. But by asking questions from family or going online I can get more answers.

0.600000	I have the capacity for the most part but every now and again I find myself needing some assistance with not just filling out paperwork but even understanding pill bottles and other medicine. It can be mentally draining but something I've accustomed to. For the most part, I understand what I need to but it doesn't mean I don't need the help every blue moon.
0.766700	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain and understand health information.

0.822222	I feel like I am well able to understand medical information given to me Sometimes I have to have medical terminology explained in terms that I can understand.
0.261100	I feel like there is too much information and too many words. The font is also really small with little space to write. I also hate it when I have to rewrite things that I have already written. Why can't it be easier? 
0.750000	I feel like I have a good understanding of basic health, I'm also not afraid to ask stupid questions or ask a question more than once or ask it a different way so that I understand what I am hearing. My mother in law is also a nurse so if I don't understand something she can usually break it down into something i understand.
0.838900	I feel like I'm more than capable of understanding basic health information. If I don't understand some parts, I ask my doctor to explain in normal terms. If I'm still confused on it, I go home and study it.
0.900000	I have the complete capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health info and services.  I ask many questions, read all I need to read to understand my situation and all options available for my treatment.

0.688889	I just feel really weird to not have ad ad it really weird to make it happened in the world terrible account in this earth
0.866700	I am fully capable of understanding and obtaining my basic health information. I can do so in person and also online with my healthcare account. It shows my lab results and general health information.
0.777800	I feel as if I can understand the basics of what is said, but occasiolly the use of the technical terms can get confusing compared to what most people would call a condition. Most forms are very simple to fill out though. 
0.866700	I think I can do this very well. I have done it in the past to great success. I think if I had any trouble grasping it, I could get clarification from a professional or online myself. It wouldn't be too hard to get obtain, process, and understand basic health info.

There have been times when I have been reviewing a medical report of mine where I didn't understand the language.

0.916667	I work in a healthcare facility and I am not afraid to ask questions or let them know how I am currently feeling. 
0.866700	I feel that my capacity extends as far as what I feel comfortable with. These health questions and decisions, I feel, are rarely out of someone with a normal high school education's capacity to handle. I feel that if the health decision is not to the best of my judgment, then I will seek the appropriate health professional. I also feel that most health care professionals would take the time to better explain to their patients, if there was some kind of misunderstanding. This would in turn lead to a more patient/doctor trustworthiness, which would benefit the overall performance of the hospital.

Of course I donât know everything, but when I myself need to go to the doctor Iâm not afraid to obtain information, understand it, and Iâm confused or have questions, my doctor is very well in explaining it. I sometimes consult with my family in important decisions, but other than that Iâm very good in making appropriate decisions when it comes to my health, and what is between me and my physician. 
0.850000	I have some experience in a health-related career. I feel fairly well-equipped to understand common terminology, as well as some of the more common services that a provider would recommend.
0.866667	I always ask questions until I'm confident that everything has been explained to me, and I understand everything.
0.916667	I have superior capacity to comprehend and process all medical information I receive to make appropriate health decisions.
0.666700	I think I have a good grasp, but sometimes the physicians differ in their abilities to convey information in a way that is useful to me as a patient. I find medical forms a challenge as I am dyslexic and also an immigrant. I usually have my husband read them over or fill them out for me.
0.794444	I have the capacity to the highest degree. I research and investigate to ensure I get the best care available.
0.883333	I feel quite confident that I can understand basic health information because I am not afraid to ask questions of the physicians and staff.  In fact, it is imperative that we, as patients, ask any and all questions for our own health and be able to understand what is going on with our body systems.
0.816700	I feel comfortable understanding and making decision regarding health information. If there is something that is unclear I will ask for further information or a better explation. Also I will ask the opinions of my friends and family.
0.822222	I believe that I have the ability to do so.  I am a reasonably intelligent person, I have access to the necessary research materials via the Internet, and my wife was trained as a biologist and can help me through those parts that I might find difficult.
0.866667	I am totally capable of understanding and processing health information. I also consult with my physician friends I f in doubt. I am capable of using the internet as well to get further clarification.
0.705600	I feel as thought sometimes I understand the information 100% and other times I feel completely lost. When I feel as thought I understand everything that the doctor and nurses are telling me, it's because I did my own research before I even stepped foot into the doctors office. When I'm told something I know nothing about, it's hard for me to understand completely because I know nothing about the medical field.
0.800000	i am not that old for me not to understand what the doctors trying to say. i am having trouble to read their writings but pharmacy can do it for me. so i am certain that i can get what i needed
0.800000	I think I am capable to obtain, process, and understand basic health information for making health decisions 
0.672200	When it comes to basic health questions. I struggle with trying to remember past concerns and history of previous diagnosis'.

0.688900	I think I have the ability to communicate with my doctor and explain to him the things that are going on. Whether it is headaches or some other problem, I can give him the symptoms and he takes it from there. I can then listen to what he says and ask follow up questions. 
0.916700	I feel I have a great ability to obtain, process, and understand these things. My mother was an RN (now head of a health department), my grandmother was a PA, and I've grown up around doctors all my life. That's probably a bit of a unique position. I would say that it's much more difficult for the average person. 
0.900000	Though I am not a doctor or a nurse, I worked in an environment related to medical, and I learned some knowledge by myself, so I am very confident to make appropriate health decisions.
0.916667	I am extremely capable of understanding, processing and obtaining basic health information and services.
0.744400	I believe that I have adequate health literacy. College has helped me learn this, especially since my major is Public Health Education. I do sometimes blank out when filling forms, though, and often ask my mom for help. I sometimes do not tell all of how I am feeling. I sometimes do not understand what the doctor says, but just let them go on with it.
0.816700	I feel like I have the ability to ask questions and get clarifications, but I always feel like they want me out of there as quickly as possible and as if they don't really care about me. I feel like I'm being patronized and as if they think I'm stupid for not understanding the first time. I also kinda feel like I'm whining when I say something hurts, because it seems like there are other people that hurt way worse and so I'm just being too sensitive.
0.600000	I believe that I can somewhat understand what Doctors tell me but I still prefer for them to write it down.  Often times, when a Dr originally tells me something I struggle to understand but after asking them to repeat I often understand it better. The internet has been a large help in allowing me to understand medical information.
0.722200	I feel like I am fully capable of making decisions upon and understanding basic health information.  I feel that I can grasp most concepts myself, if not there is usually a nurse or doctor willing to answer any questions. Additionally, I have access to the internet via smartphone, so I have essentially all of the knowledge in the world at my fingertips if need be.
0.883300	To a large degree, I feel confident in my capacity to obtain, process, etc. health info. My wife is a registered nurse, and if I ever find myself at a crux, I can rely on her to aid me.
0.833333	I am perfectly capable to understand, process and make health decisions for myself and help loved ones.
0.738889	I mostly understand but ask a lot of questions.  I have trouble with memory so I often need written information.
0.916700	First of all, I don't get sick that much.  I usually only have bronchitis and seasonal allergy so my condition is pretty simple. If at any given time I don't understand I will try to ask question or research it afterwards. For myself personally, I don't have any issue.  On the other hand I have to care of my love one and sometimes I could come into terms that I do not understand then I will request the health care provider to give me a simpler explanation.
0.611100	I have no issues comprehending my medical issues.  If a health care provider can't answer my question the internet usually can.
0.794400	I believe I understand the information presented to me enough to make my own decisions. I've only gone to the doctor offices a few times however not enough to know everything. If I don't understand something I make a point to ask for further details.
0.516667	god favored me no matter what my situation looks like God will always have my back that's why I put my full trust in Him and Him alone
0.588900	Well, I'm not mentally disabled. I therefore *can* do it. I don't sometimes understand medical terminology, which for some reason medical personnel seem wont to use when speaking to non-medical personnel, and often I can't be bothered to have a conversation about it. If it seems important, I'll make the effort; otherwise, it doesn't really matter.
0.761111	I have a degree in electrical engineer. I often deal with complex matter.

0.655600	When i am with the doctor or nurse i ask as many questions as i can. I want to know as much as i can know before i leave their office, because when i get home  it is so hard to find accurate information regarding a medical condition. I can look online but the internet has to much or incorrect information. Asking a friend or family member to help is not always the best information and mostly can be biased i think. It almost like every form needs to have an instruction book to come with it.
0.761100	Yes, I have basic comprehension of medical questions and can fill out my own forms and understand directions for medications, etc. Some medical terms are hard enough to pronounce, let alone know what they mean so I need clarification on that at times but am comfortable asking questions if I am unsure about anything.

0.755556	I've learned a lot about my health in the past year and have worked closely with my nurse practitioner. I have been dealing with anxiety and having panic attacks was something very new to me. It felt like I was having a heart attack daily and talking to my nurse practitioner about everything in my life and when I should start feeling my medication start kicking in.It was a learning process because I had to try a few different medications until I found one that didn't give me side effects. Having all of this happen over a year ago has made me take charge of my health and start to fully understand everything I do need to know.

0.811111	I have been  blessed with doctors and nurses who take the time to make sure I'm comfortable with whatever's going on with me.

0.572200	I think I have basic understanding of my medical conditions but I wish I was more educated about how my body works, more importantly how and why my body has certain issues that negatively effect my life.

0.505600	I do not have a the capacity always to get all the help and information I need.  I bring someone with me to all doctor visits or hospital visits so they can help me to fully understand.

Therefore, I am not afraid to speak up and ask the doctor/nurse about any issues I have and about medication, side effects, etc.  If I don't like doctors who don't listen to you or don't bother to explain.  I will not go back to a doctor who behaves that way, it just shows they don't care.
0.861111	I ask questions till I get it all, no matter how long it takes, I feel very confident, before anything is done

0.800000	I feel very confident in understanding the science of medications and medical problems.

0.761100	Sometimes I do understand things give to me by doctors or anyone else in the medical field.
0.900000	I am able to read and process information quite readily; even if the documentation uses technical language, I can look it up on the internet or just ask. I've occasiolly had physicians use highly technical jargon with me, but I will ask them what that means in a non-technical sense. I usually carry a list with me of things I need to talk to my health care providers about, if there are several things I need to discuss. 
0.850000	I am sixty three years old and have been to the doctor both on my behalf on the behalf of many family members with varying (including very serious as well as unusual) medical conditions, so I have had a lot of experience and know the vital importance of obtaining service and processing how to use it
0.916700	I think I have a great capacity to understand basic health information and make appropriate decisions. If I do not understand something I am not shy about asking my provider to explain it in a different way. I am very apt to ask questions or to clarify when things are not clear to me. I also have the internet to look up things I am not so sure about.
0.844400	I feel that I have the capacity to fully understand the information that doctors or nurses relay to me. If I don't understand or I need to obtain additional information I understand how to acquire it.
0.833333	I feel like when I go there, It's pretty quick and easy. Going there and back. I love fishing and more. You got it and more that way. Going to the store back and back. FIlling outmany documents.
0.850000	I can do some things on my own, some others I need help with. It's not always that I could understand medical terms and instructions but I try my best. I access websites, contact my doctor, ask my family, and I just try to be patient when dealing with information.
0.883300	I feel I have enough common sense to ask the relative questions I need to and if not I am able to search and find answers to any other questions I may have when not in the doctor's office.
0.661100	I think that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. This past year I have had to sign up for health care four times due to job changes and it really made me understand what I am getting and paying for. And how messed up our system really is. 
0.766700	I do feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health info because whenever I don't understand something I am the first one to ask for a clarification.  I study the info very often with my husband and we collaborate and anything we don't have a grasp of, we set aside time to understand it. So I am more then confident that I can make appropriate health decisions.
0.888889	I think I have full capacity to understand and make informed health decisions when necessary.  I don't have any medical issues, either mental or physical, that would interfer with doing such.
0.788900	Well my mom had many health issues and I never had a problem figuring out anything.  If need be I would get on the internet and find answers to what I do not know.  That is the same thing that I do now with my children say for example with their vaccines.
0.872200	I feel like I am as capable as the average person of understanding what a medical professiol tells me. I'm not a doctor, so of course there are some things that require further explation, but I can usually quickly grasp the gist of the situation if the doctor uses layman's terms. I usually ask all the questions I can think of at the time when I'm in the appointment, but every once in a while I'll be too embarrassed to bring myself to ask about something.
0.916700	I am a middle aged man who has no problem understanding English. I have a college degree in the sciences, so yes, I can understand technical instructions. If something is unclear I can ask a nurse or doctor to explain it further. I also have a good relationship with my doctor so conversations come easy. 
0.844444	i am very capable and aware of most of the understandings. if not i ask the dr. to be very distinct.

I sometimes worry that I am not being told enough about a condition, but then I reach out to resources on the internet to supplement my knowledge. 
0.733300	I have a background in healthcare from my school and that provided me with a thorough understanding of how to advocate for your healthcare and  ask the right questions to make sure I am capable of understanding what I need to do to improve/maintain my health depending on the purpose of my visit to a healthcare professional.

0.688889	I generally understand but need sufficient time with the doctor. I sometimes need help making sure I understand everything. 
0.900000	no problem I have full mental capacity though I don't have a college degree, I am an intelligent person who is interested in learning new things to improve my health
0.866700	I believe I have full capacity to fully obtain and understand health information. I am confident I could make the appropriate decisions about my healthcare based on the information that is readily available online or through the doctor.
0.883300	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health info and services needed. If I feel like I don't, I can call the doctors office after I leave if I have additional questions and/or concerns. Or call the nurses line if it's after hours and talk to them and see if they might know. 
0.900000	Yes, I understand what they are saying to me and will ask the questions that I feel are relevant to our discussion
0.455600	I don't feel as if I have the capacity to obtain and understand basic health information greatly. I constantly need help in understanding basic health information. 
0.672200	I feel like I can get by fairly well. I always ask my doctor questions, and when there are things on forms I don't understand (or I have a nurse help me). I don't understand everything on medical papers, but I think I know enough to gauge health decisions.
0.916700	I am reasobly informed about health issues I encounter from time to time. It makes easy for me to act on medical advice I get from my doctors. 
0.900000	I have a background in science and engineering and I've taken courses about health and stuff so I feel very confident about my understanding. Doctors are people who are very considerate and can explain things in ways that I can understand anyway.
0.833300	I am a pretty smart guy with decent insurance and family in medical fields, so I wouldn't have much trouble obtaining this type of information.  I am also not afraid to ask as many questions as I need to in order to fully understand any medical questions.
0.916667	I understand everything that is explained to me. I usually do not need further explanation. I do, however, ask a lot of questions when it comes to my daughter. I like to know what is going on with her health at all times and I make sure I understand what the doctor(s) tell me. 
0.916667	All this information is saved into my phone and backed up to the cloud I have no reason to talk to any if them anyway
0.616700	IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT I WANT TO ASK WHEN I GO TO MY DOCTOR, EVEN WHEN I WRITE IT DOWN.  MY DOCTOR DOES NOT SEEM TO WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH ME. JUST LOOKS AT HER COMPUTER THE WHOLE TIME.  I FEEL LIKE I AM BOTHERING HER. WHATEVER MY PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE, SHE WILL GIVE ME A PILL FOR IT.
0.844400	I feel very confident in my ability to receive and process basic health information.  I am pretty familiar with medical terminology and the medical industry, enough that I do understand the medical advice given to me by physicians and nurses.
0.827800	I feel that I am quite competent in regards to understanding health information that is given to me. I worked in a hospital for many years and am comfortable around nurses and doctors. When I do not know something, I ask questions but I also do research at home on my own and then ask more questions if needed.
0.888900	I feel very capable of understanding health information.  I have a science background and read many books about health, disease control, etc.  I do believe there are racial disparities in health care that affect my access to the information, testing, etc., that I need, but with respect to understanding information, etc., I usually have no problem.  
0.816667	pretty well, when everything is explained. I think that is what is important for a paiteinet to be able to understand, and if the doctor and the people in charge of telling you does a  good job then i don't think people will have problems in understanding the information given,
0.805600	I feel pretty confident that I have the ability to understand basic health information that's given to me and to make decisions for myself. I don't always feel confident that doctors are giving me the right information though or that they have taken the time to understand my issues.
0.916667	I feel I have full compability to make all appropriate health decisions  I have no problems with filling out forms or obtaining health information
0.827778	I am pretty sure I can do it but when I am told about a med or something I need to get over the counter I forget what it was or how to say it so I have her write it down for me.
0.883300	i have full capacity to do this. i'm not afraid to ask questions and am proactive.
0.872222	I have always asked questions if there was something I didn't understand.  Doctors and nurses are very helpful to explain things.
0.750000	Every doctor or nurse I've been to has always explained things to me without me asking them.
0.866700	i have the capacity to understand health information and services since I went to college and listen extremely well and I don't hesitate to ask questions. I will often research beforehand so I can ask questions to the doctor.
0.916667	I am highly confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.838900	As far as past experiences go I have always had the capacity to understand.  I feel somewhat confident that I would always be able to do so, however, if I developed something that was out of the ordiry, I might find myself uble to understand.
0.855600	I feel confident, but most likely because I haven't had to deal with any major health issues yet. I find that the internet is a very vast source of information, that can supplement a medical professional's advice in terms of what to do regarding treatment or diagnosis. I feel as though I have ample access, as well as everybody else living in the modern era, to access vast wells of knowledge whether it be via the internet, through word of mouth, or through the expansive network of medical institutions which seem to be always open. Even if you can't get an appointment right away, there seems to always be alternate options.
0.661111	I feel im able to understand most of it. But i dont understand all of it. I sometimes have my daughter read the items to me. To help me understand it.
0.916667	I may be 74 years old, but so far, my mental capacity is excellent. Of course, it's easy to find out more information nowadays if one needs to do so simply by using the Internet. 
0.872200	I feel very confident that I can obtain and understand basic health information.  I usually feel comfortable asking the needed questions to better understand my doctor and if there's any suggestions to improve my health.  I am willing to try what my doctor thinks is best, and use whatever resources are available to me.
0.672222	I feel like I can do it myself without any help. Its not a hard process and I make sure I talk everything over with my dr first
0.916700	We live in the internet age so I have all the information. Really, I have the exact same information any doctor on the planet would have. If I don't feel like spending a lot of time looking into a specific issue myself, I have no problem with asking the professiols.
0.755600	"I feel like I have a pretty high capacity to obtain and process health information. Thankfully, I've lived a very healthy life and haven't had all that many interactions with healthcare professiols. But I owe that in part to my interest in health, exercise, and nutrition on a hobby level. I've studied a variety of health topics simply because it interests me; over the years I've read dozens of books on health and nutrition, disease, and pharmacology. I'm a curious person that likes to know how things work, and the human body happens to be one of those things I like to learn about. I read a number of health related blogs, occasiolly listen to health related podcasts, and have even dug in to scientific papers in medical jourls before. So I have much more background information than the typical person - nowhere near that of a medical professiol of course, but I can ""talk the talk"" better than most on a variety of health related topics, I believe. If anything, I'm more confused by the bureaucratic side of things. Insurance plans and coverage, law and tax related issues etc. are about as complex as the human body itself these days. I can't quite get myself as interested to learn more about that, but I know if I needed to research details of my plan or my options, I'm confident I could find and process that information too."
0.916667	I think I am perfectly capable of understanding how to make health decisions. I have no trouble reading or writing and I'm more than comfortable asking questions. 
0.883300	I think I have the knowledge and ability to understand health information and services. I have an education in public health, which gives me the background information I need to make informed choices. I'm also comfortable asking questions.
0.816700	I feel like I have a medium capacity to get and understand basic health information. I can fully comprehend health information as I am in school for a healthcare field.

0.400000	I really never understand most of what the doctor is saying about my condition. I feel really stupid for asking questions about it because when I do ask questions I get the vibe that the doctors think I'm stupid. I sometimes will ask a few questions but by the end I am shaking my head like I fully understand when actually I have no clue. 
0.766700	I feel like I can understand most medical forms that I have to fill out at the doctor. I can understand the pamphlets that the makeup. But I don't feel like I get enough information to understand test results. Even if you ask for a copy, it is in jargon that normal people can't understand.

0.900000	I feel that I have the capability to understand the written material that is given to me when I go to the doctor. Although there are a very few times that I don't understand but I seek help, usually at the front desk of the doctors office and they explain to me in detail. It is very important to me that I understand all the medical papers about my health because I want to make sure I take the correct measures in case of an illness. I would not want to misunderstand and later on deal with a worse health issue. I would rather ask even if it means asking a lot of questions.
0.666667	I understand most information given to me about my conditions and medications, but billing and insurance forms are very confusing to me. I often ask for help with things like that.

0.755600	Yes, I guess so. Basic information is no problem. Basic information about my health issues is easy to understand. But health issues don't fit neatly into the basic information. I think I need more than the basic information to make decisions.

0.416700	Most of the time I feel out of place. The explanations the doctors give have such high medical vocabulary that it is difficult to understand what they are saying. I feel I get lost in the middle of their explanation. When something is hand written by a doctor for a prescription it is even worse since half of the time I cant understand what they are writing wether it is the name of a medicine or the instructions on how to take them. The procedures are also hard to understand. It all comes down to the amount of endless information I fell I am given by the doctors. Its too much to take at once, most of the time.
0.572200	I am capable of understanding what the doctor is telling me, if they are giving me basic information about my health.  But when I suffered from a serious condition almost dying and having stayed in the hospital for a month, to this day they never clearly explained why I had the emergency.   I keep having to take test after test that makes no sense to me but they never clearly explain the problem.  I guess they just don't have an answer.

0.811100	I think that I have a good ability to do this. Both me and my wife are very good at doing research online. We are also very open and up front about asking questions and being very thorough. By using all of these traits and skill I feel that I am very equiped to get all the info I need to make health decisions.
0.650000	I beliebe I have a very high understanding and capacity to get these things done on my own. It is very rare that I find myself asing for help in these situations. 
0.811111	I can comprehend  basic health I formation and can make decisions if I have the necessary and correct information.

0.838900	I feel like i am intelligent enough to either understand and ask questions or go and do research on my own to educate myself on things i don't understand. i have been on my own since i was 16 and have had to do these things alone. when you don't have someone to turn to while you are young you learn quick to utilize resources available to you.
0.916700	I feel I have a good capacity to obtain and understand the information given to me. I always explain everything that bothers me, and answer questions honestly. If a question comes up later, or I need clarification of something that was said, I call the doctor back to discuss the matter. My doctors are very good at explaining things in terms that people without a medical background can understand.
0.822222	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand my basic health information and services. Also I am confident making appropriate health decisions.
0.777800	I feel like I am very capable of understanding any health information that providers give to me. However, my recent experience has been that providers may give you conflicting information and may be highly unavailable to answer questions and communicate poorly in general. For example, my husband has high blood pressure and his old PCP said to try to reduce salt, while his neurologist said that salt intake doesn't matter. In our community, we have facilities run by Banner, and our experiences has been that these doctors have poor communication and don't feel bothered to answer questions or return phone calls. 
0.672222	I feel I usually understand  except when the doctor uses big words then I have to come home and look up the words
0.733300	I feel that I have a tendency to take longer to process such matters.  This is not surprising as I am autistic.  I mage to make appropriate health decisions out of sheer persistence more than immediate aptitude.  If I have forgotten a question at an appointment I contact the doctor later, all over again, etc.

0.916667	I can do it all the time, I don't have any trouble with information I can do it all myself with no help
0.833300	I feel like most information is readily available to those who know where to look, or know whom to ask questions to. Google is a great tool. Taking notes or receiving a pamphlet about what is medically going on, you can go home and do proper research. When I'm in the moment of receiving a lot of information, I process what I can and tend to wait till later to ask questions. The more often you receive that medical information, the more likely you're going to understand it subsequently. 
0.866700	I feel very confident in my ability. Especially nowadays, when you can google and read more about any topic, I am sure that I could understand any medical information and make solid decisions. I might feel a little pressured in an appointment where the medical professional didn't have a lot of time to spend with me, but I would just go home and learn more about the topic through research, and call back for more info if necessary. I also have a great, experienced family who would help me understand anything I had questions about.

0.777800	I believe I have a good understanding of health information. Sometimes, doctors try to give a lot of information at one point, but I believe I can understand what they are saying. This is helped by having written material as well.

When I am given information, I still feel like I have to log on the internet and do further research. I usually look up extra information so that I can understand exactly what I have and what steps are need to be taken. I also go back to my document on my clinic's website so I can grab information that may be important to my research. If I panic, I look up forums so I can get some comfort from patients like me.

0.866667	As  long as the wording used is not intricate medical terminology I can usually understand  basic health information.
0.600000	Health information can be very confusing. They do not always write the information so that an average person can understand it. Many times, I have to ask what the long medical terms mean, then I feel stupid. It can get scary, causing even more questions that are hard to understand. Having the internet so handy now does help with searching, but then you find other information that is really scary. 
0.794444	I think im considered fairly functional in filling them out and asking questions. My limits are more physical and mental fatigue and forgetfulness. 
0.622200	I should probably ask more questions when interacting with my doctor. Often they seem busy and I don't want to take time away from another patient with perhaps a more urgent condition.

The minor things you have to fill out when you get to the doctor or that they explain to you during routine or semi-routine checkups I believe I fully understand.

0.916667	I believe that every doctor visit when there is a problem or i need to know something or i don't understand something i always ask the doctors or nurses
0.438900	Health literacy includes numeracy skills. For example, calculating cholesterol and blood sugar levels, measuring medications, and understanding nutrition labels all require math skills.

0.633333	I am under the care of 2 to 3 doctors at any given time. At times I feel like I am being rushed and things aren't explained to me the way I need. I can fill out forms, but it seems they aren't read by the doctor. When given a diagnosis, I have to do the research to find out exactly what it means. I can say that my PCP does a better job than my other doctors in taking time to listen to me. I recently had a very bad experience with a surgeon and staff at a prominent hospital/medical facility all over forms. No one would really help me. They just passed me around to different people. I felt discarded.
0.850000	I feel that on my end I have the entire capacity I need.  I will ask for advice of course, but I will make sure I ask every question I need until I fully understand.
0.738900	I feel like for the most part I am able to make the appropriate decisions . If there is something that I do not understand I make sure to ask questions to fully understand it . If it is a bigger decision I take all the information I can from the doctor . I then go home and google and read as much as I can about the problem . I also talk to any and everyone who has went through the same thing . If I am still lost on what is going on I go back and talk with the doctor .

I can usually take the doctors information and try to read and add more facts to what he tells me.

0.683300	I sometimes find it difficult to to comprehend of grasp the terminology used but I either can do further research myself and sometimes ask for better explanations.  My capacity to understand basic health information is probably better than I think.

0.672200	I'm pretty bright and understand a lot, but a lot of times my doctors or nurses don't really explain things to me in detail about my conditions, lab reports, etc. I also forget to ask questions or clarify things when I am there sometimes, because I tend to get nervous. They're always rushing too so it's not like you get a ton of time.
0.683300	I am pretty well versed in medical terminology and knowledge, especially for someone who isn't a doctor. I generally can understand most things well. 
0.900000	I feel I am capable to understand basic health information and obtain services I need on my own. I have access to many resources that can help me, and I can understand these resources on my own without the help of others. 
0.794400	I think in a serious medical situation we are all a bit nervous and anxious, I always go with my parents so I can listen and ask questions and later explain if necessary.  When I go to the doctor I am usually alone and I find it difficult getting the doctor to listen to me, to actually hear what I am saying.  Sometimes I feel like they've just made up their mind and they need me to move along as quickly as possible.  I usually end up just leaving with questions unswered.
0.672200	It takes me some time, but if there's something I need to figure out with regard to my health, I'm usually able to figure it out. Luckily my mother is a family practice doctor, so when I need help understanding health information and services I can usually call her and she'll explain it to me. Sometimes, though, there are things that I don't know and I don't know the right questions to ask to figure it out, so I'm left in the dark.

0.916667	I have a lot of self confidence in filling out any kind of forms from medical to legal as I have a Master's Degree. I graduated with honors and always did great in English and am currently writing a book!
0.627800	I would say so. Doctors sometimes talk in hard to understand ways.It is some times hard to tell if it is on purpose or not. Sometimes you wonder if doctors are about numbers
0.850000	Normally, I have no problem understanding what they are telling me.  Occasiolly, when I encounter someone who doesn't break down medical lingo into easier terms, I do have trouble but don't have any problem asking for clarification.  
0.811100	I feel like I usually have a good understanding of what any medical professiols are trying to explain to me. Often when I do lack understanding I don't realize it until I have left.

0.461111	I just can't understand the doctor writing and I try to ask them the right questions I have a hard time feeling out information because of my health and my hands not working the best do to the surgery I had of my spinal cord
0.777800	I feel that i have a basic understanding of medical knowledge. A lot of times I will need help understanding things regarding medical terms if it's something that I'm really unfamiliar with. It can be hard remembering all the information they throw at you at once so sometimes I like to have another person there with me to help out with that.
0.744400	I feel that I am confident that I can get basic health information.  I think if I can't get the answers by asking questions I can look in other areas to learn the information.  
0.744400	Relatively well but often times I feel my doctors just regurgitate what they learned in a book and follow what is in a book often ignoring any pain I have and prescribing me pain medication instead of fixing the problem. Often times when I ask why they will simply dumb down the answer as a categorization of allergies or an old injury without going in depth into the cause when I feel I deserve a longer explation. 
0.916667	Quite well.  I understand how to obtain, process, and understand more than basic health information for not it myself but family members as well.  I have had to explain medical terminology to my parents

0.666700	I think i have a fair degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions because I feel that i am old enough to make decisions on my own and i believe and trust in God in everything i do and decide.

0.644400	When the information is basic and in lamens terms I can understand it enough to have an idea of what is happening. Most of the words they use to identify medical issues are confusing and even the internet doesn't have a clear answer that I can understand. I sometimes ask my nurse friends if they can help me understand it too. 
0.622200	I have the capacity to understand basic health information because I did not leave the doctor without explaining to me everything.  Asking is learning.  There are words that I can't understand that's why I always ask the doctor what it is just to clarify everything.
0.566700	I feel that I have the basic services needed to help me to understand health information that I may not necessarily understand on my own. Services in my hometown and well as my local hospital and pharmacy are always willing and available to ask for assistance when needed and are also friendly as to make asking for help as painless and easy as possible. 
0.916667	Asking questions is the key if you want to know things it's always  important  to ask questions  if you not understand  or ask someone to explain  to you if you don't understand

0.688900	I feel like I am constantly having to look up information about my medical health on my own, like on Google, and I'm having to make sense of it all on my own.

I can't always understand or process all of the information because a lot of times I feel my doctor is in a rush or I don't think of the right questions at the time of service and think of them later. I don't know who I'd contact about situations once I am no longer in front of the doctor.
0.750000	i have to ask the doctors a few questions. the service that i normally get it always great services. my nurse that i go to also help me with all the questions that i have for them. they would tell me what i need to eat right and drink.

0.883300	I can generally understand the information given to me by my physician.  Whenever I am not sure, I will ask him or his nurse to explain it in laymen's terms.  I usually do  research on my own as well, and get a second opinion on methods of treatment I am not sure of.
0.833300	It takes me some effort to get a grasp of medical information provided by my doctors. Some of it is quite confusing. So, I have to trust them blindly without my informed input in the medical decision they make.

0.572200	Doctors are honestly so crabby so I rarely feel like I'm able to process what they're telling me fast enough to even formulate the questions I need to as. Given that, I rarely leave the doctor's office feeling like I understand my health information or what is being recommended for me. For example, I don't understand why I was instructed to get a thyroid test done so I never did it. I didn't understand if it was a light recommendation or if it was really necessary. And in terms of processing, I feel like they're always going too fast for me kind of like I said before.
