-1	I just always feel a little bit concerned that the doctor might find something bad (cancer, a need for surgery, a health condition.)
1	Just the general idea of going to the doctor makes me uneasy.  I do not know why I feel this way but it is always like this.  I even just make the appointment and I get super anxious.

-1	Finding out that whatever ailment I have is worse than I thought it was. I would be terrified to find out I have something like Cancer or some serious disease.
-1	I always expect something major to be wrong.  Haven't had that happen yet, but I just always assume bad news is coming.

-1	I am just an anxious person to begin with so I always get anxious if I feel something might be wrong

-1	I don't really get anxious or worried, I just get bored with the long wait and the hassle of it.  The only time I've felt anxious at a doctor's office was when I was getting my cheek biopsy because they were thinking it was skin cancer (it was). And then the surgery and reconstructive surgeries made me feel anxious because I was worried about scarring.

-1	There always rush of people
1	Mostly relatively minor phobias about things like needles.
-1	I feel anxious about telling the doctor what is wrong.  I'm afraid he won't take my symptoms seriously.
1	Being sicker than I can handle.
-1	sometimes I am scared of the news I may receive. I have a lot of health issues so I get worried. I do not get worried about my doctor, but at the news I may get. 
-1	I always get anxious when going for something that is hurting, or my anxiety because I think that they all think I just want pills or something like that. So, instead I deal with a lot of pain and anxiety, because of the anxiety it causes me to ask about it. Its a horrible anxious loop.
1	I'm afraid that they will try to force me to get a procedure that I don't want. 
1	That I'm not getting the best help possible. That my doctor is so preoccupied with what's wrong with his next patient or the one in the other room that I know he's go back and forth between that he's not paying the least bit attention to what is going on in my room. 
1	They will hurt me in the examination process or will be unkind to me and not believe me when I explain issues I have with my health.
-1	In general I think it is just something that everyone feels when they go to a doctors office.  You are just fearful of what they will say it is just the general fear of the unknown
-1	I'm mostly worried if I have no idea what the problem might already be. I usually have an idea of what the issue is before I go and the uncertainty, when I have it, is difficult.
-1	Just if something is wrong. I don't want to be unhealthy or discover a bad problem. 
-1	Finding something wrong
-1	Having to wait a long time for service. 
1	They will rush me through. There is a large population here. In my small town growing up everyone knew everyone. I went to church with my doctor. Here all they want to know is what kind of insurance you have. Usually they don't take mine. I just don't go and treat myself. I avoid vaccinations and unnecessary treatments. 
1	The waiting times which happen and you are in a check up room alone. 
-1	The long wait at times.
-1	Them finding something out that could be really wrong with me. I want everything to be okay and get a good report.

1	Afraid if there's going be a long wait.
1	I feel the most anxious about getting my blood pressure tested. 
1	They aren't careful. They're in a hurry.
1	When I'm there, I'm worried if he's had a bad day. I feel like that could affect his examition and/or dealings with me. Sometimes I wonder whether or not I'm going to have trouble with my insurance. There are times when I'm worried about how much time I'm spending there, and if my kids are okay where they are. 
-1	I mildly dislike needles, and poking around in my private areas is more annoying than embarrassing, but I get over the annoyance and look away when they do the blood draw.
-1	most likely the unknown of what exactly is wrong. 
-1	Find something that could effect my family or myself in any way
1	I'm worried that something may be wrong with me!

1	I fear the end result or diagnosis.
-1	I only go when I think something is terribly wrong, so I am worried that I might be right and it's not some simple ailment.

1	I WORRY THATY I CANNOT ACCURATELY EXPLAIN SO SHE WILL UNDERSTAND
-1	I am always afraid that they will find something wrong with my health and it will lead to death. It is fear of the unknown.
1	i am just curious. i want to know what help i will need. I also want to know if there is something i should be concerned about
1	I am always worried that the doctor will find something bad.  Even though I know there is nothing I can do about it I am almost convinced every time I go in for a visit I will leave in a worse case scerio 
1	I don't go unless there's something wrong, so I'm always a little nervous about the outcome.
1	Discovering a medical condition that may be unbeknownst to me. 
1	that something will be wrong and it is unexpected.
1	I am very paranoid and I feel that things never work out for me. I always dread and fear the worst,
1	I don't like doctor's offices, needles, or exams. Anything out of my normal routine makes me nervous.
-1	When I am not sure what to expect or am not quite sure what is wrong with me, then I get a little anxious or concerned.
-1	I become anxious about blood draws and injections.
-1	I just am always curious what is going on with my body and I am hopeful that it isn't too serious. I don't know what they are planning once I get into the exam room. So, this sense of unease leads to some anxiety.
-1	im a lesbian. how much will i have to explain after that. what stuopid questions they may ask about birthcontrol, or sex activity, which usually reveals they don't know meaning of word lesbian
-1	I sometimes feel anxious that I will be waiting in the exam room forever, especially when I have other plans after the appointment.
-1	IM WORRIED HE IS GOING TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME EVEN IF I AM JUST THERE FOR A YEARLY PHYSICAL
1	getting bad new about my health, getting a shot
-1	Getting bad news like cancer
-1	No, I never worry.

-1	I am not really anxious about seeing a doctor because I feel it is better to take care of any problems right away rather than waiting for them to get worse.
-1	Just worrying about what might be wrong with me. I hate to be sick, but I trust my doctor.
-1	That there could be something wrong.
1	I worry about whether I am going to die. I believe if I'd had more money I would have had better care. I do not get to choose my Dr. I have to go where my insurance will be accepted and these Dr.'s are always different. I never see the same one twice. A few years ago everyone had a family Dr. who knew them all their lives. No longer. 
-1	Potential of the doctor finding health problems.
-1	That something might be wrong.
1	They probably aren't qualified to do what they do. They are LARPing.
1	I have a tendency to think the worst. I am a pessimist. I think something much worse is wrong with me than ever is. 
1	The cost
1	Being around people, having to discuss problems. 
1	getting scared that there will be something wrong
1	I feel worried because I'm a very secretive and self-reliant person. Visiting the doctor is all about depending on someone else and letting them examine and judge you. I don't trust them not to reveal my persol information to anyone they see fit, even if I would strongly object.
-1	The only thing that really makes me feel anxious is when I'm awaiting test results.  I generally feel pretty calm.
-1	how easily my condition can be treated
-1	I would feel anxious if they did testing and looked at the results and said things didn't look good. 
1	I worry about what is wrong with me. The doctor doesn't make me feel this way, and I am hoping whatever is wrong isn't serious. It's just the whole waiting game I guess.
1	"I don't like most examitions especially the ones that invade much of my ""privacy"" as far as private parts. That always makes me nervous. It's just not a good feeling to have the doctor look at parts that are usually not disclosed unless to an intimate partner."
1	I am anxious that my doctor will criticize my lifestyle or my habits without seeing me as a person. I am worried that my doctor will not listen to me. I am worried that something will be wrong with me.
1	Having someone exam my body and tell me that I'm unhealthy. 
-1	I'm not sure if it counts, since it doesn't actually relate to the actual doctor's office, but the drive over there makes me feel the most anxious.  I have panic attacks when I drive and I really hate to drive because of it.  If that doesn't count, I guess the only anxiety I would feel is if my doctor wasn't in that day since they have three different doctors and I only like him.
1	What kind of tests will they have to do? Will they hurt? Will it be expensive? What if they find something serious? Will I have to have surgery? How will that alter my way of life? Do I have the time in the day to tend to all of this? 
-1	I worry that I won't get the full attention of the doctor and won't get all my questions answered. 
-1	I do not enjoy having someone exam my genital area. Otherwise, it is par for the course.
1	When I have a bad feeling about a test result or something negative that my doctor will tell me. Also, when my doctor doesn't support my ideas or beliefs or doesn't trust me.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor. 
-1	Not knowing what will happen.  Not always taken good care of myself
-1	I DONT LIKE TO HAVE A FINGER STUCK UP MY BUTT
1	The impending case of my pain, or if I may have something I do not know about. 
-1	If I felt I had a loss of life sickness I might be nervous, but otherwise I'm never nervous.
-1	Lack of compassion and understanding. Also, acknowledging the existance of chronic Lyme disease at some point would be nice. 
-1	Being weighed and having my blood pressure taken is usually nerve-wracking. I have struggled with my weight all my life, and the last couple years my blood pressure has not been stable.
1	Having to wait for so long in waiting room. Then having to wait in examition room. My mind wanders and too much free time and quiet is not good when I am at a doctor visit. I don't want to be told anything is wrong with me.
-1	Fear of my health getting worse.
1	That they will cause me more harm than good. 
-1	nothing but the bill.
1	I start imaging the awful diagnosis that he could discover, like cancer. 
-1	The thought of maybe them finding something wrong. 
1	I'm always worried they're going to find a lump or something that indicates cancer or another scary disease that would change or end my life.
-1	Pap smears.  It's just an awkward situation, though what actually gets me is it can hurt LIKE HELL.  I'm pretty good with pain, it's necessary so I shrug it off, but it's certainly not something I look forwards to in any way, shape, or form.
1	That they'll find something really wrong.
1	I usually feel anxious because if I am at the doctors office there is something wrong.  Something wrong means it's going to cost a lot of money.  I don't have health insurance because I can't afford it.
-1	Them finding something bad.  ALso, something that may be uncomfortable physically, like a shot or a procedure.
1	I am worried I will go home still not knowing what is wrong with me.
1	That they will try to give me a shot....I HATE needles. Or that they will tell me something is wrong with me. 
1	Just that I never know what they are going to say. Also that I may not agree with what they say or they may want me to do things I don't want to do. It's just that unforseen things can happen.
-1	idk why but the only thing that makes me a little anxious is having my blood pressure checked. For some reason when the cup goes on my anxiety shoots up and they always have to retake my blood pressure a second time.
-1	Just the fear of the unknown. Not knowing whether the doctor will find somethng wrong with me, and if he does find something wrong, how serious will the condition be. 
1	That they are going to tell me that I am overweight or shame me for my weight. 
1	I'm always anxious for any stranger to look at me in depth like that, whether it's a doctor, dentist, or person on the bus. It's very intrusive and unsettling. I'm also worried that my doctor will give me bad news or even worse will refer me without telling me why and it will take weeks to learn what's wrong with me.
-1	I get nervous about the unknown.  So the until I see the doctor I am a bit worried
1	I worry that they will not help me deal with my health issues but will send me away with no help. I feel that my health concerns are rarely taken seriously enough. 
-1	I worry that something minor will turn out to be something major. I'm not a hypochondriac, and I don't worry about stuff all the time. It's just that health can be complicated sometimes.
1	When I am just waiting for the results from everything.  My mind will keep thinking of the worst outcome until I hear a solid response.
1	I worry that the doctor won't listen to my concerns or do anything to help me, or that he still won't diagnose my chronic health issues yet again.
-1	Nothing
1	I worry they aren't gon be able to help me. I also worry that it could be something bad.
-1	I'm turally anxious, so I feel that way about most new/unusual experiences.
-1	Uncertainty if there will be something really wrong with me
-1	I don't really get anxious or worried when I go to the doctors.  It doesn't make me worried unless they tell me something is wrong with me.
-1	That I will forget to ask something or tell them something that is relevant. 
-1	Just having to deal with answering lots of questions and getting tests, etc.
-1	I don't usually feel nervous or anxious. I am generally calm. 
1	I feel that the doctor is judging me and my lifestyle and will be harsh and critical of my choices.
1	I am worried about a potential health problem that I might have that was previously unknown by me. A lingering disease or illness is a scary thought. I also sometimes worry about the costs. 
1	There's always a chance that they are going to see something horrible.
-1	I have PTSD and have been nervous talking about it, which is the reason I've most commonly gone to the doctor recently.
1	The anticipation of the exam results is the most nerve wracking. There may be something that I wasn't aware about such as cancer. 
1	blood test. I am terrified of needles and the results.
-1	Generally I am worried about the bad news I may receive.  I feel that if I get a bad prognosis then I am doomed to an extremely expensive medical bill as my insurance has a relatively high deductible.
-1	finding out
-1	I have social anxiety. I feel nervous about interacting with the doctor and staff. I feel inferior.
1	I once got diagnosed with diabetes and they wanted me to go on Medforin and I refused instead I relied on altertive therapy and next time I visited the Doctor they had NO evidence of this diagnosis.
1	im worried about cost. i dont want to go to the doctor because it's expensive. thus, when i do go, I'm worried about what he will find and what it will cost.
1	I don't know, I've always had anxiety going into a doctor's office.
-1	Seeing if I have gained weight.
1	What may come out of the visit - such as a bad diagnosis.
-1	Just wondering what could be wrong or what my examition outcome might be.
-1	When I am feeling very bad, I worry that it may be something serious.  Also, having to wait in the lobby and then in the room makes me anxious because I sometimes have to wait a long time.   The exam room has no windows and I sometimes feel claustrophobic. 
-1	I don't like waiting around sick people.
1	Since I'm getting into my late 30's and I used to party a lot when I was younger, I'm always a little worried that it will filly catch up to me.  I worry about it a lot when I'm at the doctor's office.
-1	The waiting period is difficult. It is hard to sit there and wait for the doctor
-1	Nerves in general. No one likes to go to the doctors. But int he long run you know you need to go, even if its for something small. Because that small thing could be something large and if you didnt go something worse could happen to you.
1	Having to pay the cost of going to the doctor. Another thing would be like knowing that the doctor will say that something is wrong.
1	I just get really anxious in general when going to the doctors office. I think it is a combition of something being wrong and I also just don't like the whole waiting environment and all of that. 
-1	I don't usually feel nervous, but I might if I know there's something wrong with me
-1	When I have a health issue and do not know what is wrong with me - when it is out of my control. When I am going in for a regular physical, I do not feel anxious at all.
1	I'm worried about embarrassment, or that something is wrong with me.
-1	I would feel anxious if I was in the office to hear results. If i was in for a regular exam or check up I would not have nerves. 
1	I feel like I am in good health, but there is always a lingering thought in the back of my mind that he will find something wrong.  It's not a strong feeling, but it's there.
-1	Waiting in line, hoping I didn't actually break something. In my wife's case, it was questioning who made the decision to have an OBGYN look at what turned out to not me a problem. I also don't like receiving bad news, which thankfully I largely didn't.
1	I don't like the idea of taking medical tests. I always expect the worst and always thing that my blood work or other related tests will come back bad or that I will be diagnosed with something really bad. I also do not like the very sterile and fluorescent lit environment that Dr offices are in. 
-1	Worrying about whether or not something is abnormal or not. If I will need extra testing or other medication.
1	I worry that I will have bad test results or that I will be kept waiting too long
1	 I am usually nervous or anxious because it just has a cold environment and you're unsure of what's about to happen 
-1	The fact that there is always a chance that they can tell you something is wrong with you
1	Pain. The thought of being truly sick. Feeling potentially helpless. FEAR OF USEA
-1	Only thing I can think of is getting medicine I can't pay for
1	I am most anxious and worried that the doctor will not take my concerns seriously. 
-1	I just dont want to get any bad news
1	The outcome of what ails me. Is it worse than I thought it would be?
-1	NO WORRY
-1	The unknown of how any results I am waiting on will come out. 
1	I think what makes me anxious or worried is a sense of the unknown. I don't know what they're going to come back with. They could come back with some terrible medical problem, even though it's unlikely.
1	Just the worry of what the doctor says the condition coudl be. I'm also always too nervous to ask many questions.
1	Getting my blood pressure taken is what makes me feel the most anxious. I get anxious that my blood pressure will be high, which then leads to my blood pressure being high.  
1	I am most anxious or worried at the doctor's when they take my weight and blood pressure. I'm worried that my blood pressure will be high and that my weight keeps going up.
-1	Just the thought of finding something out wrong.
1	I am worried that the doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. 
1	Being told I'm not healthy.
1	I worry that I will forget past information, that the doctor will not remember what I tell them, or that I will get painful or invasive testing. I worry too about potentially painful or expensive follow up care.
1	I am worried about what they'll find and that they'll say. I rarely see the doctor so when I go, they always find something new that's wrong with me.
1	I have a neuro condition and there are a lot of uncertainties around it. So when I have to be seen for it, it can be a long experience full of many questions. With uncertainties, it causes me anxiety because I don't have a game plan set it stone. If i have a reason why things happen, or a plan, i can deal with it, but when I don't have answers, it makes me nervous.
-1	I feel most anxious or worried that there will be some bad diagnosis but in general I don't tend to worry about this because I have good health.  I would only worry if I had symptoms that were concerning or alarming, and this has never really happened to me.
-1	I would say just not making enough progress on the things I was given advice on last time. It's easy sometimes to hear information in the office, but applying it to daily life can be much more difficult. 
-1	somethiong is wrong with me
-1	I get anxious and worried because I'm always scared this is the appointment where he tells me something is wrong with me. I also am just a nervous persolity.
-1	I think I am generally uncomfortable with visiting a doctor's office. I have never had a particularly bad experience at a doctor's office, but I find going to appointments to be an unpleasant but necessary thing to do. I am also a bit disturbed by having to share breathing space with other sick people in the waiting room, etc...
-1	The potential of my doctor finding that something is wrong with me or that I'm living an unhealthy lifestyle. While I'm generally healthy, I fear that something could change that.
1	I always think the worst possible outcome when I go to the doctor. Because I read all kinds of health information online, I tend to think that I have the illness and my doctor tries to remain optimistic with me and not to think the worst all of the time.
1	I worry that somehow she will find something wrong with me that could be serious. I also get nervous when explaining symptoms to my doctor and then to get overly anxious and sometimes cry. 
-1	I dont get anxious, hes doing his job and will tell me what he thinks. Yeah there could be bad answers like i got cancer or something but for the most part its not that heavy
1	That I will be termilly ill or have cancer. I get scared of the lights as well.
-1	It's awkward and uncomfortable.
1	That they won't be able to do anything to help me, or just won't know how, or won't believe me that anything is wrong. 
-1	I don't think I'm actually a hypochondriac, but my mind always shoots to the worst possible scerio when something is wrong. I'm worried that I'll be too anxious to appropriately describe the issue I'm having and just hope that the doctor figures out what's wrong on his own.
1	Worried nervous
-1	I worry about what the doctors will find. The thought of being really sick bothers me.
-1	If I've been feel pain, I might worry that it might be an indicator of something serious. That situation would cause me the most worry.
-1	I don't like being examined (especially pap smears) and getting shots. I feel most anxious about pain from shots and blood tests.
1	they check me and ask me a lot of persol questions
1	I'm worried about getting bad news. Usually when I'm at the doctor, something is wrong with my health.
-1	Honestly, the only thing that bothers me is the long wait. Besides that.... nothing really makes me anxious...I figure the worst that will happen is I find out I have some kind of flesh eating disease.
1	That staff will be rude or mean. That I will have a condition
1	i worry that they are going to have bad news for me. i also worry that they are simply judging me. i also worry that things will arise that cost a lot of money. 
-1	I don't like drawing blood. Last time I went to the doctor they stuck me three times and couldn't get any because I was so tense. They told me to go to a lab and I refuse to, even if I probably should see my lab results. 
-1	White coat syndrome. just going into the office, and the fear of the unknown.  Finding out something is really wrong.
-1	I have not had any worries when visiting the doctors office.
1	Needles. I absolutely hate them due to having injections into my neck that hurt so bad I passed out. I'd rather have my appendix removed (again) than have those injections done again.
-1	Getting there on time and hoping to not have to wait, sometimes the uncertainly always makes  me nervous.
-1	Other people, like a waiting room that's too crowded. Or people coughing and sneezing. i don't do well with others usually.
-1	Nothing really, I've not had a bad or surprising experience with a physician. The only thing I would worry about is how long is the visit going to take!
-1	I sometimes feel anxious during exams, specifically the well woman exams. I usually just try to breathe and relax, and ask questions when I am unsure of something.
-1	I am anxious when i visit the doctor and I can not pin point why I am. I feel like she is rushed and if I have a concern that day they she is not going to talk to me about it. It sort of makes it feel like pointless to even go in to the office.
1	I always worry if they will make a mistake if its something being done. Also, I wonder if theyll find something else wrong. I worry also that I will make them uncomfortable.
1	I am always worried that I am going to find out something that I don't want to hear. For instance, I am worried I could be diagnosed with a major health issue. Also, I fear sometimes that I will be reprimanded for not properly taking care of myself in between visits. 
-1	I worry about if my condition has got worse. But I hope I hear they have found a cure.
-1	I just don't want to be unhealthy and that makes me anxious. The thought of there being something wrong and how I could afford to take care of myself. 
-1	You never know if the reason you're going in is more serious than you thought it was going to be. Plus it can be a stressful situation, especially if you aren't feeling well
1	"I have what I would call ""doctors anxiety"".  I tend to always get nervous when I go to a doctor.  Once I'm there, and start seeing the doctor, I usually feel better and less anxious."
-1	I think they will try to shove something down my throat.
-1	I think it's just the fear of the unknown. If I'm not going for any particular reason, you never know what they could find that could be potentially bad. It's just a little scary.
-1	I have a history of certain medical conditions and I'm getting to an age where those conditions may be more likely to occur.
-1	Unsure of what will happen. 
-1	You never know what to expect in an office. Sometimes just having to wait a long period of time for a dr. to show up makes you feel anxious. Too much time to think and worry.
1	I have panic disorder so I'm almost always anxious and worried. But I don't like to think that my doctor will find something termil like cancer.
1	It is the waiting and wondering if they will take the time or just throw a prescription at me.
1	I would worry the most that they would find something life threatening or dangerous that is not outwardly apparent, and can only be found in a checkup.
-1	There is always a possibility that you could have something major wrong with you such as cancer or a disease.
1	I'm fat. They always tell you that you need to lose weight or die. 
-1	I get worried that there is something seriously wrong with me, potentially lethal.
1	Well sometimes you might have a small problem that you think is bigger. So I try not to panic until I talk to the doctor and find out what's wrong and usually it's nothing really big.
-1	I feel most anxious about getting test results and the impending decision that will need to be made based on those results. It makes me anxious about overthinking the decision or making the wrong choice.
1	I may receive life-altering information. Or, to treat something, I may start heading down the wrong path when it comes to treatment. The cost is also a concern. 
-1	getting bad news
-1	It's mostly wondering about if I actually have a condition that is wrong with me. It doesn't have much to do with them being a shady doctor.
-1	I am concerned that there is something going wrong with my body 
1	The primary cause of worry is the possibility that the doctor could discover something harmful in my body. This would lead to great discomfort as well as fincial liabilities. 
-1	That something might actually be wrong makes me feel anxious, but what makes me feel even worse is if I go in with a problem that turns out to be nothing.
-1	I'm not usually either of these things. It's the not knowing prior to the doctors that leaves me anxious. Going there I feel relief.
1	"I am always anxious that the doctor will not listen to what I have to say or write it off as ""all in my head,"" or they will not give me a satisfactory diagnosis and just throw antibiotics at me."
-1	If I feel anxious and worried, it must be the test result have some issue and doctor needs to talk to me personnel.
1	I am not in as good as shape as I would like.  I don't like being ked and being fat.
1	I have to go so long between visits to a physician, and my general health and nutrition are so poor that I dread hearing I have a serious illness every time I go. I worry about my wellbeing. I fear that years of poor health and dental care will catch up to me every time I see a physician.
-1	"I am worried that he will say something like ""this is rare"" or ""I have never seen this before"".  I want something routine that is easily eased."
1	It's really only certain types of exams that make me feel nervous and dreading the appointment. These are procedures that I find extremely uncomfortable, so I put them off. Often, I don't get them done. 
1	I just worry that they will find something that is terribly wrong with me.  I stress that until the exam is complete that I could have some issue that I did not know about.  
1	The general sense of invasion that examition brings, the thought of future discomfort or pain or inconvenience or tragedy, all waiting for me in that little room.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit a doctor. Maybe if I had a condition I was sure was serious I might feel kind of anxious.
1	I usually feel worried about what the results of my health assessment might be. I also get nervous about interacting with doctors (or people) in general, but I usually tell myself there isn't much to worry about just to calm myself down. 
1	Just the fear that something may actually be wrong and I have no control over. It gives me a great deal of stress.
-1	I do not like going to the doctor's in general so when I have to go to a doctor I feel restless and worried sometimes for no reason.
-1	The thing that makes me most anxious is just uncertainty.
-1	I am a little worried that my health problems will be worse than what they seem.
-1	Just finding surprises regarding my health. The next thing would be the cost. Though I have insurance, It's hard to see what it covers or not and what I will end up paying.
-1	Only times I get nervous is when I am in the waiting room, surrounded by sick people. I really do wish more offices had a split up area where people going in for check ups or non contagious things could be sat away from those with spreadable sicknesses.
1	I have chair anxiety and I always have, dentists, doctors, anything like that freaks me out and I think it is a lot of my own neurosis but also the fact that doctors have had a very strange demenour with me and always made me feel like they thought I was too unintelligent to understand what they were telling me.
1	I'm scared that she will find something wrong with me.  Something that will change my life.
1	that theyre going to come throgh the door with some scary results.
-1	The only thing that I really worry about is that the doctor might find something that is really wrong with me. I might be very sick.
1	There is always some anxiety that if you were going to the doctor for a reason it may be worse than you expect. I also have some trepidation regarding wait times in my physicians office. 
-1	If i feel like something is wrong like pain. It gets me worried before i talk to the doctor because I'm not sure what's wrong with me. It always is not as bad as i initially think
1	If I don't know what may be wrong with me, I'll feel worried.
-1	I do not feel anxious at the Dr. Maybe annoyed because of wait times.
-1	The most anxious aspect of visiting the doctor's office is waiting in the lobby to see the doctor. The actual process of talking to a doctor and getting tested isn't a problem for me as I'm a healthy individual.
-1	Well, any time I go there I'm a bit more anxious than usual.  Because it's a doctor's office!  Specifically, probably the sense that he may find something wrong with me that I was not aware of.  And something I do not want to know about.
1	The doctor commenting on my weight
1	Being weighed, being judged, not wanting to divulge information that may make me look bad. 
-1	That he won't be able to fix the problem that I'm dealing with.
-1	I am just generally an anxious person. I do not like going to the doctor, especially if I know it will involve a blood draw. I do not do well around blood or needles. 
-1	Whenever I have an issue i'm worried that it is actually bigger than I expected. The hospital setting sort of makes it worse.
1	I always worried they will find something is wrong
-1	I do not feel anxious when visiting the doctor at all. The dentist is another matter entirely.
-1	The most obvious thing in my eyes...that they will find something wrong that I was not aware of.   It is similar to getting your car worked on.  You always worry the mechanic will come out of the shop and say your &lt;auto part here&gt; is also broken. 
1	That the doctor will pressure me into doing things I can't afford, or don't really want.
1	I have anxiety in going to the doctor. I feel that the doctor will try and diagnose me with something that I do not have. 
-1	What makes me feel most anxious is when i'm sitting in the waiting room forever
1	That I'm going to go in for one thing and have something else come up
1	Being given some negative information about my health that I had no awareness of.
-1	I always have that lingering fear at my yearly ladies appointment that it will be discovered that I have cancer or something.  I think many women feel that way. 
-1	The only thing that makes me anxious is the wait time to see her.
-1	The thing that makes me the most anxious would be going in when I know something is truly wrong with me and not having any idea of the outcome - the uncertainty can be very worrisome. 
-1	Mostly time constrictions, which really has little to do with my doctor at all. She's pretty great, I must say.
1	I'm worried they'll find something really wrong with me. I'm not anxious about the doctor.
1	Waiting for the doctor to give me results. Fear of the unknown.
-1	The cost associated with going to the doctor would be the only thing I worry about.
-1	Finding out that something is seriously wrong with me.
-1	I'm not particularly comfortable with anyone touching me. I also worry that something is terribly wrong with me.
-1	Mostly it's the cost of going to the doctor. I don't normally expect the worst as far as my health is concerned.  
-1	its mainly when i don't have a clue whats wrong and could be something serious.
-1	I AM WORRIED THEY ARE GOING TO FIND SOMETHING MAJOR THAT IS WRONG WITH ME.
1	I just don't really like doctor's offices or hospitals in general. I worry that I will get some bad news though things are usually fine, but I worry a lot in general.
1	Fear of whether or not there's something wrong with me, and fear of how much treatment will cost. 
-1	Nothing really. My current doctor takes care of me very well.
1	I am always anxious that a problem will be something serious, even though it usually isn't. It is in my ture to prepare for bad news whether it is particularly likely or not.
-1	If I'm undergoing a procedure that could have bad results, that makes me anxious. Also, if I have to wait a long time.
-1	I usually do not feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor. 
1	I always worry that a simple problem is actually something very serious 
1	I get most anxious when I'm waiting for test results or something. That's when I feel the most anxious, the waiting. I also feel anxious when something painful, like a shot, is about to happen.
-1	Just having to be there, really. What if they find something wrong, what if there's some sort of problem, etc. Its more general, low key anxiety than anything specific. 
-1	I get anxious about what they will say.  Since I have anxiety I worry my blood pressure will be higher then normal because of how I'm feeling and not how it normally is.
1	I feel that anxious that my doctor will find something really wrong with me.  I worry that I will have to go to the hospital or have some procedure done.  It is the fear of having a serious medical condition.
1	"The bill is number one with a bullet.  Then after that I would be most worried about whatever condition I came in for being worse than it appears, or worst case scerio a big ol' shrug of the shoulders from the doctor saying ""I don't know what causes that..."" then endless testing (oh wait that goes back to cost).  Also lost time I have to take off of work because no doctor keeps a schedule that takes into account peoples working schedule."
1	when i have a problem i'm concerned about and they're trying to figure out what it is, and it becomes apparent it could be something bad
-1	I would say what worries me the most is that the doctor may find something seriously wrong, like cancer or the like. As I age, I find that I am much more attentive to the possibilities of those types of diseases (cancer, dementia, arthritis, etc).
1	I am anxious because I know I am overweight, and I dread being weighed and measured. I am anxious about my blood-pressure reading and blood sugar readings, as high blood pressure and diabetes run in my family. 
-1	That I may have to have a shot.
-1	I am not anxious at the doctor but if I had to pick something i would say just maybe anxious about shots/pain
-1	That he might find something wrong that I didn't know about.
-1	I am most anxious about possible serious problems that are manifesting.  I worry that I may be worse off than I think.
1	I am scared they will find something that is termil. My father passed away from cancer when I was very young, and I get extremely anxious that I will get blindsided with something terrible. 
-1	Strange environment, nervous about having to talk about myself and my issues. Having to bring up questions and concerns when they are doing things. 
1	I'm worried I'll have a condition I didn't think about. I'm worried I won't be able to live.
1	I don't want to have to take my clothes off. Most of the time the basic rule of society is to avoid being ked in front of other people, it's hard to adjust to the idea that it's supposed to be normal to do for medical professiols.
1	I have a general anxiety towards doctors. I feel as though if i go to the doctor i am going to get bad news. No matter what i go for, i feel like they are going to find a termil illness that i did not know i had. 
-1	I feel anxious because I am afraid my doctor will miss something because they don't care that much about my health they just want to prescribe me something expensive and then send me away. 
1	For some reason I'm always afraid that they won't believe me or will think that I'm weird. I get weird looks sometimes because of the way I explain situations due to my anxiety. The nurses are generally good at making this okay, but the actual doctors generally seem too busy with their shift to fully give you their time and attention. 
1	I cried last time I went because I couldn't handle the stress of him treating me like I'm stupid or asking why I'm gaining so much weight. All he could say was I'm referring you to a phys doctor. 
-1	I do not like needles so having to take a blood sample with usually make me a little worried.
1	Probably the idea that something is very wrong. I am rather overweight, and I know that leads to major problems.
1	That they will say something that is not what I wanted to hear. Also that they might now really look into what is going on.
1	That something will be seriously wrong
1	My condition is serious and currently I am in remission but every time I have a new scan and go to the doctor there is a chance something could show up so I am anxious
-1	I feel most anxious while I am waiting for test results to come back. Most often they are not bad news but it is the waiting that gets to me.
1	I just worry something bad will be found. That's always a possibility. I dont really like being touched by a stranger either.
-1	There is always a small risk present in many interactions. I am afraid that something will go unchecked sometimes.
1	Going to the doctor is always a nerve-wracking experience. You never know what news you could get after a health examition.
1	I don't like going to places I'm unfamiliar with. I don't like seeing sick people. Doctors offices usually have a real sad, depressing and anxious environment and feeling. 
-1	Just the anxiety of waiting to hear if anything is seriously wrong. I get worried when I have to wait, but I'm usually reassured in the end.
-1	The only time I would feel anxious is if I think something is really seriously wrong and then I would worry about the outcome.
1	He always tries to prescribe pills to me I don't want to take. An example is my blood pressure is normal, and yet he stills tries for me to get high blood pressure pills.
1	I feel anxious because I know my problems will be over looked or shoved off as not important. It makes me unhappy to be wasting my time. 
-1	I get anxious because I am afraid that the dr. will find something wrong with me that I did not know about. 
1	I am most anxious that the doctor will tell me that something is wrong. I know that if something is wrong, I will have to do/take something that is very inconvenient or expensive.
-1	Nothing in particular. As I said, I've been going to the same place for years, so I'm very comfortable there. I get a bit anxious when I'm sitting there waiting, simply because I hate waiting for anything.
1	I guess wondering whether or not they are going to be honest with me. If I knew they are going to try to push an antibiotic or prescription, I'd already be defensive. I don't take pharmaceuticals. 
-1	I am sometimes worried that I'm not going to pass one of the tests and will have some sort of condition. Before going in, I feel like I don't know how healthy I am. 
1	I usually assume the worst, when I have a doctors visit. Most of the time I was right. 
-1	The results of tests and what might be wrong with my body.
1	I worry that they are going to tell me something is wrong, that I am sick or dying. Just a general fear of receiving bad news.
1	not knowing what they will find, or even if they will listen to what is going on with me
-1	I feel little uncomfortable to describe some pain about mine body.
-1	The one thing that would bring about this feeling is not knowing. When you have to wait on test results and you dont know what will be the outcome. 
1	I feel the most anxious about being weighed or having my blood pressure taken and it is high.
-1	I don't honestly feel anxious when visiting the doctor. I am there to get help. I can imagine if I had a severe health problem that my anxiety level would be much higher but so far I have not had that experience.
1	"Everything. The sights, sounds, smells... The possibility of learning something terrible about my health... The vulnerability of having to undress in front of people I don't know well... The humiliation of having issues blamed on my weight... I had a terrible pediatrician as a kid who berated and terrified me and snuck up on me with vaccitions, and I've had a lot of medical anxiety ever since. My ""white coat syndrome"" in regard to my blood pressure when I see a doctor is HORRIBLE."
1	I am a very paranoid person when it comes to my health. Health is one of the most important things in this world so I am always concerned about losing my health. Even though I live a relatively healthy lifestyle and am young I still worry more than I should. 
-1	Not knowing how something is going to turn out. Whether a test is going to give not so great results or something else like that.
-1	I'm always worried that my doctor will find something horribly wrong with me like cancer
1	What makes me feel most anxious in a doctor's office is the uncertainty of it. I don't like feeling bad and not knowing what is wrong, and wondering about the diagnosis can be nervewracking.
1	Just sitting there wondering what they will find or if my condition is changing for the worse.
-1	I have always been anxious at the doctor's office, from when I was an infant.  Nowadays, it's not so bad, but mainly the sterility of the room, and the hyper-awareness of my body, plus being poked or prodded at, makes me nervous.
1	I worry the doctor will find something I did not expect. I also worry that if something is wrong, it will be expensive to treat. I tend to fear for the worst.
1	I always worry if they will find something wrong.  As I get older, this is more likely.
-1	I know that my physician will want to spend less than 5 minutes with my care and that annoys me. I feel anxious in order to get my most immediate needs out as quickly as possible knowing that he will soon sprint for the door. I do not feel that I am receiving adequate care with him and am looking to change physicians.
1	Because they take tests and the waiting in the room while the Dr. is on the way can be worrisome because it could go really well or really bad. Its the anticipation and unknowing that can make one feel anxious.
-1	I am not typically anxious about visiting the doctor's office.
1	I worry that my doctor would find something wrong with me. I want to go in there alive, and come out fine without any problems. I'm also not comfortable with people touching me, even if it is my doctor.
-1	Unexpected changes in weight, blood pressure, etc. (i.e. the unknown.)
-1	Just about my health. I don't worry much at all but sometimes I think that maybe they'll find something wrong, like maybe my blood pressure is bad.
-1	I do not like getting blood drawn, and I get scared to hear bad news.
-1	I am healthy so going to a doctor's office does not make me anxious though when they take my blood pressure it is usually higher then normal. So subconsciously it may bother me a bit.
1	worried something might be wrong. 
1	I am an anxious person to begin with, so waiting in a public area with other people is already nerve wracking on it's own. I also have trouble talking with people I know well about my problems, so the idea of divulging intimate physical problems makes me very nervous.
-1	I am mostly worried about the worst outcome. If I have a problem that I do not know what is going on, I am worried that the diagnosis will be poor and that could affect my lifespan or quality of life in general. I am also anxious when they lecture me about my health habits because I don't need a lecture as an adult, I understand my choices.
-1	I think most anxiety/worries just come from not knowing what is going to happen
1	If anything has changed, if my health has worsened even though I feel okay. 
-1	As a healthy person i usually visit once a year for basic blood work
-1	Just the thought that some illness may be discovered that I have.
-1	I don't want to be diagnosed with a serious condition, I'm not anxious about seeing the doctor but the possibility that something is seriously wrong with my health
1	I don't like the feeling of being exposed to strangers. I don't want to find out information that might make me change something drastic in my life.
1	Another appointment with nothing getting done and feeling the same or worse when i leave the doctors office.   They said surgery wont help me but wont give me anything that helps make me comfortable.  
1	I am the most anxious about possibly having to have blood drawn, or anything else with a needle. Additiolly, I am sometimes anxious about the doctor finding something majorly wrong with me. I worry about coming into contact with other sicknesses while at the doctor's office in general. 
-1	I don't get too anxious but i would probably have to say when they check my blood pressure.
1	when the doctor recommend and prescribes a drug that has interactions with other drugs that i am taking and his nurse warns him and he says give it to him anyway
1	finding something wrong with me.changing my meds
1	I guess it would be the waiting game. Waiting to get the test, then waiting for the results, waiting for the call that everything is fine, you hope and pray. 
-1	nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried when going to the doctor i am just turally that way. it isnt being there that is causing the feelings its just life in general
-1	Because I have dealt with cancer in the past, this would be my most main concern when going for check-ups - that they would feel something suspicious.
1	I hate having to talk to people about myself, and I feel like if I say something's been bothering me they'll treat me as if I don't know my own body and as if everything's my fault. I feel like they look down on me when I'm not in 100% top condition.
1	i HATE going to the doctor and hospitals. i was in and out of them nonstop as a kid with very serious health problems.
-1	that I might get some disease or virus from the patients in the waiting room or from surfaces in the doctor's office. He also always shakes my hand. 
1	I'm worried they won't listen to me. I'm worried I will encounter yet another doctor who does not care at all. I feel mistrustful after previous experiences.
1	They're fairly sterile and I generally feel concerned about what possible medical problems I could have.
-1	Trying to explain accurately what's going on and hoping I don't need further tests. Uncertainty 
-1	I don't have any worry when I go to the doctor's office in regards to my health. I currently do not have insurance so what would make me most anxious is I have something wrong that requires a lot of medical attention.
-1	That he might find something wrong.
1	You never know when they are going to find something that is going to be a problem.  Even when you feel healthy, an exam always makes me anxious.
-1	The thing that makes me the most worried is wondering if my doctor will diagnose me with some sort of rare sickness that will cost a lot of money or if he will have to check my testicles for cancer. 
1	alway the unknown. with you yearly exams.
-1	Just the waiting in the office to be seen and hearing everyone else cough and sneeze makes me anxious
-1	Hearing bad news.
1	I'm occasiolly worried about what I will be diagnosed with.
1	I guess it's because I really don't like doctors. They are not always honest to you.
1	Only that they might find something I'm not aware of. I am almost 60 so anything could go wrong. 
-1	Just the visit itself.  I can't really put my finger on what exactly it is.  I just don't like being there.  I don't like when they come in and talk to you like you;re friends.  We;re not, lets just get this medical stuff over with.
-1	What makes me more anxious while visiting the doctor's office is thinking about what they will say about anything.
1	In my dad's side of the family (possibly mom's too), we all have fear of doctors. I worry that the doctor will find something really wrong with me that nobody can fix. I'd rather live my life happily not knowing instead of dreading what I could possibly have.
1	I don't like feeling exposed when undressed. I am nervous about the tests.
1	I am turally an anxious person, but when I visit my doctor I'm paranoid he's going to find something that I didn't know was wrong with me. I think this is tural.
1	I am worried something serious will be wrong with my health.
-1	Having little time with him because he stays busy all day, so I worry I may not get the time I need to talk about what is happening with me. 
-1	I don't want to hear any bad news about my health.
1	I don't like needles. If I have to have my blood drawn I'm anxious. I get useated by the experience. 
1	I am worried that they will find out I have some horrible disease, or they will give me a medication that causes bad side effects.  I also worry about how much my medical treatments will cost.
1	I think it's just fear of the unknown. I wonder whether I've developed some type of illness since my last visit, and let that fear take me to some dark places.
-1	I worry that they'll find something very wrong with me. Such as cancer or something
-1	I don't. I'm always calm when i visit my Dr
-1	The fear that soemthing worse might be wrong with me then initially thought. That uncertainty can make me very uncomfortable.
1	I feel like they don't really care that much and don't even try to pretend to.  They are quick to prescribe pills before any other options.
1	I'm mostly worried about not asking the right questions while I am there. I'm not usually sure what I need to be asking. I then worry about whether  I'll be able to understand all the information that is going to be thrown at me. I'm just hoping it sticks so I can move on with my life as comfortably as possible. 
-1	Just the wait and time it takes to get through everything.
1	The thing that makes me anxious when visiting the doctor's office is the possibility that I could have a health problem. This makes me anxious because even when you live a healthy lifestyle, you can randomly get health problems. So it is this dread of the unknown that makes me anxious when visiting the doctor's office. 
1	to hear some bad news about my health
1	Mostly when I feel worried or anxious it's because I'm paranoid that something is wrong with me and I'm about to find out some terrible news.
1	I have been sick most of my life. My anxiety is spiked when I have to deal with a new nurse, or sometimes the regular Dr is not in when I go to my appt, I prefer just my primary care provider. I do not trust the others very much.
1	I fear physical aging of the body such as joint pain and also breast cancer, which my mother passed from.
-1	The waiting in a close small space, although I am not claustrophobic.  
1	I am never that anxious, but if I am it is usually jut generalized anxiety that i always have. I have social anxiety in almost every social situation.
-1	I am always concerned the doctor is going to find something seriously wrong with me, something i have not noticed. Like a tumor or cancer or some type of STD. 
1	At one point I was having severe stomach and abdomil pain.  I went to the doctors believing that my appendix may have ruptured.  The dr did the necessary test to determine that was not the case and it was just a serve case of acid and the proper form of treatment to releave the symptoms
-1	They always seem to find something wrong with me.  I am waiting for the cancer word to come up because I tend to have everything.
-1	the fear of the unknown, especially at my age, is what makes me worried.  Everyone has the fear of cancer.
1	I have longstanding health problems and I'm always worried they are going to say there are signs that they are getting worse. This makes me anxious and worried.
1	i had having female check ups those seem so invasive
-1	That I'm going to have an underlying problem that is going to be a long-term health ailment. My biggest fear is that I go in for one problem, but my Dr. discovers something more horrendous. 
-1	Usually it's just a routine check up, so I never really am too worried. I would guess that the only worry I would have is if something came back unusual from my regular check up, but then again, that would just mean it was caught before I even noticed anything wrong, which would be better than being caught too late.
1	I always am worried about what is going on with me or if she will find something out that I don't know about.  I feel horribel getting on the scale and am embarrassed 
-1	What makes the most anxious is when they're running extremely late and I have to sit there and wait.  It gets me upset that they don't care that I've had to take time out of my day and they should be courteous to others as we are to them.
1	I am more worried about being taken seriously for pain and symptoms I am having even though I have rarely had experiences where they were dismissed. I am also usually worried about the outcome or source of discomfort or symptoms. 
-1	The fear that you have something worse than what you really have.
-1	I have no this filling when visiting the doctor's office. I'm confident in my doctor.
-1	The ever-present possibility of long wait times. 
1	cause i know he doesn't care.  i think i have white coat syndrome too where i get nervous...especially with the new doctor.  He knows nothing about me.  So i just don't go to the doctor.  I've had a cold for 3 weeks and won't go.
-1	I just don't like going. It's a fear of the unkown, and not wanting there to be anything bad wrong.
1	My family has a lot of health problems. While I have been relatively healthy for my whole life so far, things could change at any time. I get nervous that I won't have my health in a future situation, so I try to do everything I can to stay healthy so I can live an active life. 
-1	I would say that I feel most anxious when the doctor's facial expression says something before they even tell me.  if the doctor looks discouraged about test results I usually become anxious or worried.
-1	I get worried when I go to doctors when they give me results of blood work or tests.
1	I am worried that my doctor will tell me I have a disease or that I am overweight. Or he'll tell me that I need to start eating better.
1	I worry the doctor might detect an illness/defect I was not aware of or something that may affect me adversely.  
1	I am worried that the diagnosis would be something completely different from what I expected it to be. I am worried that something may be more serious than it seems. 
-1	Simply not knowing the outcome is what would bother me.  Most of the time it is nothing, but the fact that it could be something serious makes me a little anxious from time to time.
-1	The wait time.
-1	I just don't enjoy being poked and prodded by other people. I also have received some unfortute medical diagnoses (melanoma twice) in the last year, so it makes me a little worried that it will come back. 
1	When I visit the doctors office it is usually for a reason, and I am worried that it will be a larger health concern than I would like to have. For example, I worry that the bump on my ear must be removed by surgery and thinking about hearing that makes me anxious. 
-1	I am always worried that they will tell me something is wrong.  Going to the doctor gives me general anxiety.
1	Not knowing what the outcome will be. I'm not a hypochondriac per se, but I do tend to think the worst thing whenever something is wrong with me physically. I dread getting a bad diagnosis but usually it's not that bad and can be easily fixed.
-1	Well if he insist on taking another test
-1	I always worry before a doctor's appointment. I always worry that I'll get bad news. 
-1	The expentancy of news, the fear of having a desease or having something wrong with me without a cure. 
-1	The unknown or possible conditions that could be found. 
1	them tell me something bad 
-1	What makes me feel anxious is whether I am going to get new information or not.
1	the uncertainty of whats wrong with me, and if they can fix it and HOW MUCH WILL IT COST
1	I always worry about hearing bad news. 
-1	Just not knowing what is going to happen.  I always have a hard time when I don't know what to expect.
1	If he's going to find something wrong with me
-1	I fear that maybe i'll walk out with a deadly illness
-1	I feel in many cases that the answers I get are just stock answers. No thinking out of the box. I would have zero issues if my doctor asked me to exercise or eat better for 2 weeks and then come back as a suggestion. Instead, it feels like receiving a pill is what I usually get. That is when I feel anxious of what just happened and worried that I won't get better. 
-1	I get most anxious about the bill I receive after the visit. 
1	I am worried that something might be wrong with my health, but mostly if I had a bad health last time. Otherwise I like getting my checkups. I try to rarely go to the doctors though. 
-1	Not much, usually. If I have to discuss an embarrassing issue I could be nervous, maybe. 
1	Will I need any bloodwork done? Will I have to fight them to convince them to change my birth control or acknowledge my bi-annual sinus infections that I've gotten like clockwork since I was 16? 
-1	I don't really feel anxious or worried when I go visit a doctor. 
-1	Potential health issues.
-1	how much the price of meds will be
1	Sometimes I'm afraid there might be something wrong with me that I don't know about yet. 
1	I'm nervous to begin with and do not like going to doctors to begin with and then you add the added anxiety of them finding something wrong, so yes I do feel anxiety going to the doctor for a couple reasons.
-1	I have a history of medical problems. Every time I go to the doctors I pray nothing else will be wrong. Along with my current issues are stable/improving. 
1	I just feel worried that they don't have my best interest at heart. They just want to line their own pockets. They also don't spend much time explaining things or giving altertives.
-1	If I have an ailment, I'm most worried about how much time and cost I will have to dedicate to having it treated.
1	I get worried that something may be wrong and I don't know it.
-1	I only get anxious when I visit the doctor when I think there is something wrong with me that I am not sure about. I Google my symptoms and start to get even more worried before I even see the doctor. I am worried about what the doctor may say and I fear the worst. 
1	A doctor, whether they like it or not, has a certain amount of power over their patients, and I have a lot of trouble dealing with situations where people have power over me (and I have been justified in that concern). It's stressful having to be in situations of uncertainty or where I don't have the control I want.
-1	When I have something wrong and the doctor takes a long time to figure out what it is. Though I suppose the worst is worrying about the cost of the procedure.
1	Misdiagnose me or just scam me into spending more.
-1	"I always worry about getting that ""I don't know what's causing your problems"" answer - or worse yet, the clear implication that it's ""all in my head."" I fear the doctor won't find anything, when I absolutely know that something is wrong."
-1	The only thing I ever feel anxious or worried about is (1) waiting too long for the doctor to appear and (2) worry about whether I going to get a nurse who will do a painless job with the needle!
1	You never know what they are going to find.  Even if you feel totally healthy they could tell you something is wrong.  That is what makes me feel anxious.
1	that he will find something that is untreatable.
1	It's just uncomfortable having your body examined by a stranger. Waiting in the room, sometimes half ked, is really not my idea of fun. I am afraid of being judged by the doctor or afraid of finding out some sort of bad news about my health.
-1	I feel most anxious when I'm going to have to have blood drawn. I have a thyroid disorder, so it's fairly often so they can check my TSH. I don't like needles and I am a lot better than I used to be, but I always get a little nervous about the stick.
-1	The only problem I have is finding a doctor who will do a thorough examition and LISTEN to what I'm saying.  I don't mind one that experiments as long as I know it is and that we are working together.
-1	It depends on the situation. If I am seeing my doctor, say, because I am not feeling well or in a lot of pain, then of course I'll feel anxious and worried that something might be seriously wrong. If it's just routine checkups, then I'm relaxed.
-1	I worry that I am going to receive news that I have a physical illness that went undetected before. I'm worried that I might have cancer, diabetes, or heart issues. I am obese, so my weight is of great concern. 
-1	I am usually worried that my blood pressure will be high. The anxiety ends up making my blood pressure high. It is sort of a cycle. 
1	I often feel anxious or worried about them always wanting to discuss my weight. Not my problem the reason I am there. They are always trying to blame me being overweight a little.
1	I am not a huge fan of going to the doctor but still go because I value my health. I am always a little apprehensive of visiting the doctor even though I am in excellent health.
-1	I feel anxious that the doctor will be in a rush and I will not be able to ask questions I have.
1	The fact of what could be wrong makes me anxious.  I don't know if I have an issue that will require further medical attention.
-1	It's not a remark on my confidence in my doctor; it's more of the fact that I'm worried that I have some underlying condition that is more serious than I anticipated.
1	Normally it's a matter of having to wait to hear back from them that makes me anxious. I dislike waiting for exams and tests to come back. 
1	I don't like feeling vulnerable as someone exams me.  I don't like having to get undressed in a cold room or having someone judging me.  If I do go to the doctor, I normally have to have something seriously wrong so I am anxious to find out what the problem is.  
1	I get anxious going to the doctor because I don't know what they will say or have me do, and I don't know if I will be able to explain my problem well enough for them to understand.
1	I'm always afraid that he will find something knowing that I'm not a spring chicken.
1	worry that something is wrong
-1	When I am there for symptoms. Also the anxious feeling is there because no one taught me how to go to doctors and make appointments for myself.
1	When visiting the doctor , I sometimes feel anxious because of the unknown. You never know what a doctor is going to tell you. If something is wrong , I always have the feeling it will be something horrible...
1	I worry the the doctor might find a serious issue that will negatively affect my life. I also sometimes worry that the doctor will not be able to diagnose me properly and I might have to go to another physician.
1	I always fear a negative diagnosis such as a termil disease or serious debilitating condition.  Some of the tests are not fun either.  Such as blood tests.  
1	The not knowing why they do what they are doing when they are doing it. I have yet to find a doctor that will answer my ongoing questions as to WHY things are done and What the purpose of those are, in a complete way. Sometimes the answers that I get just make me have more questions.
1	"The physical vulnerability makes me antsy - I'm a very physically private person, so the examition itself usually makes me uneasy. And then of course there's the ""what if"" thoughts of what could be the worst-case scerio."
-1	I am always worried they will find something serious like they did with my mother's cancer.
1	I worry about what the doctor might find. I feel much more at ease once it is over and I am given a clean bill of health. Until then, I get nervous about anything that might be going in my body that I didn't know about. 
1	Nothing makes me so. I believe in God's providence in everything including my own health.
1	How long the affair is going to take. How poor the doctor's bedside manner is going to be. How much of my problem's they'll casually write off as being about my weight and nothing more. Whether or not they'll believe me about problems I'm having.
1	There is always the concern that you might have some serious health issue that you didn't spot and that a doctor may notice. I also am not a fan of being touched by those I'm not close with so I get a bit anxious due ot the amount of physical contact involved in most appointments.
-1	I get nervous when it gets really persol such as at the OBGYN and I also hate getting shots or blood work done.
-1	Not knowing what to expect from the appointment, or test results.  
1	I just hate being examined and having to visit the doctor in general. Life would be easier without having yearly exams to have to go to. :)
1	Feel worried my health will be judged. There's also the looming fear that my health is worse than I imagined. 
1	I feel anxious looking at the different types of instruments.
1	I always get a little nervous when I go to the doctor so my blood pressure raises. That makes me more anxious that I'll have an extremely high blood pressure when they take it. Something about being at a doctors office is slightly off putting.
-1	I am worried that if I go to the doctor for something minor, something else will be found that is more serious. I live a healthy life but somethings you can't prevent. 
1	I get uncomfortable if any clothing removal is involved. Also, I get a little nervous that something might hurt. I also get nervous that something is wrong and it won't get noticed.
1	The thought that something completely insane might be discover like cancer
-1	Not knowing what is wrong with me and hoping that it isn't the worst case scerio.
-1	I usually feel most anxious when I am waiting, waiting to be brought back to the exam and waiting to see the doctor. I also get anxious when I feel sick and don't know what's wrong with me, the unknown makes me worried.
1	I am worried about the doctor finding an issue or something wrong. I am scared that the doctor will find something serious or something incurable. 
1	I am worried that something will be wrong with me. That, or I worry that the doctor may judge me. I'm worried he might think I'm lazy, gross, or don't take catre of myself.
-1	The fear that a serious condition could be found. It's really the noting of mortality, that something with the body could be malfunctioning.
1	Not knowing what to expect.  Potential for more tests.
1	I'm always worried that he may find something terribly wrong with me. I'm always worried about cancer.
1	The wait, I'm sitting there just thinking about different things to worry about.
-1	My health might have problems makes me worried. My health also might be worse than last time.
1	I just don't like the idea of being examined or judged for my bad decisions in life. 
-1	Just the general routine of having the physical and examition because it's such a persol matter.
1	I think for me there is always the fear of what will they find that I don't know about, the what if something is really wrong fear. Other than that the exam, albeit uncomfortable at times is not really an issue. 
-1	Because I have some current and past health issues, I am often anxious about whether these health issues may be negatively effecting my health in a serious way. I am also nervous that my doctor may ask me questions that I am nervous to answer because I feel I might've done something to negatively effect my health.
1	idk
-1	They might find something seriously wrong.
1	I dealt with some health issues in the past. So it makes me anxious when I am visiting a doctor for a problem I think I may have. Mostly I am anxious that they will tell me I do in fact have this problem but I am also hopeful that I will not have health issues
1	I feel anxious when the doctor makes me uncomfortable or talks down to me. Additiolly, if the nurses or front desk staff are rude when I walk in, I start to feel uneasy.
1	There is always a feeling of unknown when visiting the doctor's office. Even if I feel healthy, there's always a little doubt that something could be wrong. That's where the anxiety and worry comes from.
-1	"I'm not anxious or worried when I visit a doctor, at all. There isn't a need to be. It's not as if I ""must"" by some law follow what they ask me to do, it's merely a choice. I'd be far more worried to visit a dentist and worry about needing a cavity filled then seeing a doctor. "
-1	The doctor may find something wrong that I didn't expect. I feel like I am in good health and don't like to find out there is something wrong that I didn't know about.
1	I have a lot of social anxiety, so just going there and talking to a doctor makes me anxious, just from the social aspect of interacting with them. It also makes me anxious to talk about issues I'm having, especially if they are embarrassing. I also don't like mentioning things related to lifestyle choices that may reflect badly upon me, and it makes me anxious when things like that come up.
-1	I really don't think like there's anything, since her and her office folks make me feel completely at ease. Possibly what my blood pressure is going to be.
1	"Because when I am there, it is usually because something is wrong that I do not understand myself and need answers for. This type of thing makes me worried because I get that fear of ""what is wrong""."
1	I worry that my blood pressure will be high. I worry about being diagnosed with cancer. I'm 66 and feel my mortality.
-1	I'm at the age where 29 years of firefighting are catching up with me. This is wehre the weird cancers, heart problems, etc start coming in . I will probably have to take early retirement due to my TBI, so I am dreading that
1	Worried that it could be something serious, or even termil.
-1	I usually don't feel anxious at the doctor. But sometimes I feel anxious at the doctor with my kids, I just want them to be healthy and I get nervous if something is wrong.
1	I feel anxious because even though I know there is most likely a problem I hate to hear that I have a problem. It's an anxiety that I have always had before visiting a doctor or dentist.
-1	I'm usually just worried that something is going to be seriously wrong with me. Or that the doctor will miss something important.
1	The possibility of finding out something is wrong can lead me to feel anxious or worried. The more regular my visits are the less worry this causes me.  
-1	I don't know, I don't like to get ked or just put on that paper gown. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Also, I get worried about how much it's going to cost, because even though I have insurance, the copay can still be really high.
-1	I think it is just an overall feeling I get from seeing a doctor.  I have never been good at doctors offices or hospitals, they just give me an overall nervous feeling that I can't really explain.
1	"They're going to want to order more tests ""just to be sure"" so that our understanding goes from 90% likely to 92% likely, but these new tests are going to cost me enough to take years to pay off."
-1	If I'm going in for something unknown, I might feel a bit anxious.  Other than that, it's routine body maintence.
1	Something might come up. Maybe it will be caught early, or maybe something terrible will be detected like cancer.
-1	"Waiting in the office after my vitals are taken and before the doctor comes in.  Also waiting for test results - anxious about the ""what ifs""."
-1	I really don't suffer from anxiety at all when visiting the doctor. Potentially missing work is the only thing that worries me.
1	I am always concerned that something will be wrong with me. I have and still do drink heavily. I am scared that one day something concerning those risks taken will be serious. 
-1	The most worried I get is being concerned about having to wait to long to be seen.  Other than that, there isn't much to be worried or anxious about.  Whatever I am there for, the doctor will do his best.
1	I've had doctors insult me, accuse me of lying, or jump to false conclusions. I don't feel safe in a doctor's office.
-1	Its the waiting in a crowded room.
-1	I worry about being lectured about my health and also having to go through the whole procedure of tests. I don't like it.
1	I get anxious wondering if I will have health problems.
1	That a problem will be discovered
1	I feel anxious because i sometimes think i will be diagnosed with a terrible disease.
1	I am worried about having to get ked. I am worried about finding out something is wrong with me. I am nervous about having to talk to a stranger about persol issues.
-1	The waiting while in an office that smells of sickness. If it wasn't for the smell it wouldn't be so bad but they always smell.
1	I am working hard to improve my health and I always get worried that my tests will show that I have regressed in my work.  I also worry that at some point it may come back and tell me that I have developed a serious health issue that will require lifestyle changes.
1	The man barely looks me in the eye. He's very brusque. 
1	Doctors usually are hurried and that makes me anxious. I usually have questions and I'm worried that I won't have time to ask them. Or I worry about whether the doctor will listen to me and help me. I have been dismissed so often by doctors, especially for my children. 
1	Being examined and evaluated more than anything. Insecurity, if I had to put it another way.
-1	Getting sick from other patients. 
1	Everything about going to the doctor gives me anxiety. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, so it can not really be helped. I am concerned that I will only hear bad news, or that the doctor will be cold and judgemental, or any other number of things that could be negative about the experience. 
-1	I don't usually feel anxious or worried about going to my doctor. If there are problems, then I will deal with them when they arise. Only time I'm a bit apprehensive is if I need to see a new doctor.
-1	Just know I don't go enough and dont stay on top of my health and past health issues so when I go I am slightly worried about things I neglected to keep checking on being worse 
1	Being judged. Having to get kid. 
-1	It does make me worried if I have some sort of condition that feels unresolved or it could worsen. I know it is good to figure out what is going on, but it worries me to imagine what it could be.
1	not being able to properly explain my condition and not receiving adequate treatment
1	I get irratiol fears that my ear infection will somehow end up being cancer. This is the mindset I normally have when I visit the doctors so I normally have a healthy amount of anxiety when I have to go in.
1	I am afraid I might be told something I don't want to hear, such as cancer.
-1	I can feel anxious about my doctor finding something wrong with me.
1	I am most worried about the doctor telling me that something is wrong (like finding a lump) and that farther testing will be required. Some things cant be found or will go unnoticed until you visit a doctor, and I am most scared about some illness creeping up on me.
-1	I, like most people, have a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor. This stems purely from not knowing if something is wrong with me that I might not have noticed. I stay in shape, and have a healthy routine, but there is always the chance that something is lurking underneath. 
-1	I honestly have no anxiety when meeting with my doctor. I enjoy the process. 
-1	I guess it's all the waiting. There is always at least a 10-15 minute wait in the office before the appointment. 5-10 would be more acceptable. Then there is also the time you have to wait in the examition room. 
-1	"I'm turning 40 this year, so I do get a little anxious these days when I go to the doctor. There's always a little ""what if he finds something"" voice in the back of my head, even though I'm quite healthy overall. I don't really mind going all that much, though."
1	Probably that they will find something horrible. They are going to tell me i'm to fat and to quit smoking. Both are easy to say but hard to do.
-1	I'm more anxious to see if the thoughts I have on what the issue are line up to his. If they do then I already kind of know the course of treatment so there is no mystery.
1	Even if I feel healthy, I get worried that there is something wrong. Also, I don't visit the doctor often so I get anxious about being in an unfamiliar place. Since it is so far between times I visit a doctor I get worried that I waited too long for them to diagnose.
1	The fear in the back of my head that they will find something drastically wrong.  I am worried I will get bad news. 
-1	Not much really. It is a process I understand that has to take place and sometimes it is tedious and takes time to complete.  Too many blood draws on occasion 
-1	It's not so much the doctor visit that concerns me.  It's the lab results.  As I am under aggressive treatments for my Cancer, my lab numbers fluctuate with various modalities and medications and that gives me modest concern.
-1	It's a little irratiol, but sometimes when I'm in the waiting room, I worry about that the doctor might find something terribly wrong. I know there's nothing really wrong because I feel fine, but in the back of my mind, I still think something might crop up that will be a terrible burden to treat. 
1	I hate shots. I hate shots a LOT. I'm always in fear that my affliction will result in a blood test or a shot of some sort and that's when I get REALLY tense.
-1	nothing i know my body and the health care system as well as my doctor so there is nothing to be anxious about
1	"I guess there is always the possibility of seeing a doctor for a simple check-up and having them start a sentence with, ""Oh my god, why didn't you have this mole looked at sooner....you have a week to live."" I don't really think that way until I am half-dressed and being examined.  So I would say there is a moment of feeling vulnerable in that situation, but I don't obsess or anything."
1	I'm anxious about what might be wrong with me and how much the treatments will cost.
1	The fact that I would ever be in a position to where I would have to visit a doctor for anything.
1	I worry about being judged or put down again. I worry that there will be something terribly wrong with me and the dr will miss it or dismiss me based on my appearance.
-1	Maybe having bad results.
1	I don't want to hear any bad news.  I just want to hear that all is well and I can go about my life.  I do not want to hear that something is worrisome and I need more tests, etc.
1	Worried that I get diagnosed with a serious illness.
-1	In the past I had struggled with Anxiety and Depression. I do not currently struggle with these issues and they have since been resolved. Due to the ture and cultural stigma relating to mental health it was somewhat difficult for me to deliver my concerns verbally to my doctor. This made me feel very anxious and worried before my appointment, but once I filly maged to communicate my concerns I was put at ease by my doctors professiolism and demeanor regarding the issues. He helped a great deal my overcoming this medical condition and now I no longer have these issues and no longer need medication for this.
-1	Nothing about going to the doctor makes me feel this way.  Usually I feel annoyed because of the kids, the waiting, and the cost.
1	I have a severe case of white coat syndrome. As soon as I walk into the office I start sweating profusely. Strange because I am a doctor...
-1	I'm getting older, and I know I'm not as strict with myself about maintaining proper diet and exercise.  I know it's for my own good, but visiting my doctor means confronting my own shortcomings in this area.
1	That they will push needless meds and tests and not do anything for me anyway. Doctor is no longer a noble profession
-1	There's a lot that I don't know when I go into a doctor's office, and I'm often concerned that I'm forgetting to say something that is relevant to my health. I don't know what is and isn't necessary to know, and the whole experience makes me aware of my own frailty and mortality in a way I usually am not.
-1	that he might find something wrong with me that i was uware of or that is bad.
1	when i am experiencing a medical problem I sometimes have anxiety about it. The unknown makes me anxious 
1	I worry about getting bad news. I worry about being judged. I worry about appearing nervous and anxious.
1	I think the feeling of finding something seriously wrong. I've been lucky to not have very many medical problems in life so I only have to go to the doctor for something minor. It's not a familiar place so that makes for some anxious feelings overall. 
1	When I visit a doctor's office I am always anxious because I don't know what he is going to find. I am always worried about my physical health.
-1	I think it's just the fact that I could get really bad news at the doctor. 
1	I am afraid of the procedures that cause pain.Also finding something is wrong with me is scary.
-1	I tend to feel anxious whenever there strangers involved, especially professiols. I tend to be anxious all the time, especially when outside of places I'm comfortable with or familiar with, and a doctor's office is the furthest thing from a comfortable space to be in. That, and I'm always paranoid that I might unintentiolly make it more difficult for the doctor to actually do their job. I tend to breathe very differently, almost as if I'm trying to keep myself from showing any potential symptoms. Plus, my self-destructive tendencies (that are caused by my depression) tend to come in the form of me denying myself help, so even I mage to get to a doctor, I feel cornered. 
-1	"I don't want to hear anything bad. I know I am not in the greatest shape and I need to ""get busy"" but do I? No.. like everyone else we want to be in denial. "
1	Just nervous being at the doctor's office, I have anxiety every time even when it's just a simple check-up. Mainly the uncertainty.
1	Recieving bad news. Getting a wrong diagnosis.
1	The fear that something adverse may be discovered. Also the existential feeling of a lack of control over a possible health issue.
-1	I think there's always that worry in the back of your head that there may be something really wrong with you and the doctor is about to find it and tell you.
1	Normally I am concerned, like most, that my doctor could find something seriously wrong with me. My mother passed of lupus, and my father just recovered from colon cancer, so I am concerned that it's only a matter of time that I am diagnosed with a life threatening aliment. 
-1	i would say a fear of getting bad news. a fear of being judged. i don't like to be touched also so that makes me anxious.
-1	I have COPD. Each time I visit my doctor I half expect him to tell me my symptoms are getting worse and that the end is near.
-1	If I truly think something is wrong with me, then I am most anxious when she is  giving the physical examition.\
1	I almost always feel skeptical that I will get any good answers and it makes me feel worried that I will never find an answer.
-1	I am worried that there will be something that will be expensive. Unfortutely we are in a position where we don't have great insurance coverage and we don't have a lot of savings so a medical issue could be very costly to us. 
1	I am most anxious and worried when visiting a doctor because I am fearful that they might find something seriously wrong with me. I am not a hypochondriac but I usually only see a doctor when something is bothering me.
1	I guess I am always afraid that something will turn up on a test that I was not anticipating.  There are so many detriments that can lie dormant, and something may turn up even without symptoms.  In some cases, I tend to wonder whether its better to know than not, because then you begin to live as if you have the indientified ailment.
-1	Probably just the blood tests I have to take.  They changed people and the new people aren't very good at making it quick and painless.
1	I have a touch of health anxiety, so I tend to expect the worst. Even if my symptoms are fairly benign, my imagition gets the best of me.
-1	I don't normally feel anxious for myself, but i do get nervous for my child and unborn baby. I worry that a simple cold is actually cancer or that the baby will have some rare disease. With myself, I worry that I will have cancer and won't be able to raise my kids. The actual doctor doesn't make me nervous at all. 
-1	I feel anxious that something might be wrong with me. I worry that I might get diagnosed with something bad.
1	I have past trauma that makes me not like to be touched.
1	there's always something in the back of your mind telling you it's worse than it is. Fortutely, it usually isn't.
1	When I visit the doctor, I'm afraid that I am going to be very sick. This feeling comes even if I've had no symptoms or other serious illness
1	I am most worried that my doctor will notice that my health has been going downhill since the last time I saw them. I am also uneasy about the physical examition that involves my doctor physically touching me under the hospital gown.
1	I just want answers, which is something I can never get. I really don't even care if the answers are not good, I just want some answers, that's all.
-1	When they have to draw blood from my hand for some test.I am not afraid of the test result but the pain of the needle.
1	I am worried if anything would be wrong. I'm worried what my doctor will think about me. 
1	I ALWAYS KNOW THE ISSUE ABOUT MY WEIGHT IS GOING TO COME UP.  I HATE TALKING ABOUT IT.  I HAVE TRIED AND FAILED MANY TIMES TO LOSE WEIGHT.  I ALSO NOTICE MORE PAINS THAN USUAL AND WORRY KNOWING MY FAMILY HISTORY.
-1	I am not anxious or worried at all when I visit the doctor's office. There is not point in it. If something is wrong then worrying about it isn't going to help the situation get any better.
-1	When I do not know what is wrong with me.
-1	In case I am feeling bad about something that I think is the worst case scerio and I will not find out until he has examined me or ran some tests. Worrying is mostly in my head and not a result of the doctor himself.
1	I never look forward to seeing what it says on the scale, to start. Then the pressure I feel about the decisions I make about my own health seem to come under scrutiny and that makes me extremely uncomfortable. I can't wait to be done with the appointment.
1	I have anxiety about a lot of things. I don't think it's something in particular that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I just do and it's hard to pinpoint exactly what I'm anxious/worried about. 
1	I don't feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office. I usually feel relieved that something that is going on is going to get taken care of here. I don't like to go to the doctor but I feel better once I know what is going on with my health than not knowing. 
1	Going to the doctor makes me uneasy because it's so persol and I'm concerned there may be something more serious happening.
1	finding something else wrong
-1	I only get nervous about a bad diagnosis.
-1	The most worrisome thought would be they're going to find out some things wrong that can't be fixed. I mean if you find out you have to take medicine or have a light surgery it's fine. You go there and they tell you that you have cancer, or heart failure all because you went there because you had a slight cough and are slightly fatigued..... I mean who expects that to happen?
1	I just worry in general about my check up results.  I'm getting older and weigh more than when I was younger.  I just get a bit anxious on blood pressure now too.
1	Feeling embarrassed by something that is going on with me I guess. I think I am more anxious about that than anything else. My health is pretty good, and if it wasn't I don't think I'd really fear that. The money, also, the money makes me extremely worried. I fear having to pay thousands of dollars for my health.  
-1	I don't really feel anxious about visiting the doctor's office. If anything, I might be worried about arriving late to the appointment. I wouldn't like being late.
-1	I am most anxious about the unknown and having routine tests uncover something serious that I wasn't aware of. So far there have been no major problems but as I get older I am expecting something sooner or later.
1	I worry about what disease I may have after reading information online about causes of severe pain. I worry about my organs and as I age, there seem to be more things wrong and more things that I have concerns about.
1	What might come of the visit. Not seeing my doctor, just what may or may not be wrong.
-1	I just worry sometimes that they might find something that I already didn't know about.  I don't like to be surprised usually.  Especially when it comes to my own body and health.
-1	That my doctor will find a new problem with me. That I have a new bacteria or that I have a big problem;
1	Just the notion that a test result could reveal something bad.  Cancer, for instance. 
1	Uncertainty.  Anything can happen. I could be walking out of there and know that I will be dead in a week or I will no nothing more than I did before. 
-1	Usually fear about bad outcomes or future illness.  I, like everyone else worried about what could happen.  Even though I know that my condition isn't contingent on whether I am aware of it or not, it's still bothersome to learn.
1	Just the overall experience. You never know what to expect or what they could find that isn't necessarily good.
-1	I rarely get anxious at the doctors office.  If I go to the doctor when I feel like something may be wrong, then I may be anxious until I know that it is not something serious.
1	I have not been anxious from going to a doctors office in a while.  Everything that I have been told in a while was what I was expecting.
1	I feel like my doctor is judging my body. I feel like I am inferior because I am not in good health and have many problems compared to my doctor.
1	I fear that they are going to find something really serious is wrong with me. 
1	Getting my blood pressure taken and going on the scale to measure my weight. Two things I dont think many people like doing.
1	I fear the unknown just like everyone else.
1	I worry that the doctor will find something that i am uware of. I fear what they find will be painful or expensive to treat.
-1	That they might find something that I have wrong with me. I have to doctor a lot for my problems and I'm paranoid that I will get something that is caused by the medicine.
1	I just do not like the whole experience, or the sterile smell of the health care faculties. 
1	I am most anxious and worried when I visit a doctor's office because I feel like doctors only look at the major illnesses that you may have instead of realizing that everyone doesn't fit into those categories.
-1	If I have been very ill for a long time and there has been nothing to help me for a long time, I would worry wondering if the test results would show some dangerous illness like cancer, aids, etc. which could kill me soon.
1	I am worried that my doctor will be very upset with me because I am not losing weight.  I keep gaining weight.  I am worried that I will eventually have high blood pressure or diabetes.
-1	I worry about new findings or a change in my health.  I also worry if a procedure is going to be uncomfortable or painful.  
-1	That I'll get sick from being around so many sick people.
1	I often have to have physical examitions and blood tests.  The blood tests especially incite dread, anxiety, etc in me simply because I know they will hurt.  Even the physicals give me discomfort though.  I also worry about what thing I will have to correct my doctor on this time.
-1	I feel most anxious when I have something wrong with my health that I am worried about. 
1	For my mother, any visit to the doctor's office is a possible event filled with dread. Has the cancer spread to her brain yet? How long will she be able to breathe effectively before the tumors in her lungs over power her? For myself? I'm basically as healthy as a horse and entirely apathetic about it.
1	Getting results back from tests when trying to find out if certain symptoms may be signs of a new condition or decline in health will make me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. 
-1	What makes me feel anxious sometimes is seeing other patients with various ailments waiting to see their doctors. When I'm thinking there might be something wrong with me, it unsettles me a bit to see other people who aren't well.
-1	When I am feeling ill and I don't have a good idea about what is wrong.
-1	I am worried that I am going to get bad news or poor test results.
-1	I don't like to have closed contact with people in general. Visiting a doctor and having the doctor examine my body is uncomfortable for me. 
1	I worry about getting bad news. I also don't really like strangers touching me so this causes anxiety.
-1	When I am going in with something that I dont know about and how it will turn out. I mostly go for my annual physicals. I never have ailments. So if I ever had an ailment and had to go in I would be very anxious.
1	"A lot of them have elitism or an ego about them. I expereinced this several times with doctors. Or while you are sitting there at your lowest point, barely able to hold your head up, they will talk down to you. YES THEY DO. fuck em. Sorry but I can't with medical doctors. There is so much intellectual elitism and yet they haven't actually ""cured"" anyone of diseases because the underlying issue of what everyone is eating isn't addressed. We act like if we can eat it, it's our food source and will go in and out of the body. Unfortutely people forget that in anything, if you burn dirty, or the wrong fuel, you will RUIN the machine/your body."
1	The fear of them finding something wrong with me.
-1	When my doctor is checking my weight I get worried because I am trying to lose weight to control my diabetes 
1	I am most anxious or worried about receiving bad news or requiring a procedure that I'm not comfortable with.
-1	Just general anxiety because I've experienced a lot of incorrect diagnoses, and as a result, been prescribed medicine that has a very negative effect on me. I worry about not being listened to. I dread the patient blame that I've experienced.  
1	Not sure what they will say. Sometimes they make me feel bad about myself.
-1	I am not at all anxious or worried about anything.  My doctor is just wonderful.  I go every six months.  I was just there, and he is a great doctor.
1	I am mostly nervous about the cost of the visit.  To a lesser extent I am worried about what he might find (ie cancer) or something of that ture. 
-1	How long I will be sitting there.
-1	I am always about any appoiment, every time I go se the doctor I just don't like to wait.
-1	That they won't know what's wrong, or that they won't take me seriously enough.
1	I get anxious thinking they will think less of me for how little I've taken care of myself. Which is not true really. I exercise every day. Literally every day. The results are not very noticeable, but I would be WAY worse off if I didn't exercise. 
1	The possability for bad news.
-1	I just get anxious for some reason.  I don't like being told something is wrong with me so I get worried.  Also I hate having to give blood or do other procedures that could hurt.
-1	The waiting room makes me feel like that sometimes just because you have to sit there and my mind starts to wander sometimes. Usually I am fine though.
1	That they won't hear me. Or that I'll get some dreadful diagnosis and then be faced with decisions that I don't want to make.
-1	Having something wrong with me that will require me to take a medication that is the only option to cure what is wrong with me but at the same time will have side effects which will continue to effect me for a while.
-1	I am most worried that my doctor will find a new problem or disease when I am examined. I don't want a new disease to deal with. I am also worried that I will lose my health insurance and I won't be able to afford treatment.
1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office when I am awaiting any test results or physical examitions. I worry because I fear something may be wrong and I would need medical treatment.
-1	I have anxiety just being in medical buildings not because of the doctor herself. I also often feel worried when being examined that something wrong will be found.
-1	Nothing in particular.  I'm pretty much comfortable there.  Nothing has ever happened that I would be terribly anxious.  I think a certain degree of anxiety is normal if you are sick and going to the doctor.  I think the anxiety is more related to the illness or symptoms than seeing the doctor.
-1	The bill. And if they can actually help
-1	Probably the bill.
-1	I am an anxious person in general.  So after having waited in the waiting room, and then waiting again in the exam room as I wait for the doctor to come in I am already getting anxious and worked up.  It's not because I fear what I might learn or what might happen, but I'm just nervous in general about meeting the doctor and the waiting and anticipation helps fuel my nervousness.  I am far more nervous about meeting and talking to the doctor than I am about what might happen or what I might learn during my visit with the doctor.
1	Occasiolly, I may feel anxious at a doctor's office because I have a fear of needles. I always have to lie down when I need them to take a sample of my blood. I also become anxious because if I am unsure about a medicine or pill I haven't taken before, I am worried about the possible side effects.
-1	I always dread what the doctor will find out, like if I have some horrible illness. I also feel like he talks at me rather than to me. This worries me because I don't feel that I'm a part of my healing program. 
-1	What makes me anxious or worried when visiting for the doctor is when he asks me very private information. I understand why since they are related to my health, but as a private person, it still makes me anxious/worried since I prefer those information to stay in my brain.
1	Not knowing what's wrong with me.  Worrying that it's worse than it actually is.  The fear of not knowing whether or not they are able to help me.
1	I would be most worried about being told I had a terrible disease. I would be andious about being told I needed urgent surgery. I would be worried about being told I needed to take manh drugs for the rest of my life.
-1	When they are in a bad mood. They have a facial expression of someone angry and mad at the world.
1	I feel worried about what could be wrong. I rarely will see a doctor due to the fear that something major could be wrong medically. Also anxious due to feeling like the Dr does not want to be bothered with me as a patient.
-1	"When visiting the doctor, there's always a ""what if"".  I'm never scared or worried about my health, per se, but just if something is not feeling right or beginning to come on."
1	The main reason is that I am almost always anxious, especially when around other people, that is something in fact that I would probably be visiting the doctor for.  Other reasons would be just worrying if something may be wrong.  Most of it is due to the fact that I have an anxiety problem and it doesn't really take anything to make me that way.
-1	I am only anxious if something might not be covered by my health insurance plan. My biggest worry is money.
1	I dont like waiting. Then I worry that they might find something wrong with me.
1	No one ever wants to hear bad news about their health and when you don't see a physician often, it's likely that there may be underlying issues you are not aware of.
-1	Other people that are there that may be sick, and I end up catching what they have.
-1	I get worried I won't have the time to ask everything I need,  or that I put it off too long. 
-1	Just that I would rather be somewhere else.  I am usually OK, but there is always that thought that they might find something.  But then again, that is a good thing because then we can treat it.
-1	When I am there because I know something is wrong, i dislike the suspense of waiting.
-1	"That there might be something wrong with me that I just didn't ""feel""."
1	Even though my overall health is good, I always worry when I go to the doctor that she is going to find something wrong with me. This is not based on any real evidence or health concerns, but I still worry about it quite a bit.
-1	Just the uncertainty of which tests I have to undergo and what shots are going to be given to me.
-1	"I get anxious about how the doctor will treat me and whether they will take me seriously.  I'm usually more worried about the doctor dismissing me than I am about them finding a serious health problem.  I also worry about the inevitable ""you're fat"" lecture.  I know it matters, but it still makes me feel bad."
1	The thought of having your blood drawn makes me cringe.
-1	When I have a problem and I work myself up by googling signs and symptoms which usually tends to point me towards the worst case scerio.  When i go to the doctor to confirm my conditions, I get anxious waiting to hear what I really have going on.
1	If I already have a bad feeling before going to a doctor then I will be worried that they might confirm my suspicions.
1	I am anxious about what the doctor might find about my health.  Even though I am a healthy individual, there are always some uncertainties.  I just anxious about what he might find even though I believe he will find nothing.
-1	I haven't felt anxious or worried about visiting a doctor's office since I was a small child. I don't really enjoy sitting nude with nothing but a paper shirt on, but it doesn't make me anxious or worried. 
1	With some health care providers in the past, I felt that they were too rushed and a little rough. During my first pregncy, I saw one doctor in the practice who gave me a quick, rough interl exam. Even my husband was cringing. When a doctor's bedside manner is impersol and they seem rushed for time, it usually makes me feel nervous, and I am much less likely to ask questions, lest I annoy the doctor.
-1	"Nothing. I don't worry or get anxious. Worry is a waste of time. Mark Twain said ""I have worried about a lot of things in my life, and some of them actually happened.""  People need to relax. If anything, maybe the bill would worry me, or that a treatment needed would be way too expensive to get. "
1	I just generally feel that I am worried to discover that something is wrong with me. If I am just there for a checkup, you never know what it is you are going to find out. Just the atmosphere of being around other suffering people makes me anxious.
1	I hate going at the doctor, maybe it's that sense of uncertainty that kills me.. I fear the physical pain but I can bear it well enough.
1	I mostly feel anxious when I am at the doctor because I don't like needles or pain whatsoever. If I have to give blood or get an exam, I get so nervous because the pain makes me feel sick.
1	Not having a proper conversation that may get to a root.
1	I am afraid they will find something wrong with me!  I do not like them trying to talk me into testing that I do not want.  I used to fuss about my weight and my blood pressure.
-1	I'm not worried as much about the examition as I am about finding that there is something wrong with me. I always worry that I will have a bad disease or contract something that could be bad, even fatal for me.
-1	I might be worried something might be found that might be bad but I try to be optimistic and pray.
1	I just hate being out of my element and hate having people I don't know touch me
-1	My weight always makes me feel anxious and discouraged. Discussion around how much medication will cost makes me anxious. The wait in the waiting room usually makes me feel worried and irritated.
1	Will I be helped or just shoved through the system?  We don't see doctors anymore unless we can pay their price to see them.  We see s now and while I'm sure they are very good I'd like to know why doctors are letting them take over when they went to school for.
1	I am a bit uncomfortable being social in general outside of people I know very well, so I'm usually more worried I am going to make a fool of myself. I also worry that the doctor will be disappointed with the ways I have been handling myself, even though I've never been treated harshly for such a thing. Filly, there is always the small worry of finding out about a debilitating condition that might change my life.
1	Getting some sty infectious disease or being given news about some complication with regards to my health. I really don't trust doctors or visiting them for any reason. I try to stay relatively healthy to avoid having to go to one.
1	Having found the possibility of a life threatening diagnosis.  If not then a chronic disease.
1	"I am always worries about getting ""grim news"" about a symptom I go see my doctor about.  I know being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness is rare, but I always feel I will be one of the unlucky ones who gets that bad news."
1	I get anxious just being there. I am a person with high anxiety, so just being in the doctors office causes me as great deal of anxiety. I also get anxious that something will be wrong with me.
-1	When I go to the doctor's office for something serious - that isn't just a regular checkup - I'm more worried about what's wrong with me than what the doctor's gon do to me. I know my doctors aren't going to do anything weird, or try to make me take any weird medicine that doesn't actually work so that I'll just keep coming back to them. I feel like I can actually trust my doctors, even though I understand that not everyone feels that way with their own doctors.
1	I don't like attention being on me. I always feel anxious when being seen for myself (and not my kids) and being examined. I would prefer to just skip over all of it!
1	I am overweight and I know that the doctor will say something about that - and that may be what is causing some issues.  I just don't want to hear that I have something really wrong with me.  Most of that is just in my head, but I still get worried that it may be true.
1	I worry about what could be wrong with me.  It's not the doctor that makes me nervous. It's dealing with sickness.
1	how to describe what's going on with me so that I can get real help, not just lip service.  
1	Because I'am getting older not any younger.
1	The only thing that makes me nervous is the thought of my doctor actually finding something that could potentially kill me.  I get extremely nervous sometimes, but so far it's always be fine.
-1	The long wait
1	I expect bad news. Usually i go to doctors when something is wrong so im on edge anyway.
1	I only have two doctors. I don't like going to my primary care doctor because I don't feel any connection with him. I only go when I really have to, and I feel like I'm judged there, both by my doctor somewhat, and by his assistants. I don't get anxious or worried when I visit my other doctor. 
1	Getting wrong advice because I don't fully understand medical language.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried about going to see a doctor is that I'm very nervous to tell someone my problems because they might not understand or they might judge me. 
-1	I would be worried that something may be bad as I get older.  I typically have good health, but always think the next visit could show a bad diagnosis, worse health, etc...something that could impact my family as well as myself.
-1	As I get older I worry a little bit each time that I could have some disease that people tend to get as they get older but it hasn't happened yet.
-1	I only feel anxious if I feel like the doctor has something to tell me but aren't being straight with me. 
1	Bad news. That is all that needs to be said. There may be things that are wrong with you and you may find out on that visit. You could have cancer, you could have lupus- there are thousands of potential scerios that will start to unfold after that visit and its only human to be scared of those potential outcomes.
1	First off I have social anxiety and general anxiety. So everything makes me anxious.  Second off having a strange person poke and prod at me bothers me to a high degree.  Then there is the worry about whether something is wrong physically with me.  
1	I know that they are there to make money.  I don't want to be another product along the factory line.
-1	Im most anxious that the doctor will miss something important, just give me a medication that I don't need and then push me out the door to fend for myself.
1	I had GAD, so even small issues cause my anxiety to kick into overdrive.
-1	Nothing, it doesn't make me anxious to go to the doctor.
-1	I feel most anxious when I know that I will have to undergo some kind of testing. Sometimes I worry about receiving negative results, or the doctor finding something unexpected. I worry that I might have an illness that could possibly be debilitating or even life-threatening.
-1	Fear of the unknown. Afraid of receiving a diagnosis that is far worse than something I have previously suspected.
1	Fear of receiving bad news, fear of a painful procedure, fear of expensive medical bill
1	I feel nervous that they might find something seriously wrong with me. I like to avoid the doctor sometimes for that reason.
-1	I worry about the cost of the care I am receiving.
1	I am worried something is wrong with me, or what other tests and labs or procedures might be recommended. I also worry about money. Sometimes I worry that I am not explaining my issues correctly, or that my doctor is not considering all angles of my care, even though I know he tries. 
-1	I am usually most concerned that the doctors will find some health issue that I was not aware of or that I am not taking care of myself well enough. 
-1	The feeling of the unknown is probably what makes me the most anxious.  I try not to think too hard about it, but there is always a possibility of getting bad news when anyone is visiting the doctor.  
-1	It's the unknown, the uncertainty of it.  If I am there, it's because I was uble to figure it out on my own, or uble to gain access to what I need to treat myself.  Again, a Dr should be viewed as a partner in helping you achieve good health.
1	I always feel anxious when I have to wait for test results. I am also anxious when a doctor does not have a quick solution to my health problems.
1	I get most anxious about being diagnosed with something else, haha. The doctor doesn't make me nervous, just the whole idea of potentially having another thing wrong with me.
1	Just the uncertainty of it all. Not knowing if what's wrong with me is serious or mind running away with it all. Thankfully almost every time I thought there was something serious wrong with me it turned out to be nothing. But I have bad anxiety and a panic disorder so it's the worry and not knowing that makes it hard for me to deal with. Once I leave there though I usually feel fine and relieved.
-1	Generally, I'm not worried, unless I'm in pain from a specific problem.  Then, of course, I'm concerned about finding a solution for the pain.
-1	I suppose there is a degree of the unknown. They is always the possibility of them finding something unexpected. Overall, I'm comforted to see a doctor and know they are looking after me.
1	I am anxious about all of the things they check regularly because these things are likely to have some result or they would not check for them in the first place. 
-1	Getting to my appointment on time.
-1	I don't have any anxious feelings. I've know this doctor for many years and he is a nice person as well as a good doctor.
-1	I have not had to go to the doctor's office the last few years so I do not recall, I guess it would be when I see needles, though the nice nurses tend to make the anxiety go away
-1	When i feel something is wrong with my body and I'm hoping it is nothing too bad. 
-1	I am worried that my blood pressure will be high or my weight will be high because i haven't done what she told me to do and I haven't been following the diet that I agreed to follow. I am also worried about finding something else wrong with me. 
1	If I go to the doctor's office, it's because I already know that something is wrong.  I'm in tune with my body and only go to the doctor's when absolutely necessary.  So, I get anxious if I can't tell what's wrong with me and worried about the diagnosis; some people in my family died fairly young.
-1	Just the uncertainty of the experience. Not knowing if the doctor is going to discover that something is wrong.
1	My doctor seems reluctant to prescribe me certain medications, and it makes me think that he views me as someone who is drug seeking.
1	I am always most anxious about my weight.  I continually try to lose weight, but am much heavier than I would like to be.
-1	The sterility.
-1	I don't want to hear any bad news, so it is a little worrisome to have an examition by a doctor. However, if it is a problem which is rather simple like a cold or the flu, then I'm not too worried about those situations.
1	I worry because I have bad habits. I know he' going to tell me things I don't want to hear.
-1	The only thing that typically makes me nervous is the doctor finding something that concerns him that I had not recognized in myself.  The fear of being diagnosed with a serious illness, even though i'm not having any symptoms, is really what makes me anxious.
1	That the doctor is going to find or determine that I have an issue or condition I was uware of or not expecting.
1	The thing that makes me most anxious is probably the possibility of having some horrible disease. For all I know, I could go in for a checkup feeling fine and walk out knowing that I have cancer. At the same time I get kind of worried about the doctor misdiagnosing me or missing something important.
1	I have a lifelong phoboa of doctors/hospitals, etc. Big time. Comes from a near death when I was three. Ratiolly/intellectually I know it is safe and good and helpful, but my body and mind go FEAR to the enth power. I even sweat walking by an ambulance. Have tried everything and can't undo it. 
-1	I am usually not very anxious about going and seeing a doctor.  Seeing a new doctor for the first time always makes me anxious or if I'm worried about my current symptoms and her diagnosis but generally, I'm not anxious about seeing my current doctor when I need to.
1	Just the fact that I'm sick enough to be at the doctor's is enough to make me sick. Then I also start worrying about how I'm going to come up with the money to pay the over-inflated doctors' fees.
1	The one thing that makes me anxious is not knowing if there may be some things or issues I might have that I am not aware of. 
1	What makes me anxious or worried is the uncertainty of not knowing what might be causing me to feel unwell. Whether is it something serious or minor.
-1	I guess it is the fear of not knowing.
1	I tend to worry a great deal about the bill.  This makes me overall anxious of the types of tests, etc.  When I am going for a specific issue - as opposed to a check up - I am often a little anxious about what the issue will be.  Will it cause me pain?  Can I recover quickly and easily or will it be on going?  Will it be expensive to treat?
1	I am most anxious or worried about them finding something I did not expect that will negatively impact my health. I am also worried that they will tell me I have been doing something wrong or that I am putting on too much weight.
-1	I'm in good health so I am never nervous about seeing my doctor. I go once a year for a check-up. The only thing that bothers me is the blood draw that he orders each time, this is needed to monitor my PSA because of a previous cancer diagnosis.  I also don't care much for the colonoscopy I must endure every three years.
1	I always feel like I may be getting judged and also wondering about the outcome. 
1	Im always worried that there may be something more serious wrong with me than what I think there is. It always makes me paranoid that I will find out something negative.
1	I hate feeling like I might have some lingering undetectable disease that's going to kill me at any time and suddenly finding out about it and realizing I only have a few months to live.
-1	I'm generally worried about my condition. Or the news they'll give me. Or some intrusive test.
-1	When I go because I do not feel well it makes me anxious that they will not find anything wrong and I will continue to suffer because they cant figure out whats wrong.
1	i worry about getting weighed when i go to the doctor. i don't want to gain a few pounds and the doctor say something to me about it. i also worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me and then i'll have to deal with a tough situation. another thing i worry about is sweating. i get nervous about seeing the doctor for whatever reason and i get sweaty. that's kind of embarrassing.
1	It's just a weird experience altogether. Having a stranger poke and prod me is not something that makes me feel comfortable. They ask a lot of questions and the little gowns are way too small and don't make me feel any less ked.
-1	I have had a serious condition in the past. It's not the doctor it's what she might find.
1	The only thing that would make me feel worried was if I was really sick or though that a really bad diagnosis was on it's way.   Not knowing what is wrong is the main worry that I would have.
1	Nothing in particular about visiting the doctor, except for the last one I visited. (I tend to be a bit high strung or anxious, anyway; I have chronic clinical depression.)
1	I worry that there will be something seriously wrong even if I am just going in for a cold.  Many times I think about what could be the worst possible scerio as far as sickness could go.  Or I am afraid that the doctor won't be able to figure out what the problem is and I will have to continue to be in pain.
1	I always get uneasy when a doctor is feeling around my body. I'm always waiting for a bad response, like a lump or something that shouldn't be there.
1	Just the nervousness of being there. I don't like visiting and you always worry a bit that something may really be wrong. 
1	What makes me feel most anxious is that the doctor will start telling me that some of my symptoms are all in my head or that the doctor will decide that he wants to try some new treatment.  I am very drug sensitive and don't do well when I have to take a new drug.  I have had way too many bad reactions to medications, so now I have anxiety over any new medication I try.
1	"I worry that I'm going to find out the treatment for whatever is wrong with me is going to be uvailable to me due to cost. Also I hate the general ""invasion of privacy"" feeling that it causes, particularly if I happen not to be alone when I am visiting the doctor."
-1	Nothing really. I'm always calm about going to the doctor, even if I do feel sick or injured. I guess I just think positive the entire time. I don't know. It never bothered me or worried to go and see a doctor.
-1	I only feel anxious or worried if I suspect something's wrong with me. Otherwise I'm always pretty relaxed in the doctor's office, and pretty comfortable with the nurses and staff in general.
-1	I have HIV so I am always worried that my medications may stop working or if I am starting a new treatment that it may not be as useful as my prior regime.
-1	When I first started going to him it had been quite a while since I have had a primary doctor. I was very anxious about my test results. I had 2 serious issues. The first one is completely under control now. We are working on the second. This had decreased my anxiety. I guess my anxiety stems from not knowing about any issues I have.
-1	I guess I am sometimes anxious when I feel I might have something wrong with me. I get a bit worried about what it actually is and whether it is dangerous. Otherwise I am never worried about the actually doctor's office visit itself.
1	Well when its a cold or the flu it isn't that bad. It's when you don't know what illness you have that's really scary. When you have this unexplained pain that doesn't go away and you mistakenly look on the internet for answers towards what it may be. Even without the internet, sitting there with pain in an area that could have a serious illness like cancer, waiting for the doctor to come back with his diagnoses would make anyone anxious. Simply, people fear hearing the possibility of bad news, no matter how big or small. 
-1	Because at home my blood pressure is good but as soon as the doctor comes in to take it, it goes up
1	I worry about the communication aspect of a doctor's visit. I know that I will not ask the questions that I should ask and may not remember the information they have told me.
1	finding out something bad
-1	Anything that requires a time-delay worries me: bloodwork, urine alysis, etc. The lab can take a while and my mind always wanders to the worst that could happen. 
1	Mostly my weight. It has been an issue due to some of the medications I am on. I worry that I have gained weight each time I visit and that my doctor will comment on it. I also worry about the blood test results I have done each month and hope that they reflect that the medications I am on are working so I don't have to change medications yet again.
-1	It makes me feel most anxious or worried when the doctor wants to do numerous tests without explaining why those tests are necessary.
-1	What makes me anxious and worried is that they do not listen to what I want or trying to do things a tural way. They just blindly follow protocol and make money for big pharma. Free healthcare is one thing but It would be so much better if we could afford decent rent and space to take care of our well being instead of expensive rent, small spaces and cheap food so that we are stressed and unhealthy. 
1	I have more of an untural fear of doctors and dentists. This is most likely due to the fact that I so seldom need to see a doctor. If I had been unhealthy and seen a lot of doctors, I suspect I would be way more comfortable with the process. But I assume it's much better to be healthy and see a doctor seldom and to be sick and see a doctor so often as to not be uncomfortable.  :)
1	I worry that a simple problem is actually the beginning stages of something serious. I also worry that the doctor may miss something that leads to prescribing the wrong medication.
1	Finding a difficult to cure physical problem
1	Just being there meaning something is wrong just puts me in an anxious mood.
1	I don't like the atmosphere of doctors offices. I don't like feeling like just another number coming through. I don't feel like I'm being heard or cared about when I am visiting the doctor. 
-1	if it is a follow up for something unknown
-1	That he's going to tell me something bad. I worry I'll have some medical condition that requires extensive treatment.
-1	I don't like having blood drawn. This is the only part of my doctor visits that I don't like. 
1	I'm worried that the doctor will find something that is detrimental to my health. I also don't like people touching me. I'm nervous to find out my weight.
-1	Sometimes just the unknown. It takes awhile in the doctor's office to wait. Also, what if on the off  chance there is bad news healthwise? Those are things that comes to mind.
-1	I only get anxious/worried if I think I could have a serious health problem - and the doctor is giving me feedback on it. It is typically something I am familiar with so I am not that worried.
1	I am always most anxious to see if my Doctor is in a bad mood or not. I see my doctor every 4 weeks and we have a tough relationship. I am kind and calm but I am not afraid to advocate for myself. I also become anxious when I am sick and would like to know the my outcome of illness.
1	That they will give me bad news, and that the treatment will be something I'm uncomfortable with. 
1	I just don't like going. It smacks of weakness and it invades my privacy. It's also time consuming and expensive.
-1	Just the waiting process makes me nervous because I just want to get it over with. Usually, doctors visits have been pleasant but I just want to get them over with so I can continue my day. If I sit in the office waiting for a long time, I start getting stressed over the potential wait in regards to whatever I have planned after, and it just makes me nervous overall waiting.
1	I feel anxious or worried that I may find ou bad news. I worry that some of my bad habits may have caught up with me. I am concerned I will receive bad test results 
1	Concern that there may be something severely wrong with me.  I also would hate to get blood drawn. 
1	I am sometimes worried about what diagnosis the doctor may give when I have a serious health concern. I also get worried that the doctor may dismiss my concerns or that I won't be taken seriously.
1	If I have something wrong with me that is concerning me that I want looked at, yes I feel anxious. If I am just going for a yearly wellness visit, I am at ease.
-1	When I have a gynecological or sensitive problem that I feel embarrassed about. I'm getting to be less worried about that but especially when I was young that was a main area of discomfort.
1	If I visit a doctor's office, I'm worried about several things. I worry that something is wrong with me and it's going to be worse than I imagined. I also worry that I will be misdiagnosed, and I also worry about what the doctor or his nurses think of me, particularly if I have to disrobe during the examition.
1	im scared what they are going to tell me about my condition and the  office just makes me uneasy, it is not like im going there for a good reason.
-1	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because I can never be completely sure what diagnosis I am going to get. It would be silly to say I wasn't worried or anxious that I could get some negative news regarding my health.
-1	Even though I'm comfortable at my doctors office and have known him for years, I always get a little anxious when going in for an exam. I think it's mostly because I'm worried about what they'll find that's wrong. Most of the time it's only something minor or nothing at all, but I still get a little worried.
-1	I will be worried if they will told me to undergo medication because I will need money in order to that.  I hate expenses.
-1	When we're no longer young we are always fearful of a Dr finding some health problem that we may be uware of but I'm in extremely good health so I'm not really anxious when I see my PCP. I'm more anxious about my insurance company denying payment for something or the government (congress) screwing up insurance and chasing sll the Drs out of the profession.
-1	Just the idea that even though everything feels and looks good, there's the possibility that something is wrong. The unknown is what makes me the most worried.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office.
1	I'm anxious about the doctor discovering something that's going to dramatically change my life. There's always the possibility that something dire might turn up.
-1	I don't worry much when visiting the doctor.
-1	I dont like needels  
-1	I'm more worried about the cost than anything else. I'm very healthy, but I'm afraid of the high cost of falling ill and having any medical issue. That's what concerns me the most 
1	I feel anxious at the doctor because I never know what they will tell me. That alone worries me. What do I have to pay for next is the question in my head.
-1	The bills afterwards. I am not really to anxious with the visits.
-1	In good general health. Not expecting any surprises. Mostly go for routine annual checkups.
-1	What the diagnosis will be. If there is anything wrong with me. 
-1	The possibility that I may be examined health problems.
-1	Nothing really nowâ because we have had the same Doctor for several years and we know him and converse openly with him. He is friendly and remembers persol details about us which help a lot. He is always open and honest and has always taken very good care of us when we have had needs. We both go to the Doctor regularly and because of that and our relationship with the Doctor there is a large level of comfort now
-1	Anixous that there will be something wrong.
1	Obviously, that something is wrong. That you've gone in for something routine and there may be more going on than what you were prepared for. For example, going in for something that you thought was a swollen lymph node and being apprehensive that it could be cancer. I think about these sorts of things when I have an appointment. 
-1	What worries me is the possibility of the doctor finding something seriously wrong, like cancer. Other than that I don't really worry about doctor appointments.
-1	If they were to tell me that I have a loss or restriction of mobility.
-1	The only thing that i usually dislike is getting my blood pressure taken. Not only have the PA's taken incorrect readings on many occasions, but , because i had hypertension in the past (since resolved) i still fear getting a high reading. Usually my heart rate elevates a bit while i'm getting it done. 
-1	I am most worried about whether or not the diagnosis will be something minor or major.
-1	a possibility to hear something bad about my health
-1	I feel worried if I think I will get a bad result or hear something I don't want to. I also get nervous around needles. 
-1	If I'm sick but I don't know what I have, I might be a little anxious to hear what the diagnosis is.
-1	i dont. i am healthy and i have a healthy lifestyle
-1	Wondering if something is wrong
-1	Just hearing her 'official' word on lab results, I'd say. I've normally already looked at the numbers thanks to an online portal where they post results, but I don't necessarily know what they mean and I don't generally feel like doing research (e.g. to see if a small change in my triglycerides is significant) when I know I'll see her within a week (lab work always a week before I see her, results usually online a few days prior to appointment with her). It's ever so slight. 
-1	I can't put a finger on it, but possibly hearing that I am doing poorly in some aspect of my health.  I try to be a healthy person, but it would be hard to hear that something is seriously wrong, and I guess that's where I become anxious.
-1	I don't get anxious at the doctor's office. If I have something wrong with me and they run tests then I might worry about the results, but otherwise I'm pretty calm.
-1	The possibility that they could find something wrong with me.
1	I am anxious because I can't predict my results. I am most scared of being told my health is in a poor state. Bad news could possibly come out and I wouldn't know what to do about it. 
-1	Waiting around sick people, more often than most.
1	i have hypertension and when i go to the doctor, my bp is typically higher than outside the office. the thought of it going higher at the office makes it go higher at the office if you know what i mean. i also don't being weighed as i am currently overweight.
-1	I am afraid they will find something wrong with me.  I don't want to find out a have an expensive or deadly issue.
1	I am worried there might be a problem I'm not aware of, especially high blood pressure or thyroid issues which run in my family. I also feel like the nurse and doctors at the practice I go to don't really listen to my concerns much. 
1	My anxiety when visiting a doctor's office is pretty irratiol, but I can't deny that I feel it. It's largely because of the uncertainty of the experience. Even if I feel that I am in good health, it's possible that the doctor could tell me I am in poor health or have a condition I was uware of. Though knowing about the condition would be positive overall, it is a frightening thing. 
1	I used to feel worried when discussing the symptoms and progression of sickness. Now I don't care to the same degree unless I am presented with a new symptom. 
-1	nothing -I do get upset and tend to walk out if he she has not seen me within 30 minutes of my appointment
-1	I feel afraid that the doctor won't have enough time for me, or he'll brush off my questions. Those are my two biggest concerns when I go to the doctor. I don't like my opinion to be brushed off or disregarded, and I hate feeling as though my concerns don't matter. It also makes me really anxious that I wait 45 minutes to see a doctor and then the overall appointment takes only 90 seconds. It just makes me feel really worried that I'm not getting the care or attention that I should be. 
1	I HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS.
-1	I think what would make me feel most anxious would be if my doctor found something wrong with me
-1	I WAS FEELING WORRIED ABOUT FINDING OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME OR IF MY CONDITION WAS IMPROVING. I GUESS I AM ALWAYS ANXIOUS ABOUT GETTING ON MORE MEDICATION THAN I WANT TO.
-1	I hate needles and whenever going to the doctor, that is my first thought that makes me anxious, are they going to want to give me a shot. Since I do not take pills, sometimes a shot is needed and I hate those. But, I can take them without much pain, it's just the idea- maybe some fear left over from childhood- I don't know. But, that is mainly what makes me anxious. The other thing is doctors always have to rub or push wherever it hurts and that bothers me.
1	I always feel anxious and worried about what may be the outcome of whatever is going on.
1	What makes me anxious is the possibility of having a serious condition. I know it's just a small chance of it, but just the possibility of that make me very nervous and scared. 
-1	I usually have alot of visits to the doctor because of a few health issues i have. And always when i get examined i am anxious even thou i know i am okay i would always be anxious cause you never know how your body is going to change wether in a good way or bad.
1	The fact that they make assumptions and don't listen to me. I've witnessed them giving incorrect information to other people and I'm always annoyed that they will do the same to me. So just based off of previous encounters, I dread that. 
-1	It is a woman and though I am not ashamed to undress for her,it still leels a little bit uneasy.I would feel worried,when I have to see her,when I have sudden complaints,that don't go away.
-1	Obviousley, him finding out I'm sick. Him finding out something on me is broken. Or even him telling me I'm uble to reproduce. 
-1	Most of my anxiety comes from the doctor feeling that I need further testing beyond what is covered by my insurance. 
-1	The possibility of finding something I don't want hear.
-1	Not really much does.   I am a level headed person.  The only thing that would make me anxious is if I felt something was wrong, not with the care I actually receive.
-1	nothing makes me feel most anxious and worried when visiting the doctor's office... 
-1	Only if its about something new that could be something very bad, or just awaiting answers on previous tests. Otherwise im always fine.
-1	 Not knowing what the outcome will be. Wondering if they will be able to figure out what's wrong, and give me the proper treatment. 
1	I am always concerned that they will find something that will require further testing. In my past experience, further tests can be expensive and painful, and for me have always turned out fine. But even still, it is scary to decide to ignore the doctor's advice and not do further tests. 
-1	I have always been anxious when I go in for a physical , hoping the results be favorable
1	worried about getting illnesses
1	I'm very overweight, and I worry about disappointing my doctor because I haven't lost any.
-1	Poor communication makes me wonder about the doctor.
-1	I am always a little hesitant when I go to the doctor because I very rarely go (other than annual exams). If I am there then it is for a valid reason. Perhaps that why I am usually a little hesitant and worried. I am worried about what they will tell me. I always have my children on my mind and worry about not being well enough to care for them. 
-1	I worry that he might find something that I didn't know about.  Like some growth or cancer or something.  It's just the unknown and then what it might lead to. 
-1	I only sometimes experience slight anxiety. This comes from a general sense that there could be something wrong with my health.
1	Now we cannot see the Dr.'s we trust. We have to see Dr.'s that are assigned to us. Usually, I am rushed through or disrespected. I don't go for this reason. I'll just die in my home. 
1	You are always a bit on edge hoping that you won't find out you have a terrible illness. I feel like I don't know my doctor anymore so it's very impersol and makes you feel a bit awkward in telling someone so much about you. I also feel like there isn't enough time to be told things in detail.
-1	I think I'm always just worried about what they are going to find out next. After all is said and done I feel all the anxiety is gone.
1	I feel anxious because I know she is always going to find something wrong. If it isn't my thyroid it is something else. I am worried because she always wants to put me on that blood pressure medicine with a diuretic, which made me sick and pass out constantly last time. My doctor is a real piece of work. She doesn't think of the tural approach to things.
1	I know that my specific concerns will likely not be addressed
-1	I am more worried that the might find something wrong with me. I don't really ever think about being sick until I go to the doctor's office. 
1	Now that I am getting older, I worry they may find something that could be serious.
-1	My cholesterol levels and my sugar levels. I have high cholesterol though my LDL is good so not concerning. My sugar levels have spiked the last few years and several times I have been warned of pre-diabeties.
1	Generally I am worried about the possibility of needing to get my blood drawn, as I have a severe phobia of injections.
-1	When a treatment is not working and we have to explore altertives
-1	well if it is not my own doctor I guess the thing I would be worried about would be judgement or not listening to me.
-1	As I get older, there is always the fear of what they might find - something that just pops up.
-1	I feel most anxious about getting a bad diagnosis. But on the flip side I also feel anxious that my doctor will not take my symptoms seriously and will think I'm overreacting (it's happened to me too many times).
1	Fincial requirements are number one. I have insurance but can not afford very much out of pocket expense. As far as whether the treatment is correct, I seldom worry about that cause I can just skip the recommended treatment when I get home. So I have to make sure whatever is done is covered by insurance or I probably will not do it.
-1	That the doctor might find something wrong with my health.
-1	because of my past history, my body is not how a normal healthy person my  age is. It seems like everytime I go to the drs. it seems like something else pops up
-1	Don't really feel worried. Just depends if its something major would make me feel worried. 
-1	The language barrier.
-1	I am afraid that my blood pressure is going to be high and then this will be the visit I'm stuck on blood pressure meds.
1	just the waiting to see what he or she says
-1	The thought of having a newly discovered illness is what tends to worry me the most about visiting a doctor. I always have a fear when new tests are run the doctor may discover cancer or some other life-threatening illness.
1	I am a generally anxious and uneasy person. I takes a lot for me to trust someone on a persol level. Therefore, my visit's to the doctor tend to bring on anxiety and worry.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried is going in there paying my co-pay and them not listen to me.  I do not go to the doctors if there really is not a problem.  I do not like going to the doctors.  So I get worried every time I go there because it is more than likely them not listening to my problems again.
-1	I get a little worried when my doctor recommends something I don't want to do (like a colonoscopy). In general, however, I am not worried at all. My doctor knows that I might not agree with everything he says and I always have the option of going to another doctor.
-1	I might have to waste some time in the waiting room.  I prefer to spend my time as I choose to spend it.
-1	I feel these feelings sometimes because i do not always know what to expect from my doctor. I also dont know what they may find wrong with me if anything. It is always a nerve wrecking experience.
-1	I have a general anxiety disorder so sometimes even the most common events can make me feel anxious. It really has nothing to do with the appointment. it just happens.
-1	"Always experiencing the worst case scerio when identifying illness. For instance, ""my leg pain is getting bad"" with the doctor response of ""well, I guess we should saw it completely off""."
1	The actual exam. I just don't like people touching me that way.
1	The exam itself especially from a gynecologist. I hate being nude even with a Dr I really like and trust. I feel exposed.
1	The whole think.  The waiting, the gowns, the sterile environment.  It makes me very anxious.
1	Being told things I already know or cannot do anything about makes me feel anxious. Also, being examined makes me feel vulnerable. I had an ob once who called me fat the entire time I was pregnt and that I would be obese after giving birth. I knew I had gained a lot of weight but I was eating well and was exercising. Being pregnt I felt like I had no control over being able to actually lose weight until after giving  birth. It ended up I had edema and lost 45lbs in 4 weeks after delivery but ever since sometimes I feel anxious, dread or worrysome when doctors tell me something I already know eapecially if it is something I have little control over or are currently working on.
-1	I sometimes feel worried when visiting the doctors office because if I am there it's because I'm not feeling well.  But I feel regular checkups are a good thing to stay healthy.
-1	If I have a real issue that is not just pedantic-like complaining---that it will not be thoroughly dealt with due to insufficient time alone. That would be some mega bullshit. It's why Im trying to learn a lot as to how I can effectively help myself through altertive medicine options such as aryuvedic. 
-1	How seevere is my condition.Some doctors like to practice fear mongering.
-1	For now, I don't feel that way because I trust my Doctor so much.Seems that he is my family or brother
-1	I am worried that my doctor will discover a health issue and not be able to adequately explain the cause or offer treatment solutions.
1	That I've either come in about an issue that's too trivial to need a doctor's attention, or that I've waited too long on an issue when I should have known it was more serious. Basically that there are multiple ways my own judgement could be wrong. That I'll embarrass myself by making a bigger deal out of something than is warranted. That I might have to redirect a conversation of the doctor seems to jump to wrong conclusions or makes bad assumptions.
1	What makes me feel worried is the thought of a bad health report. As I get older and my body starts to slow down, I feel I'm more prone to bad health. What if I suddenly have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, or my urine shows signs of XYZ, etc, If a doctor comes back with news like that, it's sure to have me worried at least a little.
1	it might be bad experiences in my childhood
-1	That they will find something wrong/incurable. 
1	It makes me feel worried that the doctor might discover a problem during the examition that I didn't know about.
-1	I do not feel worried about a visit.
-1	I get anxious about my lab results for my condition and also about my weight. 
1	I would feel out-of-control.  I would feel depersolized and treated as a body.  I would feel vulnerable.
1	When I visit a Doctor's office, it is because I am already showing symptoms of something that has not gone away on its own. As a result, I am already worried prior to the visit, as if it doesn't go away on its own, it may be serious.
-1	THat something will be wrong with me.
1	I'm always worried that what they think is wrong with me is incorrect. I think that it is something worse than what it is.
1	I'm worried they will find something.  I'm worried that the doctor may think less of me because I'm overweight.
1	That the doctor may find something wrong. That I may not be taken seriously. General anxiety and panic due to mental health issues.
1	I do not like to be touched by people, so being examined is extremely stressful to me.  I am also a nervous person in general, so it does not take much to get me worked up.  I tend to be pessimistic, so it is easy for me to assume the worst about health conditions.  I (and members of my family) have been brushed off when we did bring up medical complaints, so I tend to worry whether the doctor will take my complaints seriously.     
1	Going to the doctor's office makes me feel like I'm going to take a test I haven't studied for. I'm fearful of potential health defects but also of just being judged in general. I am aware on a logical level that this is silly but the feelings persist anyways.
-1	I persolly just dislike the actual procedures. I'm not fond of the actual process as I am a very private person.
1	The possibility of health issues is always a concern. However, I am quite an anxious individual, so just the base process of attending this appointment fills me with an uneasiness and a sense of dread. I feel a lack of confidence and a sense of embarrassment, even seemingly without just cause.
-1	Cost of treatment Treating the pain or injury I have would cause me to stop doing something I like to do.
1	I hate having to slightly disrobe for something that is no fun at all! If the doctor looked like Brad Pitt, then I would be happy to go. 
1	That they will discover I have some horrible illness or that I will need some awful treatment. I also just dislike the environment (cold, reeking of disinfectant).
-1	Asking everything I want to.  Not forgetting something.  Trying not to be too much of an annoyance.
-1	I feel a bit anxious when I visit the doctor simply because I'm in a position where I may learn some worrisome things about my health. The potential is always there for negative news when you're visiting the doctor, so a bit of anxiousness seems inevitable. 
1	Being in that paper gown makes me uncomfortable. You aren't always at your best when you need to visit the doctor. I may have a serious problem or feel very sick.
-1	Its the whole scene of making the trip their, sitting in the waiting room, surrounded by strangers and their aliments with my my thoughts that drift off to cooler place I wish to be. 
1	"I have had fairly aggressive responses from professiols when I ask them simple questions. When I ask my healthcare providers questions I either get unsatisfactory answers or outright defiance. It is too easy to offend a medical professiol by ""questioning them"". Studies show that for a therapist their compassion is more highly correlated with their success than their skillset or education. As computers become more capable of diagnosing health problems (and as most doctors just put your symptoms into google these days anyway), I think we will have less autistic doctors that can ace any test and less stress in the doctor's office."
-1	Uncertainty about my illness, or the treatment I may need.
-1	its usally a long wait when I go to the doctors the waiting makes me anxious and when I have to wait to get results makes me feel worried some times.
-1	I have a condition that is called white coat syndrome. When I go to the doctor even though I do not feel different my bp rises. After I settle down I come out normal. I do sometime feel a little bit nervous when getting back blood tests but other than that I look forward to seeing my doctor. 
-1	They could find that something is wrong with me.
-1	that he might lie to me in order to make me feel better
-1	This depends highly on the current health situation. If I had a serious health issue, I'm sure I would feel some anxiety about the diagnosis and treatment. Maybe more so about the costs than anything else. 
-1	I feel like they might found something bad. I also think that I may have a bad condition.
1	I worry that I won't be taken seriously. I worry that I won't be able to get what I need. I feel anxious about experiencing prejudice (many healthcare professiols have prejudice against fat patients and transgender patients). I worry about the results of lab tests. 
-1	I guess whether or not something will be wrong with me that I'm not aware of. I don't normally think like this though. 
1	"I feel most anxious about the ""what ifs"". What if something were wrong, or something was gong to happen medically. I often get anxious about my interactions with a professiol, I am not a ""people"" person."
1	What makes me most worried when visiting the doctor is learning that I have an illness or other negative condition that was preventable. Next is learning about an illness or condition that is neither treatable nor preventable.
-1	Honestly the most anxious I get is over getting shots. I know they're important but they trigger a phobia in me and it makes me very uneasy to deal with it. 
1	I don't know what the outcome is going to be.  Is this going to be a serious issue?  Will it be expensive?  Perhaps, I'm also somewhat anxious about whether or not they will be able to tell me what is wrong at all.
-1	I always worry that they will look at my former diagnosis and decide or judge me verses taking a look at whats bothering me at the time. for instance, I was self medicating with alcohol, i came in drunk several times, so when i get asked several times if im still drinking in the same visit, its irritating. Are you sure you havent drank this week? its patronizing. 
-1	Nothing beyond whatever I'm there for.
-1	That I will be embarrassed, and also I worry about the result they will give me.
1	i always seem to get bad news. i hate being told or wondering if i am doing things right. everything seem so cold and sterile.
-1	Mostly just that the doctor is going to find something really bad.  I am not worried about what the doctor will do or the physical examition itself.  Just the part in the back of your mind that he may diagnose something very bad.  That is what makes me worried and a little uneasy.  Not a whole lot just in the back of my mind.
1	I've had so many health problems in the last 10 years that a visit to the Dr. is almost never good news.
1	That my knowledge of my body and my views about medicine and disease will not be respected. That I will be forced into treatments that run counter to my beliefs. That I will be abused and put through unnecessary procedures or tests.
1	I am worried about the cost, about whether or not the staff are friendly, if whatever I am going in there for is going to end up being something worse than I expected. There are a ton of reasons to feel complete and utter anxiety and worry while you're in there. That's why a lot of people don't go. 
-1	I am usually worried about the results of a blood test and just making sure my numbers are okay in general.
-1	I feel most anxious about anomalies showing up in my blood tests and the embarrassment of getting a pap smear.  But in general, I do not get anxious or worried when seeing a doctor.  I see doctor visits as a necessity, and any medical problems must be detected and dealt with head-on.
1	Nothing
-1	I tend to worry in general, and when I get blood work done I worry that my results will not be good. I worry that conditions that I have will not improve from one appointment to the next. I'm on medication for these conditions and I worry that a combition of these medications and changes I've made to my diet and lifestyle won't have a positive effect. So far I have had positive results, but I worry every time that that won't continue. When I first started seeing my primary care doctor I was worried that I might not like her or might not be comfortable with her, but we have developed a pretty good relationship. 
-1	I am generally not anxious when I see the doctor. I am rarely sick and just don't have much fear when I go see a doctor. I guess there is always a fear of something being terribly wrong with me but I tend not to think about that. I guess I am more anxious about picking up an illness at the doctor than anything else, like the flu.
-1	I don't like getting my blood drawn. I hate needles.
-1	I mainly worry when I am not certain about what is going on with my body. What is causing issues of illness.
-1	Just the out-of-routine occurance. A visit to the doctor is not a normal daily occurance for me.
1	whether i will get the best solution for me
1	I am most anxious about finding a reason and remedy for any health problems. I become worried about invasive and expensive testing that give no answers. I worry about being overlooked or ignored about my concerns.
-1	Wondering what battery of tests or measures may be necessary, whether something unplanned or unnounced will be painful or stressful.
1	Just doctor's in general make me nervous no matter how many times I have been. I think they call it white coat syndrome. I am fearful of a scary diagnosis even tho I have never had one before. 
1	Waiting for news. 
-1	It depends on the circumstances. I not usually anxious or worried at all about a routine examition. If I'm there because I'm injured or ill, I might be somewhat worried about my condition or the prognosis.
1	I'm afraid they will tell me something bad. 
1	The uncertainty of the potential outcome is what worries me most.  That uncertainty stems from a fear that something may be terribly wrong with me. Along with that, there's always the fear that either way, I'm going to have to undergo frightening procedures that may include getting needles (I have a phobia of them).
1	I think the biggest thing is that I always think the worst and assume I will get bad news a lot of times. It takes a lot for me to go to the doctor usually so when I do go I get nervous and anxious. 
1	When visiting the doctor's office, I feel most anxious about having my weight and blood pressure checked, because they are usually higher than recommended. I also feel stupid if I need to ask for clarification if I don't understand something the doctor said. And just being around people in general (in the waiting room, for example) makes me very anxious. I fear judgment and criticism, and also fear possibly becoming ill from sick patients.
-1	I feel anxious at time of visitation because I feel sometimes they will give me some negative results about my health.  
1	I am always a little worried that they are going to find something seriously wrong with me. The only doctors I have been to in the past few years are baby doctors and they are typically very good at relieving those worries.
1	I do not visit the doctor's office often but when I do I always automatically get an un-easy feeling of nervousness. I can not explain why I feel this way.
-1	My health is what worries me. Not knowing if something is seriously wrong. New doctors also make me a little anxious.
-1	Just the unsureness of what could be wrong with me. 
1	I am not an anxious or worrisome person, but I do often feel these emotions in a doctor's office. Sometimes I worry that my condition may be worse than I am assuming. Also, I guess as a gut feeling, I just don't like doctor's offices, which helps to invoke these emotions.
1	Cost is always a big factor and then you worry about what they may find and what treatments and/or prescriptions that you will have to take and what side effects could be included. 
1	Just being in a doctor's office makes me anxious. You know you are there because you're not feeling well, but you don't know the exact reason why and you never know what you might be diagnosed with. You also never know if the doctor is going to reprimand you about the way that you handle your health and that can be embarrassing and upsetting. I am a relatively private person and I hate putting myself so out there and that includes telling the doctor private health information.
-1	When I have to get on a scale. I hate getting on a scale...period. I'm not morbidly obese or anything, but it makes me very anxious. I wish people didn't insist on weighing  people everywhere. 
-1	Just the rush rush of it all. I do not really trust that dr's are really listening to what you are saying.
-1	I think that what makes me worried the most is that they might  find something really wrong. 
-1	I always believe something is wrong when they don't just tell fast. I feel that they are annoyed someone came to get better.
1	The language barrier concerns me most.  What he says and what I think he means are sometimes different.  As an example, they tell me that tests I need to take for an existing condition are preventive; they are not preventive if I already have the condition.  The tests at that stage are diagnostic.  They are more concerned with a patient taking standard tests than treating them for the condition the patient is most worried about. 
1	My family on both my mother's and father's, have histories of terrible diseases as well as cancer. My dad died of cancer at a young age. There is also quite a bit of mental health issues, the cause of my mother's suicide. I've spent a lot of time in hospitals watching people die and just driving by a hospital gives me the chills. I worry because I always expect the worst when it comes to doctor visits.
-1	I don't know. Nothing really. If I have a concern that I think something is really bad, I would probably be nervous. If I had no idea what was going on with my health.
1	I think it is usually the possibility of illness or a bad visit and finding out something is wrong.
-1	NOT APPLICABLE
1	I would feel most anxious while visiting the doctor's office because I would fear that there was something else wrong with me instead of what I was going in for.
-1	I worry about what my blood pressure will be that is basically all that I worry about them doing
-1	"Really, the only thing that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the potential for unknowns. While my health may not be the best, I have never encountered anything ""serious"" when seeing my doctor. I am always somewhat concerned that he may one day find something that requires serious medical attention, and that worries me."
1	I get most upset and worried when it comes to physical examitions because of my own persol views about myself and my body.
-1	I feel most worried that the doctor will find something, maybe it's cancer, or some other neurological disease. But even though logically, I shouldn't worry, it just becomes automatic. 
-1	just the thourht of the unknown like getting bad news but not usully that bad of and experience as far as worrying goes
1	I am always worried about bad news. My mind always goes to thinking that any results will come back bad. I also fear being told I will have to come back for more testing.
1	Because of how people can't do things with how the doctor's office and the results
-1	I not the type of person who gets anxious or worries about anything. If i felt anything it would be uncertainty about finding out about some condition I wasn't aware of.
-1	The only thing that makes me nervous is when they take blood because I hate needles.  I also have in the back of my mind the notion that the blood might come back with something negative that might negatively affect my life.
-1	I am always anxious about my blood work.   However, nothing ever turns up bad so that is a relief.  
-1	Having to do an unexpected procedure that either is somewhat painful or time consuming. Having to wait to see the doctor. 
1	I don't like to have my body examined, as I feel a little uncomfortable with it. Also I am always worried he might find something seriously wrong with my health. 
1	I don't really feel anxious when I visit my main doctor (as described previously), but I've had a certain amount of doctor phobia as long as I can remember/since I was a small child.  I'm really irratiolly afraid of needles and especially injections.  I am capable of having blood drawn if I lay down, but I have a feeling there's part of me that always expects at a GP's place or something that they're going to want to give me a shot or something...  I know that won't happen at the endocrinologist's office, ha
1	I get nervous because a lot of people in my family have had cancer, I've been pretty healthy my whole life but I'm afraid my luck will run out and I'll get it too.
-1	I am most anxious about the doctor not knowing what the issue is.  I am anxious about anything requiring surgery.  I am fearful of debilitation.
-1	Mostly I am worried about unseen or unknown health issues that might show up in an examition. If I am unsure what caused the problem that brought me to the doctor's office, I will usually have some sort of concern or worry. If I have a general understanding or notion as to what is wrong with me such as a flu, I am typically not too worried at all. 
-1	Don't have any complications or disorder. Still anxious about needles since I was little.
-1	I only go to the doctor for a yearly physical exam, pap smear, and mammogram or if I am feeling ill. I am concerned I may not be explaining what I am feeling properly and give iccurate information. Then, I would receive the wrong treatment.
1	My blood pressure is always high and it is even higher when I go to the doctor's office.  I am always anxious because I'm expecting it to be high.
-1	I worry that my doctor might tell something bad about my health.
1	I feel a bit anxious about visiting the doctor's office, due to the results of my vital signs and weight.  Sometimes my blood pressure is a little high when I am at the doctor's office and my physician even knows that this is due to a little nervousness at his office. The reason behind this uneasiness is the fear of finding bad or high risk results about my health.
1	Not knowing the severity of my condition and the thought of being given drugs that will have terrible side effects.
-1	I am most anxious of being called out because I haven't kept to a low saturated diet as much as the doctor recommended.  I hate admitting I haven't followed instructions.
1	I worried about what the diagnosis the doctor will tell me.  Will it require surgery, how long the recovery period will be if surgery is required, is it a termil illness, or a decline in my mental faculties?
1	I never know if something is wrong that I don't know about or if the doctor will find something that I didn't know was wrong. 
1	"I call the chair that I sit in closest to the doctor the ""hot seat"".  :o)  I am always a little nervous going to the doctor.  I wonder if what I am going in for might be something silly and I am making a big deal about a small thing.  Also I worry that they won't find whatever is going on with me and after testing they don't find anything.  I feel a little foolish after that."
-1	Sometimes I may feel that way but it is not because of the actual visit is. It is more because I have to be there in the first place, meaning something is really going on with me and I am anxious to find out what it is.
1	about what he will tell me if something is wrong.sometimes my sugar levels are high and he gets a little upset because he is very concerned about it.
1	I think that I'll be diagnosed with the worst condition and will need surgery. I have white coat syndrome so my worries are numerous and most of them are silly but I'm working on meditating to control my anxiety. 
1	I haven't had a male doctor since I was a child.  Now I have a male doctor and I feel very uncomfortable with him.  I think that if I had either a female physician or a male physician who was more concerned and caring I would not have these feelings.
-1	I'm sometimes a little anxious about being physically examined by someone I don't know well. I'm sometimes a little worried that there might be something seriously wrong. And crowded waiting rooms and long wait times are stressful, so I don't look forward to that.
1	Even though I am relatively healthy and have no family history of major medical conditions, there is always the chance that something can go wrong. I wouldn't say I am extremely nervous when visiting my doctor but I am a bit anxious. 
1	I don't know what could be wrong with me; the mystery bothers me. I would love to have straight answers at all times.
1	I'm usually worried that I will get bad news. I get anxious that they will tell me something is very wrong. Or if I don't know the doctor I get scared that they won't treat me right. 
1	I am usually anxious or worried because I fear that something will be wrong with me.  I worry that I will find that I have diabetes or some other bad news.  
1	That i am wasting my time and not going to get the help i need to fix or understand my problems. Most of my problems are not real bad just yet but they are problems i want to understand before they become major issues.
1	The unknown.  I never have been comfortable with doctors and the older I have gotten, the less I trust doctors, especially since the ovomitdon;tcare tax went into effect and we are refused treatment once we reach the age that we cannot work and support the correct number of career welfare families.  
1	The results of tests.  That can mean blood work or various other tests.  I also had unprotected sex which made me nervous waiting for the test results for that.
1	The lack of transparency and uncertainty can be burdensome. Knowing that the doctor knows more about what's wrong with me than I do, and them not sharing all of that information. 
-1	I'm not typically worried or anxious when I visit a doctor's office.
1	I am most worried that he will neglect to find the source of the problem, and I will die due to an error that was easily preventable with a little care for his job. I think they have no consequences for patient deaths, so they do not care if they miss things that will save lives. They do not care for their patients anymore, they just milk them for their sheckles.
-1	I just have no faith in any of them and feel I'm going to have to visit at least one more time permitting to get a second opinion and they always say it's something else so then you have to figure out which is correct which means a third opinion or simply suffering until your body kicks the ailment itself.
-1	I do not like having blood work done. I hate needles and it makes me uncomfortable.  I also dislike going to my gynecologist. 
-1	Most my symptoms are things that I worry about, and not the doctor herself. I am fearful that some of the pains I am having are serious medical conditions.
-1	I imagine it would be the uncertainty.  it is also uncomfortable.  why are you even asking this question?  you have to know the answer.
-1	I'm not worried just cautious and aware..educated... 
-1	I worry about my doctor's age and how long he is going to remain in practice since he is well aged. I also worry about some of the staff at the office and how many have left over the years. Just general white coat anxiety is what makes me feel most anxious, I have always had that and always will.
1	I'm passed the point where I receive good news at the doctor
-1	Just the concern that something may be worse.
-1	I don't really feel anxious at all at a doctors office. I feel like I'm doing things that I should probably do more often, but I don't because of fincial reasons.
1	More worried just in case doctor told me something worst thing. 
-1	Nothing really does, unless I am there in pain or concerned about my health for some reason, that usually is not the case though.
1	I worry that the doctor will find a health problem I am not already aware of. I worry that the doctor will get short if I ask too many questions. I worry that the doctor is so attuned to conventiol options that he won't think broadly about new possibilities to address conditions with less side effects and more benefits.
-1	I am worried that something might be wrong. I don't usually go to the doctor so when I do, its because of some pain or problem so I am anxious that it is very serious
1	I always feel like they will find something else wrong with me, I take enough meds now
1	Certainly there's some anxiety or dread in going to the doctor. Whether it's just an exam or you're going for a specific purpose, there's always some uncertainty about what the doctor will say. It could be everything's ok or you have some serious medical problems. That uncertainty makes it tural to be anxious.
1	If the doctor will sound harsh or criticize me.  If the doctor will ignore or discredit what I say.  If I end up having a really bad health problem.
-1	The only thing I fear is the wait. This makes me anxious because I do not like to waste time. Sometimes this can be the worst part of the doctor visit.
-1	Not knowing what is wrong with me if I have to go to the doctor or maybe having to get more tests done than I thought.
-1	getting blood drawn is what makes me the most anxious. when i get blood drawn i always pass out.
1	It is just an uncomfortable feeling. I don't think anyone looks forward to going to the doctor.
1	i am getting older now,and i sometimes wonder,if something really horrible will be found wrong with me.it seems i wake up with a new ache or pain daily.
-1	I usually feel quite good so I am never nervous about my checkups.  Fortutely I am extremely healthy and always have been.  The worst problem I've had is sciatica and I went to PE for that. 
-1	If anything it's that the doctor might tell me something is going on with me that is worse than I am aware of/anticipating. 
1	I'm afraid they will find something else wrong or needs to be taken care of that will cost me more money out of pocket even though we have insurance.
-1	I always wonder if they will find something else wrong, besides the problem that I am there for.  I usually get a little anxious because I know that I have waited too long before going to see the doctor.
-1	They might find major health problems 
-1	When I visit my doctor for my examitions I am always anxious about m results. I always think that something might go wrong and this makes me nervous.
1	Sometimes when going into the Dr's office with symptoms that seem like they maybe severe I become anxious while waiting for the exam and tests to determine my issue.  I also get anxious because it seems like the dr always wants to discuss worst possible issues first.
1	Finding out the cause of any medical issues I am contending with. 
1	I feel anxious about going to the doctor at any time.  I am not a fan.  I can become a little worried about the idea of tests or anything out of the ordiry.
-1	I feel worried, because I am not sure I get the best medical advice. Some anxiety comes from realization that my doctor doesn't incentives to give me his utmost attention.
-1	i get the white coat syndome when they take my bp it always goes way up and scares me
1	You know when you don't feel well or are in pain, but there are tests and measurements that can locate possible diseases or health issues that I may not even be aware of.  I'm also not very comfortable being ked, so that's very nerve wracking.
1	I'm always worried when I go to the doctor because of the history of cancer in my family.  I get worried that little things may be precursor's to cancer or something worse.
1	Mostly I worry about my condition and how it will affect me. I also get nervous around doctors in general, because usually when you have to see a doctor, you won't be getting good news. So I'm usually already feeling a bit anxious before I even see the doctor.
1	The things that make me feel most anxious is interacting with the doctor and feeling like a may be scolded. The other thing I don't like is just going to the doctor tends to make me feel a general unease. It triggers my social anxiety.
1	Thoughts that there is no point to visit the doctor, I just spend time and money without any results.
-1	My worries at the doctor are usually less about the actual meeting with the doctor than surrounding matters like cost and health insurance. I am sometimes concerned about prescription side effects or misdiagnosis, but am willing enough to accept my doctor's recommendations that it doesn't bother me.
-1	I sometimes think about how much the visit to the doctor will cost me. I think of it more as an annoyance than I'm being taken advantage of.
1	That the physician will give you a negative report/diagnosis. Doctors don't have a positive bone in their bodies. It is ALWAYS doom and gloom with them. They just  approach a patient with how the odds of getting well are so low. Their game plan is to give you a lot of medicines or advice a sometimes unnecessary surgery. Again, to make money for hospitals and drug companies.
-1	Not knowing what is going on or what problems might be occurring in my body. 
-1	i be so anxious to see things like my blood presser and worried if it going to be high 
-1	Now that I am 64 I cannot help but worry about what the doctor may find; if there is some condition or clue that I am not even aware about, but may lead me down a serious path of health treatments and expenses. I think I am actually more worried about the possible fincial consequences than the physical discomfort.
1	The hope that nothing bad comes out of the exam.  I go to an exam if I think something might need to be checked, or for bloodwork ect.  Its always a worry that something will maybe be wrong.  
-1	Not knowing if everything's gon be okay or if there's some issue the doctor might discover that I didn't know about.
-1	I feel anxious and worried because I don't know what the doctor will tell me after examining me.
1	Anxious about getting old and sick.
-1	during an exam, you do not know what could be found, so that is nerve wracking
1	The thing I worry about most when seeing my doctor is potentially finding out that I have a serious problem and will need surgery. Just the thought of surgery terrifies me!
1	The idea of receiving bad health news or finding out that there was something extremely wrong with me or my health.
1	I always worry that the doctor will find that something is wrong with me and I wouldn't even suspect.
-1	Even though i am calm with my doctor,  it's always an anxious time as you never know if something could be found wrong. 
1	I suppose that it's fear of the unknown.  As I get older I hear about all of the various health issues the others have experienced and I worry that something serious will happen to me. 
-1	I have several chronic pain and breathing issues.  I'm always concerned that one of these issues may evolve into something that may become very serious.  I don't like surgery and I don't like hospitals, and I'm always concerned that either may become necessary.
-1	Mostly I worry if my health is improving or backsliding. I have a silly worry that he will find some horrible disease or something. I mean, not really, but kind of if that makes sense. I also don't like getting shots. Or the backside exam.
1	The attention of the doctors
-1	Well, experience tells me that a little thing can be indicative of a big thing. How do you think I found out about a cancer that resulted in a 3 month hospitalization? A doctors visit, thats how. So, it would be rather unusual to not have trepedation when repeating the visits later. I had to abandon a cafreer because of physical pain and even the doctors that realize the source of the problem are too chicken shit to say so for disability. Seven years later and poverty is the result.
-1	my doctor takes hours to come into the office to see me. that makes me really anxious because sometimes i have other things to do that day. also, i just met him so i get anxious about describing all my issues to him.
-1	I dont get anxious or worried when visiting a dr office.  There is literally no point in adding stress.
1	Unless I am having a routine visit then there is always a chance that I could have a serious problem. Even when having a routine visit there is that chance, but it is more worrisome when the problem is not something you have normally dealt with. In my case I have a condition that will generally get worse as I age and I am anxious because I may get information that I have gotten worse instead of staying the same. 
1	I feel most anxious or worried at a doctors office wondering if they will listen without being brushed off or ridiculed. They tend to be dismissive when realizing I am not able to tolerate medicine, and rather than researching to find the root cause I often feel brushed off or abandoned. I get anxious or worried because I'm obviously visiting the office for a valid reason and wish they would take a moment and try to help find or recommend an altertive solution. 
-1	I am hoping that I get a clean bill of health from my check ups. You never know what a doctor might find. It produces anxiety in me regarding possible health problems arising.
1	I feel like I am not going to remember to share all my concerns or that if I bring them up the doctor will think they are stupid. My husband recently brought up concerns I had over a procedure that he needed done and he said the doctor literally said the concern was stupid. 
1	I feel anxious about the exam itself and not speaking well. I get nervous and shy to talk to anyone I do not know well and sometimes stumble over my words. I also get worried over what the prognosis will be. 
-1	That I might have to get blood drawn which doesn't hurt it's just an annoying process.
1	Even if nothing feels wrong, I'll get nervous that I've got some major health issue that I wasn't aware of. I'm in my late 30's, and although I'm in pretty good health now, I'm always afraid that issues of some sort are just around the corner for me. 
-1	Being in a doctors office. 
-1	I will feel worried if i have some health issue since long and will be waiting for the reports from the doctor.
1	Just the thought that something serious could be wrong.  The thought I might catch something from the other sick people.  That I might have to have some kind of treatment.  That I might have to have a shot.
1	that there is something seriously wrong.. 
1	Most of the times it's the uncertainty about how severe the illness is, the pain involved when getting diagnosed etc.
1	The thing that makes me most anxious is the fear of the unknown. Even if I am at the doctors for something minor routine test can show something worse.
1	The unknown of what they might find from running test.
1	I am anxious and worried that something more serious may be wrong with me than I think. I am embarrassed to talk about certain things with my doctor. I just want to get the exam over and done with because I don't like to be looked at and touched. 
-1	just what to expect from a check up.Just thinking what if they find something wrong with me.
1	I feel anxious because I am afraid he will find something wrong or he will want to send me somewhere for tests I do not want
-1	WHat makes me feel most anxious is just the overall doctor visit which I always find unpleasant.
1	I'm worried that they will find something wrong with me. I hold my breath until they tell me everything is okay.
1	They could find that i have a dangerous health issue. 
-1	I feel most anxious or worried because I felt feared.
-1	I worry that there could be something more wrong with many than there really is.
-1	Being in hospitals. The sounds, the smell, the sights. I guess it goes back to when I was young, every time I went to the doctor as a kid something was wrong. I guess some of that anxiety cared over to my adult years. 
-1	
-1	I'm anxious when I am really sick and don't know what's wrong with me. I go into the office expecting the worst. It also makes me anxious when she doesn't know what's wrong, and I have to get more testing done. I am also anxious when I have to see another doctor because my doctor is on vacation. 
1	Im afraid that the doctor lacks the basic knowledge to access the condition and prescribe appropriate treatment.I worry that the individual may be more concerned about fincial gains rather than offering sound judgement.
-1	It just makes me anxious having to be examined.  I don't have a good reason.  It feels kind of intrusive.
1	Examitions require a level of persol interaction that I am very uncomfortable with. I usually only go when I am sick so I am already worried. 
-1	Nothing really.  I like my nurse practitioner and feel like I don't mind going to the doctor's office when needed. 
-1	"The lack of concern for my health commonly demonstrated by the doctor. The assumption that I am an ignorant person without the capacity to understand what is being said to me. (That said, having done technical support for years, I can understand that attitude. ""My computer has a big blue screen that says I done somethin' illegal, but I didn't! It's all paid for, legal."" Yes, this is a real event.)"
1	"I've had a bout with thyroid cancer so every doctor visit I think ""what's next?"" and how much will each referral and testing diagnostic cost. It worries me emotiolly and fincially."
-1	Just the fact that I have to go the doctor at all. I have been sick for a while so it just makes me nervous to be there at all, and a little anxious but I know I feel a bit better now, so it is getting better with the axiety.
1	usually what they may or may not find. You never know what problems you could have until you get an examition. I usually trust their skills and judgment and that they'll do their job well though. 
-1	I don't like being poked and prodded, disrobed, made to wait long periods of time in the exam room.
1	I get anxious or worried because I always expect something bad to come out of the situation.  I'm always thinking something more serious is going on than really is. 
1	when my brainscans come back and I'm finding out the results
-1	I don't often feel anxious or worried about going to the doctor.  The only thing that might make me uneasy is the possibility of them discovering I had a life threatening illness.
-1	I am very paranoid about my health. The thing that makes me feel the most anxious or worried is me thinking about what could be wrong and what the doctor will tell me. I am always afraid he is going to give me horrible news.
1	I am not sure why I feel like this. It is a general feeling that I have always had. Probably mostly the smell and the idea that I will be in pain ( a shot or a pap smear).  And then recently just frustrated that the doctor will treat me like my situation is stupid.
1	The possibility of finding something life threatening. 
-1	I am not anxious or worried about doctor's visit, but concern about time I don't like the waiting
-1	I don't feel anxious when visiting the doctor
-1	One of my biggest concerns with visiting a doctor's office involve receiving bad news or being treated too quickly and the doctor not doing a full job. As patients we sometimes wait long periods to see the doctor, so the idea we can be pushed out fast is worrisome.
-1	I am made most anxious by having to bare my body during physical examitions. A doctor has never made me feel uncomfortable about this...I just am.
1	I just worry the possibility that they find something wrong with me. I'm never worried about the doctor doing anything wrong or making mistakes. I don't have the healthiest lifestyle so I expect bad news when I visit the doctor.
-1	Unless I am really ill I don't feel anxious. The one thing that worries me most is when a doctor briefly feels for breast lumps, although that's done so quickly there's not much chance of it. So the chance of having cancer of some kind makes me most worried.
-1	I was most anxious and worried about my own health, especially when I wasn't sure what could possible go wrong with me and before a new symptom was diagnosed and confirmed by the doctor.  
1	The diagnosis. I sometimes already have some idea or thought about why I feel bad and I'm afraid that the doctor's diagnostic confirm my suspicions.
1	I am just always worried they'll find something crazy bad with my health.
-1	i don't like waiting for results especially if it was for something that might be serious. 
-1	Not right now. I look forward to makeing sure I am staying healthy now. 
1	"Feeling as though the physician doesn't have the time to ""deal"" with you.  Questions not answered, followup not proper.  "
1	I think lack of trust is a big issue. I'm also squeamish about needles and other procedures. Also, bad memories about my parents' medical treatment.
1	The longer i wait, the more anxious i become. As i become more stressed anxiety builds. The waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me to become even more stressed.
1	I'm not sure if I know.  It seems to be an automatic reaction.  It may be in part that I don't want to be told that I need to make major changes in my lifestyle.
-1	Worried because just in case doctor told me something bad about my health condition.
-1	Unless it's for a regular check-up, I'm at the doctor's office because I''m either injured or ill. My condition would make me a bit anxious. There is also the small chance that the doctor might discover something serious that I was not already aware of. 
1	"Money is the first of the most important concerns. The old saying ""I can not afford to get sick or go to the Dr, hospital, etc.. Applies to most of us including me. The second worry  concern is what the Dr finds out during lab work, exams, etc and the diagnosis and the ""Cost"" I am always concerned that whatever the Dr finds through an exam or test is that they advise you on a standard rule of the most expensive treatment or specialist they can give. I have had many persol experiences with this. There is no such thing as persol, affordable, think out of the box, healthcare treatments. I am treated like a robot in a robot system. I go to my family physician and if there is anything wrong I get sent all over town to specialists and have many appointments and a lot of time and out of pocket expenses and find out later that all of that was not necessary and the health problem could have been handled and treated through my family Dr. simply and a lot less expensive. "
1	I am afraid I will get bad news.
1	I'm worried about the readings of my vitals that the nurse takes. Those are generally the best way to tell how I'm doing. By the time the doctor comes in, I'm more apprehensive at what the numbers are more than I'm worried about him as a person or physician. 
1	I feel worried each time I visit my doctor because I feel he's going to add me on more medication. He said that my blood pressure continues to increase. The medicine that I'm on already makes me feel dizzy at times. I don't want to be placed on more medication. 
1	When I sense that the doctor has their own agenda rather than responding to the patient in front of them, it makes me very anxious. When the doctor exhibits arrogant behavior or seems disrespectful, I worry that they won't really listen to me or will discount what I have to tell them. When a doctor seems to assume that every patient is displaying drug-seeking behavior, I worry that they aren't really listening and that I will not get the right treatment.
1	I'm afraid of receiving bad news about my health
-1	As this hardly ever occurs, well, ... hard to say. However, most times (very few), I've mostly felt more neutral, than anxious. Any anxiety would be related to waiting time.
-1	Mainly just the fear of a bad diagnosis. 
-1	Its just a very nerve wracking experience, if you don't go to the doctor that often like me, you just never know what illness might pop up.
-1	The only thing that worries me is if I am sick, and I am worried that the doctor will have bad news as to the sickness.  I worry that the cure for the ailment would be traumatic or painful; like if I needed surgery.
1	The thing that worries me the most is that there will be costs I'm not aware of to the visit. We are on a very fixed income and a lot of times there are additiol fees tacked onto bills that I wasn't expecting. Sometimes it's because I asked a question, which is frustrating.
-1	As I get older, I recognize that my body is aging as well. As the body ages, it tends to degrade. What makes me anxious is if he finds something wrong and wants me to go see other doctors or have tests performed. I don't want to spend the time having to do that.
1	I am particularly uncomfortable with physical examitions and so they make my anxiety flare up.
1	The idea that I might have something else to add to the pile of illnesses I have. Or that with my Sjogren's since I'm more likely to get lymphoma will it show up, especially since cancer runs in my family.
1	When I visit a doctor's office, my biggest fer or worry is a negative diagnosis. It is basically the fear of the unknown or the uncertainty of it. 
1	I think doctors often seem to guess at what is going on with their patients, though it is an informed guess, they may not be making a careful assessment of their patients health and rely a little too heavily on previous experience to the extent where they may not recognize or are dismissive of other symptoms. They can often seem resigned to a bad outcome, and at the same time be uninformative about what is going on.
-1	"The only time I might feel anxious or worried with visiting my doctor would be, the not ""Knowing"" what's wrong. Not wanting to hear any dreadful news."
-1	I don't want to feel anxious, but there is something about me that is turally anxious. I know this about myself because my BP reading inflates every time I go for a checkup.  I feel I am this way even in social situations although no one takes my BP under those circumstances.  
-1	I worry that I may have underestimated the seriosness of my condition. There is usually also the worry that the doctor might find something wrong with me that I did not even suspect.
1	It worries me that my physician will give me bad news about my health. 
-1	waiting for my appointment is a very stressful situation. The longer i wait, the more anxious i become. As i become more stressed and anxiety builds, the waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me to become even more stressed.
1	I am a very nervous person. When I have a doctors appointment I am very antsy and high strung. I fear my diagnosis will one day  be cancer.
1	"I have to be KED! Well, not exactly. The gown is open in the back though, making me feel exposed and vulnerable. I don't want to turn my head and cough while he checks out my ball sac. Sh*t, he's looking down there a bit too long. Is he gay? Oh, no, here come the latex gloves. ""Bend over,"" he says. "
-1	I always feel a little anxious when someone has to look at my ked body. I also worry that being anxious will throw off my blood pressure readings, I have low blood pressure, and want to keep it that way. I hate getting on the scales as I know my weight is not great for my height. I am always a little anxious when the blood results are given to me. I want to be in excellent health and if I am not I want the doctor to tell me it is something that can be changed by diet or medication.
1	"I worry that the doctor might prescribe me medicines just because I went in for a consultation. In other words, the doctor could have very well known that the medicines are just a temporary solution and that my illness would have healed on its own, given some time and rest. Instead of saying ""Go take rest"", he would be forced to prescribe medicines just because he is a doctor! I am not scared of injections. However, I become uneasy and anxious of intrusive procedures like inserting swabs into your nose, throat, ears etc. I am anxious that the doctor might be a racist and would harm me in some way or the other based on my appearance or ethnicity."
1	Although I try my best to keep myself healthy, I never know what a medical check-up will bring. I'm just an anxious person in general, so it's hard for me to sit still when someone else has information about me that I don't know. The anxiety comes from wanting to make certain that I'm physically and interlly OK.
1	I am worried about what might be wrong with me.  I worry that it might be really serious.
1	Well, I'm 38, so I just don't want any unwanted surprises. :-) 
-1	The time necessary to identify and appropriately mage health issues sometimes worries me, as I do not feel that I can trust my PCP or any other single doctor individually.   I have had too many bad experiences in maging my own care, and that of various family members.
-1	Just having to know what really is going on with me can be a source of worry. It's always uncertain until the doctor gives you confirmation of what's really going on with you. Until I know, I am waiting and that makes me anxious. And obviously depending on what I end up learning about, that can make me even more anxious.
-1	When I have to discuss my results that do not know about with him
1	What makes me feel the most concerned about visiting a doctor's office is that they likely don't know what to do, but will gladly try a few things that will end up costing way too much. A person is lucky if they don't end up feeling worse, being told there's nothing wrong, and/or walking away having to take a bunch of expensive pills. No, thank you.
-1	"I don't like it when the physician doesn't know what is wrong and has to refer me to a specialist. For example, I asked my physician ""Why can't you just do the biopsy?""  She said she didn't have the resources in the office.  It makes me very anxious when I have to make an appointment with another physician and wait while I don't know what is wrong.  This has happened to me in the last year.  Then for the BIGGEST thing that makes me anxious is worrying if my insurance, UHC, is going to try to pull some nonsense to get out of paying for something.  They actually did this, they made every nonsensical excuse not to pay the physician for the biopsy.  The physician's office eventually wrote off the expense, but that is not fair to them.  SO, my insurance trying to get out of paying is what makes me most anxious.  "
-1	I am always concerned when I go to a doctor appoint even if it is just for a check-up.  I am not sure why I get so nervous.
-1	The doctor is not totally alert. Wrong diagnosis. Visiting a doctor for the first time.
1	I always fear the worst when I have a symptom or pattern of symptoms. As such, I am not so much anxious about the doctor in particular, but about learning about conditions I may have.
-1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious and worried is getting blood drawn. I also get nervous when I have to get a shot. Also, pap smears.
1	If there would be something in the results that was unexpected and it would create some anxiety
1	Worried that I might get bad news or that I'm moving backwards towards progress that was made before.  It's almost like you don't know what's going to happen at each appointment.  Just deal with each one separately.
-1	just the office in general, the coldness , and waiting
-1	None so far as I have been taking care of my health on my own. My routine medical checkup has been good and when I do need to see my physician periodically it was more on getting the flu shots or some mild illness.
1	Generally, when you enter a doctor's office, it's either to receive treatment or advice regarding an existing issue or concern.  The best case scerio when going is that nothing is wrong, or it is not as serious as suspected.  The anxiousness or worry stems from the altertive scerio, that the issue is more serious, the issue requires additiol treatment, and the issue may not only affect my future health, but could include significant out of pocket costs.
-1	That there may be some serious condition with me
-1	 One never  knows the outcome .. the potential is there for all  kinds of problems.
-1	if I have an extreme illness and it may be caught too late
-1	Finding out what is wrong with me. Or having him find something new that is devastating. I worry about what the diagnosis might be.
1	It's just a part of my persolity. I am an anxious person. I sometimes feel worried that there will be something wrong with me.
1	I feel most anxious or worried about any possible negative diagnosis or treatments that might be advised to take (especially if invasive). Just the initial feeling of not knowing what is going on or what the problem is is already enough to cause a general feeling of anxiety. Some testing (and not just treatments) are also worrisome (fear of needles... I go through it, but I still hate any type of needles/pin pricks, etc.).
-1	Whether I need to be here.  Whether they can help me.  Whether this is a good value for my money.
-1	I am worried when the time to know the results of tests. I am worried whether my conditions are getting better, dosages of medicines are right for me in the past three months, when I may proceed for reproduction, ... etc.
-1	I am most anxious or worried because of the possibility of finding something medical problem with my health
1	That they'll look down on me and brand me a drug seeker, or not believe what I'm telling them.
-1	I'm always anxious because I go when I have a problem, not just to visit.
-1	The thing that makes me most anxious is wondering if there will be something majorly wrong. I also worry that there won't be anything that can be done for symptoms that may be present.

-1	I am most anxious when I do my blood work or when I have a pap smear. I always fear the worst. I don't know why, but I always feel like something is wrong. Things usually turn out alright, but I still always doubt things.
1	What makes me feel most anxious is not knowing what the doctor may or may not find. Even if I'm feeling fine and believe that I'm healthy, you just never know. I'm also a bit of a hypochondriac, so in the back of my mind, I think I'm always think there couldbe something wrong. 
-1	Whenever anyone goes to the doctors, we are going at our most vulnerable state. We think there's something wrong with us. We always await the worse news. But as I've gotten older, I've realized it's not as scary as I thought.
1	When I have to get a cancer screening or something of that nature done. I really get worried when my kids or loved ones visit the doctor to be honest.
-1	If I know I have to get blood drawn I will get very nervous and have a panic attack, I do not like needles and that makes me anxious, otherwise I never have many issues while visiting the doctors office.
-1	I feel anxious that they'll find something else wrong with me. I hope that I'm doing the right things and that I don't walk away with unexplained tests or something else that I need to watch out for. 
-1	I am mostly anxious about the diagnosis. I also get anxious about being left in the examination room for a long period of time before getting seen. It almost becomes claustrophobic to the point that I need to get up and open the door.
-1	I feel that I will receive false or very bad news from my doctor. I have seen doctors give patients wrong information which led to worsened health. 
-1	I would feel anxious visiting the doctor if I had something going on that was scaring me or that was something major that was wrong with me. Sometimes I worry that if I go in for something that it won't be solved.
1	I feel a little afraid that the doctor will find something wrong with me tat i didnt even know about yet. As i get older i know parts of my body will not function correctly and im anticipating that on a visit
1	I have anxiety so just going to meet with someone I do not know well in a public place automatically causes me to feel anxious and worried. Couple that with it relating to my health it is more severe.
-1	I do not experience anxiety ot worry very much about going to the doctor.  For me, it is more worrying when I can do it between work, kids, homelife, etc.
1	i feel like the doctors are not being honest with me and saying that I am not healthy just so they can prescribe me a bunch of baloney. I have been depressed and very anxious for a while and wanted to bring it up to the doctor but feared they would force me to take pills or force medication for the sake of them gaining money rather than helping me which makes me step back and not want to visit the doctor unless I absolutely have to. 
-1	The unknown of what the answer will be. I've had some pretty serious health issues happen and there are chances of reoccurrence. 
1	As I get older and feel more aches and pains I'm worried that he'll find a tumor or some organ failure or some bone turning to dust or some incurable disease.
1	Oh there's always the worry they'll find something that ends up being deadly cancer or something. I'm also worried about having to do the prostate thing because I'm getting to the age where it's going to happen so I'm a bit anxious about that.
-1	The feeling that you could have an underlying condition that is not effecting your quality of life but could. You would only find that out when visiting the doctor and being examined. 
1	I get anxious sometimes because you never know what is going to found or if something could go wrong. It is not a guarantee that everything will be checked to be fine.
-1	I sometimes get nervous about talking about an embarrassing symptom that I might be experiencing, or I get worried that an serious illness might be diagnosed in tests. 
-1	Mostly I'm anxious if something is wrong with me and I don't know what it is. If I'm waiting for test results or something, the not knowing is the worst part of it. Other than that, I don't really feel anxious
1	Being sick and assuming it's the worst possible thing. I'm worried about getting sicker in the waiting room with other sick people around. I'm worried about procedures that might hurt or feel embarrassing, such as bloodwork or bad side effects or something, and embarrassing as far as potentially showing body parts I don't normally show and talking about bodily functions
-1	Just because if you're going to the doctor, something is wrong with you.  You don't know what's going on, and if it's something serious.  Nobody wants to hear that bump on their head could possibly be malignant.  It's fear of the unknown that makes me nervous, not necessarily fear of the doctor.
-1	Just being there is sometimes unsettling. It is hard to keep bad thoughts out when you are surrounded by sick people and the smell of a doctor's office. However, I know that my health is separate from others, so I try to keep the bad thoughts out by focusing on myself first. I get a little uneasy when waiting for test results or after an exam, but I know that I can get over it quickly.
-1	My greatest fear is that they will not listen or take serious my myriad of chronic and acute illnesses. They seem to often deal with my main issue that I came in for, but don't want to give me the time to deal with the other smaller yet still importan reasons I came in.
1	Just not knowing what exactly is wrong with me is scary. If i go in knowing oh it's just a sore throat or the cold or something isn't that big of a deal. but if i'm going in for a blood test or something like that, it gets a little scary.
-1	Whenever I am worried about visiting a doctor it is due to what I am in there for. I am worried something could be wrong with me and it will be a long and expensive process if something is considerably wrong with me. 
1	i am anxious to talk about what is going on with me and im anxious to find out if something new is wrong with me
1	Like I ALREADY wrote, I don't like waiting.  I want to get crappy situations done with as soon as possible so I'm not sitting around dreading and thinking about the worst case scenario.
1	I am sometimes afraid that there will be something seriously wrong with me. I sometimes dread hearing the worst, but so far, it has always turned out just fine. 
1	When I go to the doctor, I often think if I happen to have something that is not yet discovered in me as those silent diseases that makes me feel anxious
-1	I don't have a good track record with caring, thoughtful doctors. Most tend to disregard what I say or think about whatever's happening to me. In addition, I have a poorly understood chronic disease (CFS/ME) that many doctors refuse to even admit exist, despite overwhelming new information that it is a biological illness.
-1	I actually never get anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office. The doctor is there to make sure I am well. There is no hidden motive involved. They provide a service and I am generally alright with the service I personally receive. 
-1	I get most worried about the doctor not being able to find a diagnosis for what is wrong with me. I have had some health problems in the past that I have had a hard time finding a diagnosis for. This means more waiting and more doctor's visits in the future.
-1	Having to wait a long time. This is a waste of my life.  Doctors seem to overbook their appointments.
-1	I was anxious about the cost.  I am not anxious about the actual visit itself or about my doctor. I recently lost health coverage through my employer so the cost is the source of all my anxiety when it comes to the doctor.
-1	I only feel anxious when I know there's something wrong with me or I feel terribly ill. When I'm feeling that way, I start worrying that I might have something serious.
1	I am worried about getting bad news.  I also worry about being embarrassed or feeling awkward.  Usually it is the fear of bad news that worries me the most.
-1	If I am having symptoms that I don't understand, or if I haven't been to the doctor in over a year, I sometimes afraid of what I will find out. It's nothing big, because other than diabetes, nothing really bad has happened to me.
-1	I think getting a bad dianosis is probably the worst part about going to the doctor and also what keeps me from going to the doctor is that fear that something will not be good
1	I feel most anxious about the fact that there may be something wrong with me that I have not noticed or realized yet and that can lead me to be concerned. 
1	when we visiting the doctor it would be very difficult to seem it.It would be very fair of it.Getting a treatment it would be very important of it
1	I've always been anxious when going to the doctor's office but it has nothing to do with my doctors or their staff. I'm always concerned that some small ailment will end up being a larger issue. I've also had family members diagnosed with serious illnesses, so I worry that my time will be up at some point.
1	I never know what to expect. My family has a history of cancer, so I'm always afraid that routine scans or checkups will result in them finding something that shouldn't be there. I'm concerned that I won't know how to react to what they tell me, or that  they won't find something until it's too late. 
1	I am not a social person, so I have some difficulty speaking about my problems and issues. I am also worried about what the doctor may have to say about my health. 
1	Your doctor should listen to your answers and offer you suggestions for managing your anxiety symptoms. A family doctor, however, does not specialize in mental health conditions and may not be qualified to treat you. He should provide referrals to psychiatrists or psychologists in your area that are better qualified to work with you and create a treatment plan for you.
-1	my psa count as it is an indication of cancer. thankfully mine is normal and has been everytime taken. but it is the test i worry most about though i think my dr is more worried about bp
1	I am an anxious person in general, and medical stuff makes me especially anxious. I think my fear is that the doctor will tell me that I have a serious health problem that I didn't know I had. I worry a lot about those types of things.
-1	I always worry what they might find. I have a history of cancer and diabetes in my family and I am always concerned that is going to become a issue in my life as well. I guess that is what I am most worried about, something that I can not control happening and altering my life.
1	I worry that something about my health will be wrong. I'm afraid that I will have a terrible health issue, or even something minor but inconvenient. I think about how I'm a bit overweight and that is going to eventually cause health issues. I wonder if this appointment will be the one where I find out that my weight has caused some issues.
1	What makes me most anxious is the fear that my doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. I also fear many of the procedures, as well as just interacting with medical people in general. The latter comes with me just having an avoidant personality disorder.
1	That I'll actually find myself and that will actually read to do something that I don't actually either want or need; basically that I won't be completely honest with the Dr.
-1	I'm a pretty calm person and I don't get too nervous - but when at the doctor's for a problem I do sometimes have in the back of my head the idea that I might be really sick, or he might find a problem, or I might hear difficult news.  So I get a little uneasy and uncomfortable sometimes due to the unknown but not too bad.
1	I just get anxious that something could be wrong with me that I dont know about. You never know what your bloodwork will come back saying
1	I really get nervous about multiple things such as giving blood or other tests that I have not experienced. I can say I am kinda a baby when it comes to tests and such that doctors may do. This may stem from the fact I have not been to the hospital before for anything serious
1	i think it's the fear of finding out you have some sort of illness / disease that you weren't aware of before. i am especially nervous about blood test results
1	I am usually nervous about what they will tell me that I have.  The last thing you want to hear when you see the doctor about having headaches is that you have brain cancer.  I seem to always think the worst.
1	Finding something that was unexpected.  Going in for a routine exam and getting bad news would be the worst. 
-1	I'm anxious that my weight is too high. I'm also worried that my cholesterol or triglycerides are high.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious at the doctor's office is, by far, getting immunizations. While I agree to get any that are recommended, even ones that aren't strictly required by the office or by my college because I believe in taking any health precautions available to me, I am very afraid of needles and get almost pancicked when I need to have a shot.
-1	Nothingg at the moment.  I'm mostly healthy expect for my weight from drinking habits.  I started having random pain that was constant and moderate to serve I would worry about what the diagnosis is at that point.
-1	I would only feel anxious or worried about visiting the doctor's if I thought I had something serious wrong with me. If I thought I had a serious disease or a potentially embarrassing disease, then I would be worried. 
1	When I do go to the doctors office, because past doctors have never believed me on my condition I was always feeling anxious and worried throughout the visit. However, this has slowly went away. Still for some visits I become anxious or worried that my conditions may be developing further in a negative way. 
1	One thing that makes me feel most anxious is the fact that there might be something wrong with me. That worries me, and I stress out about it.
-1	I get worried and anxious when I'm not sure if my problems will require some kind of procedure or if I will get a diagnosis I don't want to hear (like having cancer). The doctor herself doesn't make me feel uncomfortable or nervous, it is the consequences related to my problems that make we worried.
-1	I am not sure what it is. I guess I am introverted so sitting in a quiet room with someone I donât know well is uncomfortable. Also I donât want them to think I am seeking drugs 
-1	I know I am going to feel foolish saying this but I absolutely hate getting shots. It's not the pain that it causes but rather the mental build-up of thinking of the needle going in you and all the blood.
1	I feel worried about whether I can get my questions answered and whether I can get the care I need. I have at times not received the treatment I feel I needed or the correct medicines when I have needed them. 
1	That they will tell me something bad that I do not want to hear, that I am not in good health. I worry that it will be something that I haven't been doing right. 
-1	I have anxiety, and going to do anything where I am being examined bothers me to some extent. I don't worry about any potential problems, it's just general anxiety.
-1	I think the worst part of it is just the waiting and the anxiety that provides to you, not knowing what might happen or what is wrong with you
1	I am always a bit anxious with doctor appointments. I think that there is just that factor of the unknown that makes people worry. 
-1	usually I am most anxious or worried when I have to visit the doctors office for my children. I never want to see my children in pain and taking them to the doctor with the thought that they may need a surgery or another inverention is what worries me. I also want to make sure I am making the best deicions for my child's health - it is a big responsibility to have someone else's health in your hands when they cannot make decisions for themselves yet.
1	I just get the feelings that I would expect most people to get.  If you're at the doctor then something must be wrong.  I just want to get it over with and get out of there.  If you are having fun and enjoy visiting the doctor then something is not right with you!
1	I am always worried that something will be very wrong and I don't like being touched by strangers. I also worry that I will need to get my blood drawn and needles scare me
1	I used to be worried about the cost most of all, but I now have stable finances and appropriate insurance so that is less of a worry.  I worry that they'll tell me something scary about my health, like needing surgery or having a chronic uncurable condition.  I've needed surgery that had me on bed rest for a week and it wasn't pleasant.
1	What makes me feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is getting the results back from lab work. I am not the most healthy person so I am somewhat worried that I may have some illness that is undetectable that can be found in blood work or x-rays. I dread the idea that I may have some kind of serious illness and that it will affect my life significantly. 
1	I'm the most anxious when I have no clue what could be causing my problem or if the doctor or nurse doesn't seem to know either. Also I get anxious if I anticipate bad news.
1	I experience this as many times. When I want to saw the doctor, at that time he come to office too late or leave. This behavior is the worst behavior of the Doctor's attitude. This is very wrong action. 
-1	Being diagnosed with cancer would have to be my number one worry, even though I have never been diagnosed with it before, its just a really worry for me, and I do things in my life to try to avoid this diagnosis.
1	Being able to adequately explain my concerns, anticipating the response of the doctor, being ignored or talked down to, the actual physical exam also makes me anxious because I don't like being touched.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious is if they discover something that is wrong with me that I do not expect in the least. I am a very healthy person, but it would be extremely upsetting if something like that came up.
1	The fear that I've not taken care of myself well enough and it will result in a malady that I could have avoided.  The prospect of not being well for my children.
-1	I just hope he doesn't come to me with bad news with something wrong. I am most fearful of cancer which can strike anyone without warning, and causes emotional harm for the whole family.
-1	Anything can go wrong at any time. I'm in good health, but you never know. There is always this little bit of anxiousness that something could be wrong or something in the future. 
1	When I visit a doctors office the thing that makes me the most anxious is worrying about getting a shot.  For my entire life, I have absolutely been terrified of needles and getting shots.  Each time I go to a doctors office this thought and idea continuously races through my mind and I find myself often sweating and shaking out of nervousness for no reason.  Also when I visit a doctors office, I worry about how much the visit is going to cost and what is actually wrong with me .

1	"I get nervous by the ""formality"" of the setting. Sometimes the setting is too clinical and not very personable. I worry about these things and not about the outcome of the visit."
-1	Normally, I'm pretty healthy. I think the waiting time both in the lobby and in the examination room just gives the mind enough time to overthink things and think the doctor's going to be coming back with bad news. There's just a sense of uncertainty about what might pop up.

1	I don't like waiting to see the doctor, and I don't like the small talk aspect of doctors in their offices. I just want a diagnosis, prescription, and to get out. I respect the medical profession but being in a waiting room full of sick people really makes me not want to go to the doctor at all. 
1	Well i am worried they might find out i have some reare diease or something like that and that could have a big impact on my life and well being

1	I am worried that they will discover something that is wrong with me. I know i am healthy but there is always a suspicion that something is wrong and they will discover it. It just more nerves about having a bad disease discovered. 
1	I worry that I will receive random and unexpected bad news regarding an unavoidable health problem. Additionally, even though I am a healthy weight, exercise, and otherwise take care of myself, I expect without reason to be scolded for doing something wrong health-wise.

1	I feel most anxious and worried about receiving bad news or news that means high costs or extended time away from work.  I am also nervous about potential uncomfortable tests and procedures.  Sometimes I think that my doctor is silently judging me for my appearance or other physical quality/attribute.
1	sometimes it's about the health which makes me worried and sometime it is about the inability of knowledge which we can't find out about our health

1	"I'm most concerned that the doctor will find something wrong with me that was clearly my fault.  It's not so much that there's something wrong with me that bothers me; it's being faulted for my lifestyle and choices.  That seems really backwards and silly, perhaps, but that's my bigger fear.  It's not them saying, ""There's something wrong with you.""  It's them saying, ""You haven't been taking care of yourself."""
1	What makes me feel very anxious is probably the fact that I wont know the results until a couple weeks after the appointment. Therefore I tend to worry a lot about the results and the outcome while visiting the doctor office.

1	I am often worried that the doctor will not have a solution for me. Often the doctor proposes a possible solution, but rarely suggests a solution that will definitely address my problem. Because my time with the doctor often feels hurried, I am worried that all of my concerns will not get addressed. I also get anxious when I have to discuss problems that are somewhat uncomfortable or may be perceived as embarrassing for me. I also hate needles, and worry about whether the doctor will recommend a blood test.

-1	Mostly what upsets me is the fear of the unknown. I rarely go to the doctor because I have a good understanding of the human body and various illnesses/injuries.

So, the concern is that it catches up to me when I'm at the doctors and I get awful news.
1	I don't like being weighed and evaluated by the medical assistant. I would rather not see so many people when getting care.
-1	I think what makes me feel the most nervous is learning that there might be something wrong with me that I did not know about before even going to the doctor in the first place.
1	Uncertainty is the key to promote anxiety in my opinion. During the visit, I am worried when I meet with the PCP to discuss the outcome of the examination. The main reason is the uncertainty about the result. What if something really bad happens? What is my current health condition? I cannot control my feeling in the uncertain condition.
-1	The only thing that makes me feel anxious. Is I had surgery for female reproductive problems. The surgery has a 40% failure rate and I go the doctor every 6 months to see if the procedure is still holding or not. That can be a little disconcerting because if it fails I have to have another surgery.
1	I am always uneasy in a doctors office.  I have never gone there for a good time and usually good news means that they have nothing bad to tell you.  I tire of hearing I am getting old and also the rotation of doctors with the current state of health care and insurance in the country.
-1	I feel one never knows what may crop up, but I really don't get worried or anxious about Dr's appointments.  Perhaps a little uncomfortable because I find Dr's appointments are not really enjoyable
1	I am usually worried about what the doctor will say. I don't want to hear any bad news. I also worry that they won't find anything when I know there is something wrong. There have been times where my doctor would say that I was fine, but I knew I wasn't. I also am anxious about what type of tests they will do. My biggest fear is blood work. I usually know when I am getting it, but I always hope they won't do it. 
-1	I am always concerned about discovering I have a sickness, or being lied to by my doctor in some way
1	I am pretty much constantly in pain or having some symptom or another, but I do not like to bring this up, even to the doctor. It was not looked well upon by my family growing up. You just toughed your way through things without whining. I would be worried that I would bring up a concern and it would not have any real medical basis and I would feel like I was complaining about nothing. 
-1	Whenever I'm visiting the doctors office I feel like I tend to get the most anxious whenever I have to be weighed. I also get a little bit anxious whenever I'm sitting in the exam room and have to wait for the doctor to walk in because I just want to know what's going on with me as soon as possible and having to wait just makes me feel like I'm on pins and needles and I start to get worried that it could end up being something worse than what I'm expecting it to be that's going on with me.
1	I am concerned that I am broken that there is something wrong with my body that is not fixable or is not responding to treatment. This anxiety resonates with me every single day, but is at its highest when I am getting an exam at the doctor's office.
-1	When I don't know if I've collected enough symptoms through tracking to be able to get a diagnosis. A diagnosis is hard to get, but once you have one, you can make a plan and do something about the problem. I hate knowing something's wrong but not being able to get help for it, and every time I go to the doctor with a problem, I'm afraid it's going to happen again.
1	I am afraid and worried when I have blood work done because  I always think they are going to find something wrong with me. Also, I am afraid they are going to change the dosage of the medicine I am taking for my auto-immune disease because they would rather go by the lab work then how I feel. 
1	I worry the most about my health being worse than the previous time that I saw him. I get anxious that he can tell that I have not been following his guidelines perfectly in regards to taking care of my personal health.
-1	I think i'm pretty healthy, my doctor says so. So i don't really fell worried or anxious visiting him. Basically it's just the routine checkup, what can go wrong? 
1	I get worried that the doctor will find something is seriously wrong with me and I'll be blindsided by the diagnosis. I once had a regular checkup with my OB GYN where my doctor suspected I had a lump and referred me for a mammogram. This was alarming as I had no idea that would be an issue. I was also in my 20s. The mammogram showed that I was fine. But now I worry about it happening again.
-1	I do not feel anxious at all when visiting a doctors office for normal reasons. They tend to be good at diagnosing and treating conventional illnesses. I just do not trust them with anything beyond that really. The only other reason I may be anxious is if it is flu season. The last two times I have had the flu, I caught it at the doctors office seeking treatment for something else. 
-1	If I'm just going for a regular check-up, I'm not worried at all. However, if something is bothering me, I tend to think the worst, so I do get anxious. It usually turns out to be nothing, and I've worried my self for no reason, but that's my personality. I'm always worried that whatever I'm dealing with is something bad. It can never be simple.
1	That I could potentially find something wrong with my body or something that's out of sync, whether it be blood pressure or even my weight. I feel like if something could go wrong, even a small chance, it's something that I'll think about.
1	It depends on the doctor and the reason for the visit. If I have to go to the gynecologist, it's stressful due to the extreme invasion of privacy. I'm normally not anxious when going to my primary care doctor, unless I have to provide a blood sample. I have an extreme fear of needles.
1	I normally have a lot of anxiety when seeing a doctor not necessarily because I am worried the doctor will not be good enough, but because I am afraid about the uncertainty caused by not knowing what is wrong with me since I am at the doctor to find out what it is. I may find out that it is something really bad so I am scared of that. I am also afraid that the tests that need to be done will cause me pain or discomfort, and I am especially scared of needles.
-1	I think it is just being anxious about your overall health. You do not want anything to be wrong, so you keep thinking about the worst case scenarios while waiting at the doctor's office and you can not get the thoughts out of your head.
1	I just worry that I might have to go through another surgery.  I also have a fear in needles  I also just have bad experience with doctors when I was child.
-1	That they will find something wrong with my health. I am also still a liittle nervous about injections/vaccinations. The older I get, the more anxiety I have about that
-1	If I don't know what is happening to my body. When the symptoms are unknown and I am anxious to find out what is wrong. Only happened to me twice. I think it is the unknown that rattles people.
-1	Nothing, I've never felt discomfort or anxious when going to the doctor. Worrying about something I can't change is pointless and just adds further stress to my body so I keep myself calm and take the punches as they come.
-1	Feeling anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office can be caused by apprehension. The possibility of sick people in the waiting room -- passing along their own illness is always a concern.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I've been there enough times that most visits are routine and anything major can be dealt with during the visit or by a referral to another doctor.
-1	Contracting the flu or another airborne pathogen while waiting in the waiting room. Other than that, not much. Most of our visits are well checks where we have no urgent medical treatment needs. So, we spend most of our time making sure our hands are washed and cleaned and use both face masks for protection.
-1	I hate social interaction the most. I don't care about the results, because I know that I'm in good shape and doing everything correctly.
1	I feel like the doctor will tell me something bad, something that will effect my life or the way I lead my life. I am fearful of all possible outcomes. I worry about these things that may hurt my family if I am sick.
-1	Just hearing some bad news but I know they are just doing their job at the end of the day, so whatever they do is understandable.
1	I would feel anxious or worried about a doctors visit if I had a strange pain or feeling in my body that I haven't had before. Not knowing what could be the cause of the pain or illness would make me worried about what the diagnosis could be. I would slightly doubt the doctor fully understands what I am feeling and if the treatment would be the correct procedure for me. I would not feel anxious or worried if I was just going in for a regular checkup or follow up. Only when I am experiencing something I have never experienced is when I would start to worry.
1	I hate small talk with people I don't know that well. Hate answering the same questions over and over, especially ones I don't think are their business or that I know how they are going to respond and I also know I am not going to change my behavior. 
-1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious is the thought that something might be wrong with me.  It has nothing to do with my doctor or how he performs checkups or physicals.
1	Sometime I get worried that something will be wrong. I have two beautiful daughters and I always want to be healthy for them. I also have a long family history of breast and ovarian cancer. As well as heart problems, high blood pressure and diabetes. I always worry that I maybe suseptable to one of these conditions and it worries me.  I ear that one day I will be checked or tested and Iâll end up with a condition that a family member of mine had. 
1	Having insurance issues that make payment difficult is one of my biggest anxiety factors. I also have a hypochondriac streak and expect terrible news about my health.
1	I am always worried when I see the doctor because I always feel like they are going to tell me something is really wrong with me. For the longest I thought I wa healthy now every time I go they find something new about me. I donât know if it is they want more money from me or they are really trying to help me.
-1	i do not feel particularly anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. if i had to choose something, then i would say that waiting for test results may sometimes make me feel a little bit anxious.
1	I feel like I am not going to be able to clearly explain how I am feeling to her. I don't want he to think I am over exaggeration anything so I kind of hold back but then I feel she won't really understand what I am dealing with. 
1	I always have a latent worry spring to life when entering a doctor's office that he or she will find something very wrong with me and the condition will affect my loved ones.
-1	I think the most obvious answer is that nobody wants to hear something is wrong with them.  I have an unnatural fear of death anyways.  I do not have a regular physician because I am almost never sick.  So on occasion, when I have been sick or something has been wrong that I felt that I needed to go the doctor, I have worried that I would hear bad news.  The mind tends to go to worse case scenario.  I go to get a yearly mammogram and a yearly pap smear-neither of which is a pleasant experience just for the fact that it leaves me exposed. So that is enough to cause anxiety but add to that the possibility that they will find something wrong is always enough to cause worry.
-1	Not knowing what the problem is that you are seeing the doctor for.  SOmetimes small little pains can lead to big problems.  That will definitely cause me to be anxious and worried.
1	I struggle with my weight and it makes me uncomfortable when at the doctors, also I'm always worried that there is the possibility that they will find something truly wrong and expensive.
1	There is always sense of anxiety when you go the doctor. You might feel healthy and fine, and then the doctor  might find something. It happened to me a few times, when I went to the doctor. So, there always there sense of uneasiness. Just my 2 cents. 
-1	I simply get nervous thinking something will be wrong with me which is seriously life threatening. Sometimes I get like this, but it isn't often. My anxiousness subsides once I see the doctor. 
-1	A dreadful diagnosis such as a terminal disease, cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's, or organ failure. Anything that makes me worry about dying is worrisome.
1	I think I always think the worst when I go, I act as if I am going to walk in and they're going to tell me I have some deadly disease. I usually feel like when I leave I feel better automatically no matter what is wrong just because I find out there is nothing wrong with me (that can be long term bad).
-1	The most anxious I feel is the wait for the Doctor. I understand that they are busy, but when I sit around waiting long past appointment times I feel like they do not value my time in the same sense that I value theirs by being on time.
1	I get anxious and worried every time I visit the doctor. I'm not quite sure what it is to be exact of the reason that I'm so afraid, but I think that it has a lot to do with me being afraid that something is going to go wrong. When I'm worried, my blood pressure usually shoots up from me worrying a lot. I feel so much dread when going to the doctor. 
1	I am always concerned that there is some underlying issue that I am not aware of, and am fearful that I will get test results that reflect this. Also I am not a fan of being touched even in normal circumstances so that is stressful for me.
1	I never visit the doctor for a good reason, i'e either sick or injured so worrying about the worst case is human nature. Plus the whole thing is uncomfortable, with the doctor feeling up your member, them taking your pee, the waiting room, and paying for it all.  
1	I get nervous about being around a lot of sick people. If I'm seeing a different doctor than normal I'm worried that they won't take me seriously. I also worry that there might be something really wrong with me if I can't figure out what is wrong on my own.
1	I try to take good care of myself, but I know I don't always make the best choices. And I worry and have anxiety all the time anyways.   So it's just worse when I need to visit a doctor. I always think and worthy about the worst possible scenarios.

1	I am worried that something will be wrong with me or that I will need to undergo expensive treatment. 
-1	I get most worried that I'll be told I have a serious medical condition of some kind, particularly cancer. My family doesn't have a history of cancer or anything, but some of my behavior throughout my life with substance abuse has led to what I think is a higher risk of certain cancers, so that is what makes me most anxious about going to a doctor. But it's not something I dwell on.
-1	I sometimes feel a little anxious about going to the doctorâs office because my family has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Although I try to eat better and exercise regularly, I sometimes feel that I am going to get bad news from my physician. There are so many factors right now in regards to eating habits, physical fitness, and stress that may easily change your health outcomes. I sometimes associate doctorâs visits with something going wrong in your life. I always expect the worst and think that something bad is going to happen to me and that I need to change something.   
1	"When visiting the doctor's office, my biggest worry is that they will ""find something seriously wrong.""  I don't think that is an uncommon fear, and maybe not even irrational, but it does occur."
1	THINKING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME. KNOWING THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG AND MY LIFE MIGHT CHANGE JUST LIKE THAT.

1	First, the paper gown is a nightmare. Who doesn't feel anxious wearing only a bit of paper? My usual appointment is for an annual exam, so there's always anxiety about having potentially cold and uncomfortable metal objects put in my girl bits. And, of course, the fear that the doctor is going to find something horrible/fatal
1	I never liked hospitals or clinics. Those places always made me anxious as a kid and I guess I never got over it. My fear of needles also contributes to that anxiousness. 
1	There are a few things that seem to make me feel almost anxious or even worried when visiting the doctor's office. One of those things include diseases that can be spread from patient to patient.
-1	I am usually not worried when I visit the doctor's office. I take most things as they come. If I had to think of something that makes me anxious, it's the thought of what the visit to the office might cost me, and how much I will have to pay out of pocket since I don't have insurance. Other than that, I don't get nervous when I go to the doctor.
1	I always worry that there may be something serious with my health.  Recently I have started to have all sort of problems.  There seems to be something with every part of my body.  
1	The potential for being disagnosed with something new and dangerous can make me feel worried.  The potential for being pressured into new medicines and/or shots can make me feel worried.  Being told to take 2 different blood medications when I have not yet started taking the first one makes me feel worried and manipulated.
-1	I sometimes worry that there might be something major wrong with me. Like I fear the worst sometimes like if I would to be diagnosed with cancer or something life threatening. 
1	I feel most afraid that the doctor will gloss over what I am saying and not try to understand. I then cannot be reassured by anything said.
-1	Wondering how much the payment will be. Wondering what I might need to solve my issues. Wondering if I could get help for my migraines or would I be stuck with them.
1	I am usually nervous when i need to have any blood work done. It is a terrible feeling, especially if you have to do it on an empty stomach. No matter the assurance that the doctor gives me, i still know that it is going to be an unpleasant experience.
1	I am afraid that something will be discovered that has gone unnoticed, such as cancer! I am nervous at being inspected closely. I am nervous that something is wrong that will be missed or misdiagnosed. I am nervous about my body shape or life choices being judged. I am nervous about the financial cost. I am nervous that some drug will be recommended that I do not want to take or that will be expensive or will have side effects.
-1	Just learning something new about my health, especially if it's something negative. But haven't really experienced that so it makes me worry that one day something might come up unexpectedly.
-1	I always feel like I am going to hear bad news when I go to the doctor for a checkup. I have been dealing with a disease since a very young age and I recently have begun to feel like maybe this illness is even worse than anyone originally thought.
-1	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the thought of them finding something that could lead to a terminal diagnosis such as cancer. I do smoke cigarettes (about a pack a day) so sometimes I worry that something would be found to indicate the need for more testing. Uncertainty makes me nervous if it's for something that could potentially be serious. I am generally not anxious or worried when going to the doctor's office though. 
-1	I am mostly worried that my weight or blood pressure or something may not be normal and there will be further testing to be done.
-1	If I have something wrong with me and I can't pinpoint exactly what it is I get a little bit worried, since it might be something serious.  I always get restless when I'm waiting to hear the information that the doctor will tell me. 
1	Well usually when I go its cause theres something wrong with me thats causing a pretty bad ailment and so I already go into it expecting something bad. I can be a bit of a hypochondriac and that may play on my experience a little bit. But then its also because a lot of the procedures they must do to check you out, are uncomfortable or downright painful. And sometimes, doctors tell you that there is something they found that concerns you and they get you super worried, when they shouldnt say anything until test results come back. Many times I have had them distress me thinking I had an issue such as an enlarged/inflamed liver, just to find out theres absolutely nothing wrong with my liver. The days of stress from worrying waiting for those results is unnecessary. 
-1	A long wait makes me feel anxious.  If the doctor were to suggest a test that I was not expecting I would be worried.
1	When visiting the doctor's office, I am afraid that I may get some news that could be very bad. I am also afraid that I may have not been following the doctor's orders as I should and he may be upset with me. I am also afraid of the costs that may be incurred.  I am also afraid of needles so the thought of a shot is upsetting. 
1	I feel concerned and worried that I might receive bad news when I go to to the doctor. I feel this way even when I have no reason to feel this way.
-1	If the doctor found something strange or maligns after the tests.  If I have a chronic condition that affects my entire life. 
1	Mostly just wondering if theres anything wrong with you that you don't know about, and the possibility of it being something dangerous like cancer. Everyone has a fear of uncertainty that makes them uncomfortable and nervous.
-1	I feel most anxious when I have to wait a long time after a blood test or x-ray or similar tests. I also feel very anxious when the doctor seems to be in thoughts when I am sitting in front of him. I am also anxious when what the doctors says is not clear to me or he talks in a very complicated way.
1	You just never know what is going to be found out. I have a lot of iffy family history that makes me nervous so I always dread going to the doctor
-1	i just hope that there is nothing wrong with me and hearing everything is all good that make me feel happy
1	im afraid they will tell me something bad or tell me that im unhealthy because of my weight or vitals
1	I worry about the cost and about having a doctor that might not seem to care about me. If I go see a doctor, I want them to wholly focus on my health when I'm there, and I worry they won't do that.
-1	Getting blood work because my veins are not good. I hate that I may get stuck 4 or more times in order to get blood done. 
1	Well, seeing a new doctor is unnerving. Especially if you've ever had a bad experience with a doctor. Also, feeling like your needs may not be met or like there is something unexpectedly wrong with you makes you feel anxious or worried. 
-1	sometimes having ot ask for my anti depressant medicine to be refilled gives me a little anxiety because I kinda still feel ashamed and wnoder if they really want to fill it for me.
-1	I usually am worried about the cost. Also I worry that my illness or pain might be something worse that will cost more to treat. 
1	That I will get bad news.   That the doctor will tell me something bad about my health.  I also worry that I will have to undergo more tests or treatments.
-1	I am nervous about my weight and what they will say to tell me to lose it.  I get anxious that I will be judged.  I hate putting on a thin gown and the office always seems cold.  I hate the paper and waiting an undisclosed amount of time.
1	Worst part is the waiting room, where I come up with worst case scenarios in my mind about all the horrible things that arenât wrong, but they could be. Basically my own mind is why Iâm anxious and worried, nothing more.
-1	If I have maybe a bump or an ailment which I kind of worry if it's something more. The head games you play with yourself where you try to play doctor but really your brain just goes to worst case scenarios. 
-1	Not knowing why I feel the way I am and is it a really problem or just I need to keep a better check on myself
1	I am worried that they are going to tell me I have some huge problem and then judge me for it. Or that they may just say I do so they can make money. Or make me feel uncomfortable about myself. I am a very private person. The best case scenario is that I go in they say I have a clean bill of health and I just paid them for that. 
1	Expenses are a big part of it, but I also don't feel very thrilled about finding out what may be wrong with me either.  Plus, my injury made me feel very useless, I couldn't work or do a lot of other things and those feelings sort of colored all of the experiences that I had at the time if that makes any sense.
-1	that i cant afford it or im going to have something keeping me off work too long. the wait also makes me anxious.
1	If I have an unexpected pain or problem, then i feel worried. I feel that although they can help at times, its up to God to heal.
1	"I always think there's some random disease they will tell me i have. Im not sure why. I guess its the whole ""not knowing"" thing. "
-1	I never know what is going to be said so I always have some level of anxiety with doctors visits. I also have had a few bad experiences. 
1	I always feel anxious about visiting the doctor. I worry about my test results from my last visit. I worry that I will get better news about my health. 
1	I worry that there might be some bad result or that I might be sick and not know it.  I get scared that the test being performed might not have the result I want.  I get nervous days before doctor appointments.  And if I have a procedure done I worry even more because I have to wait for the results.  The waiting is the thing that really makes me worry, if I know I am going to have to wait for some results I lose sleep the week before I have to go in.  Losing sleep makes me even more anxious and by the time I get to the appointment I am really uneasy.  Not knowing the outcome really makes me scared.
-1	There's always a bit of worry that something is wrong that I didn't notice. I just like to be fully prepared.
-1	Most of the time it is the wait to see the doctor.  The sitting to get back into the office then the waiting once I do get into the examining room.  I worry that something new may be needed that will cause an extra charge. So all in all I would say waiting and money.
1	I am worried since I am getting older that something will go wrong. As you age, it's sure that something won't work like it used to.  I want to make sure that I am examined thoroughly and that the doctor spends time doing the appropriate tests.
1	I hate stepping on the scale and I hate to be partially naked in front of people I don't know. I'm also always a little nervous that the small thing I mention just in case, could turn out to be something big and a bad diagnosis. 
1	I am a breast cancer survivor so I am always anxious before any doctor appointment now. I feel like I would rather not go and not risk getting anymore surprise bad news. This usually occurs with blood testing or any other types of medical tests. I felt fine before I was diagnosed so I know that there is a chance to feel good and not know something is wrong inside. It will probably make me feel this way for the rest of my life.
-1	I am most anxious or worried about that  there is something unexpected that I  didn't think could be a concern.  I would be worried that there would be many tests investigate further.
1	The thing that makes me the most anxious is when a doctor does not talk much when they dont act like they care.  When a doctor seems like he is having a bad day can make me anxious 
1	The biggest fear is that something very bad will be discovered. I worry about going for what seems like a relatively normal ache or pain and finding out I have some deadly or crippling disease. No one wants to hear their upset stomach is stomach cancer. Finances can also be worrisome. I am always nervous I will need to get expensive prescriptions or procedures I did not anticipate.
1	I don't go to the doctor unless I really have to. It's expensive. So because I can't go for check ups when I need to, I always worry that something major could be wrong.
-1	The thing that always gets me going is the blood pressure cuff.  It gets really tight around my arm, and I've always hated that.  But actually seeing the doctor is usually pleasant and problem-free. 
1	The thing that really bothers me about going to the doctor is that he will order another MRI on my back again. I had a frightening extreme case of claustraphobia one time a year ago in a very small MRI machine and I am afraid that I will experience that again.
1	When I have to have blood drawn or put through other tests to confirm or deny diagnoses. That is very stressful because I have to wait for results and while I am getting my blood drawn most phlebotomist do not know what they are doing
-1	There is really nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried. The only thing i do not like is waiting. I am not overly cmnfrotable around sick strangers. I get a little uptight when everyone is coughing and sneezing and the room seems to get smaller. Again I have no worries at the DR other than waiting.
-1	I am a very reserved person and being examined, even by someone I trust, feels somewhat invading.  I also am thinking about whether the exam will produce any negative findings such as high blood pressure or less than favorable results with any bloodwork that has been done.  I go in trying to relax and talking to myself in a soothing way but it usually just makes me more tense.  
-1	They will rush you. Support staff seems disinterested and abrupt. Lack of professionalism in general and seem almost undereducated.
-1	I think there is always the thought in the back of my mind that something might be discovered that is a big health problem. I don't stay worried about this constantly, but that thought creeps up most times when I go to the doctor. There is cancer in my family history for example, and sometimes I worry about that. Really, it's just a general thought that pops up during doctor visits.
-1	Mostly about pain.  If I know that a shot or some test like bloodwork is required, I do not like it.  It's not enough to make me avoid them but it does add to my slight worry.  
-1	I typically feel anxious. I think the only thing that ever worries me is if I think that something is wrong and I am worried about what treatment might be recommended or potential side effects. I am also sometimes worried when I know that I am going to have something painful done
-1	I am generally not too anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because of the strong relationship I have with my physician. What would make me most anxious is if I'm seeing the doctor for an ongoing illness that is severe and am dreading a diagnosis of a major disease/cancer. 
-1	I really don't care much anymore. I am 69, have lived a full life, and I fully expect my health to deteriorate and I am capable of accepting that. The only thing that makes me close to anxious about visiting the doctor are painful shots, but I can handle it. 
1	I really get anxious when I think about my labs coming out bad. The doctor always seems like it is my fault they are coming out bad even though I'm trying my hardest to improve my health.
1	When I go to my doctor's office for a check up, I am always anxious that my blood tests will show that something is wrong. I tested in the pre-diabetic range last time I went, so this is a worry for me right now.
-1	Nothing really in particular, I just have doctor anxiety -- along with general anxiety. I think the doctor called it White Coat Anxiety or something like that.
1	Not knowing what the outcome will be and it there has to be something done how bad will it hurt and how long will it take to heal.
1	I feel that a doctor is reacting to my symptoms but rarely cares to work on discovering what is causing it. They are more inclined to just hand me a prescription and send me on my way.
1	"My doctor does my ""well woman"" exams. I don't think that any woman is entirely comfortable with that. My doctor has a good personal manner of dealing with people, though.  I think any time that I put on a gown with no back on it and nothing underneath, I am not going to be at my most confident."
1	Im anxious when I go to the doctor sometimes because I dont know what to expect when I go there. In the back of my head I feel like everything is going to be fine but you never know.
-1	I am always worried about getting bad news or bad test results. Doctors offices always just make me feel uneasy. 
1	I fear that they are going to come back and go we just found something terribly wrong with you and... That or its we need to get you on this medication and its going to cost a bazillion dollars and you better take it or there is nothing I can do for you. Or lets run these other tests that I am pretty sure are unreleated but they will boost my bottom line so lets do these. To which I know I will have to seem like a butthead as I ask what specifically they need that test for and why. But of course I dont always trust the answer as again its for making money.
1	I get really anxious about all aspects of visiting a doctor's office. I'm usually very nervous before I even get there. I dread getting weighed. I'm always worried that they will find something seriously wrong with me, even if I'm just there for a minor illness or an annual physical. 
1	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is not know what I may have, or what medication I have to take. I am also concerned with the fees I may have to pay.
-1	What makes me nervous about being at the doctor's office is being around people who I think are sick.  I'm afraid I will get sick just by being there. 
-1	I will have to fight to get the doctor to acknowledge I'm a human being and listen to me. He never has time to actually listen. He hops on the first thing he sees on his phone and writes a prescription. That's worrisome for me. I know I will not get good treatment unless what I have is common and everyone is treated the same.
1	I am often worried about whether I will be treated with respect, more than anything. Or that the doctor I see will dismiss whatever I am struggling with. I also struggle a little with blood draws-- I get incredibly faint. Sometimes I am nervous for my own health, but most of the time if I'm not seeing my primary care doctor, I'm just rolling the dice as to whether I'll get someone rude and disinterested or someone who's an actual professional.
1	I'm usually most worried that I will receive some bad news. I've had a lot of health problems in the past and always feel like the worst possible scenario is going to come true.
-1	The prospect of pain or experiencing something physically uncomfortable - having a boil lanced, or a skin biopsy taken. 
1	Being told that something is severely wrong with me. I just had this happen recently when I went for a physical and ANS turned up positive (auto immune issue). I still have to go to another lab for a more detailed test and I've been putting it off since I kind of dread it, plus, it's is a hassle. I'm also always uneasy when I'm getting examined I don't have a specific reason, I just don't like it. I also hate getting undressed and having the whole staff in and out and you are sitting there naked in a paper gown. 
-1	I am comfortable with the exam and tests themselves. What makes me feel anxious is the results of any tests or exams. I guess you could say the unknown. 
1	Overall I do not like doctors, and I have had bad experiences with uncaring doctors before and I do not want to repeat those situations again
1	"The smell of a hospital/doctors office immediately gets me anxious. Moreso however, I almost expect them to say something is wrong (whether or not I have reason to think there is), and either ready injections or prescribe medications. It's primarily the thought of ""what if something is wrong"" and the outcome of it."
1	I feel anxious because of the waiting room and germs (I am a bit of a germophobia and am afraid I might contract an illness while waiting). I also get worried about maybe being pinpointed from the doctor if I didn't follow there instructiosn to the t
-1	Being in good health and being able to maintain good health. Not wanting to have any issues with my blood work or health. 
1	First of all coming to appointment on time and waiting for up to an hour for the doctor. Then expectation of lack of details after exam.
-1	Anxious to see what they are going to say. Because no one or Doctor can know your body better than you. Are Bodies give us signs if something is wrong.
-1	Thinking that he will find something that is wrong that I didn't know about. That there will be something major that will affect my life.
-1	More often than not it is just my own imagination conjuring up the worst case scenarios for simple illnesses/problems. There is nothing about the actual visit that makes me anxious. I put it all on myself.
-1	When visiting the doctor's office, I am most worried about hearing bad news. The moments leading up to the visit itself is most nerve-racking. 
-1	What makes me anxious is that my doctor finds something really wrong with me. That would be one of my biggest fears, and to be honest is what makes it harder for me to get a check up from my doctor. Though my doctor does his best to make me feel that I am as comfortable that I can be. No one really wants to hear any type of bad news. Once I hear that everything is fine with my health from my doctor then that is when all of my anxiety disappear. That is what worry about the most.
-1	The thing that I'm the most worried about is having to get extra things done like labs where they take blood or running tests because my insurance doesn't cover squat so I have to pay for everything out of pocket.
-1	The lobbies and the wait time, It takes way too long and people usually have their kids running around being obnoxious.
1	It is always the waiting process, I feel very dizzy at hospitals because of the classic smell and the test results make me nervous even is they might be very good.
1	Not knowing what the doctor is going to say or what the test results are going to be.  Needles and blood make me nervous
1	I am greatly uncomfortable getting blood drawn. I immediately get very fearful of this once I step into the doctors office. It's uncomfortable to have someone touch you and to not have clothes on, etc.
1	I sometimes fear that we will discover something that will have morbid consequences.  It is somewhat irrational when I have no underlying symptoms.  But I cannot help it.
-1	I worry a little that they might find something wrong. More than that I worry about having to make choices and advocate to get the treatment I want. 
1	I usually visit the doctor's when something's wrong, so I am always anxious to find out what it is.  In addition, I fear nasty diagnoses, painful tests, or having to take some horrible drug.  I am very relieved every time I leave a health care building alive and ambulatory, as I feel that just going there presents some level of risk.  For me it's basically a choice between two evils-- the disease or the doctor.  
-1	I might get kind or nervous that i might have something really bad or dangerous to my body and my mind. Nothing else but that. 
-1	I don't usually feel this way. If I were to be anxious, it would be for a painful test or procedure. 
1	Mostly, I'm worried about whatever situation made me visit the doctor. I don't visit the doctor unless I feel I have a serious problem that won't go away on its own and it will need some medical treatment. This is a very rare occurrance though.
1	Always wonder if maybe he has some bad news after giving his examinations. Also going to a doctor is rare so i'm a bit nervous just interacting with him. If i go to the doctor it is generally because of some problem so i worry about that too.
-1	That I may or may not have a serious health confliction and in having one my doctor will look down on me and judge me. I am also afraid about how much everything will cost me in the end
-1	About finding out if I had some kind of eating disorder. Also if maybe the reason I was losing weight was that of something that could not be explained what so ever. Also, I was worried that if I had some kind of disorder, what would the woman that I love say about that?
1	I think that the things hat makes me the most anxious is just not knowing what to expect.  I often start to imagine the worst situations, like the doctor will find something terribly wrong with me and I let my imagination get the best of me.  I also tend to think that procedures and exams are going to be more uncomfortable than they actually are.
1	I often feel worried that the doctor will give me bad news. I am worried that something some day will be seriously wrong with me and I will have to make a major life change to survive.
1	I guess I just do not want to hear any negative information. Being in a doctors office feels a little cold and sterile. The environment encourages you to feel nervous and a little jittery. 
-1	"I don't feel overly anxious or worried, it's more like a small bit of ""what if I'm really sick"" or the doctor finds something abnormal. "
-1	I get a little nervous about judgement maybe. Like they'll think Im a hypochondriac if I tell them everything I need help with. I don't like the smell of the place, that alcohol smell. I don't like people touching me. I don't like how you're shoved around like cattle into different rooms. I don't like the front office at doctor's office, they are usually cold and sterile. Just say hello to a patient would be nice. LOL
1	I hate sitting in the waiting room. It is noisy, dirty, and loud with patients, kids and the TVs blasting. The waiting room is not conducive to people who have mental disorders. Then when I am answering the basic, every visit questions (like do I feel like hurting myself or others) I feel anxious that he is not listening or caring how I really feel unless I answer opposite of what I know the correct answer is. He barely looks at me when talking to me and has used another patient's name when writing my prescriptions. I don't trust him nor do I even like him. I want to go back to my other doctor.
-1	How much the cost is going to be, and what my blood pressure is - although that seems to get me worked up and drive it up more, ha.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious about visiting the doctor's office is my fear of social interactions.
1	who knows, there are so many symptoms that can be said to be related to all kinds of diseases, nobody wants to let some body else tell them that they have diseases
-1	Not getting the results back quickly is what makes me anxious when going to the doctor or if she can't give me an answer right away and has to rely on lab results instead.
1	I worry mainly weather or not i have money to pay for the copay and then if my insurance is going to cover the rest. Insurance companies are so weird you never know what they are going to cover and finances are always my biggest stressor. 
1	I get anxious when visited the doctor because I'm afraid of what they might find and that it will be bad news.
-1	I just do not like visiting the doctor.  This brings worry to me and makes me anxious.  also, I am an anxious person anyway so I stay anxious.
-1	Nothing makes me anxious.  I am relaxed and calm.  I guess the only thing that makes me a bit anxious is sitting in the exam room wrapped in paper, but I'm fine once someone comes in.
1	I lost my mom to a stroke a few years ago so I am now anxious whenever I visit a doctor, I was not prior to suddenly losing my mother. I smoke (less then half a pack of cigarettes a day) and I know the negative impacts this can have on my health so I am always worried. Also my cousin's 18 year old son was just diagnosed with Cancer so I am now aware that anything can happen. 
1	I'm always worried he will find something wrong with me either during exam or with bloodwork. I get anxious getting called in like I've failed the test.
-1	I am always worried about  visiting the doctor because you never know what the diagnosis might be it could be good or bad. 
-1	The only thing that I could think of is the fear that I may be sick. Other than that I'm not to fearful at the doctors
1	I have a lot of things wrong with me and I am always afraid they will find something new or I will have to have more surgery which is very hard on me and my family
1	I worry sometimes that something serious could be wrong with me.  So, when going to get checked out I fear that they will find something bad, instead of thinking it could be something minor.
-1	I sometimes feel anxious or worried because you never know what your blood tests will show even though you may be feeling fine.
1	I might be diagnosed with something horrible. I may need to have further examinations. I may be billed a very high amount.
-1	I have met with my new Dr. one time and walked away confident and peaceful that he is my primary Dr. Time will tell.
1	I always feel slightly uncomfortable being examined, they may be more to do with my personal insecurities than with the doctor or the exam itself.
1	I can't stand to be touched. I have PTSD from being raped and I absolutely hate when they want to do a gyn exam. I am never made to feel like this is okay. When I went to the county clinic for birth control they told me I couldn't have birth control until I allowed them to examine me even though I have never had sex other than being raped and I was hysterically crying. I just wanted to get birth control because I'm getting married and want to be prepared but I ended up leaving with nothing and felt so ashamed.
1	I usually worry that they will find something wrong with me that is serious. I tend to assume the worst. I look to them to calm me down and help me see that chances are good it's nothing serious.
1	My biggest fear is getting blood taken, so I'm always petrified I'm going to have to have it done. It causes me a great amount of stress. Sometimes I'm worried I might be diagnosed with something I had no idea I had.
1	I just have horrible white coat syndrome. We went to the doctor when we were little only if we were terribly ill. I think as a result, I have a profound fear of all medical surroundings. 
1	I am always worried that something is going to be really wrong and also they it will cost a lot of money. 
1	just not knowing the unknown of the whole situation. worrying about things that you might be wrong with you ect. 
1	Just the act of going there.  The uncertainty of what could possibly happen and what the next steps would be.
1	What they are going to say. What they are going to find. The outlook. The coldness of the doctor. Having to explain things to the doctor. Them not listening. 
1	Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination.
1	First, how long am I going to wait. I know doctors have little regard for their patients time as I tend to wait 30 minutes to two hours for them to arrive. If I am  sitting in a doctor's office, I have a health issue, so of course I'm worried that it could be serious.
1	Being at the doctors makes me anxious and worried because I dont know what he's going to tell me.  I dont know if something seriously could be wrong with me or not.
-1	In general, what makes me the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is when I go for a specific reason. For example, STD testing or I have something I noticed that I want to seek attention for. These are the situations that cause the most anxiety because they aren't specifically routine, but conditional. While I do have an annual physical, I know what to expect based upon historical visits, but when something unexpected occurs it could be anything from minor to severe and you just aren't aware of it. What if that rash is something more? What if that mole isn't right and I need to be referred to a dermatologist? What if that cold wont go away as fast as it should? These are the kinds of situation that cause me anxiety.
1	I think the thing that makes me most anxious is whether something is really wrong or not when I visit my PCP. If I have to wait for results, that is the worse for me. Not knowing is sometimes worrisome and makes me anxious because of the wait.
-1	I think like most other people I'm most worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me. I've been very lucky with my health, and would like to stay that way so whenever I go for a checkup there's always a little bit of anxiousness that I might have some disease or something that I don't know about.
-1	There is actually not much that scares me. I know I have a light heart condition and moderate CAPD. But I know also that I have quality healthcare and that this healthcare is available when I need it. I have regular check-ups and have cardiac training 3 times per week.
1	The reason that I'm there is usually not a good reason. That in itself causes me to have anxiety, especially if I am not feeling well, or have a problem. Also, medical procedures make me uncomfortable. Examinations usually also get personal or require talking about matters that make me uncomfortable by their nature. I'm also concerned that they are going to find something terrible, or that I'm going to have to do something that requires a lot of suffering to improve the situation.
1	WHEN THE DOCTOR DO THE PHYSICAL CHECK AND KEEP TESTING OR DOING THE SAME TEST AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT GET ME WORRY THAT THERE IS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY HEALTH. 
1	I am anxious at the doctors office because i am sick and do not know what is going on with my body. I worry the treatment is going to be painful or uncomfortable and this brings my anxiety up. 
-1	Finding out that my I might have inherited a health problem from a family member during a check up or analysis, that is always a major concern and cause for nervousness when booking a check up.
1	I am always afraid that the doctor will find something very, very wrong. I used to watch a lot of hospital shows, where you go in for a hiccup and you end up dying. I have since stopped watching those and I have been less afraid.
-1	I think of the worst possible situations and get worried about being diagnosed with something bad. I am usually able to get those thoughts out of my head though.
1	I just am an anxious person.  I don't like the doctor's office and try to avoid it when possible.  I go when needed though and usually good comes of it.  I just get so nervous that something might be wrong or that they're judging me.
-1	There's not really alot that would make me worried about actually seeing the doctor. If anything I would be the most worried about why I am going to the doctor. If I dont know what is going on and it is something that has been bothering me, it more about the unknown. The other thing I would be nervous about is if I have to go to the doctor last minute and I have to see another doctor that I havent seen before. When you see your regular doctor there is already some trust there so seeing someone else doesnt feel right to me and it is hard to trust them because they are not my doctor. Lastly, when I go for my yearly exam it just makes me nervous because of the discomfort. 
-1	The number one thing would be the discovery of something that is asymptomatic. I'm sixty years of age and feel pretty good. So I guess any anxiety I might feel would be tied into discovering an issue that I had not planned on.
1	For one thing, if there is the flu going around like now, I am very hesitant and anxious to go get bloodwork or general exam because I don't want to end up catching the flu from the sick people there. Beyond that, I just have had a few years recently that I feel going to the doctor is a waste of money for me, I leave with no answers, no solutions and just more broke. I have no confidence in the doctors at this juncture to at least point me in the right direction regarding my health. It is a frustration that I'm currently dealing with as a matter of fact. I personally feel (and many others in similar situations that I have talked with) feel that Novant Health, in particular, has ruined my family practice that I've gone to for decades. In recent years, it's just become a waste of money as I'm shuffled in and out after paying. That in and of itself, the lack of confidence I have now in the process, does cause me anxiety, as well as teh finances.
-1	I feel anxious or worried based upon whether my doctor will discover an issue with my health. This means that I will have to deal with the necessary research to determine if my health will require more attention as well as achieve the necessary footing to converse with my doctor on the subject of my health.
-1	I'm always a tiny bit worried when I'm at the doctor just because I worry they could find something wrong that I didn't expect but for the most part, this is not something I'm too worried about and I trust that most of my doctor appointments will go generally well as expected.
1	I am just funny about people touching me so I get anxious about that.  Also that something might be found that I don't want to find out about.  Just the whole process of having to be examined.
1	I'm always worried that something terrible will be found, especially now that I'm getting old. I also worry that something will be misdiagnosed, sending me in a long spiral of unpleasant tests and more appointments that lasts for weeks. Since I don't fully trust doctors, I also don't trust them to cure me if something terrible is wrong.
-1	I don't feel anxious when I visit a doctor's office.  I am calm and looking ahead at what I will learn about the doctor and my health.
-1	I am always afraid that they will want to draw blood from me.  I have a very severe phobia of needles and I almost always pass out.  It's embarrassing and I always have to explain myself before they start the process.  I usually tell them it's probably safer for everyone if they let me lay down somewhere while they are taking the blood.  I have hit the floor several times and hurt myself after passing out.  It's a terrible thing to live with.  
-1	I feel anxious when I have a sudden medical issue that presents itself that needs to be seen by the doctor. Also, when I'm having an unusual test done, like a biopsy, I feel very anxious.
1	I feel anxious when I am at the doctor's office because, even though I am healthy, there is always a chance that a medical problem could be discovered.
-1	I am a hypochondriac and believe that even the most minor symptom is due to something larger and i'm dying. When I visit the doctor, i feel he will confirm that i'm really sick,
-1	I am afraid they might find something that is out of the ordinary. The daunting feeling of fear is what is the most worrying. 
1	"Can I just repeat the word ""everything"" ten times? My health keeps getting more and more... interesting as time passes. Nobody knows why I can't walk more than a few feet. Nobody knows why I'm nauseated all the time. Or why I trip over my own shadow on a regular basis. After a while, you get really tired of doctors saying to you, ""Wow, that's really weird."""
1	i often feel as though i cannot accurately describe my issues because i feel nervous or afraid, and when i do try, i often feel misunderstood or dismissed. i also worry about things i can not control, such as exposure to other sick people or uncertainty about the physicians own care and sterilization practices. 
1	The things that make me feel most anxious at the doctor's office are a) my ability to communicate clearly the symptoms I am experiencing and how often I experience them and b) describing intimate or personal issues with female nurses and doctors.  I am far more comfortable with male doctors or nurses.
1	Sometimes I'm worried that something might come up. Like I might have an illness that I didn't know about. The waiting is really intense sometimes. 
1	I am always nervous that something will be wrong with me. I get nervous sitting in the waiting room because I imagine whatever symptoms I am experiencing could be a serious illness. I worry about the doctor not saying much because they get concerned while examining me.
1	Test results. I have a few issues with my blood sugar and A1C, so I'm always a little anxious about what they will say about my sugars and my weight. I do not want to have insulin at any point in my life, so I've been working on controlling sugars without it. Sometimes I succeed, but not always. And a lot of doctors don't approve of the diet I'm using(ketogenic), unless they have a higher understanding of nutrition.
1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried is not being taking seriously. It seems most doctors are so quick to send you on their way so that they can get to their next patient. It is so hard to find a doctor who acts they actually care now - a - days. Im also worried about being treated for the wrong thing while the real problem is growing stronger. I had a friend who had a tumor the size of a basket ball on her uterus. The doctor told her she was pregnant. So for two months she walked around thinking she was pregnant. Turns out she had a very progressed cancer tumor on her uterus. She almost died from being mis- diagnosed.
1	Even though I trust my primary care physician, I still worry about my health. I worry the doctor might tell me some bad news about my health. I worry a pain I have might be cancer or something else serious. I worry about pain and death.
-1	They usually have some difficulty finding a vein in one arm, but other people are better in other locations. I do dread my colonoscopies since the last one was painful. But not much else..so far, since I'm relatively young.
1	I am afraid I'll have some horrible disease or find out that my doctor cannot help me in a way that will improve my well being. It feels tense because I don't know what to expect and am also afraid of being judged.
-1	Nothing , I selected nothing on the survey because it's true. I feel calm and fine in the doctors office. I have never been through a real medical scare to make me feel otherwise. 
-1	I always get anxious about blood work results. I never really get bad results but I sill worry a bit. My blood pressure is always a little high when I go in but this is a normal thing for me.
1	Mainly that something will be wrong, when I go for the next check up, I'm getting older and I smoke and this is around the age when my mother started to have medical problems.
1	It has nothing to do with my doctor herself, or her staff. I'm just not a huge fan of sitting in waiting rooms, and I feel like that tends to cause my heart rate to rise and then for me to just get nervous about being there in general. I feel like hospitals and doctor's offices just have a certain smell to them that I'll never fully get used to. My main issue with my health is also having a history of anxiety disorders, so that definitely plays a huge roll in how I feel about doctor's visits. I think that I work myself up thinking about the unknown, and fearing that something will be wrong, even when I'm just having a routing checkup and no reason to believe that something is actually wrong.
1	I have never been a health-minded individual and have been obese most of my life. I become defensive when I feel judged regarding my health. I am deeply worried about my health but much more afraid of finding out that something is seriously wrong.
1	It's a personal anxiety that is provoked when an extended period of time has passed between sessions, and I have to say that it doesn't help when they start asking directly related questions back to back.
1	Feeling anxious or worried about doctor's visits stems from the uncertainty of the entire experience. Not knowing if something is seriously wrong or even if your doctor will diagnose correctly.
-1	Although I'm seldom there because of sickness, there is always the possibility they'll discover something wrong.  That worry naturally increases with aging.
1	I don't feel too anxious or worried during a visit because I know my body is generally healthy. However, I always know there is a chance something is wrong, which is why I wrote neutral.
1	That I won't be listened to, or my illness will be dismissed with a bottle of pills and no alternative or other viewpoints.
-1	What makes me most anxious is not knowing a diagnosis. I am a planner, so when the outcome is not predictable, it makes me stressed out and worried. I am anxious until I find out what is wrong and how it can be fixed.
-1	I am just a worrier in general its my personality. At the doctor's office all that worries me is getting sick from touching something as I feel there are a lot of germs in these places.
-1	The fear of hearing some kind of bad news. Even if it's just a routine check-up, I'm always fearing the worst in terms of hearing bad news. The entire atmosphere at a doctor's office gives me that vibe. 
1	As a female I'm used to the fact that a lot of doctors will tell women that whatever is wrong with them is because of hormones or stress, and so I worry that they're going to miss something important. Particularly since doctors are far more interested in a woman's privates than her heart (annual heart scans aren't in vogue, but they'll nag for a pap) when heart attacks are one of the top killers of women. The problem is, you never know if you got a good doctor or not until you've seen him/her, so I'm always anxious thinking I might be going through the embarrassment and cost of seeing this person that I might never want to go back to for my care. Then you have to start all over again with a different doctor, with the same worries. 
-1	I really don't have those feelings.  I guess when a new issue comes up  there might be a thought that it could be something bad and incurable but I don't dwell on things like that.
1	I feel worried because I think about the possibility that I have an untreatable disease or a long term disease that will affect my life
-1	The one thing that causes me to be anxious or worried is that I sometimes put off going to the doctor over aches and pains and I am afraid he will find something majorly wrong with me. 
-1	I am not anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I like that I have a woman doctor because I feel I can talk to her about anything, included issues only women have. I feel comfortable if I need to be physically examined because she and I are women. I feel she better understands women's issues because she probably had/ has them two.
-1	If im super sick or think something may be wrong then seeing the doctor and getting that either confirmed or not is stressful
1	firstly i don't like being poked and looked over. secondly the fear of having a serious disease is always in the back of my mind when visiting the doctor. lastly it's also just the fear of not having control of the situation. 
1	Usually when I'm anxious for a Dr. visit it's when I'm feeling real bad and expecting the worst. In those cases it's always been less severe than I imagined which is a good thing.
1	That they won't believe me. Or the that the next step in my treatment will be scheduled too far out and I have to wait a month to have a test done.
-1	Sometime the wait alone can be worrisome.  And if i am coming to grt some test results sometimes i feel a little uneasy hoping for the best outcome
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried at my doctor office. I feel like my doctors office has everything under control and makes everything as calming and relaxing as possible.
-1	The doctors office has always been a place that is scary to me. It is just the thought of the unknown, because we have all heard stories about the people who just go in for a normal check up and find something terribly wrong or something of that nature, and plus I had to get a series of painful shots when I was younger, so my perception of the doctor's office and hospitals has never been very good, although it has gotten better. It is more the place itself, and the unknown factor that worries me than anything that my doctor or any other physician does.
1	I am worried about something being wrong that would lead to expensive testing and treatments. I also worry about catching the flu from being around sick people in the waiting room.
-1	I am worried that the diagnosis will be worse than I initially thought. Although unlikely and Im not a hypochondriac, still, a small part of me feels very anxious about a bad diagnosis. 
-1	"I feel worried when they see something of concern on my blood work and want to redo it.  Blood work is very telling so it makes me extremely nervous if something looks ""off"" to my doctor."
1	I'm usually worried that I'll find out something negative about my health, due to the poor choices I've made in terms of diet and exercise. 
1	I would feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I am injured and worry an exam may cause more pain or if I feel there is something really unusual about my symptoms and something could be seriously wrong. Regular visits do not cause me concern.
-1	I don't have any anxiety when I go to the doctors office.  I usually only make appointments when necessary so I don't feel that anyone's time is wasted.  the only thing that really bugs me is when I have to wait a long time without any feedback from the front office staff.  I know that emergencies come up which throws the schedules off, but I believe that keeping patients informed is important.  If you don't let them know about a schedule change you are basically saying that their time isn't as valuable as someone else's.  so I guess this is my anxiety issue when going to the doctor. 
1	I'm always treated like an unnecessary burden that they have to rush through dealing with.  I never feel like I can ask what I need to ask.
1	If I am getting a pap smear, I have been hurt in the past because of carelessness. So, I almost always tense up when I am getting that done due to past trauma.
1	I get worried that I will receive bad news in regards to a a problem that I have going on and I hope it turns out for the best
-1	What usually makes me nervous about going to the doctor's office is when there's something that i feel is wrong with me that's beyond a regular checkup. It doesn't really have anything to do with the doctor since it's mostly the situation that got me in to the office to begin with. But when there is something worse than usual, then everything from the wait in the waiting room and the patient room to just talking to the doctor/nurse is nervewracking
-1	I don't. This doesn't apply to me. I don't go in feeling nervous or anxious when going to the my doctors.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the long wait in the lobby and after waiting for so long, the doctor only gives you a small amount of time. That doesn't provide you enough time to ensure all questions and answers are given. 
1	It is the uncertainty that makes me feel very anxious. I don't know what the outcome is going to be and the possible associated costs to treatment also are a cause of concern. I feel that I may be criticized or judged for certain personal choices.
1	I am always a bit uneasy going to the doctor.  I worry that he is going to find something wrong with me.  I'd almost rather not know.
-1	I am getting older, and I fear that a condition is in the works that I do not know about.  I fear that something is happening right now that I won't be able to bounce back from.  
-1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I have symptoms, or am suffering from an illness and have no idea what it is.  If my symptoms are extreme, sometimes I'm anxious or worried.
-1	I'm actually never really worried as although I don't get sick or have to go to the doctor's office often, I am confident that they will figure out the issue and get me back on track health wise, in a good amount of time. 
1	What makes me the most worried is if it's something serious or not. I personally don't have health insurance so anything serious would also probably cost me a lot of money out of pocket. This is particularly worrisome as my personal income isn't that high either.
1	I think I am just allergic to doctor's offices!  I am one of those people whose  blood pressure goes up when tested in the doc's office.  I look at the trays of sharp instruments lying in wait on the counters and I am uneasy!  I have a vivid imagination.  I am anxious about any invasive tests, about possible pain, about possible bad news, esp. as I get older and older.  I have learned to trust my doctor, and as I have reached the age just this year when my yearly physical exam does not have to include a gyn exam, I am much more relaxed.  
1	I guess the number one thing is fear that a routine exam or test will uncover something really wrong with me.  Now, to be fair, I am a paranoid hypochondriac.  So any time I get the slightest little pain or perhaps a lump or something, I am convinced it's terminal cancer and I'm going to die in 3 weeks.  Needless to say, that has so far not happened.  So I think it's very important that I have the ability to access proper medical care (in the past I haven't always had the access)  to go and get checked out on a regular basis, more for my own mental peace of mind than because there is something actually really wrong with me.  Other than that, sometimes I do worry that a doctor or nurse will be judgmental and make comments to me about certain unhealthy characteristics like my weight or smoking, but that's not nearly as big a concern.
1	I'm worried that my doctor won't take time to hear my concerns. Also, I am anxious about possible test results.
-1	Occasionally, I feel anxious at the doctor's office. I feel like I am in a vulnerable position and I do not know if something will be wrong with me that I did not know about before.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I am attending these types of appointments because I am a laid back and relaxed person. I taking everything one step at a time and see no reason to stress over anything.
-1	I just feel anxious because I'm afraid something might be wrong with me. I am afraid I will be told something I don't want to hear. But I do trust my doctor.
-1	Since I do not feel these emotions when visiting my primary care physician, I will describe those feelings of going to my previous dentist.  I used to have these feelings when visiting my dentist because I wasn't taking good care of my teeth. I think I don't have these feelings now is because I have taken an active role in my total healthcare.
-1	I don't get anxious to actually see my doctor, the only thing that may make me a little anxious is when I go to the doctor for a specific pain or something and then I worry that something may be wrong with me and I don't want to get bad news 
-1	I feel anxious if I am having a health issue and worried it could turn out to be something serious.  I make sure I get a thorough explanation when my health issues are being explained to me.
-1	I feel most worried is when the doctor finds an issue and he does not know how to treat it in the first steps. It is unknown and could be life threatening.
-1	I am most anxious or worried about visiting the doctor because one can never know what will be found out about my health. But this stems from the fact that I have largely avoided doctors for most of my life. If I regularly visited a doctor, then perhaps I would be less worried.
-1	The possibility of having some kind of surgery. I have always had a fear of having surgery and the operating table in general since I was little. 
1	I feel anxious sometimes because if I need to go the doctor, something is wrong with me.  There concern over the unknown will always lead to a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor.
1	I feel most anxious if a doctor is not open to my full explanation of what my body is doing. Most doctors are too close minded regarding nutritional therapy and so I tend to be skeptical of a doctors quick diagnosis. I know my body the best so I trust my insight more than them.
-1	I worry that I'll get admonished for not taking care of myself (my weight has been creeping up lately) or that my blood pressure will suddenly be high or something else unexpected.
-1	I feel anxious sometimes about telling them what's wrong with me, and wondering if what they can do to help me. 
1	I am worried that he will not believe me when I tell him my symptoms and that I will feel like a foolish old women.
1	I am mostly afraid of them telling me something new is wrong that I did not know before and that I will have to start taking some new kind of medications.I can hardly afford what  I am on now even with all of my healthcare. I can only imagine what it would be like if they had to put me on more.
-1	I rarely feel terribly anxious unless I am experiencing a very painful or unusual condition. If that is the case, I am most anxious about receiving a bad diagnosis.
-1	Having to sit on the exam table.  I'm a big guy and it is tough to get on that thing and sit.  I would rather sit in the chair.
-1	The main thing I don't like going through is a breast exam and/or a pelvic exam. I would imagine both of those are slightly uncomfortable for almost all women. I know they have to be done though, so I manage to get through them whenever they are needed.
-1	I'm anxious that there might be something really wrong with me like having life-threatening illness. I don't want to have something that will make me change my way of life. 
1	Authority figures in general make me feel uneasy, but i hate going to the doctor. i am not sure why, I also hate getting naked in front of anyone who is not my fiance. That is a huge trigger for my anxiety. I don't like being poked and proded or touched.
-1	I just don't enjoy people poking and prodding me. Even worse is that you're paying to be poked and prodded. They usually don't seem very confident in what they are doing or why they are doing it, It feels very impersonal almost like you're a car at a mechanics shop and not a living breathing human with thoughts and emotions.
1	I don't like to give details about private issues. The healthcare system seems to be set up as a referral business. The first visit is just to get a patient to go somewhere else.
-1	I'm anxious that my doctor might say something is off with my blood levels and or the nutrients I am recieving.
-1	It really depends on what I am going for.  Most recently I had to go because I was having knee pain related to an old injury.  When you go to a new dr and say you need strong pain killers some times they think you are just trying to get drugs
1	I am most anxious that there will be bad news, or difficult news.  I am also anxious the dr. wonât understand what I am trying to explain.
-1	I want to be able to find out what the issue is right away when I go to the dr office. I also would like to avoid a run-around with treatments that would be completely pointless and offer no remedy to whatever reason I had to visit the dr office. I also do NOT like dealing with needles, having my blood taken causes me some anxiety whenever it happens. 
-1	It depends on my reasoning for visiting the doctors office. If its a matter of me being really sick or something that could of been wrong at a pregnancy checkup I was very worried. I had went in a couple times only to find out I had lost the baby my future pregnancy checkups were always a huge scare and worry but as far as routine checkup it wasn't ever a problem.
-1	What makes me feel the most anxious about going to a Doctors office is having to wait for lab results. The wait always gives me anxiety because I want to know that I am ok.
1	The one thing that makes me feel the most anxious has been a couple times when doctors pushed medications instead of making sure I actually needed it.  If there are major symptoms and they don't take the time to find the source and instead just automatically try and mask a problem I feel very angry and defeated.  I've wasted time and then you have to go somewhere else.
-1	I think what makes me feel the most anxious is what they might find. I worry a lot about my health and always fear the unknown. 
-1	Usually a doctor's office is cold and this environment causes me to fell tense. Also I often forget to tell the doctor important symptoms and I become anxious when trying to remember them.
1	Noodle's I don't like the pain being told something is wrong in my body really make me worried are just having to visit my doctor 
1	When my doctor writes something down and doesn't mention anything about it to me. My doctor knows more about me than I do and I know nothing.
-1	I don't really mind going to the doctor it doesn't affect me usually. Unless I'm worried about something, but just going in for a checkup I'm usually fine
-1	I usually get good reports for the most part. Unknown is always worrisome. Something can happen that is unexpected and you can take things for granted. Health is always one of those things. My doctor does a good job of not keeping me in the dark about anything but you always worry about the what if. Mortality is a scary concept. Worry about what happens to my family is something goes wrong. Worry about how to pay large medical bills even though I have good insurance. No matter how prepared you think you are I don't think anything can prepare you for a very bad medical report.
1	The great unknown. If I'm in the doctor's office it's because I really need to be there, and I'm usually heading out of the country or returning and something has gone wrong.
1	Knowing that a doctor could give me information at any time that could change my life forever makes me a little nervous.  Or when connected to an EKG machine and they tell you not to worry--how can you not be a little nervous.  Or, waiting for a test result that seems to take forever.
1	I'm anxious because you never know what the doctor is going to tell you. For example they could tell you that you will have cancer in the next moment and you wouldn't be prepared for that whatsoever. It is scary.
1	Whether I wasted my time and money or if this will be one of the few times Iâm actually provided a medical solution to whatever Iâm there for. 
-1	Not being able to know the outcome it what makes me the most anxious worried.  The actual act of being at a doctor's office and talking with a doctor doesn't make anxious or worried, usually.
-1	"Since I have diabetes, I am aware of its symptoms and comorbid conditions/disorders. The main thing I worry about when visiting the doctor's office is being ""found out"" if I didn't follow doctor's orders from the last visit or I slipped a little. I want to present as the perfect patient, though I know there's not one. I don't like being told I'm doing something wrong since I do try so hard to maintain any and all progress. "
1	I'm always scared because I have lots of health problems in my family history. I am always scared that something is going to come back bad or a simple ache is going to be so much more than just a simple ache. I am always worried about what they will recommend or what they have to say.
1	It was just one situation while i was prgenant and i just didn't want to go because i knew i would get myself upset at what they had to tell me.
1	I am worried about something being wrong with me that i am not aware of. I am worried about unexpected medical expenses. 
1	Whether or not that i would bleed once I was in the office. The doctor always needs to draw a significant amount of blood, usually until I get dizzy. 
1	Feeling is the nominalization of the verb to feel.[1] The word was first used in the English language to describe the physical sensation of touch through either experience or perception. The word is also used to describe experiences other than the physical sensation of touch
-1	The first thing that makes me anxious is getting on the scale. I dread that more than anything, and also I get very worried about cost because I am self pay.
1	You never truly know what a doctor could tell you. Your body and mind can feel 100% sometimes and the inside of you could be completely destroyed. 
1	The outcome of a diagnosis would be what I fear most. I do not participate in many actual exams, I don not like people touching me. Not even for a shot or checking heart rates. I just get extremely anxious about seeing any DR for fear of bad news.
-1	I am mostly anxious or worried because I have little faith in their ability to diagnose my problem. Or show concern by getting to the underlying cause of my problem. Medical costs keep going up and up and yet is seems as if medical care has been drastically declining.
-1	I'm worried about the cost of a prescription or care. Healthcare here in America is very expensive. Right now I'm luckily on my parents' insurance, because I simply cannot afford my own as an individual. Once that time is up, and if I get sick or injured, I'm screwed. One of the biggest causes of bankruptcy in this country is due to healthcare bills.
1	Just afraid that they will find something that is not good. I haven't really taken care of my body from like 12 to 22 using heroin and doing whatever drugs I could get my hands on. Just the past three years I got my life otgether and my health is phenomonal. But I am worried I will have something go wrong with my brain because I have had two traumatic brain injuries. I don't want the doctor to tell me I have brain cancer
-1	The part that makes me most anxious is the time that I have to wait. :-)  Other than that, I feel like I am being very well taken care of and preventative care is important for all - I try to maintain my health.
1	I am never sure if my condition will get worse.  I don't want to have a negative report but understand it is a possibility.    I have to live in reality when it comes to the information. 
-1	I had a major illness when I was younger, and it took the doctors a long time to find out what was wrong.  I had to have blood drawn on a daily basis for over a month.  To this day I still hate having blood drawn.  I always look away, and just hate when I have people who aren't that competent drawing blood.  I also worry about what hereditary conditions I may have.
1	I am always afraid they will find something wrong with me.  I absolutely fear having something serious and needing surgery or some horrible disease like cancer.  It's terrifying for me to visit even if it's just for a cold.  
-1	It's probably a dumb reason, but her hands are very cold. She's a tiny woman and being in a doctor's office all day doesn't help her warm up. She apologizes, but that makes me a little anxious. If I had recently been ill, I also feel a little anxious about my lab results. I don't get many colds or the flu, but when I do I feel very sick. That makes me think there might be some other problem, but so far it's not been very serious. 
1	I guess the uncertainty of your health is what makes me the most anxious. It really worries me that I don't truly know if I'm fully health even If I feel healthy.
1	I'm getting older. I always feel my body deteriorating and I'm just always scared something new is going to pop up. I'm not a hypochondriac, yet I do worry about my health because it really isn't very good. 
1	I wonder if they will find some kind of health condition I was not aware I had. I also wonder if they will judge or criticize me for things like not getting enough exercise or always eat nutritiously.  
1	I am most worried about examinations which may be physically painful or uncomfortable, as this has necessarily been a common occurrence for me lately. I am also a reserved person, and therefore may feel physically or even emotionally vulnerable in these moments. This is particularly true if my condition is a source of embarrassment to me, such as a urinary tract infection. I may also be anxious about forgetting to ask a clarifying question in the moment, or otherwise missing the opportunity to inform myself or give the doctor helpful information which can lead to more effective treatment.
1	I feel anxious and also worried about what results will come from the doctors evaluation.  Although I know deep in my mind nothing severe should be wrong I also know there is a chance that something may come back that would make my health even worse than it currently is.  
-1	The only thing that worries me is that I might have something seriously wrong with me. Since I had a life-threatening illness about 10 years ago --involving my heart- this isn't an unreasonable fear.
1	Nothing makes me feel anxious more than just having to wait in the waiting room. It seem unnecessary to have an appointment at a certain time then be force to wait another 30 minutes or so. Can be very frustrating when they do this at the office. I get anxious because I could have been doing better things with my time then spending it at a waiting room. This waiting time feeds into my anxiety, but most of the time I feel like I am in the clear, and have no issues I should be worried about since I get tested every three months.
1	Probably just fear of the unknown.  While I'm healthy in general, you never know what might happen or what tests may show to the doctor that you are not even aware about.
-1	Obviously there is always that sense of the unknown. That is to say that any normal routine issue can snowball into something much worse. It's impossible to tell with utmost certainty what is happening within our bodies at any given moment but I suppose that's all the more reason we need to take care of ourselves as best as we can.
-1	you never know if they might find cancer. You could go to the doctor for something you think is probably minor, but it is actually something really bad
-1	I'm worried that they might find something wrong with me. It also makes me anxious being poked and prodded. It is a little uncomfortable. It's quite personal and not at all private.
1	It is always the test results. They give me so much anxiety, it makes me nervous and I even start shaking sometimes.
1	"What makes me most anxious and worried is not knowing the doctor personally enough so that you know whether or not they have your best interest in mind on that particular day.  I think like anyone off that doctors can have ""off"" days."
1	Sometimes I feel like I'm not where I should be weight wise. I am a shy and modest person for the most part and having a physical exam makes me nervous.  I also am worried he will find something that I had no idea was an issue with my health.
-1	I generally do not get too worried or anxious about anything.  What is, is.  If a problem reveals itself, I will tackle it head on.  Worrying gets you nowhere.
1	I feel the most anxious and or worried if the Doctor may give me different results that I was hoping for, for some unexpected reason, that's why I am always trying to imagine the worst case scenario.
1	"I tend to be an anxious person in general and have a family history of high blood pressure, anxiety, etc. This often manifests in ""white coat syndrome"" when my physician or a nurse takes my blood pressure. It is usually off the charts the very first test, and sometimes it stays that way throughout the examination. This issue is further compounded as my employer/insurer has a ""wellness program"" that ties the outcomes of routine examinations with insurance premiums for the year, so there is extra incentive to maintain healthy numbers (with blood pressure being one of those numbers). For that reason, I record weekly blood pressure measurements to bring with me to examinations; unfortunately, my normalized recordings are not the ones that make it ""into the record"" for the wellness visit numbers..."
-1	Any medical appointment makes me a little anxious simply because I will have to bare myself and be uncomfortable. The only time I get worried is if I suspect that there may really be something wrong that may not turn out well.
1	The unknown makes me nervous.  Not my doctor.  I know that he will figure something out, but its the process of getting to that solution and the waiting to get in, or wanting to know that he can fix whatever is wrong.
-1	The results of a test i might have to take would make me feel very anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office.
-1	About the only thing that makes me anxious or worried is when they take my blood pressure. It always tests high for some reason and is disturbing to both the doctor and I. I do get a little anxious being around all of the germs hanging around the waiting room.
-1	I sometimes get nervous that I will get sick while I am there. If I am going to puke I would prefer to do it in the comfort of my own home.
1	I get nervous that the doctor will scrutinize my health. I do not want to here things that I know, like drinking less pop or eating less carbs etc. I also get worried they may find some serious health complication that will upend my life.
1	I worry that there might be something wrong with me and that I would need to get more tests done or even surgery and I worry what me family will do if I am not able to help as much as I have a son to support. 
-1	I most worry about how I am going to pay for the doctor bill AND the prescription they are likely to prescribe. It seems that everything requires a new medicine.
-1	I always get somewhat anxious when visiting the doctors because of all the germs and sick people there presently or before me. I always sit furtherest away from people as possible and hand sanitize to restrict the spread of illness as much as possible. As far as the actual visit, it's not that bad it's just the germs and illness I am weary of. 
-1	I would only be anxious or worried if there was a new problem that required tests and a wait for results to find out if there was something to be concerned about.
-1	I am afraid that I might be diagnosed with cancer since I smoke.  My mother had lung cancer.  She died two years ago.
-1	That I may have some dread disease that cannot be cured or will take a log of treatments to cure.  That the chronic condition that I have has gotten worse or something is prescribed that I cannot accomplish
-1	It feels kind of impersonal and condescending to be sitting there feeling as though you are being talked down to most of the time, or like you have 15 minutes of this doctor's time and then he's moving on. Being on display makes me feel anxious.
-1	I feel a little worried about the possibility of the doctor finding a chronic disease that is not curable or treatable.  I also feel anxious that I may not be in as good health as the last physical exam.
1	Vaccines and tests that are not needed being given. Getting sick from the people around me in the office. 
1	I just tend to worry that there may be something wrong with me. My family has had a history of heart and cancer issues, and I always fear that one of those, or something else entirely will affect me at some point.
-1	I usually just worry that things are going to be worse than they actually are. Usually, it turns out to be the opposite, but still. The not know or that feeling that something might actually be really bad is what worries me the most. Sometimes things get in my head that I can't seem to shake off.
1	If I have something wrong with me that has been bothering me for a while I am concerned about what the cause may be. I worry that the doctor may find something considerably wrong. I worry that the doctor may run a test that will have a very bad result.
-1	It is the waiting time when you get to the office. Getting right in would make me feel less anxious there since I am getting in and learning of any issues as soon as I get there. 
1	It mostly isn't  a conscious thing, I just get this feeling of dread from being in hospitals even if I am not the one being treated, I don't really know why. but weighing myself causes anxiety because i am really fat and I know that the doctor is going to bring it up (which is their job so I am not saying it is wrong). I also have anxiety about my health so I am always nervous that they are going to find something wrong with me. Also if I am being honest there is an inferiority complex going on, doctors are successful and even though I know it's just in my head there is a feeling like the doctor is looking at me like I am a looser.
1	When visiting the doctor, I am always aware of the possibility that something I considered a minor issue may seem more serious to my doctor and lead to a diagnosis of an urgent health issue. 
-1	The concern on something being actually wrong with me. Being sick is the concern that makes me not want to go to the doctor and self access myself via web md.
1	I get anxious sometimes believing the doctor is going to tell me something negative about my health. I also stress out about having some medical procedure that will cost me out of pocket money, for some outrageous medical bill I will receive. 
1	i dont like crowds the last time i went the lady told me to come in the eveing hardly any people .i got there it was so crowded no were to sit anxienty was kicking in bad.went to the window she gave me a clip board to fill out paper work was so nerves i told here i couldnt be in here with all thse people she told the nurse she got me.i had to walk pass everyone it was aweul sat in a room for 2hrs to bee seen.
1	just been to so many doctors feel more worn out and tired of all the appointments. there have been times i've been worried but i don't have the energy anymore for much worry. 
1	That I will not get the proper care I require. I have had multiple instances where I paid for an Urgent Care visit, waited for hours to be seen, and was sent home with nothing but instructions to rest and take an OTC pill, only to end up admitted to the hospital the following day. Such instances include: heat stroke, kidney stones, broken ankle, severely infected sebacious cyst, etc. None of these instances were taken seriously by doctors in the urgent care center.
1	If i really don't know whats going on and I end up in the doctors office I'm just hoping it avoids a surgery or something. If I think they cant provide me with what I need and I have to get forwarded to another doctor I may get a little anxious or worried about my next visit. Going to the doctor isn't very fun.
-1	The most nerve-wracking part of visiting the doctor's office is the potential that something serious is wrong; but, otherwise, I do not experience a strong anxiety about actually seeing the doctor. 
-1	Really the worst part about it to me, is taking the time out of my day to go and wait for a pointless exam that I have no reason to be examined in the first place. It's just a huge interruption every time it comes up, because its usually completely unnecessary.
-1	I would feel anxious if i had blood work or sometime of test . Say a disease test , They werent able to provide me with results over the phone, Made me go to the office 
1	I worry about problems I have no control over. I have had problems with my blood pressure in the past and I worry that my blood pressure will be high again. I worry that some other problem that I am unaware of will be noticed. 
-1	I just don't want anything to be wrong with me.  I have a husband and two little boys and worry somewhat that something major will be wrong that we won't be able to fix.
-1	when i go the doctors office the past i was over weight diabetic for about ayear and i would get an earful everytime. this last appoint was months later and my conditions had changed dramatically. i had unknowinly dropped 20 pounds in 9 weeks with a1c 10 dropping 10 points as  well. the doctor stopped his lecturing 
1	I feel really anxious when I visit my doctor because I just want to get done with my doctor appointment as fast a possible. 
1	Most likely it's basically because I have never liked being physically touched and also because I have a fear that they will find something seriously wrong. I also don't want someone telling me that I have to change my way of doing things and I absolutely don't like being lectured to.
1	I guess it is just a normal anxious thing for most everyone. The waiting is probably the biggest thing that makes me anxious. 
1	There is just something about a doctor's office that is a little unnerving that I can't quite put my finger on. Everything seems a little too perfect, and I almost feel like if there's something wrong that I'm disappointing the physician or making their life harder.
-1	Nothing really. I am usually at ease. I guess if I had to choose one thing it would be waiting in that small room all by myself.
-1	I am sometimes worried that she will judge my life choices or tell me that I am seriously sick. I once had a doctor fat shame me. 
1	There is always fear that the Doctor might bring news of terminal illness that might be afflicted with. So that fear of bad news is what make me anxious and worried.
-1	Not knowing how unpleasant the treatment/examination might be. Also I might receive bad news. That bad news might raise the possibility of pain, suffering and unpleasant treatments.
1	I worry about what the diagnosis might be, and I worry about my health issues. I also tend to be anxious about how the doctor might treat me as a person, or how they will explain things in a way i might understand and be honest with me. 
-1	Not too much makes me concerned when I am at the doctors office. i dont go very often but when I do it's usually not for a major issue, its just because its time to check up on my health so usually I am not worried. If there is something going on that brings me in that might make me a little anxious, especially if I have to get tests done because I dont get the results right away.
-1	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is not knowing whether something serious is happening or not. I fear the worst but am unable to see whether it is true or not.
1	I'm always wondering what is the doctor gonna find. I lost a parent to cancer at a young age so I always think I'm going to get a cancer diagnosis.
1	I am over weight and I am always fearful that the Dr. writes he off because its my weight.. instead of looking further into y problem.
1	I have a mechanical aortic valve, a dacron aortic aneurysm replacement, and a pacemaker.  The valve and graft are twelve years old, and my second pacemaker is 7 years old.  I worry the most that my valve will need to be replaced again, and that my pacemaker needs replacement again.  These things have a limited life, and I know that at some point problems that arise will need to be addressed.
-1	I get most anxious when waiting for a blood tests or physical exams.  I don't worry about the doctor, I worry about what could be wrong with me.
-1	The length of time I have to wait for my scheduled appointment time. Billing seems to be an issue a lot. I get frustrated with the lack of respect of my time.
-1	I don't know if it will be good news or bad news when something is wrong with me. What if it is something serious but it makes me worried if he just ignores it or does not take it seriously. I just normally get anxious because sometimes you just don't know what it is your'e going to expect.
-1	I think the doctor might not understand my condition. I also think that they may rush to quickly to conclusions or not fully recognize what is going on.
1	Sometimes I have fear before entering the doctor's office in terms of finding a health complication that I didn't know I had before.  Usually, these examinations end well for me. 
1	That a test will turn up something (I've had 2 different types of cancer). I have had more than my share of being told I need surgery and being quite frightened by the diagnosis so those feelings from those times tend to crop up.
-1	The only thing that makes me anxious about seeing a doctor is that they will recognize a problem that I did not know existed. But that is why you see a competent physician.
1	What makes me most anxious whenever I visit any doctor's office is uncertainty. When going to see a doctor, one never knows what may potentially arise in terms of a negative diagnosis. Thus, I am always a little bit on edge every time.
-1	I don't believe they have the truth. They have strayed from true health care. Prevention is key. Not pills to treat symptoms. 
-1	In general, my health has been good, so I usually don't fear healthcare visits.  This may change as I get older.
1	I always feel like I am going to be told that my cholesterol is too high and that I need to start taking medication for it. I know this is just my doctor doing his job, but I don't like having medications pushed on me. I rather eat healthier and get more exercise.
1	The anxiety from visiting a doctor's office comes from the worry that the doctor will tell me I have a serious medical problem rather than something trivia and temporary. There is also the dread about entering a hospital even to see the doctor.
-1	What makes me feel anxious or worried during a doctor's visit is usually just my condition, hoping that it isn't something super serious or expensive to fix. Needles also make me uncomfortable, but they are a necessary evil at times.  
-1	I am most anxious that I will forget to mention something- or what most people probably feel- that they will receive some bad news. In general I keep healthy habits and have not received any bad news. I am 39 so generally I do not expect to hear bad news about my health as I have not so far.
1	I am just worried they will comment on something that will make me uncomfortable. I once had a Dr yell at me about my pulse rate but this was after the receptionist told me my insurance was canceled. I panicked but it was a clerical error on her part and was quickly fixed. My heart was racing and I hadnât fully calmed down yet. 
-1	I suppose the most anxious thing I have worried about is whether or not the doctor was in a rush. Sometimes they try and push you out and don't like being asked many questions.  
-1	I had a past medical history where a mysterious illness wrecked me and spent a month in the ICU, 2 weeks in a coma. So when I feel like something is wrong again, its hard to not have a bit of anxiety or worries. However when I'm at the doctor's office, I guess its mostly just being judged about poor life decisions. 
1	I feel theyâre give me the same answers all the time and donât really listen or my issues. The doctor doesnât give me their best opinion and advise. They say itsuptometodecide. Iâd like to know what they think. Thatâs why I paid to go see them. 
1	The only thing that really gives me any problems is thinking about the unknown and the possiblity that there could be something wrong with me that i don't know about.  This presents a small level of anxiety and fear that there could be something that is not good. 
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried. On the contrary, I want to find an answer to why I feel so bad, or something that will help me. Unfortunately, my concerns go largely ignored.
1	Just the act of going to see the doctor.  There's sick people everywhere, the office is usually cold, especially in the examination room..  You often have to wait alone in the exam room for a few minutes which increases anxiety..  Shots aren't too bad, but it's still a needle so those suck..
1	I'm always worried that I have some serious medical condition.  I'm a hypochondriac, and I think what worries me most is being diagnosed with some horrible condition that I've never heard of.  Also, I have a bit of a fear of needles.  I'd hate to be surprised by having to take a blood test.
1	That the condition I'm experiencing may require surgery or some other drastic, or painful measure. Since there's a family history and particular diseases that people with my ethnicity, and men over a certain age experience  (prostate cancer)  I fear that I may have it too. I guess to put it simple, it's the uncertainty and the fact that with certain conditions there's really nothing a patient can do to change the situation. On regular checkups, experiencing a cold or something like that  I'm not as worried since I have had many in my lifetime. I do, however, hate needles so I get antsy when I know I have to get  a shot.
1	I feel anxious and worried when I am at the doctors office because I always worry of getting some disease that cant be cured or cancer I am sick all the time with ibs and I recently had hyplori I have alot of stomach issues and bowel issues so I always think of the worst outcome possible I am very anxious
1	A lot of doctors don't get to the root cause of your medical issue.  They hear a few of your symptoms then give you a textbook diagnosis and send you away with a prescription for the symptoms instead of trying to solve the cause of the problem without filling you up with medication.  I want to be properly evaluated, not just medicated.
1	I am worried about what will be found when they examine me, if it's something serious or not. I'm worried about the cost, and I'm worried about being judged for my weight. I'm usually very anxious about all of these things. 
-1	I really dont have any anxiousness at any of my doctors office visits usually. The only time there is anxiousness is if my doctor orders bloodwork to be done. While the procedure itself is easy, the before hand is what gets me anxious. 
-1	I do not like to visit the doctor because even when there is nothing wrong they try to medicate you to death.  It seems like they are just looking for a reason to give you all kinds of medicine that is not really needed.
-1	I get anxious because i'm always afraid that they are going to tell me that something  is wrong and need to change something. 
-1	I guess just worrying that something will turn up. That the doctor will find something that is very bad. I would say that is mostly what I worry about.
1	The thing that i might not feel comfortable with the different tests that they do. Especially i don't like poking my hands for blood tests and i don't like the fact of them asking too many questions which might not be necessary.
-1	I normally don't feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office. One way I would feel worried is if I was experiencing great pain and had to go to the doctors office in order to stop that pain. I generally remain calm and don't expect to find anything too wrong with myself.
1	When I visit the doctor, I'm most worried about them finding something wrong with my overall health, or even something specific that could really harm me.  I worry I'll need some type of invasive procedure.
1	If I'm having symptoms or there's been a change in my condition since my last visit, I worry that something's wrong with me. I worry that it could be serious and that it could be expensive. I don't have a lot of money for healthcare.
1	I always know there will be a conversation about my weight.  What makes me most anxious though is my blood pressure.  It always reacts when I'm in the doctor's office.  I've tried breathing exercises, visualization, hydrating well and distraction.  They work to a certain extent in calming me down but aren't 100% successful.  It's so annoying!  (My blood pressure is fine everywhere else but the office).  They know me well enough that they take an initial pressure and come back 10 minutes later after I've relaxed.  Totally a psychological response.
-1	Doctors cannot always explain what is wrong with you when you feel sick.  My brother had a serious medical condition that his doctors did not understand.  They ran a number of rests but never really understood why he was sick.
-1	I am most anxious about visiting a doctor's office when I have a problem related to my heart. I am worried it might be something serious.
1	I get worried because I always think the worst and that the news will be bad because a lot of times it has been. Iâm 35 but I have already been diagnosed with both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis and have had an ischemic stroke. After getting these diagnoses when I least expected them, I just feel like any diagnosis is possible for me.
-1	I worry they might find something wrong with me that is incurable. Something like cancer. Also waiting around for long periods of time will sometimes make me anxious.
-1	The only things I've every worried about when visiting a doctor are if it's a new doctor and whether or not I'm going to like them, if I see a lot of people in the waiting room and feel like it's going to be a very long appointment that is going to take up a lot of time and ruin my day, or if I feel like they are going to tell me I have some type of more serious health issue going on. I have had some doctors make me feel anxious in the past, but my main doctor has never caused me to feel that way. 
1	I do not like the doctors office because its always full of sick people. I do not want to make my health worse by compromising it. I also believe that doctors try to push pills on to people and get incentives for it.
1	I'm afraid that they will give me bad news. I'm afraid of getting sick in the future so I feel nervous.  
-1	I get slightly anxious when talking about my pre-existing condition (sleep apnea). Another thing that might make me a little bit anxious is getting a physical (for obvious reasons).  Getting weighed also makes me slightly nervous.
-1	I am worried that they will find something wrong with me. I don't want to be told I have high blood pressure, or something wrong with my blood work. So it makes me nervous to go. 
1	If I'm seeing a doctor for a specific problem (rash or cold or pain), I think it's normal to worry about what they might find. As a general rule, going to the doctor for check-ups doesn't bother me, though I do worry they'll find something wrong sometimes.
1	The alone time in the doctor's office is what makes me the most nervous. Usually when you show up you wait in that room for 30+ minutes alone. It is very cold in there, and usually the rooms are a plain white color. I become especially worried after a blood test/physical/etc when the doctor says they will return shortly and I am left alone again.
-1	I usually worry that they will not be able to hear the baby's heart beat.  After that I worry that they will come too soon or that I didn't take care of them well enough in utero.  It's hard to know that all is okay until they are here.
-1	i'm not usually worried when i go to the doctor. i'm a fairly healthy person and i can usually get a prescription to take care of anything that's going on. 
-1	NOthing.  I really dont require a lot of personal space or require any privacy as far as my body is concerned so I really don't care what she needs to do.  I'm also super healthy so I'm never ther for anything too crazy
-1	I hate the blood pressure cuff. I always get really nervous when they put the cuff on me and I have to sit there while my blood pressure gets taken. Because I get so nervous, my reading is very high.
1	I always have a fear in the back of my mind that I may receive life changing news. I have had surgery a couple of times in the past and so I tend to think of the worst case scenario. My worry tends to play tricks on my mind and make any form of pain seem worse than it may be.
1	I am just uncomfortable being in a doctors office and having them exam you and touch you. When I think there is something wrong with me sometimes I am concerned they are going to think I am crazy, and there isn't anything wrong, or maybe there really will be something wrong. Just being in the doctors office gives you that feeling of what are they going to find.
-1	"I dislike having anything ""invasive"" like a papsmear, but that's probably me (and most people), and does not reflect on my doctor."
-1	I just worry that something will be wrong with me or go wrong in the process. Nothing has been wrong with me yet, but I did the most worrying when I was pregnant. I thought for sure something would go wrong with the baby, but everything ended up being okay. I'm just a worrier in general.
-1	i don't have these feelings at the DR's . I always feel comfortable there because we have a high level of mutual trust.
1	My main worry is that the doctor will not be there.  In the past 12 months I have been to my appointment each month only to have the doctor on vacation 2 of those times and one time no one was there and the door was locked.  I don't worry about what he may tell me I only worry that I wont be able to get my Rx's filled.
-1	I do not like to have my blood drawn so that is what makes me feel the most anxious and I worry about how test will come out. 
-1	Nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried when I'm visiting the doctor. I know I'm there to get checked out and I'll take the next step as it comes. 
1	The doctor looking at my body makes me self conscious and I'm worried that when they're talking to me I'll look dumb
1	I'm extremely private and modest. I don't like having to disrobe in front of him. It makes me feel completely awkward and uncomfortable - like I'm being judged.
1	Mostly, I am concerned that I will have a major health problem diagnosed or discovered. I am always thinking of the worst possible scenarios in the moments leading to my scheduled appointments, especially when it's not a regular checkup and I am going to the appointment because I am feeling ill or something similar. Those moments always make me anxious, and I usually feel relief when the appointment is over and nothing major is discovered.
1	Ever since my mother died of a rare neurological disease, I worry that something terrible is going to happen to me, especially in regard to my health.  It is a ridiculous fear, and one that I am trying to get over.  I worry about what could happen 
1	I've always had some issues with the doctor and I have no idea why. It's bad enough my blood pressure will actual read out higher when I am at the doctors office.
-1	I am not usually anxious or worried when visiting the doctor.  The only thing I could say may be a factor is just uncertainty about having a serious issue, but this is not typically how I think.
1	I dislike uncertainty, so I tend to feel a good deal of anxiety while waiting for test results and analysis. If I had 100% certainty that a particular ailment could be successfully treated with a particular approach or if pharmaceutical intervention would always work exactly as I wishes, my anxiety would likely abate. The not knowing makes it difficult for me and the waiting for results heightens the negative affect.
1	I just don't like the entire experience even though I know that most doctors are there to help and they really care but I don't like tests and being probed and don't like the possibility of them finding something bad.
-1	When I am being given shots. Since I was a child I have had a phobia of needles and do not enjoy when I need one. I understand they are important, but I still don't like them.  
-1	I have high blood pressure so I am always anxious about my numbers. I am a senior, so I do worry about things that a younger person would not think about. I hate tests and sometimes I have to go for them, even though I know it is in my best interest.
-1	I worry that something out of the ordinary will be discovered, and that I'll have some problem that I don't even know about.
1	I have anxiety regularly, but I also hate being the sole focus in any situation. Plus, I don't like exposing myself due to a childhood trauma. I am sure that my distrust of my PCP adds to his anxiety. 
1	I get anxious during the waiting time, I worry about the results of exams and tests I may have or need and discussions about things that may be wrong with me
1	What makes me feel anxious when I am visiting the doctor is wondering what my health problem is. There could be some kind of underlying issue that could be very serious and you don't know until you are actually checked out by the doctor.
-1	I have had unexplained pain a few times and I have been nervous wondering what it could be prior to going. I felt anxious to have tests done and get results in case it was bad news. I never felt scared to speak with my doctor though.
-1	"Well I'm usually pregnant and towards the end of the pregnancy they ""check"" you for dilation. I just hate that. And I hate pap smears too, which are similar in uncomfortable feeling."
1	"It's that stupid adage of ""What you don't know, won't hurt you"". I know it is bad to think such, but it is scary knowing that something is wrong. I often don't go to doctors until i need to out of fear that they will find something."
1	It usually is what the doctors decision is. I am always worried about something serious. At my age things can go bad. 
-1	Uncertainty is what would bother me the most. The uncertainty of if something is wrong and what to do if there is something wrong. 
1	I'm worried but also curious, if they will find something and worried they may make a wrong choice for me.
1	Knowing that I was unable to ascertain the cause or treatment necessary to overcome whatever the ailment happens to be. Knowing that my literal life is in another person's hands. It is an opportunity for life or death, the gravity of it gets to me.
1	For one thing having an appointment at a certain time and then having to wait and wait.  Then when you finally see the doctor he spends very little time with you.  I get anxious about the outcome of my visit and what he will find.  My blood tends to rise a bit in this instance.
-1	i feel most anxious about what could be wrong with me i also dont like no knowing and waiting for awhile im a generally anxious person so when it comes to public events i just am not in my overall comfort zone
-1	When I first go in, I am worried about possibly having something that wont easily be found and treated properly.
-1	I don't usually get worried.  there was a time when I had my self convinced that I had ovarian cancer.  I went to the doctor to talk to her about it.  That day I was worried, but it wasn't anything about my actual doctor that gave me anxiety. It was me self-diagnosing myself that had me all worked up. 
1	What makes me feel most anxious and worried is the fact I may not get the proper help I want. Sometimes doctors fail to understand what I am experiencing and I end up not getting much help.
1	Basically I go when I have problems . So not knowing the issues makes it worse. I feel threatened because of how uncertain everything is.  
-1	I think going to the doctor, in general, gives me a little anxious feeling.  Whether you are going because of a problem or a regular examination, the feeling of wonder about what he/she will say about your health is definitely present.
-1	I dislike going to the doctors in general- I have anxiety and hate needles. I pass out when getting blood drawn, they are unsympathetic...the list could go on... 
1	I just get worried that my glucose numbers are not good enough for my doctor. I'm also worried that they will find something new that's wrong with me.
1	You never know what your results are going to show so that can be nerve wracking. But also being examined fully by someone you donât know very well is just uncomfortable 
-1	I only really feel anxious if my daughter is very sick. I want to make sure that she gets the best treatment possible. I have a hard time when she is sick because I worry about her. Sometimes I am worried that she won't get the right treatment plan. Usually my anxiety is relieved when I actually talk to the doctor.
-1	I'm worried the doctor will see something that I didnt know was a problem.  Or that something that is bothering me is more serious that it initially seems.  
1	Fear of the unknown.  I am worried about what she might find when doing an evaluation.  I am worried that she might find something wrong.
1	I feel anxious and worried when i visit any doctor . The reason is because i am always afraid of my health. I am afraid that doctor would say something wrong about my health
-1	I think its just going to the doctor that makes me anxious  I dont like going to the doctor because I am afraid something will be wrong and illl have to do all these tests
1	Knowing that you don't have all the information, you need to basically take their word even if they aren't telling you the whole picture, and that you don't know what the outcome will be of certain medical procedures until after the fact.
1	I don't really know what it is, I don't think it is the doctor themselves, but rather just the entire experience. I go to a hospital when I am not feeling well, so in my head, everyone is wondering what is wrong with me or why I am there. Plus, I do not want to have a time where I go to the doctor and something is very wrong with me. 
-1	I don't know if I will be there for an hour, waiting. If I have tests I would be anxious about the results. 
1	I'm always afraid they won't take my concerns seriously, that they think I'm over-exaggerating my symptoms. I've had a doctor flat out tell me I was wrong even though I knew I was correct and it led to a fear that I just won't be listened to. 
-1	What makes me feel most anxious when I am at a doctor's office is when I have to take an eye exam, because I feel they never give me sufficient time to focus on what lens is better when I'm getting tested.
-1	That they don't take me seriously. I have gone multiple times with the same symptoms and each time I am given the same prescription and physical therapy recommendation. This has gone on for 3 years.
1	I do not feel comfortable in doctors office in general. It is the way I am. I watch for anything the doctor says that my end up costing me money.
1	I'm not sure what makes me anxious when I go to the doctor, maybe it's the possibility of having to do more tests.
1	I get really nervous around people in authority in general.  Add that to a situation where a person in authority is asking me all about myself what my daily life entails and it makes me extremely nervous even though I trust and respect my doctor. 
1	I am always worried that the doctor may tell me that I have been diagnosed with a serious medical condition.
-1	My main concern and cause of anxiety is the worry that my actual illness is serious. I'm very rarely thinking about or distrusting the doctor or healthcare provider instead.
1	I wouldn't want the doctor to find something negative. Also, the cost deters me from going to the doctor. Medical expenses are so exorbitant that I don't like to go to the doctor if I feel like I can avoid it.
-1	Again, it is not necessarily feeling these things outright and instead, just wanted to be prepared and anticipatory. Being aware increases the chances for finding the best solution. 
-1	The thing that makes me the most anxious is going in to see the doctor for something minimal and finding out that it was a serious problem. I still remember the time I went to the doctor with my mother to get her checked up and during the time she thought it would be a good idea for me to get checked out too. When we went there the nurse said that everything was fine with my mother so I felt relieved but when she went to my results she had said I had a few traces of kidney stones in me. I began to worry because I always saw myself as very healthy but she reassured me it wasn't that big of a deal.
1	That they will tell me some stuff, and it will seem to make sense, but ultimately it won't help me with any of my problems and nothing will be resolved.
-1	I get the most anxious in expecting a negative outcome. Aside from that I am not really anxious or worried at all about visiting the doctor's office.
1	I am very overweight and I'm always worried that doctor's will disregard me or judge me when they see my size and weight. I'm very self conscious about my weight and body type, and I also worry that doctor's will just see me as a problem due to my weight. 
-1	The battle I sometimes have to have to get them to use a manual blood pressure cuff on me instead of an automatic one.   As previously mentioned, I have severe osteoporosis due to osteogenesis imperfecta.   It is possible for the automatic one to tighten so much that it can literally fracture my arm.  Thus as the nurses' handbook for OI states, a manual blood pressure cuff should be used on folks like me.    Doctor's office staff are not used to patients coming in and insisting on the use of a manual cuff.   I don't look forward to having to go through that each time.
-1	If you're feeling under the weather and the cause is not immediately apparent, resulting in tests - and you need to wait on test results before treatment can be decided.
-1	Going to the doctor is like taking your car to the mechanic. There could always be something seriously wrong that will require time and money to fix. In this case, my health is the most important, so of course I am concerned the doctor would find something bad under my hood.
1	I do not like to be exposed to other people's germs in the waiting room.  If I have something other than a routine condition, I often feel worried about the unknown.
1	i am always worried that the doctor would tell me i have cancer or some other awful disease . the worst case  scenario is always in the back of my mind, im often a little anxious at the doctors office.i worry also about catching a virus from a previous patient because alot of people who go to the doctors office are very sick.
-1	I usually don't feel much anxious when visiting the doctor's office. Maybe because I used to visit the doctor's office when I was a child. The past experiences sometimes may make me a little anxious.
-1	I typically am not very anxious when I go to the doctor. The only time that I do worry is when I'm not sure what's going on with me. As I typically don't get sick, this is not really an issue for me. 
1	I do not feel comfortable going to the doctor's office. Health issues make me feel tense and anxious. I am not sure about the reason. Probably is the possibility of finding something new about my health.
1	I am generally in good health so I don't need to visit the doctor's often.  When I do, it's usually for something that has me quite worried so it's just that.
-1	I am anxious about my health first. Secondly, I am afraid I will get huge medical bill I cannot afford.
1	I have white coat syndrome. Going to the doctor's no matter what it is for makes me anxious or worried. I feel my blood pressure raising. There could be nothing wrong, but a cold and I still get all worked up.
1	Learning the results of tests that I've had taken. I usually get scheduled for tests like cat scans to check my lungs. Waiting til my next appointment to learn the results of those tests makes me anxious to the point of almost being sick to my stomach.
-1	I have always been very nervous when I go to a doctor appointment. So that means when I sit down, and they take my blood pressure, it is sky high.
1	As I have gotten older, my Dr's visits have turned from normal visits about a cold or virus to more serious health concerns.  I now worry when I go see my Dr. that I am going to be told some bad news. 
1	It makes me anxious that they may find something severely wrong with me and it will change my life. Or that they will misdiagnosed something and it will affect my well being. 
-1	I might get bad news or something unforeseen will rise and i might not be able to handle it. The thought of getting cancer has always frightened me. Even getting a dangerous virus has always scared me.
-1	I think the scariest thing is not knowing what the result of your test are going to be. Even if you feel super healthy and you are living a healthy lifestyle nobody can be 100% sure that they are healthy 
-1	I think that all people who go to a medical practice feel the same as me. Perhaps the patient goes with a slight abdominal discomfort and in the consultation discovers that it was not something so light what he felt but it was or is a serious and delicate disease. However, I recommend taking this risk and going to the doctor. That will always be the best option.
1	I never know if itâs going to go okay. I have a heart condition and sometimes things look great and other times not so great. Itâs stressful and expensive. 
1	In general, I would feel anxious because I would not be sure what the diagnosis would be.  Also, I'm always worried about having to buy medicine or take time off of work.  So I always feel apprehensive until I find out what the problem and treatment is.
-1	I have social anxiety so that always plays into my anxiousness. I also will sometimes worry that I will get diagnosed with something bad or that there will be a major problem when I go. Though it's usually in the back of my mind. 
1	I had cancer 8 years ago, so I naturally worry that something might develop, or perhaps secondary cancers from my treatment.  I also am embarrassed about my weight, although I am on a walking program and am doing the best I can.
1	I usually feel anxious and worried when I am unsure of the outcome of a diagnosis. When I am going to see a doctor for a concern with my health and I don't yet know the diagnosis, that makes me very uneasy. The other thing that makes me worried about visiting doctors, is the doctor themselves at times. Because I don't know the doctor personally and I am unsure of what type of person they are and how they maybe professional or not. 
-1	I guess when I go to the doctor I am scared that they will find something really bad, as I have had cervical cancer and it came back 3 times.  I try not to be negative but it just worries me.
-1	I usuall don't worry too much. The uncertainty of what may be found this time pops into my head but it is a minor issue.
1	I am anxious because I generally don't like going to the doctor or the dentist. The place often has other sick or injured people there, which makes me anxious. The environment, while clean and sterile makes me uncomfortable. It usually involves annoying paperwork, driving to and from, checking in, and lots of waiting, which makes the experience unpleasant and anxiety inducing. Further, the uncertainty about health conditions or what might be wrong creates nervousness and anxiety.
1	I am always worried that I have some form of cancer. I smoked for many years and did not take care of myself becuase I was taking care of others. Now I am suffering for it. I want to live a long life, but I fear cancer
-1	I just feel anxious sometimes that i may get bad news.  They may find cancer or something serious that i was not expecting that could be life changing.
-1	I fee anxius about visiting a doctor since i dont want any bad news, and i fear being diagnosed with something that would cost lots of money or would be deadly
-1	always worry about going to the doctor. some tests can show somthing is wrong even when you have no symptoms so that always gives me a little anxiety until i know what is going on fully
1	My most anxious moments at the Dr's office involve tests which have been recommended and the realization that I will not be able to pay the co-pay and deductible required for most of the needed tests.
1	I just never really know what to expect and I feel that it is a waste of time. There has been wrong diagnoses in the past with people, so who knows. It's like flipping a coin. I'd be more worried about what the doctors says if anything.
-1	I feel anxious about telling things to the doctor because I always feel like the doctors don't believe me or think my concerns are not important. I also feel anxious if I have to be undressed for an exam.
-1	I am getting older. I don't have any of their difficulties, but pretty much all the males on my dad's side had high pressure, diabetes, and potential for heart disease.
-1	The main thing that makes me anxious when going to the doctor is wondering if they will find something very wrong with me. I worry about ever contracting a deadly disease where it is unlikely to be cured. This reason alone is why I make sure I see my doctor for my annual checkups. I want to know well in advance if I need to get something treated. 
-1	I know there is always the chance of bad news. I do not put my self in the expectative state of mind, but I am aware of the possibility.
1	I am worried about making sure to resolve whatever issue I have come in for. I am worried about my insurance working properly. I am anxious about what questions the doctor will ask.
-1	If I am not feeling well not knowing what is causing me to feel ill makes me anxious and worried. After the prognosis and diagnosis I start to settle down and relax. 
1	I feel most anxious about some bad news I could get from the doctor's. I am overweight, so I am always worried that I could have a diagnosis related to that.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is my skin appearing to be in need of hydration. I never want to appear to my doctor as being as ashy.
1	"I am always concerned for surprises. I'm always afraid that they will find something ""new"" that is wrong with me, which is disheartening, considering how many chronic conditions I have."
1	Mostly my fears are actually going to the hospital and getting sick. I also don't do well with waiting in long lines. I need to be able to get in and out. I also hate not having my records available online. 
-1	What makes me feel worried is just the anticipation about whatever could be ailing me being worse than I thought it was. I would not want anything serious to happen to me in that case.
1	I am anxious that I will have a visit like my last one and that all he will see is my weight and not me. 
-1	I dont like getting blood tests. That is truly my only fear. Overall, i would say that I have no fear of the doctor. I am in generally decent health overall, so i dont have much to fear. 
1	"I worry that the doctor will not take my concerns and thoughts seriously. I worry that I will be ignored and the doctor will think he knows what is best for me without listening to what I have to say.  I worry that the doctor will try to fit me into a ""box"" typical of other patients he treats and not treat me as an individual."
-1	I do not usually feel this way but when I do it is usually because I know what I am in for. I typically like to spend time self diagnosing before a visit to the doctor. I usually anticipate the most likely outcomes. I even watch the procedures online in so cases. Knowing whats coming and seeing it become my reality is a little nerve wracking. I get a little anxious from procedures involving me being naked. I think that is just uncomfortable in any case. I also do not enjoy pain so knowing I am getting some stitches can cause some anxiety. 
-1	To put it simply... fear of the unknown.  Everyone goes through this, unless they're a psychopath (I actually kind of envy them for that).  If you don't know what's wrong, and you don't know how serious it is, you're going to have that fear.  I's normal.  I'm actually wondering why this question is even necessary.  
1	I would hate to learn that I have a dreaded disease that I didn't know about. I would like to think that my lifestyle would keep me from having a bad disease.
-1	I feel dirty when I go into a doctors waiting room. And especially in the back room where you see the doctor. I think of all the sick people that are in the same area and it makes me feel very dirty. Like I need to take a shower as soon as possible or something.
1	My family medical history and not very great, so I am fearful that I will get diagnosed with something. Anytime I feel less than perfectly healthy I have a small amount of concern. Being in a doctors office is often an uncomfortable experience in general.
-1	I worry that I come across as complaining about every little thing. I have a terrible habit of ignoring things for a long time until they become a big problem, and then going to the doctor. I decided I didn't want to do that, but now I feel as if I have been put through a ton of unnecessary testing this year because of my complaints to the doctors, and I worry that I am presenting myself as a hypochondriac
1	My mind always goes to the worst case scenario when I don't feel well or my kids don't feel well. I am always worried that my own diagnosis will be confirmed or that the course of treatment for whatever is wrong will be expensive or time consuming. I really fear being sick or injured and really worry that I something terrible will happen and I will get diagnosis that something is wrong.
1	When I have an acute problem that hasn't gone away on its own, I can feel pretty anxious. I can also feel anxious when I've been waiting for a long time.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is that the doctor will find something wrong with me, and that I could possibly be put on medication for the rest of my life, treating any condition instead of being able to cure it.
-1	"My body and my car share some interesting commonalities. When I take my car to a mechanic, I dread hearing, ""Well, it could be the alternator or it might be the wiring or maybe the starter.""  The same is true of a doctor's visit. The worst possible result is lack of clarity.  That being said, of course there are situations where lack of clarity is real, and as long as doctors have a plan for clarifying a situation, I'm OK. Not thrilled, but OK. The main way that doctors reduce my anxiety and worry is by convincing me that they are telling me what they know or believe in complete honesty. If I don't think a doctor is leveling with me, then I get really anxious. I would rather have a truthful, irascible doctor than a pleasant, uninformative one."
1	Well I really can't blame the doctor for this one. I have just always felt very anxious about visiting a doctor (or dentist, for that matter). I am always fearful that they will find something wrong with me that I was unaware of, or that the visit will entail pain I don't want to deal with (such as shots, drawing blood, etc.) I wouldn't say I'm a problem patient though, it's just that I am quietly anxious about my appointments. 
-1	I mostly have positive feelings when a doctor is examining me because if I get a clean bill of health, then obviously, that's a positive result but even if the dr does find something wrong, I'd rather know about it so that I can do what I need to to overcome it.
-1	There have been times when a test or exam turned up something questionable that needed to be explored with further tests. I have had a few cancer scares. Those times were anxious for me, because I knew there was a possibility I would have cancer. Thankfully, I never did.
-1	Fear of the unknown is always the scariest part. Blood work can often reveal unexpected problems. Another thing might be that there is no known way to treat a condition. 
-1	That I will need to have shots or I will hear the word cancer. I do not mind the exam and any drugs or other things I would need to do.
1	I have very strong white coat anxiety. I'm not worried about the aspect of pain particularly. It's more the whole aspect of fearing for the worst coupled with the unknown drives it. Loss of control and claustrophobic feelings also factor into it some extent. The apprehension is worse with some medical professionals than it is with others. 
-1	I worry that they may try to push a drug on me that will end up hurting me or ruining my life. Of course, I'm very resistant to that and I would reject anything that I couldn't research before I took it. I just feel like I have to keep my guard up and make sure that I'm doing what's right for me in my understanding of things, regardless of what the doctor wants. 
1	I worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me. I am relatively young and in good health, but I am always concerned that something will come up that I am not expecting. I am too anxious of a person over all, so this is really in line with my personality.
1	that i will be belittled, and my concerns wont be addressed because they will make up their mind about it with little information and dont do a full exam.
1	I do not know what my current symptoms are, and how they effect the rest of my illnesses.  I dread going on new medicine.  I already take 9 presecriptions
1	I am very nervous about having my body violated or put through examinations that I am not consenting to. Many times doctors have forced me to succumb to treatment that I explicitly said I didn't want, so I have constant anxiety about seeing them. I have been sent away in a police car too many times by care providers that refuse to give me the treatment I need.
-1	There is nothing in particular that makes me feel anxious or worried. I was anxious when finding out the sex of my baby.
1	Worried that they'll find something seriously wrong - or worse, they'll miss something seriously wrong. Worried that they'll suggest I change my lifestyle in ways that make me unhappy.
1	Thinking if they are really up to the task and willing to devote their full attention. If not, I may end up suffering from their incompetence and the lack of work ethic.  
-1	I always feel like they may tell me something I dont want to hear or something thats going to be hard for me to correct. I dont like bad news and I never want to hear bad news at all
-1	The only thing that I would feel anxious about is whether the doctor is going to find something wrong with my health.I have minor kidney disease, which worries me slightly, and my mother has diabetes- so I'm uneasy about my a1c readings
-1	I worry that a doctor will not fully understand my pain or symptoms. I feel anxious about being overprescribed medication or receiving unnecessary medical treatments that I'll have to pay for.
-1	I have a family history of diabetes and heart disease. As much as I take care of myself, I am worried that I would get a diagnosis that is not in my favor.
-1	"I always have this general feeling that I will receive bad news when I visit the doctor's office even though I usually don't. I'm a healthy individual. But there's always a sense of ""What don't I know?"" that might pop up. Receiving test results always makes me a bit anxious because of a false positive test that I received one time in my life."
1	I am just an anxious person anyway, so anytime I have to go see my doctor I usually feel this way. I feel like when the doctor walks in he is going to give me the worst news ever, but it is not like that at my usual doctors appointments.
1	If I'm sick, I'm not sure what the diagnosis is, that makes me very anxious for obvious reasons. I'm most nervous when getting tested for STDs/HIV because I'm part of an at risk population, but I do my best to minimize that risk. I don't really get uneasy or uncomfortable talking personal bodily or hygienic stuff because to me that's expected in a medical setting.
1	I generally am uncomfortable around doctors and downright panicky around dentists.  I think this is all due to bad experiences as a child that I just cannot seem to get over.
-1	I am worried whether my weight, blood pressure, white blood cell will change for the worse. When I go for a screening whether it will show something I do not want to know I can fight.
1	I really know what the doctor or nurse is going to say to me. If I gain a few pounds I feel like they are saying 'lose the weight fatty'. Also when it came to my mental problems they want to push drugs than get to a solutions so I worried they are just going to turn me into a zombie on drugs.
-1	I think he will give me some bad news about my bloodwork or that I've gained too much weight.  Ultimately though it always goes better than expected.
1	There is always a chance that something bad can come up. Being in the office knowing that you may find out awful information is stressful. Likewise, if you haven't been listening to the doctors recommendation, you bound to get yelled at  for that.
-1	Sometimes I go into a doctor fearing the worst when I go into see him. There have been times in the past with previous doctors that their first diagnoses wasn't always the correct one. For that reason alone I'm weary sometimes.
-1	ONE THING THAT MAKES ME ANGRY OR WORRIED IS ABOUT THE HEALTH TIPS WHENEVER THEY PROVIDE ME , BUT I FOLLOW THEM RARELY WITH THAT WHILE I GO FOR A CHECKUP I AM SACRED ONLY FOR THAT PURPOSE .
-1	I have felt anxious or worried only once when seeing my doctor, and that weas when I had a naccident which fractured my hip.  I had never before experienced a broken bone and was fearful about how painful or long the treatment for recovery would be.
-1	The unknowns make me feel the most anxious and worried. If for example I am having a very bad pain and I have no idea what it could be I feel very anxious waiting to find out because I always feel like it will be something bad. 
1	Whenever I get a physical exam of course I get anxious because anyone can have hidden problems within their body and you never know what may be found at each exam. So as much as I want to stay ahead of the game I dread it every time.
-1	Nothing really. I just go there and they take care of things. It takes a bit of extra time out of my day but it's only a hour. 
-1	I think that will find something else wrong with me. I know that they want to make as much money as possible off of me, and so they will do everything they can to find something else.
1	Doesn't everyone hate to go to the doctor? I know that being weighed is necessary for medicine doses and determining overall health, but I'd go a lot more if they didn't weigh me every time. If I'm a couple pounds over my last visit weight, I'll do everything I can to lose it before going to the doctor, or just not go. I suspect this is very common.
-1	I worry that I might have a serious illness.  I don't have much money, so I can't really afford to be sick.
1	Iâm most anxious that lab results will have indicate I need some kind of medication.  I worry about my blood pressure, cholesterol and liver enzymes but so far they are OK. 
1	The amount of pain expected from some medical procedures is a cause of worry. Also, being told that there could be an abnormality in some test results. The cost of the visit or tests needed is also bothersome.
-1	"I feel like there is a chance that something could be wrong with me and I need to brace myself for some sort of bad news. This can make me feel a little bit anxious when I see a new doctor. Sometimes I also worry that the doctor won't take me seriously because I look ""rough"". I have been pegged as ""drug seeking"" simply because of how I look. This has happened even though I am not even wanting any type of medication and I am a drug and alcohol counselor per profession."
1	I think its probably fear of the unknown... or if I know or think I know what's going on, its a fear of dealing with the issue and what comes with it.
-1	Visiting the doctors office rarely makes me feel anxious. If at some point I do feel anxious it might be because the doctor will tell me that I will have to undergo treatment that is not the most convienient for me at the time or I am unfortunately diagnosed with a condition that is not curable. 
-1	I feel anxious at a doctor's visit whenever I think there might be a possibility of something being seriously wrong (like the time I found a breast mass) or if I feel like the visit and/or tests might be very expensive.
-1	I worry sometimes that I will explain something badly pertaining to my medical condition or forget something important even if I write it down or even say too much thereby causing my doctor to send me in for tests or more prescriptions.
-1	My biggest fear is that he would find something really wrong and need me to come back for further treatment. I guess that's a good thing in general, as I would be identifying a health problem... so I guess the anxiety would come from the possibility of having that problem at all.
-1	Anticipation of receiving possible negative news.  No one wants to hear anything negative at the doctor's office.
-1	I think what makes me feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is thinking about what the physician is going to say to me and if they physician wants to prescribe medications or have me undergo any tests, such as blood tests or sonograms.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office is the same thing I just stated in the prior narrative, is that I am concerned that physicians are primarily in the drug business and always looking to push drugs. I know that pharmaceutical companies incentivize physicians to prescribe drugs for pretty much everything and so I always fear that there is a âwitch huntâ in progress as a physician to look for reasons to prescribe and considers which drugs to use.
1	I am worried first and foremost about the cost of procedures.  Next, I'm afraid of being misgendered and then misracialized.
1	Nothing that the doctor did or said, but mostly what I might have wrong with me. I am naturally anxious in these types of situations because I always fear the worst, and getting any sort of negative medical news can be devastating for me. 
-1	Mentally I am relaxed, but even benign medical procedures like taking my blood pressure can produce stress responses in me.  It's also difficult when they take blood, my veins are uncooperative and so it's typically a difficult process
1	I think what make me anxious is just the whole environment of being at the doctor's office. It is not a comfortable feeling at all. It makes me feel very anxious. Further it makes me worried because I always feel like they are going to say things that are terrible. Or that the doctor is going to do tests I do not want nor like. In all the atmosphere of the doctor's office makes me anxious at best. It is not a good feeling. It just evokes bad feelings and the want to not even go. The anticipation sitting in the examination room waiting for the doctor not only creates anxiety but also worry. I have never been to the doctor's office and can say I felt at ease and calm. The whole experience of going to the doctor is just not conducive of good feelings. 
-1	Social anxiety is one of those things that you have to keep facing, over and over, no matter how scary it is. If you let it take over, it'll get too hard to even leave your house. I was terrified to get help, too. It took weeks before I finally gathered up the courage to make the call. I arrived for my appointment early so I could have time to sit in the car and compose myself before I went in. Once I was in the doctor's office, I shook so much that I could barely grip a pen. My voice came out in rapid little bursts, and I was drenched in sweat.
-1	I really don't like being touched by strangers. Even though I have been to my primary care doctor it still feels like being touched by a stranger.
-1	When I go to see my doctor I have a certain mindset. I do not let my emotions interfere with my mind, because as we know it can be deter mental to your health. So when I go to see my physician I usually listen to some calm music, trying to calm my nerves if anything, because as any human being we all have emotions, but we can control them, that's matter of practice. So in nutshell when I see my doctor I do not feel anxious or worried about anything and give myself the best chance possible to win. My mind is always on point, I am awake and aware.
1	I feel anxious when I walk into a new doctor office. I also hate going to some doctors because they are slow or way too quick in my opinion.
-1	I typically am not worried when I go to see the doctor as I am ready to face any medical condition I might have. I don't particularly look forward to prostate exams during my annual physical I guess.
-1	"For the past couple of years my Dr has been monitoring some ""suspicious nodules "" in my lung. So I always dread going in after having the xrays or Cat Scans done to monitor it. My dad died of lung cancer so it scares me and I dread going in to find out if its ok or not"
-1	If the doctor hesitate to tell me about my health reports after examination i would feel most anxious and worried.
-1	I sometimes feel like the diagnosis does not match my symptoms. But I know it is all in my head. It is a character flaw nothing to do with my doctor. 
1	I get very nervous about hearing bad news. That I am dying, or that my blood pressure is too high. I have always been afraid of doctors.
-1	I am most anxious that the doctor will find something fatally wrong with me. Though I do not believe it is very likely any time soon, I worry about such a diagnosis happening one day. As someone who has a history with cigarettes and medications, I would not be surprised if I experienced a bad prognosis at some point in time. 
1	What would make me feel most anxious is taking test, removing my clothing, getting shots or being told that I have a disease. Most doctors office visits are stressful for me because I have chronic anxiety, however, sometimes I am able to calm myself down during the office visit. I do worry about germs of other people as well, and worry later if I could get sick from them. I usually rush home and shower. 
-1	The only time I fell anxious or worried when going to the doctor is when I think that I might have something wrong with me.
-1	It's uncomfortable to go to the doctor period. I get anxious from the time I call to set an appointment, to the time I leave. Fortunately, I don't go to the doctor enough to not be anxious. I don't think it's because I fear they will find something wrong, but just that it is an uncomfortable situation.
1	I am always worried that a doctor is not going to hear what I am telling them or ignore my symptoms and play them down.  Then I get a huge bill a few weeks later.  I often felt like I was scammed or taken advantage of. This has happened so many times in the past.  
-1	I am getting older and just never know what my body is doing.i feel like my so called body clock is getting closer to its expiration date so to speak.i want to live a long life.
1	I am pretty anxious in general, but working in healthcare, I feel I know a lot of the bad things that can happen. It's hard for me to get some of those things out of my head.
-1	I'm not anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's for an exam. I don't really like waiting and I dread the expense, but nothing about the appointment itself gets my very worried
1	I worry that the doctor will find something going on in me that I will not be able to afford the treatment for, or that the treatment will have serious side effects. I worry that the doctor might see something embarrassing or shame me for being overweight.
-1	Its the anticipation. I know I could feel find but they chance that they find something or my blood work shows elevated LFTS or other medical issues such as anemia sometimes worries me.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is just not knowing.  Not knowing on a few visits if I was going to have to do a basic test as the hospital and all the trouble that entails.  That's all. 
1	I always assume the worst. I usually think that something is going to come back worse then what I initially went to the doctor for.
-1	If I am waiting test results that can be a little nerve wracking.  I do not like to wait for results to tests or blood work. 
1	I am always nervous about what they are going to say about my health or my conditions.  I generally never really get anything to positive, so I always try to prepare myself for what is to come.  If I get a good report, then I'd rather be pleasantly surprised, then be hopeful and become disappointed.  
-1	I am always worried that something far worse than I have will occur. I tend to think overly regarding what could possibly be wrong. It is usually something pretty common however.
-1	Because I have a physician's assistant who is in our family I can usually get a good take on what is wrong with me. However, when something major happens such as the prostate cancer I went through and still must be checked on a periodic basis ... I admit I feel a little anxious and worried before the visit is over. Once I get the all clear signal I am back to normal. I usually do not sweat over it until the day of the visit.
1	Just the not knowing if anything unexpected may show up in some kind of test or blood work.  You just never know when some type of medical problem that is unexpected happens.
-1	I don't feel a lot of these emotions. I usually am a pretty calm, cool, and collected person that tends not to make mountains out of mole hills. Due to the good fortune of never having a whole lot of serious health problems, my anxiety around doctors is pretty low, i'm not scared of needles, i believe in science and most of western medicine. I do experience some anxiety when waiting for test results, especially for serious things HIV, Hepatitis, Ect. I feel annoyance sometimes at having to wait so long in the waiting rooms, and do get a bit nervous about actually contracting diseases or sicknesses from waiting rooms and hospital lobbies. 
-1	I don't feel worried about the doctor because I feel the worst is over now ill get some medicine to feel better
-1	SOMETIMES I WORRY THAT I'VE WAITED TOO LONG TO GO SEE THE DOCTOR ABOUT AN ISSUE AND THUS I CREATED AN INSTANCE WHERE MY TREATMENT WILL LAST LONGER THAN IT NEEDED TO OR THAT MY TREATMENT WILL COST MORE THAN IT WOULD HAVE HAD I GONE TO THE DOCTOR EARLIER.
-1	Nothing, really.  There's the 1% chance that I might get blindsided by bad news, but that is very unlikely.  The only somewhat realistic concern I might have is if I was diagnosed with a condition that runs in my family, especially ones I'm actively trying to avoid.
-1	I usually don't feel nervous or worried when I go to the doctor's office.  The things that make me a little nervous are waiting in the waiting room and wondering which medications I might need if I'm sick.
1	Not knowing what the outcome of what i am there for. Telling me things that i am probably not going to want to hear. Being told i am doing something wrong. I feel anxious not knowing the results of tests i have had taken. Prescribing pills that have side effects is nerve wracking.
-1	I meant to put anxious and nervous sometimes around doctors because it depends on why I am going to the doctors for. If it is something serious then I would feel nervous and anxious. 
1	 Going to the doctors always has a component of dread for me. I fear my test results in particular after a period when I have let myself go physically or not watched my diet carefully. My particular fears are; cancer and signs of cognitive decline. My cholesterol is another concern as it is nearly always just outside the parameters and I am nearly always chided for that. I am diabetic but my A1c results have been consistently good for many years now. I dread going to the psychiatrist for anxiety meds because I really feat mental aging and there is nearly always a test for that involved with the visit.
1	If my doctors find something unusual if i visit them that makes me worried. Once they find out that my certain blood level is not in sync i can't just ignore them most of the time they look after their patient. Also just going to visit doctors itself is worrisome. The thought it self will make me thinking if they find out something going on with me and then i have to go through other diagnostics taste. That takes time, money and more stress for my family.
-1	I feel anxious mainly because I have general anxiety with my life. But it is the idea of not yet knowing what is wrong with me. And I generally think about the worst case scenario.
-1	For some reason I get anxious. But once I am in there I don't feel scared at all because my doctor makes me feel  better. Perhaps it's just the environment and anticipation that makes me scared.
-1	what makes you feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is just general anxiety. Or general worry nothing specific
1	When I go to the doctor for something that could be serious, this is when I get worried or anxious. I hate not being in control of a situation and I think for me not knowing is what worries me.
-1	The uncertainty of not knowing whatâs making me feel ill, of having something very hurtful or that may result in a painful procedure or that might cost a lot of money.
1	I'm most worried about what the process is going to be and how awkward it'll feel. I'm more comfortable with a woman being my doctor and I have a male doctor, so I'm slightly uncomfortable.I'm also worried about if something is going to be found wrong.
-1	I'm generally calm in the doctor's office, but if I'm going in with something unknown, where I'm not certain what it is, there is a general anxiousness about the severity or seriousness of what I may be told. That I'm thinking it's something minor but it's something major. I have a bit more anxiousness than others, since I've had the experience where I received unexpected news that I had a serious disease before.
1	I feel anxious or worried sometimes when  visiting the doctor because I am unsure if my illness may be something worse. I also get worried that I will receive bad news about my health at some point during the visit. I never fully calm down until I have left the office with a good bill of health.
1	I am worried about the diagnosis I may receive and whether or not I will be able to afford the treatment or medications I need. My main concern is the cost of treatment.
1	Not knowing what my condition is like and the chances of getting some news that might make me worry. Also I worry about the length of time it might take, because often I've waited ridiculous amounts of time. 
1	When I go to the doctor since I have hypothyroidism, I usually have to get lab work.  I have small veins so it can be difficult to draw labs sometimes.  I usually get anxious more about this than anything else.  There isn't usually anything the doctor did, but just don't always enjoy the tests they put you through.
1	I have not taken good proactive care of my health- and I would be extremely anxious that I have some condition like cancer or heart disease. I feel like I would be mostly alone and struggle badly to fight any condition or disease well with the mindset and resources I have at this time.
1	I feel most worried about my doctor judging me due to my health or possible mental problems I am experiencing. I do not feel I am able to be completely honest. 
-1	I feel anxious because I do not care being around doctors or nurses.  I feel as thought I am a healthy person and do not need to be in a doctors office for checkups.  I simply don't care to go to the doctor for any reason.
-1	Like many other patients, I am more anxious when running my regular checkups and expecting the results from the lab. I would also be quite nervous if there would be a complication and he would need to send me to the hospital.
-1	I think the worst is when you go into the doctor's office and you feel bad and you are not sure what the doctor is going to say.
1	I get just anxious about seeing and being around people. I don't know what it is. Afraid of things that could happen but I know they won't. 
-1	I'm not quite sure what it is, but every time I go to a doctors appointment I always feel a little trepidation. Its not that I'm worried they will find something wrong with me, but there is just always this sense of anticipation. It is completely illogical, and I know it. Maybe its perhaps that even though doctors are associated with caring for one's health, they are also associated with sickness and disease. 
-1	I am usually pretty good when going to the doctor.   I do get anxious waiting for them to come into the room but that is more due to me hating sitting there cold in the gown waiting and nothing to do with the actual appointment
-1	I feel anxious that maybe i have not taken care of myself as much as i should and that it may have lead to some form of problem that i do not notice that needs to take care of. I have had conditions in the past that i worry may come back
1	I get anxious when I worry about whether the doctor will assist me in a way that I personally agree with or if they will demand I do things that are out of my comfort zone, such as taking medications I do not wish to take or taking tests that I find to be dangerous.
-1	Right now I'm uneasy because the treatment that has worked for me in the past is being denied to me, and the new treatment has caused a 50 lb weight gain (I was a perfectly healthy, trim weight before!). And when that comes up, doctors don't like to acknowledge the treatments I am on are the main culprit of the weight gain. They just blame me, which is dumb since I have ALWAYS been trim, and was looking good at 45 before all these stupid treatments. 
1	The doctor might be concerned about what symptoms I've been having. I never know when my health might change. 
-1	Sometimes when I don't know what is going on and I think it could be two or three different things. I get anxious wanting to know what it is and what I might or might not have done to cause it.
-1	I wonder how the tests will come out. I wonder if my blood pressure is high, although its been normal for some time now. There is uncertainty. 
-1	I don't really get anxious or worried at the doctor most of the time. Sometimes if I have a problem that could be potentially serious I'll feel uncomfortable, but that has only happened once or twice. I also don't really like undressing at the doctor, but I opt not to and my doctor is fine with it.
-1	I do not like to wait for test results to say what is going on with my overall health I like to know right away what is happening and going on .
-1	Sometimes when I go to the doctors office and it is something more serious my mind often goes to the worst case scenario and how my life would be impacted if something is really wrong with my health. I worry that it might be some difficult procedure needed to make me well again.  
1	In my experience people go to the doctor because something is wrong. As someone who has an anxiety disorder anyway, going to someone who can confirm that a problem is real and something could be terribly wrong just stresses me completely out. 
1	Just what they may find. Something that I wasn't expecting. Me needing a treatment I can't afford. Just the whole experience really. 
1	I am not e needle person. In fact my chart lets the nurses know I have a hard time with needles. I have high blood pressure, and have to get my blood drawn every now and then, so I worry about that.
-1	Just knowing that I may end up with a doctor who does not really want to take the time to listen to my complaints and will just try to push some drug on me makes me anxious.  I am not relaxed going in just thinking about that.
-1	Mainly the outcome of the visit makes me nervous. As a person that has had a few medical conditions, it always makes me a little uneasy to have a check up not knowing if something is wrong again. Having to take additional tests, such as x-ray's or bloodwork is something that always makes me nervous. While I was sick I would be anxious before every appointment because I would be afraid that the doctor may have found something cancerous or seriously life threatening. 
1	I am worried that there will be something wrong with me.  I am worried that I will walk out sick or on several medications.  
1	That their profits are more concerning than my health. that they would rather me be on 17 different pills , all with adverse side effects than smoke a few joints a day which has a better effect at my treatment.
-1	With me getting up in age I get more worried then I did when I was younger. Any kind of symptoms that I'm having now I sometimes think the worst and that I'm seriously ill.  
-1	I get apprehensive about what they may tell me about my test results, and how I will react if the news is bad.
1	because I have so many different problems with my health I don't know what is going to be next because it seems like every time I go to the doctor something else is wrong
-1	what makes me more anxious or worry is knowing if i'm good or if i'm gonna need take pills, have an illness that is hard to cure.
1	I feel a little anxious about doctor visits in general. The clinical setting makes me feel a little uncomfortable and it usually ends up being a source of work for myself later in order to continue my healthcare. 
1	In most cases the cause of anxiety is usually the uncertainity sorounding a test whose outcome is unknown. We do not have control over outcomes of tests and however compassionate the physician is, I always get worried. I believe it's normal though.
1	I think that doctors ask many questions. Also, they search for abnormalities. This can make me feel uneasy because I don't know what the next observation or diagnosis will be regarding my health issues. Also, I feel uneasy when I have to have my blood pressure checked. 
-1	Knowing that you will likely find out what is wrong with you and hoping that it's not something expensive or bad. Also, hoping you get worthwhile information out of going in relation to the cost of going. Or the possibility of having to feel pain from procedures.
1	Even though it hasn't been diagnosed, I'm certain that I've got some form of an anxiety disorder, so I'm pretty much always on edge when visiting the doctor's office. I'm a pretty modest person (and being asexual probably doesn't help this), so anything that involves getting a little too touchy-feely makes me extremely uncomfortable. For instance, I know that I should really visit a gynecologist or the like, but the thought of it freaks me out too much. I actually took far longer than I should have to go to the doctor about my IBS before I knew what it was, because I was afraid that I'd have to have a colonoscopy or something similar (as mentioned earlier, I was fortunate that my doctor also suffers from it, so as soon as I started talking about my symptoms, she knew exactly what it was).
1	Mainly I worry that my good luck has finally run out and they find a major medical issue that has to be dealt with.  Possible crippling financial costs of a discovered medical issue causes me considerable worry.
-1	I feel nervous when something is physically wrong with me and I have no idea what it is. I get nervous when I know it could be a costly visit as well. 
1	I am always anxious and worried so it would be no different in the doctor's office. I guess I would be concerned that I would find out that I had some incurable disease or something at the doctor's office.
-1	As dumb as it sounds, what worries me the most is what the doctor's will find.  Kind of the concept that ignorance is bliss, if I don't go then I don't have to worry about whatever is going on in my body.  I also don't like having fasting blood draws, so if I can avoid those I generally feel a lot better.  In addition, if it's not a standard wellness visit, generally you already know there's something wrong and I worry it might be more serious than it is.
-1	I don't generally feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. I am satisfied with the service and am treated well by everyone there. I don't feel negative about the experience.
1	When the doctor recommends that I take some medication that I am not very familiar with. I read about some possible side-effects but my doctor does not seem very affected by that. That makes me worried because I'm unsure if something may be a big deal or not.
-1	When I visit my Doctor I'm worried that he will find something seriously wrong with me. He is upfront about my health issues and wouldn't hold back if he found some thing wrong with me. 
-1	I rarely feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office. My health is reasonable and most issues are fairly common at this point. 
1	Getting a new diagnoses or starting new treatment always sucks.  Waiting for them to come in with lab results is always a worrisome time too, not knowing if things are going the way we scare hoping and the anticipation is scary,
-1	Aside from the tedious visits which is a constant reminder that I am a cancer patient, I have no qualms other than that I do not work and my income is low which makes daily living sometimes unbearable.  I was a vibrant 62 year old with my own home a gorgeous leased vehicle and then in an instant I was a cancer patient.  It was not how I envisioned my life to be and was hopeful that I would work until full retirement age of 66 or later.  Visiting the cancer center is not a big deal.
-1	Iâm generally not worried about going to the doctorâs office. I would only become worried if a doctor gave me a reason to be after an examination. I donât necessarily go into the appointment worried 
1	I can't really explain what makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor. I am nervous when I go there no matter what. It doesn't matter if I have a current health issue or not. Getting my blood taken amps up my anxiousness though because I am afraid of needles. I always feel like I'm going to get bad news at the doctor. I think a lot of it has to do with my father and how he ended up dying. He had cardiovascular disease and me and all of my siblings also have some form of it. I lost 3 siblings this past year from heart related issues with no warning signs. 
-1	My biggest fear is that I have something terminal and that when they examine me they will discover something terrible.  I am very anxious to get the results of tests and screenings.
1	I don't like when there is something wrong with me and I don't know what it is. My fears get the best of me and I worry a lot.
1	I worry that something will be wrong with me. I also have been gaining weight and get nervous when I have to get on a scale anymore. I don't want to be unhealthy.
1	I have never enjoyed going to the doctor. I feel like their is a lack of privacy and sensitivity. Sometimes you are made to feel like just a body and not a person. And of course, worrying that something might be wrong with you.
1	When visiting the doctors off I feel scared more than anything due to the concern that anything can happen. I always feel nervous when entering the doctors office due to just the unknown of what could happen upon entering.
-1	will not get the information I need because we all know they spend very little time with each client
-1	That I will end up with another short term solution and no clear answer. In three months I will be in the same situation and he will just do the same thing and I don't see progress.
1	Their standard assessment equipment sometimes causes errors in obtaining vital signs.  The doctor often will not re-check the vitals and my anxiety usually causes my blood pressure to read higher than it is. I get anxious when they try to give me new medication for something that hasn't been examined and followed through properly.
-1	Mostly just when I have to get shots or have tihngs happen that might hurt in some way. Normal things are completely fine
1	I have generalized anxiety disorder and usually am always full of anxiety even if there is nothing wrong. What makes me the most anxious is the uncertainty of each visit. I Always expect the worst in every visit thinking something is seriously wrong with me. I cannot control this fear.  
1	The first worrying thought in my mind is always the possibility of being told some new negative information, such as my health has worsened or I have developed some entirely new health complication. I also don't like the thought of having to need some new medication since I'm already on several. Other than that, one of the main things that I'm always anxious about is the possibility of having to get a blood exam, since I am extremely terrified of needles.
1	I mostly worry about the germs I'm getting sitting in the waiting room. I also do not enjoy the shots that come along with physicals. They tend to give me anxiety but I do not necessarily have a problem with the doctor, nurse, or the wait time when I do have an appointment. 
-1	Getting weighed every single time makes me anxious. My white coat blood pressure makes me anxious... I tell the person who takes my blood pressure before the doctor comes in to wait a few minutes and ask me the standard questions and refer to my online chart BEFORE taking my blood pressure. But-they never listen to me, take it anyway and it comes out high. Then when the doctor comes in I tell him that told the assistant again to wait to take my bp(for the umpteenth time) and he takes it and it's fine.
1	When a doctor tells me that they are concerned about something and we need to run tests. Then when those tests take forever to come back with the results. That is the worst feeling.
1	I'm worried the doctor will tell me something bad. Being pregnant I'm worried the doctor will tell me something is wrong with the baby and I don't want that 
1	That i will get a bad diagnosis. That i may need to have an uncomfortable procedure performed. Or maybe the amount of money needed wont be enough 
-1	I feel the most anxious when I'm at the doctor's office and have to have blood tests. I usually end up getting light headed and fainting. I am terrible with blood and the nurse must give me some smelling salts to get me back. It's terrible, i'm the most queazy person on earth and it is so embarrassing. I am trying to overcome my fears.
1	That he or she will find something wrong with me that I did not know about. Also, that they would tell me what I am doing to stay healthy is not good enough or not working.
-1	Waiting for annual blood lab results to monitor specific conditions - if the doctor does not get back to me promptly with reassurance and feedback or interpretation, that makes me anxious. 
-1	Anytime you enter a doctor's office for an ailment it's always nerve wracking. You do not know what's wrong, and for me being in the medical field I always think of the worst conditions. It's almost like the people that google their symptoms and freak out. It's definitely harder waiting for test results knowing what's out there and how many people you file claims for that actually have these ailments. It makes you very uneasy. The anticipation is very unnerving.  
-1	I feel as if my doctor is going to tell me either something is terribly wrong with me or that i need some sort of risky procedure
-1	Even though I feel fine, there's always lingering doubt in my mind. Like I'll get some bad news or he'll tell me I have some disease or medical issue I wasn't anticipating.
1	Like I said, I think I'm a kind of hypochondriac. It's very easy to convince myself I have any disease I hear of, and so I just want to avoid the whole situation, like going to the doctor will make it worse. Also, I've had really bad experiences with doctors mistreating my family members.
1	I absolutely detest anyone touching me. It makes me feel sick to my stomach and sends my mind reeling even just sitting here thinking about it. I don't want any doctor disregarding or disrespecting my body autonomy. I would 100% avoid any circumstance where a doctor could even touch my arm.
-1	The only thing I get anxious about is when I have to get a flu shot or my blood drawn. I have needles and they freak me out otherwise I am fine.
1	I'm most anxious about weighing myself. I have really bad body issues and haven't been able to lose pregnancy weight. 
-1	I sometimes dread getting bad test results or trying a new mediciation/treatment that might give me bad side effects. I also don't enjoy needles so that gives me anxiety. 
-1	I am most worried about going to the doctor when there is nothing really wrong.  I am most anxious to go to the doctor and be told that there is nothing wrong and it's all in my head.
1	I am fearful of any health conditions I might be diagnosed with, nervous about the vitals, taking of blood, and of the office in general.
-1	Not knowing what will come out his mouth about thre test he just ran on me.  You always go in thinking hey I do this right, but still not knowing what came from these test blood work.  That has me a little worried
1	What worries me most when going to the doctor's office is not knowing what it is that they will be doing and what they will find.  I also find it somewhat unsettling to have a stranger looking me over and touching me. 
-1	The thought of the doctor finding something else wrong that I wasn't aware of or couldn't fathom. I don't like surprises like that.
-1	Sometimes I encounter health professionals that blow of my symptoms so any worry is about getting them to investigate my symptoms instead of ignoring them.
-1	I don't like needles. I don't mind going to the doctor that much, but I know that if they are going to be drawing blood that it's going to make me uneasy. I also feel anxious about my own body weight and self conscious about it.
1	I am worried when checking up on chronic conditions, wanting to make sure that I am not about to hear bad news about my health. I think a doctor's office inherently makes people nervous. 
1	I am nervous that they are going to find a major issue with my health. I am also nervous that they will miss something major with my health. 
-1	Waiting for a result. There are times when you may not get a result back for a week or two, and you have to wait to see what is going to happen next. In that waiting time, you have to pick your head up and continue on, as hard as it may be. 
-1	When I visit the doctor, my biggest worry is how much it will cost. I don't have very much money and my insurance is very bad. Even a little test can end up being thousands of dollars and I don't have the ability to pay it. 
-1	Doctors can be very pleasant to be around but many can also be untrustworthy.  It has been that way for all time and it wouldn't just suddenly halt one day.  Doctors can make sure that they are giving you a prescription that may not be the best for you as long as it is the best for them. 
1	I just dont like talking about personal things with other people so it makes me anxious in general, not just because they are a doctor.
-1	Generally, I don't feel anxiety when I go to the doctor.  I take very good care of myself and I have good sense of when something is wrong.  It is only in those moments where I don't know what is behind a mystery ache or pain that I feel anxious.  
-1	I really do not feel anxious or worried when I visit a doctor, other than the off chance that there might be a serious illness and not just a routine sickness going on. Although I tend to be optimistic that most things I would experience are very treatable. 
1	I worry that I will be referred to yet another doctor who will then refer me to another doctor. I am also worried that I will be told that the only thing they can do is give me another pill to take. 
1	The doctor makes me wait in the back room for hours. The room is often too warm and my health issues do not do well in extreme temperatures.
-1	i am sometimes feeling so because i don not know what he is going to say this time. one thing about doctors is that they must see what is wrong with your body. so going to them can make think ahead what to hear from them
-1	I guess just knowing that I didn't hit the weight goal that I had for myself. I gained weight while I was pregnant and haven't completely lost all of that weight.
-1	Im always worried im going to have something major wrong with me or they will find something very wrong with me.  I also scared i may have an infection of some sort.
1	I might get information I don't like about a medical condition. I might have to have an awkward conversation with the doctor. The doctor may have to examine me, and an unfamiliar person doing that is not the most comfortable situation. 
-1	I have had a lump removed from my breast and I have to have it checked to make sure it has not returned or any others have formed. I get anxious when I know it is time to have my check up.
1	No one likes getting naked and wearing a flimsy paper robe and being poked around, and having the prospect of bad news.
-1	I have a chronic pain disorder, so when I see a new doctor I'm always anxious that they won't believe that my pain is real. 
-1	Finding out something is terribly wrong with me would be very bad news. I'm very relieved every time this is not the case. It's best to check things early and practice preventative care instead of be late to treat something after it develops.
1	The biggest thing that I fear is finding out that I am going to have a serious medical issue.  The longer I have to wait the worse it is.
-1	I worried that there might be something wrong. I wonder if anything unexpected might come up.I worry about bad news. 
-1	I feel most anxious, or worried, about the fact that this is the place where I could potentially learn of something negative about my health, something life threatening, debilitating, etc. I know this is the place, and the doctor is the person, that this news will come from.
1	Being told that something is wrong, especially if its something i may have not yet considered.  I dont like the unknown and if i have an idea of what im dealing with i can prepare and figure out whats next, but im no dr so there is always the possi bility something will be truly wrong.
1	There is always the thought that the problem could be something worse than expected. Also I feel anxious that the problem will be something that cannot be fixed or something that will take a long time to recover from. 
1	I feel anxious because I do not fully trust the physician as it is. I also feel nervous because I do not like to have a person that I do not know look at me or touch me while I am naked.
-1	Worried that the doctor will miss something or discover something I was unaware of.  Anxiety comes from being in the doctors office for a sickness that I want cured and having to rely on someone else to make the right choice as to what best cures that sickness. Sometimes I also get a little uneasy challenging the doctor.  For example, if I think one medication is better suited to my sickness, but the doctor is recommending something else. 
1	Because you never know if they may tell you that it's something wrong with you. This is the reason why many people don't go to the dr's office as much as they should. We hate and fear hearing bad news.  Even just the thought of it makes a person feel at ease almost instantly.
1	"I use to feel very anxious when visiting the doctor as a child. I often had no idea what to expect and I often wondered what would happen if they couldn't figure out what was making me sick. Today the anxiety that I faced as a child has been greatly diminished. My current doctor and his office is really great about setting forth a game plan. Before any exam happens I'll be told what to expect so I'm not going into anything blind. Once the exam is over I'm given options on the course of treatments that are available. There is still some small part of me that gets worried before I'm seen because I roll through the ""what if they can't figure out what's wrong with me"" bit in my head. I've come to discover that this is unfounded which helps with future visits."
-1	Waiting for the doctor to see me while being exposed to possible diseases from the other patients waiting. 
1	I am usually anxious about the visit especially when there is an examination, I get worried about the procedure and the results. 
-1	I feel what makes me  feel anxious is the unknown. Not knowing what the Dr. may  say or if they would take your issue seriously and try to find the best resolution possible for the issues you are having.
1	I am a germiphobe, and I really hate even going to a doctor's office. That is probably what makes me feel the most anxious. I am always a little worried they'll find something wrong with me, too.
1	Being 67 years old, I know that age brings about potential health issues.  Also being fairly healthy my whole life, the law of averages may rear its ugly head.  I know I do not always eat right and not exercise enough and I know the doctor will ask, I will be honest and he will prod me to do better.
1	Just the thought that i should of come sooner. I blame myself for putting it of. Its always a bit nerve wracking getting examined  when you think something could be wrong with you. 
-1	If he seems distracted or not really about getting my input about my situation. I don't have this issue with my regular doctor but occasionally I might have to see someone else.
1	Sometimes i get worried when visiting a doctor due to the fear of expressing myself and also anxious of knowing my health status. 
1	every patient feels a bit anxious or worried when they visit to their respective doctor because of the result of their health may be on either good side or on te negative one
-1	Sometimes when I don't feel like I can quite specifically or accurately describe what's going on. When I feel like my concerns are too vague.
-1	I'm anxious about there might be something wrong with my body. It's not about my doctors, at most time, they performed a great job
-1	I'm worried that are going to find something horribly wrong about my health.  I am scared to receive bad news.  I'm also concerned that the doctor will recommend treatments I am uncomfortable with.  Also I am concerned the doctor will be irritated if I question such treatments.  
1	I am always fearful about a bad prognosis. I am also always working to avoid high blood pressure so consequently doctor visits tend to send my blood pressure up.
1	I'm mostly uncomfortable having an unknown person examine my body.  This makes me anxious to be done with it as quickly as possible.
-1	My greatest concern when visiting the doctor's office is that I will be rushed and/or the doctor will not take my concerns seriously. I have a hearing loss and difficulty understanding individuals with strong accents. Therefore, this is also causes anxiety if I am meeting this doctor for the first time. 
-1	There is no benefit to worrying.  I completely agree and fully realize that most of my worries are ridiculous, but that does not make a difference; I still worry.  I've been trying to stop worrying my entire life.  It is uncontrollable. I have booked an appointment with my doctor, though I can already feel the anxiety building, and have been trying to distract myself.  I worry that he won't believe me, or something else.  It is embarrassing, and I feel bad about it.
1	I have a slight fear about needles and not a lot of tolerance with pain. I always have a feeling that if I have to go see a doctor I will need to have needles stuck in me and that makes me nervous. Also, doctors' offices and environments are often unpleasant and do not help one feel more at ease.
1	Don't like taking my clothes off. Don't like waiting for doctor. Don't like being weighed. Don't like being told to lose weight.
1	I have ha enough health issues in my life to get a sense of deja vu or flashbacks - I always have a feeling that something is about to pop up. And since I'm generally healthy, when I am at the doctor, it's usually for a pretty good reason.
1	Depending on the reason for the visit, the illness itself is enough to cause such extreme anxiety. Add in the process of divulging highly personal information to people you barely know and you have a recipe for tension.
1	A combination of mild social anxiety and worrying that something will turn out to be not right with me, for example, my blood pressure being too high or something like that. I care a lot about my health, so having it examined is a high-stakes thing for me.
1	I'm afraid it will be a complete waste of my time and money, and they will fail to figure out whats wrong with me or help me try to figure out some solutions.  I'll leave the doctors office poorer and no better off healthwise.  I also don't like it and worry about when it takes them a month or two to schedule mroe advance procedures like go see a neurologist to deal with right now problem.  I pay them copay to have them tell me to go see another doctor...
1	I usually worry about my health and having to interact and explain myself to doctors and nurses. Visiting a doctor's office is also usually a big interruption in my usual daily routine, which makes me anxious. 
-1	I usually don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, since I know I am in good hands.If necessary I know the doctor would refer me to someone who would be as caring  and efficient as her.
-1	If I have to get naked or show my crotch that makes me the most nervous.  If I have to get blood drawn that will also make me a bit nervous as I am not a big fan of needles.  My biggest hesitation when seeing a dr. is how much the treatment is going to cost.
1	I am worried that I might find out that I have a serious and expensive disease like cancer.  If I had cancer it would complete change how I live my life.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, but I have prayed a lot before going to one. Going to get the results back from blood tests has made me feel a little uneasy, because I wondered what my primary care physician was going to tell me about the results, but I know that I am healed by the stripes of Jesus and I knew that I was going to be alright.  I think just waiting for the results and wondering what they are can cause a little bit of uneasiness. 
1	I feel a little anxious when I go to the doctor because I know she is going to tell me that for my health I need to eat better and exercise.  I don't do those things and I know she will get on to me about it.
1	I am worried about the doctor telling me I may have a disease or a condition with no cure.  I dont like people examining me.  I cant afford medical treatment.
1	The fact that I might have something wrong with me but they will not notice it or even care to do a follow up on it. Also I can sense their lack of caring and that troubles me a lot as well.
-1	If is my first appointment for this event that I have never been in before and I am not sure what the doctor is going to tell me that I need to do or what the results may be so I will feel a bit nervous or worried
-1	I am rarely nervous or worried when I see him. Again this is because I have full confidence in him. The only time I am anxious is if they are going to take blood from me or I will be receiving a injection shot for something. 
-1	The only thing that makes me anxious is not knowing how much time I will have to wait to see the doctor. I usually have to wait 1-1/2 to 2 hours to see her despite having an appointment. Once, a few years ago, I missed an important meeting at work because I wrongly assumed that my doctor's visit would be over in about an hour; it ended up being 2 hours because I had to wait a long time to see her, and my actual time with her was about 15 minutes. 
-1	I feel that I have a pretty good bead on what is wrong with me medically.  I am never really expecting anything groundbreaking or life changing to happen or be told to me.  A doctors office visit for me is more of a chore then anything else.
1	Honestly for any physical exam it would be getting on the scale. It really sucks because I work really hard on my body and I have been gaining muscle so I know I am going to weigh more, but I don't want to. 
-1	In medicine, not everything is 100%, but very close. So naturally, when someone goes to their physician they are there for a particular reason, so I find it natural for one to feel anxious or worried because fear for the unknown. Iâm general, everyone needs to go see a doctor, for not only maintaining a healthy life, but preventing bad from occurring, and these types of feelings occur, along with excitement and pride when all comes out good. 
-1	My primary issue with having current Western medical practices applied to me is that medical schools do not address a wide enough spectrum of healing modalities. And if they do, they charge a lot for their services. Around here, MD/NDs charge far too much for me to afford. So, I'm left with the choice of visiting a doctor who is instructed in a more narrow treatment spectrum, which does not suit my approach to health. As a result, I'm worried and anxious, because I know how many doctors react if you question their advice.
1	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor is the fact that I might have a medical condition that will cost a lot of money to cure or a long time.
-1	The thing I am most worried about is getting sick from other people while at the doctor's office.  I usually take herbal supplements and colloidal silver to overcome this issue.  The other thing I get worried about is the doctor not listening to what I have to say and then brushing me off as it's time to go the next patient.
1	I am always anxious when it comes to an office setting. I feel like there could be anything wrong with anyone at any certain time and that is nerve wracking. I fear that I will hear the worst and have to go under surgery or something like that. 
1	Doctor's, Dentist's, They all make me anxious and worried. I'm not exactly sure WHAT MAKES me feel this way. Maybe the unknown? I just have a fear of doing things like this. Makes me very nervous!
1	That the doctor may find a tumor or tell me that I have a major health illness. Even if I do not trust what the doctor is saying, this is enough to scare me and make me feel like I'm going to die! I think the entire situation of being in a dr office is intimidating. I am not sure if this is designed on purpose but the environment makes you extra anxious.  The whole waiting period amplifies this. 
-1	There's always the worry that they will randomly find something serious that you did not have. I feel that everyone has this worry.
-1	I am often worried of the things that I will learn. I feel grim or hopeless at times and my doctor is there for me. They listen, explain and let me ven't without judging in any way. I am often scared to face certain things or news, but in reality, it's life and u can get thru anything.
-1	I have not been with this doctor for an extended period f time. I need to spend a little more time underneath the care of this particular provider, in order to have complete faith in them.
1	I am concerned that while conducting an examination he will find something seriously wrong with me. Usually I go right after getting blood work and I am always concerned that the findings will be very bad and it makes me extremely anxious
1	I am most worried about the cost and pain of treatment. I also worry about how much time I might have to take off from work if something is seriously wrong. I have had a few medical treatments that cost thousands of dollars and had me out of work for a few days.
-1	I always have a tiny worry somewhere in the back of my mind that whatever small ailment is bothering me is actually a symptom of something huge and very serious, like a tumor or something
-1	That they will find I have a serious condition that will adversely affect my lifestyle either due to treatments or illness. 
1	I worry about getting blood drawn, about being declared somehow more unhealthy and having to have more work done, especially procedures or accompanying meds that I can't afford.
1	My biggest fear is that I will receive news contrary to what I'm hoping for.  This doesn't have to be life-threatening, it could be as simple as finding out that a treatment must go on loner than anticipated.  Second to that is anxiety about not remembering to ask the right things or explain myself and my symptoms or condition fully, and then being misdiagnosed or wasting my time and money.
1	I think the waiting process in doctor's offices make me the most nervous, or anxious. For example, waiting in the lobby for an appointment, or waiting for shots or a lab result. The feeling of not knowing what to expect, or what the staff is going to tell you can be nerve-wracking.
1	When I get my blood pressure taken. I am getting older so hypertension is a real concern. I am trying to cut down on sodium intake and exercising more to keep myself health. But my job is somewhat stressful so my blood pressure goes up and down sometimes. Waiting to hear my result makes me feel uneasy.
-1	It makes me feel anxious when I'm in an appointment with him and he just goes away and spends a long time outside, leaving me just waiting, just looking the ceiling and worried about what problems I may have, it's really annoying and not a good action of him.
1	I always feel anxious when I go there and they have to run a lot of test on me and draw my blood.  It seems they can never find a good vein to draw from and end up sticking me in several places.  My arm s usually black and blood when they are done.
-1	I absolutely hate that most doctors base your general health on the BMI index, when not everyone's shape is cookie cutter, or fits the categories. I get anxious when doctor's bring up my weight, because rather than argue with them about it, I just let them talk.
1	 The thing that worries me the most is the bill I'll receive. Every passing minute I'm in that office, every procedure or drug prescribed is more money that I probably can't afford to pay even with insurance. I shouldn't have to focus on that but rather be focused on why I'm there in the first place. I seriously doubt I'm in the minority who think this way.
-1	I feel most worried when visiting a new doctor because I have to meet a new person and I don't know what to expect. 
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried about visiting the doctors office. I know my doctor and his staff very well. We live in a very rural area and know each other well. My doctor has never made me feel uncomfortable of like I wasn't important. I've never had to wait a long time to be seen or treated poorly. 
-1	there is always the chance of the unknown no matter how healthy you feel or how well you think you are doing following your health Regine.
1	I am usually concerned with having a high blood pressure. My father had White Coat syndrome, and I fear that I have inherited that from him. I do not like the sterile waiting rooms.
1	When I visit a doctor I feel the most anxious at the waiting. Waiting for the doctor to arrive and waiting to receive information about my condition. I wish the process was much quicker so I wouldn't have time to worry something awful might happen.
-1	I worry most that a disease may be found that is terminal or that I may need to have surgery. I also get nervous when tests are taken just because I hate waiting for the results
-1	High costs is a factor that always brings on a fair amount of worry .I haven't had any real major health issues/ I think it's a natural thing to be somewhat anxious and worried when it comes to my health.
1	I just have always been anxious when going to the doctor.  It feels like an invasion of privacy, even though I know it is for the best.  
-1	I feel most anxious about physical pain and examinations that may be ackward or embarassing. I've had two babies and found the exams to be surprising in their frequency and in the way they were not properly explained to me beforehand. I know it's routine to them but it's not to me.
1	I'm in pretty good health, but my family genes worry me when I go in. I feel as though that coupled with my sometimes bad diet is finally going to catch up to me. That is what worries me when I go in for tests and bloodwork the most right now as I'm getting older.
-1	the only thing that makes me anxious if when I have to get any type of shot or have to have my blood drawn. I think this makes me feel anxious as I never look forward to having this done. 
1	Visiting the doctor's office gets me focused on health issues I don't usually think about extensively but that just pass through my mind. It gets me thinking about what I might not be able to know about my health no matter how much I pay attention to my body and also that I might not be paying as much attention as I should.
-1	I rarely feel anxious or worried when i visit the doctor's office. The only time i might be anxious or worried is if i have received negative test results and am going in to discuss them. 
1	I know that it will be very rushed, and that I will almost certainly not get all of my concerns addressed during the visit.
-1	What makes me most anxious is the unknown. It isn't the actual checkup, it's the potential that something could be wrong with me or that a symptom could be serious. I don't do well with uncertainty so I need straight answers instead of wait and watch or unknowns.
-1	I have a great doctor I just don't like going in general so that tends to make me feel anxious, but he's efficient and answers my questions and I usually leave wondering why I was so stressed out
-1	There is a lot of anxiety simply in not knowing for sure if your specific doctor (or your doctor that day) has your best interest at heart. They could be having a bad day, and overlook a serious problem. They could not take your truthful complaints serious, and give you a false clean bill of health. There is so much uncertainty at any given moment, it is impossible to not be nervous, worried, or anxious. 
-1	Not too much makes me irreparably anxious when visiting the doctor's office. I don't like parts of examinations like pap smears, but I know preventative care is important and my doctor has never made me feel needlessly uncomfortable. 
1	I feel the waiting is the hardest part and I always don't know what to expect and will spend some time worrying if there is something more serious than I think going on. The longer I have to wait the more time I have to worry about things I probably shouldn't be worrying about in the first place.
-1	Finding out something bad might be wrong with me. One time I went over back pain and found out I had herniated discs in my back that also causes sciatica now
1	I fear they are going to find something terribly wrong with me. I fear that when they find something terribly wrong with me the treatment is going to be unpleasant. Even when I already know more or less what is wrong, I fear that the treatment is going to be unpleasant. I fear side effects of medication, and don't want to have to take more.
1	Sometimes something will be wrong with me, and we will have to wait for lab results to help figure out what is going on.  This does scare me the most.  Also, when I had one issue, it wound up later being diagnosed as bladder cancer.  The symptoms were very scary, but she did help calm me down and had me come back every day to make sure the symptoms were getting better.  
1	I'm of course worried about receiving bad news.  And also of feeling like the experience itself wasn't very good.  I want to feel important and respected, and I rarely feel that way at the doctor's office.
-1	What makes me anxious or worried is fear of the unknown.  What will she find?  Is there something wrong with me?  And what might the consequences be of any illness.  Basically, fear of the unknown.  I don't fear getting scolded for bad health behavior.
1	The first thing that comes to mind is just having an appointment period. Time is precious to me and I am generally kept waiting much longer than my time. I understand this can be necessary but I don't appreciate it every time.  Next, the fear of getting a flu or cold just by visiting the office makes me very anxious. I do worry about how the visit  will go such as if I will get bad news or a lecture. I really dread the lectures. 
-1	I get anxious while visiting the doctor because I want to make sure that everything is all right and that my pressure is not up. And that I don't need any medication to function.
1	I feel most anxious or worried when I have symptoms that might indicate a serious health condition. One of my doctor's nurses is a little unfriendly, so I feel anxious if she is the one who takes my vitals or draws my blood. Also, I feel worried about catching the flu from other patients at the doctor's office.
-1	I am most anxious about the cost of testing and treatment.  My copay is inexpensive, but some other areas of my insurance are not. 
-1	The idea that whatever is ailing me could be a terminal illness but those thoughts don't enter too often.
1	i feel it a little bit of anxious or worried and it is due to the uncertainty that i feel that what can happen and imagine the worst case .
-1	Anytime I go I am worried . Its just my nature . I am a worrier . There is a lot of family medical problems . So anytime I go I cant help but worry and think about the possibilities that I could have something major wrong with me . I am worried that the routine check up will end up with me having cancer or something horrible like that . It all makes me anxious . I am also worried that we might miss something . That I forget something that I wanted to talk to her about ,so we end up missing it . I feel like she does a good job but I worry a lot about dying young like my father . The whole thing is pretty nerve racking but so far so good . She makes me feel like everything is going to be ok .
-1	What makes me a little bit worried about visiting the doctors office is that he will find something wrong with me that I was unaware of.
1	Finding out that is something seriously wrong with me is usually the top worry of mine. You could be feeling fine but there may be an underlying issue that you didn't even realize was present. The cost of going to the doctor is also something that I worry about since my insurance is not that good.
1	The fear of being told something could be seriously wrong with my health is the main thing that stresses me out. Another factor is, being a person who has struggled with eating disorders, being told the number on the scale, whether it is higher or lower than I expect, gives me so much anxiety. After hearing the number, I don't think about anything else and I usually revert to bad behavior. Anything that involves my weight puts me on edge - it's very triggering for me and, unfortunately, hearing information about it form a doctor is very important, so it is inevitable that I become nervous during a visit.
1	That I will have to get shots or blood drawn. Those both make me nervous, or that someone will say something about my physical condition that is negative like I need to lose weight or I will get diabetes or something.
-1	If I have new or strange symptoms going on, I would feel worried. Since we have some diseases in our DNA, I am often afraid of what might occur.
1	I always imagine and fear the worst. When I had my diabetes problems I was very concerned about my long term life and how it would affect my lifestyle.  
1	Sometimes I am afraid they will tell me that what I came to the doctor for is a symptom of a serious disease such as cancer.
-1	When I go to the doctors office, I will often feel a bit anxious. This is mostly because there are plenty of illnesses that can come up unexpectedly and I'm afraid that something bad will happen to me.
1	I am anxious that my blood pressure reading will be higher than normal, because I definitely have white coat syndrome. I am worried that my concerns won't be taken seriously. I am also concerned that the exam will be cursory because the physician is pressed for time and sees many people every hour. Something might be missed or overlooked.
1	I am a very private person so talking to anyone about health issues usually causes me some anxiety.  Also, I am relatively healthy and only have to go to the doctor on rare occasions, so it's just not something I am used to.
-1	The most anxious or worried I can get when I go to the doctor is that  the doctor will say that is something wrong.  Or give me a hard time about weight or diet.
1	I just worry that they're going to find something really bad, that I'm going to be sick with something deadly. 
1	I feel most anxious about my weight when visit the doctor. I am always struggling with my weight and I hate to see the number on the scale, it fills me with dread. 
1	I have a hard time comprehending people talking at me. I can't focus no matter how hard I try. I usually try remember key words and look up stuff later. They just get so rushed I don't want to be rude and keep interrupting. So I feel useless sometimes. And passed off that after 35 years of the pain no has an explanation.
1	I always feel anxious when going to the doctor no matter if it is just for a physical and nothing serious. I always dread getting bad news.
-1	The unknown is the biggest source of worry or anxiety that I have whenever I have to visit the doctor's office.
-1	I always dislike going for my physical because of the thorough examination given,  and then having to have blood drawn.
1	I have generalized anxiety disorder so doctors appts for me while necessary tend to bring stress and anxiety. I become anxious about what my weight will be, what my blood pressure will be (most likely high due to the anxiety) etc. I just tend to be a very anxious person even when there is nothing to really worry about. 
-1	How I will be treated by the doctor and if the doctor will give me the right diagnoses. I hate to have to deal with doctors who believe their patients are too stupid to know whats going on with them and who will not listen to the patient.
1	That the doctor will be rude or one of the nurses will be rude. Im a little on the heavier side, and they have to weigh me every visit and its really frustrrating. I know its so they can keep me on track of weight and stuff but its really embarrassing stepping on the scale and every time i gain weight.
1	I have just always been uncomfortable about letting someone  look me over.  I know that it is sometimes necessary, but it kind of feels like an invasion.  That's just how I feel.
1	Not knowing if something is wrong with me or that something is wrong with me. Fear of receiving needles. 
1	The only time I am anxious   when I visit the doctor is when I am expecting bad news. It could be when I am expecting a bad result because of recent events or symptoms
-1	I feel anxious that I will find out there something is wrong with me that I was unaware about.  The sterile atmosphere in general also makes me feel a bit anxious.
-1	What makes me most anxious is not knowing what kind of results I will receive about my health. I worry that I may have something unhealthy or otherwise bad lurking in my body. I worry that I may have some disorder that may negatively affect my life unless I act fast. It's the uncertainty of my own health that makes me anxious.
-1	Nothing really makes me feel anxious at all when I go to the doctor suprisingly I have always had good checkups and no major health issues. 
-1	Getting in and out! I am disabled and for some reason the office does not have an automatic door. Once in though, I feel quite relaxed. I know my doctor is there to help me in a non-judgmental way and I feel quite safe in his hands. His staff is also very helpful and caring, which makes any visit quite stress free.
1	That something is seriously wrong or that there is not going to be a clear answer to a problem or a clear resolution. 
-1	I feel most anxious about finding out what is wrong with me and what I will need to do to treat it. I do not like not knowing what is going on with my health.
-1	Getting bad news,  or being misdiagnosed. The Doctor not taking your complaints seriously. Trying to remember what you need to say in the little time you get to be face to face with the doctor.
1	The comments the doctor will make about my body or lifestyle. The needle for the blood test and the results.
-1	When I visit the doctor's office, I have no reason to feel anxious or worried. I have been in good health my whole life and have had almost no health issues. However, if I were to feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, it may be due to the fact that I had no clue about what may be causing my symptoms.
-1	Usually the thought of what might be wrong. Sometimes my mind wanders to the worst medical conditions.
1	What worries me the most is the doctor finding something wrong with me that I didnt know about and that it potentially could be life threating. 
-1	I feel anxious because I don't like discussing my problems and having to answer questions. I also don't like not knowing what's wrong with me and dreading the worst.
1	I get worried when I think something is seriously wrong with me. I worry that it could be cancer or something else serious and expensive to treat
-1	I think I feel most anxious when I think I'll get back bad news. My something change since my last checkup, that can impact me in a negative way. 
1	That the doctor will tell me that I have a life threatening decease like cancer. I also don't like waiting and the doctor being late.
1	I get nervous at times because you never know what could happen. You never know what conditions may exist that you don't know about.
-1	My doctor does his best to provide a calm and non-threatening environment.  Worries or anxiousness comes from my own uncertainty about my condition.
1	The only time I get anxious as the doctor is when I am getting a shot or having some kind of test done.
-1	I go to the doctor when I am sick. I have never been for a wellness check or a physical. So I am already in at least some discomfort. I just want the problem to go away. Being sick in a place with other sick people is not comforting at all. I just want an answer. I know that the course of drugs will take a week or longer to really start working. So it all takes so long.
1	The main thing that causes anxiety for me when going in for a doctors visit is the financial consequences that might come from my visit. I have had bad experiences with insurance companies in the past and not being told upfront what I can expect to pay out-of-pocket. The other worry that arises is not knowing what kind of treatment I can expect and the time and effort that I might have to invest to treat the problem. 
1	"Discovering something unknown. Or something that I could have prevented but did not. I just have general ""white coat hypertension"""
-1	Stepping on the scale makes me a little anxious.  Generally, I am most anxious about the doctor finding something that could be harmful or affect my future.  For the most part, I feel like I have a good sense about what will happen when I visit the doctor's office.
-1	Just waiting in the waiting room and the chances of getting sick because you are at a doctors office make me uneasy but it does not really have to do with the doctor themselves 
-1	Wondering if there's any new condition or if I am as healthy as I try to be. Hoping nothing comes up that would require a prescription or any medication that I can't remedy myself. I just hope all of my exams have good and positive results meaning good health.
1	I have white coat syndrome so it happens without a lot of reasons. Sometimes, I fear that they will find something wrong or that I will have something wrong that they won't catch. Cost used to be an issue but I have great insurance now. 
-1	I don't really feel anxious when visiting the doctor. Sometimes there's a weird feedback loop when taking blood pressure where I'm almost nervous that if I'm feeling nervous about my blood pressure being high I'll get an inaccurately high reading, which makes me a little nervous. It's pretty dumb and the nurse and I laugh about it.
-1	I never feel worried about going to the doctors. I am going there to be healed so not anxious at all. Maybe a little worried about the price but not seeing them
1	The things that make me feel the most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor is I usually already know that it is going to be something bad, and I fear what I will be told and than the next course of action. I have many medical issues and most don't simply just go away on there own.
-1	The only things that makes me feel anxious or worried are the results I may receive, sometimes I personally go and google my symptoms ( which isn't always the smartest thing to do) and it usually gives me some of the worse diagnosis of what could potentially be ailing me. So when I get to the doctor's office my mind is always focused on those things I've read it could be. So I be anxious to get seen to be told what it really is and worried that it's one of the things I think it is.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office is think if I'm going to feel any pain or any discomfort.
1	I have intense anxiety anyway just normally anyway. Doctors certainly make it worse. A lot of it is simply discomfort around the stranger. Another part is the vulnerability. 
1	I think I always worry that I will have something unexpected wrong with me. There is such a bombardment of cancer awareness that it almost feels inevitable that we will all get it eventually.
-1	I tend to be relaxed when visiting the doctor's office, unless dealing with a unique situation that may carry anxiety with it - ie illness, new physical sympton etc.
-1	I am comfortable at the doctors office now that I have a doctor that I am confident in. Having a Dr who wont listen to me or who dismisses my symptomology is what makes me most uncomfortable at the dr
-1	I naturally become anxious when I see doctors. My blood pressure is normally on the lower side, although it is still normal. When I go to my doctor, my blood pressure rises to 120/80 which, again, is still normal, but not MY normal blood pressure when I am relaxed. Also, I am worried he will be disappointed in slow weight loss since I began losing weight in February 2017.
-1	If I'm not sure what is wrong with me. I will start overthinking it, or even worse using Web-MD before I go to get an estimate of what might be wrong. Nothing the doctor does makes me anxious, I make myself nervous.
1	I am always worried that a doctor will find something wrong that I never knew existed, like cancer or a sexually transmitted disease.  I fear the worst news.
-1	I am not usually anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office.  I don't usually have a reason to be.  I know what to expect with my doctors.  They are straight forward and honest with me.  They will go over all of my options with me and discuss pros and cons of all of those options to help me to make an informed decision so there usually isn't a reason to be worried.
-1	I'm always there about something that is out of my control, and I have to trust that the person I'm seeing might be able to help with the situation.  I usually wait until problems build up, so there is also that urgency.
-1	Being examined is an anxiety-inducing experience. There's a lot of uncertainty about what the results could be. Going to see a doctor is also anxiety-inducing in itself.
-1	I am most anxious that my blood pressure will be high, or they'll find something I wasn't aware of having.
-1	Most of the time when I visit the doctor for anything other than routine physicals, I don't always feel I know how my treatment will go. It seems sometimes I have left the doctor's office being no closer to healed than I was when I entered.
-1	"I feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I""m afraid that I won't be believed, they simply won't care about my problem or that my individual concerns or needs will be ignored simply so they can see more patients that day. I'm afraid, anxious and desperate when they ignore me and my symptoms. So, if my original concern isn't addressed then I usually leave feeling physically as well as emotionally unwell after that. Subhuman almost that I don't matter enough to listen to. Then I question why I spent money to be ignored and still have the same symptoms that I walked in with."
-1	What causes me anxiety at a doctor's office?  A request for a blood sample, or the need to have an IV.  I really do not care for needles or for blood draws.  Not sure exactly why, but both are something that I would prefer to avoid.
1	What causes me the most anxious and worried when visiting the doctor is both the chance of receiving very bad news and or receiving wrong information about my condition or lack of condition. Being misdiagnosed or not diagnosed with something i may need to be diagnosed with.
1	I am overweight and I know the doctor will ridicule me about it. It is also always uncomfortable to have an exam or get blood drawn. It is not something I look forward to.
-1	I feel shy around strangers or people I don't know well. Additionally, I do not like needles, so the idea of getting blood drawn makes me tense. 
1	Usually the thing that makes me most anxious is having to sit in a waiting room surrounded by sick people who are coughing and sneezing and being afraid I will catch something from them.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious is getting my blood pressure taken. I know I have good blood pressure but it always makes me nervous just in case this one time I don't. 
1	You never know what they may find.  I always fear the cost of follow up appointments and the potential time that will be wasted.  Definitely not convenient.
1	Even though I trust my doctor (and any of the specialists I see), I always get anxious about doctors appointments because there is always an element of unknown. There is always a chance they could discover something is wrong with you that is totally random and unrelated to what you came in for, and it could change your life. 
1	I feel anxious when waiting for test results. The uncertainty of not knowing what is going on with my body makes me worried. I also dread having examinations where the doctor must physically touch my body.
-1	I am afraid that they are going to assume my condition and put me on a regimen without really trying to work on finding the issue.  I do not feel that doctors really look into things correctly. 
1	If I'm going in for a check-up i would fear finding out something bad (i.e. diabetes, cancer). I also worry if they may have found something or if my physical condition is more serious that what i personally think. 
1	I just feel anxious having like ten minutes to get my questions/concerns answered. And I don't have a good relationship with any of the doctor's I've had. 
1	I'm afraid that my doctor is going to mess with my medications because they try that every few years.  I am concerned I am going to walk out with referrals to a bunch more doctors and/or more unnecessary testing.  
1	I feel anxious or worried in case something is seriously wrong. Although it is not better to be blind to an issue when it is time to visit a doctor, the fear of the unknown leads to more worry than just putting it off. 
1	Why not feel anxious?  I might have some sort of disease and I don't like anyone touching me period.  I hate going to the hospital it's a depressing place to be.
1	I am always scared they will tell me I am overweight first off. Then just the initial exam I am afraid that I will have some sort of disease that is really bad because I am terrified of death.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office is that I will be informed with information that details that I have a serious illness that may require drastic treatment or may have no treatment process that is successful at all. I do not like to take prescription medicines If I do not have too. I become fearful for my own health and would make decisions onwards that I hope will only benefit my health and help me move down a process of recovery. I would have faith in my doctor and hope that he/she takes the necessary precautions/procedures to help my recover from my illness as well. 
-1	The main thing that makes me feel anxious about going to the doctor would be if I were waiting for test results to determine if something was wrong with my health and what was wrong with my health.
1	I am worried that I will not understand what the doctor is talking about, especially if something is wrong with me. I am anxious about whether or not the doctor will take me seriously. 
-1	I hate shots. I am an adult and I just hate them. I get queasy and I know it is coming. I worry also about my insurance covering everything due to a medical bill in the past. 
1	I'm afraid i'm going to get a bad diagnosis. The anxiety and dread of not knowing the condition i'm in is the worst. Also i'm worried about what type of mood my doctor is in, or how experienced and thorough the nurse is. 
-1	Sometimes I worry about cancer or some other condition.  I am aware of a bunch of people I either know well or that are in my work/social circle that have had gall bladder problems.  I worry about that.  
1	I think it has to do with the waiting and all the thoughts and ideas that enter my mind. The longer i am waiting the more harder it is to stay calm. Feeling anxious and wanting to get it over with.
1	Not knowing what new problem may have been discovered from recent lab work. I'm always a little anxious about what my blood pressure reading will be.
1	I am most worried that I will be very sick because of an unwise activity I've engaged in or it will in some way be my fault. I do not want the doctor to judge me based on that. 
1	I feel most anxious when the physicians ask me questions but then act as if they don't believe what I am telling them, whatever it may be.
-1	I fear having something really serious be discovered about my symptoms. For example, a few years ago I had frequent migraines and my doctor suggested that I get further testing down just to stay on the safe side. I was afraid there was a tumor. 
-1	I think it's the atmosphere of doctors offices/hospitals that make me anxious. It always seems to be associated with health problems and that makes me feel that I have problems.
1	I worry that the doctor may miss something, or conversely, find something serious. I also worry that I will forget to ask the doctor about certain things.
1	i feel anxious with the waiting i suppose, especially if something is wrong i want to know what it is, how serious, etc. spending time in the doctor's office isn't what i would be doing out of choice
-1	That would be getting bad news that I have a terminal illness or issue. Also just the rooms and materials in the office make me very anxious.
1	I very nervous/ anxious to talk to him about my chronic pain. He gets very gruff and makes a mean face. I don't think Alabama believes in pain management. 
-1	The fear of finding out that there might be something more serious about my condition:). However, this is not always the case, it is only if I am seeing a doctor about a serious illness. 
-1	I am not anxious all the time, I was thinking more of a particular situation. I was having blood count issues. I had to keep going back for blood draws to see what my counts were at. one of the diagnosis for what i was going though could have been cancer. I was very nervous about getting those results
-1	Getting bad information that may cost me a lot of money or affect my life in the future. Having to go on a medication or something that may hinder my lifestyle in any way. 
-1	It's nothing in particular, usually. It's just a general concern that something could always be wrong that I'm not aware of. A doctor's office isn't usually a place you visit when things are going splendidly. 
-1	I don't have much fear or worry when I go to the doctor. I used to, before I started trusting Jesus. Now that I do trust Jesus, I give all my worries and concerns to him. I just go to the doctor for checkups, and I deal with whatever is said the best way I can.
1	I am old enough to know the probability for health and longevity, and also old enough to have experienced times when things did not work out the way we hope that they would. What makes me feel anxious is that the older I get the more likely I will be told that I am going to die by a doctor based merely on probabilities.
1	When I have been examined my overall health condition, especially I have been screened for cancer, I felt most anxious and worried whether I had some symptom of cancer or uncured disease.     
-1	There's a variety of mild anxiety. For example, maybe there's nothing much wrong with me, and it was stupid to go to the doctor. Maybe there's something really wrong. Things like that.
1	I guess just generally I don't want to find out that I'm sick because I don't have any money. I know that hospitals do tend to lower the costs for people with extremely low income like myself, but I'm scared to have to deal with that. 
-1	Just the thought of going to the doctor always has made me nervous and a fear of needles and such. Once I am in and see the doctor I am fine. 
-1	I have to be weighed and I never lose weight.  I have to let the doctor feel me in places I would rather not have anyone touch.  I have to reveal myself to an almost complete stranger.
1	The possibility of my doctor diagnosing a health condition that could possibly change my life causes a lot of anxiety for me. I am also a very private person and do not like having someone probe my life and body during an exam.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried at all when I go to the doctors. I might feel a little upset if there if a long wait and this might also make a little anxious.
-1	Waiting for them to examine me and tell me something is wrong with me.  While waiting, my mind jumps to crazy conclusions like I am dying of some disease or I have tumors growing somewhere.  These thoughts kind of make my heart rate go up and he ends up thinking i have high blood pressure.
1	Usually it's just dealing with the doctor and potentially telling them that they're wrong if they were to simply give me medicine with a thousand sides effects that hide the real problem one might have. 
1	mainly not knowing what might be found since in our family history we have a little bit of everything that has come up in one form or another. 
1	That he will find something wrong that is serious. I'm at the age where that could happen at any time, and I've seen it happen too many times to my friends. So I worry about it every time I go.
-1	I am always worried that I will not get a good bill of health.  I have some weight to lose and know that I might be confronted about that and what I should be doing.
1	Mainly worried they will be giving me bad news. A lot of bad diseases, cancer, heart conditions, etc, are in my family. 
-1	I can't explain it.  I just don't particularly enjoy then environment and I have a low level uncomfortable feeling about it all.
1	When you visit a doctor's office, it's usually because something is wrong, unless it is for preventative purposes. The anxiety and worry are related to the uncertainty of your condition and the uncertainty of whether it can be treated, or what kind of treatments are available. There is anxiety and worry when visiting a doctor's office because the doctor might not be able to help you, they may not give a lot of time for your visit and rush to see another patient when you still feel unsure about how to proceed. The doctor might not have confidence in treating you and that is also scary.
1	I am worried that the doctor might inform me of some horrible health news that will ruin my life. I am worried about getting some horrible news that could mean the end of my life.
-1	Whenever i feel anxious seeing my doctor its generally due to me not knowing how much information or what information specifically i should release to her even though im fully aware i should tell her everything due to HIPA and the confidnetiality it provides. I still have anxiety however with certain things like mental state etc. 
1	What makes me feel anxious is being diagnosed with an incurable illness such as Cancer or MS. Also, if they are not able to diagnose what's going on with me
-1	While logically I know that there's likely nothing wrong with me, the last visit I had involved being diagnosed with PTSD. It was a bit of a soul-crusher to have had that confirmed, because I sort of knew that I did for the month leading up to the visit.
-1	when they are talking about serious health problem. a words from him that might lead to a bad health issue. testing my blood for std and other lifetime problems
1	I never know what they will find wrong with me.  Or if they will find a cyst and want to do more tests that cost more money. 
-1	I am mainly anxious when i visit a dr because I am afraid I am going to have bad news leaving. I am terrified that I am going to be diagnosed with an illness I will not be able to treat or get proper treatment for.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's. I have enough experience with doctors that I am comfortable that I can ask for and get what I need.
1	I often feel like they will rush me and not listen to what I have to say or that they will write me off as a hypochondriac.
1	Mainly because I have awful anxiety, I worry about everything so it's in my nature to worry about a million different things.  Also, I've been battling against my weight for a while.  I just never know if my doctor is going to be proud of my progress that I've made since I've last visited or if he's going to be disappointed that I'm not losing weight faster.
1	When I go for my yearly exam and it involves female stuff I hate it. It is uncomfortable for the patient and for the Doctor. Plus it is somewhat painful. Then there is the breast exam. I don't like anyone seeing me undressed much less touching me in a private area. I am always so relieved when it is over and I am walking out all dressed!
-1	If I believe beforehand that there is something seriously wrong with me BEFORE I talk to the doctor, then I might feel anxious as I wait to see him and talk to him. But that is rare. I  do not usually feel anxious while I am talking to the doctor. I usually just let him examine me and listen closely  to what he tells me. But I do not tend to overreact to things. If he , on the other hand, told me Ihave some deadly disease that cannot be treated, obviously I would feel rather anxious.
1	Sometimes I worry that something may be seriously wrong with me, in which case I would rather not know. But it makes me anxious not knowing, so I have to know if anything might be wrong with me.
-1	I donât feel nothing at all so I donât know how to answer this question... will get through whatever the outcome is 
1	I am a person that gets worried every time i go to the doctor.  I'm just afraid i will hear something bad while there.  Normally, everything is just fine and once i get into the examination room i start to relax.  Maybe, its all the other people in the waiting room, the long waits, ect that make me anxious.  
-1	I feel anxious about the probable poking and prodding that will take place, and the inevitable disdain that the doctor will evoke once I start making suggestions that might contradict something they had stated. I also worry about the possible copay. 
1	I am always more worried before a procedure.  A checkup doesn't really bother me, but if I have to have surgery or blood taken or something like that, then I become very anxious.  I worry about what will happen during and after the procedure and how I will feel.
-1	I'm afraid that they aren't going to really listen to what I have to say.  I am afraid that they will give me a generic answer to my problems instead of asking me more questions just to make sure it isn't a more serious problem.
1	I fear that I will be sick and that insurance will not cover it. I feel that the offices make me sick. I also think the doctor wants to get me in trouble with the insurance company so I lose my plan.
1	I tend to be a very anxious person.  When I go to the doctor's office, I tend to assume the worst for my health or that I have something wrong with me when it tends not to be true. 
1	Worried that he will deliver bad news. I am at the dr to make sure everything is ok, but i worry about the discovery of something negative. 
1	At age 72, and having a number of health issues, I accept the fact that time is running out for me.  I always feel tense with each medical exam as the likelihood of the onset of a potentially lethal condition would not be surprising at my age.
1	It is the fear of being judged and of not knowing if they will find anything wrong with me. Perhaps they will judge my lifestyle, or perhaps they will say I am eating all the wrong things or not exercising enough.
1	I have social anxiety, everyone makes me anxious. But being in a place that knows you are having difficulties makes it worse. Nurses, PA's, Doc's all rushing around coming in and going out.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious about visiting a doctor is a general anxiety of being in public places in general, along with the likelihood of being undressed. Also, I usually only visit a doctor is there is a problem, so there is some anxiety as to what the problem may be.
1	My biggest fear is that of being told that I have an incurable disease or only have a few months to live.  I think my fear is that my mother died when I was young and my father was very sick as I was growing up.
1	Just listening to what my Doctor is telling me about my impairments. There is usually never any improvement and no signs of possible or potential improvement. It is essentially my Doctor telling me that I will probably have these issues for the remainder of my life. 
1	That the doctor will detect something that could be life threatening at the least. Even if it not life threatening if I was told that I would have to radically alter my life style such as activities or diet I would find it as a great disruption. At least at first.
-1	Always makes me nervous to see a doctor, although my health is quite good.  Probably left over from child hood when I would have to go because of something stupid I did.
-1	I am just generally anxious about what he will find or that he will discover I have been doing something wrong. I am not worried about his actions or thoughts but, my own and chance happenings.
1	I am always worried about my weight and if the doctor is going to say something about it. I don't like talking about my weight. 
-1	What makes me the most worried when i visit the doctor's office is the possibility of having negative results. Knowing that i take care of myself and am in good health, i should not as much but still. Things manifest in healthy people all the time.
1	What makes me most anxious or worried is that they will find something unexpected or recommend an invasive procedure.
1	I am usually a little worried that they will find something wrong. Especially since so many of my recent visits have been prenatal - I always worry about the health of the baby. 
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I am most worried when I discover a reason for which I will need to see a doctor
-1	Waiting. Once I am back in the exam room I'm usually ok. The only other thing was expressing how bad I felt knowing it was something other than the flu or general fatigue and worry about not being able to express it because I am such a strong person that doesn't show weakness so its hard for me to really break down and let people know I feel horrible.
-1	Depending what the visit is for would determine how anxious or worried I would be. I think what makes me most worried would be being concerned the doctor would find something I was unaware of, or something potentially serious. This worries me sometimes.
-1	I have an eating disorder, and if a doctor or nurse is new to me, I sometimes worry I'll get unwanted and unhelpful advice about diet and exercise. I don't like looking at the scale, either, for related reasons. 
1	i always feel like i'm going in for a test I didn't study for. I usually have a list of questions i want to ask and in my nervousness i forget them all. 
1	I am afraid after certain tests are run, I may be diagnosed with some incurable dread disease. I would feel helpless and very upset to receive this news.
-1	The only time I feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is when I know that the only solution to fixing the problem is surgery. 
1	What makes me most worried and anxious is that they'll find something seriously wrong with me, like cancer.
-1	Some doctors do not value patients' time. They never see patients at the time of the appointment and they do not offer anything to read.
1	The overall institutional feel makes me feel uncomfortable. I also do not like sitting by myself in a quiet room for thirty minutes before the doctor comes in, giving me ample time to worry though every possible thing they could say. 
-1	The thing that probably makes me feel the most anxious is when my doctor finds something potentially wrong that I didn't know about, especially if it could potentially be a really big deal.  At one point he was worried about a mole I had on my skin being potential melanoma so he removed it and had it tested.  The test came back negative, but the roughly 1 week it took to get the results was nerve-wracking.  
-1	I don't usually feel upset or worried when visiting my doctor's office.  The last time I had blood work done I was a little nervous to get the results of the tests back, but they made me feel at ease and told me ways to improve my numbers and things I could do to better my health overall. 
-1	I feel neither anxious nor worried when visiting the doctor's office. In fact, I feel like the doctors are not going to look hard enough or listen intently enough and under- or misdiagnose me.
1	I feel the most anxious when I have symptoms that I haven't been able to cure on my own and that's what's bringing me to the doctor's office in the first place. 
-1	Just the atmosphere in general. I have no real issues or reasons to feel anxiety. It's probably more from childhood feelings or the idea of a hospital.
1	I hate visiting the doctors office because 1) I hate getting on the scale. 2) I hate getting shots or my fingers pricked. 3) The nurses are usually rude. 4) My doctor does not know much about me. I feel like he knows my name but does not care about me or does not care much about my health. 5) My doctor has not helped me get the right type of anxiety medicine that I have been wanting. All of it makes me tired and I just need something that calms me down.
-1	I feel anxious about any examination in general. Being checked out physically can be a little stressful for me. I don't like being poked and prodded. 
-1	There are a few things that could make you feel anxious when visiting a doctor's office.  A couple things that make me anxious or worried is how much the copay is going to be and if I paid my  Deductible yet or in my going to get charged a ton of money.  The next thing I worry about is sitting in the waiting room with all the sick people.   Another thing that makes me anxious on the way to The Doctor's office is how long the wait is going to be in the waiting room.  Also if your blood pressure is going to be high when you 1st get there because all the waiting.
1	I feel anxious and worried when i will have to visit Doctor as I am afraid if any other deseases may come to my notice apart from the one for which i wished to consult doctor and also if the doctor confirms my ailment as the one which cant be treated or there is no treatment that leads to frighten me.
-1	The fact that they can get very intimate into my personal life, both physically and emotionally.  They also can sometimes be slightly vague with what their thinking is on my health.
-1	I'm always worried about finding out that something is wrong with me that I didn't know. There's always a fear that I may go to the doctor for something routine and find out something catostrophic
-1	I hate getting on the scale. I never want to know how much I weigh, and I always tell the nurse not to tell me. That's probably not a great idea. My blood pressure is almost always good, but I get nervous that perhaps on a particular visit, it will be high. 
1	I believe it is all pyschological because most of the time when you go to the doctor something is wrong. So then when you go for a regular visit those same feelings come back. The ones you had when you were sick, injured or didn't even know what was wrong  in the first place. Some of the uncertainty is also worrying about my loved ones if something was in fact wrong with me. What also contributes to the uncertainty is not understanding medical terminology and if whether or not what you are being told is actually correct.
-1	nothing because I trust that my life is in good hands with my doctor so there is no use trying to worry myself and have worse nerves than i need for nothing
1	I feel the most anxious about feeling judged or criticized by the doctor. I'm afraid of them blaming me for my conditions or just not listening or taking me seriously. I'm afraid of feeling lectured to, disrespected, dismissed and invalidated by them. 
1	I am very uncomfortable when going to any doctor. I don't like people touching me and going to the doctor it is usually a given that there is going to be someone touching me. 
1	"What asinine charges are they going to bring up? Am I going to be charged because they used a gauze pad to cover a wound (should I have brought my own)? Are they going to find cause to put me through the most useless, expensive tests, because they ""feel"" there is some issue worth investigating? Are they even going to bother prescribing the correct medicines, or has some drug company paid them an exorbitant fee to prescribe their medicine above all others, even when that medication is unnecessary/not fit for the condition/better options are available?"
1	I feel anxious or worried when I feel I haven't followed the doctor's instructions properly or have been lax regarded my own health. When I am disappointed in myself, I am anxious in anticipation of telling the doctor the problem, because I don't want him to be disappointed in me.
1	I do not enjoy waiting to be seen and all the little things that must be done (weight, temperature, blood pressure). 
-1	I don't usually have fear when visiting the doctor. I only get anxious if I have to get a shot. Those occasions are few and far between.
-1	Usually it has to do with seeing how much weight I have gained. Other than that, my anxiousness could only be due to the unknown. But I have full trust in my PCP. 
1	The lack of compassion. Most doctors don't care about the patient. They just want to push drugs on you and get you out of the door instead of reviewing your background and the things you have tried that was either successful or failed. We have records for a reason and no one seems to read them. I hate having to start from scratch with each doctor I see. 
1	Getting injections of any kind. As well as x-rays and cat-scans. talking about cancers of any kind. i dont like how many germs and other possible parasites are  around the inside of docters office.
1	Worried that they will find something wrong that would require expensive treatments or hinder my standard of living that would put a burden on my family and friends
-1	Uncertainty about potentially bad things.  Moles that could be cancer, things of that nature.  When I don't understand or know what is going on with my own body, that brings anxiety.
-1	It depends what i am going in for. i think that if i am already unsure about something regarding my health, the unease will already be there.
1	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is the initial greeting and how the conversation starts off because lately I haven't been taking the best care of myself, so I'm always really nervous to find out how much worse things have gotten with either my weight or cholesterol numbers.
1	I get most anxious because I don't know what the outcome of the appointment will be. I also don't know how the doctor will treat me while I am there.
-1	I've come from a history of cancer in my mothers side of my family. I would feel worried of anxious if they would diagnosis with something in that range. I have small children so I feel that I have to be here to guide them in to their adulthood.
1	I'm not sure what I get so anxious or worried about, I just hate doctors offices. From the time I walk in (even if it's just to get a vaccine), my blood pressure elevates. I think that it stems from a time when I had a life threatening condition but I didn't know and went into the appointment thinking it was something simple, but instead I was rushed to the emergency room and spent several days in the hospital. 
-1	for example, a pain that I have never felt in my body, the delivery of blood tests, that the doctor who regularly treats me does not treat me, I find out that something is not right with my body.
1	Whenever I'm in a doctor's office, hospital, or clinic setting, I just have an uneasy feeling in general.  Doctor's offices and hospitals make me nervous as I associate them with health problems and pain.  I often feel worried when waiting for results as I'm nervous to see if they have good or bad news for me regarding my health.  I usually rely on a doctor's demeanor or personality to help comfort and relax me in these types of situations.
-1	I feel most anxious that they might tell me something is wrong with my condition when I thought everything had been fine. I worry about over-prescription instead of fixing the root issue, I think we medicate far too much in this society.
1	I worry that I will find out there's something wrong that's more significant than I expected.  I also have had several illnesses where it took doctors a while to figure out what the problem was.  So, sometimes I worry that I won't get an answer/resolution/treatment plan.
-1	The feeling that they will judge me for my life choices, even if I strongly believe they are the right choices for me. I don't tend to do things willy nilly. I try and do my research and make sure I have informed opinion or choice in something I personally participate in. I don't always eat right, and even if I eat bad once a  month, I would feel like I need to justify my decisions to my doctor. I also have a general sense of anxiety, so any unknown situation will make me worries, usually for no good reason. 
1	Having someone who I do not see often look me over concerns me. I get anxious when they check my heart rate and such which probably contributes to my heart rate going up. They sometimes try to talk while checking my heart rate which makes me more anxious as I have to participate in a conversation.
1	I have social anxiety so i have difficulty communicating at times. Having someone ask me personal questions or see me in a vulnerable position can make me feel uneasy. 
1	My genetics/family health history is not great so I'm always a bit worried something's going to hit me out of nowhere as I get older.
1	I often worry that they will find something seriously wrong with me or that I am going to die.  Even though I feel ok, I always dread that they might find something that canât be cured or they canât help to heal.
1	I am always worried something else will be wrong with me than just what I am going in for...or that whatever I have is worse than what I think. Additionally, I am always worried about remembering the things I want to ask, and if I will have enough time to ask the questions I have. So it makes me really anxious and worried. 
1	I worry about some of the tests that are done, such as taking blood and maybe they would have to give me a shot.
-1	I just always wonder if I'm in worse shape than most others seen by the doctors.  It makes me evaluate the uncomfortable aspects of my health and my body.
-1	It is simply that factor of uncertainty. Even if you feel healthy you can never truly know if there is something wrong that can't be seen or felt. You always want to hear that you are healthy but you can't know if they are going to find something unusual.
-1	The unknown makes me anxious and worried.  Not knowing what to expect or what the doctor will say in regards to an issue I've had.  I spend too much time researching online about various illnesses and going to see a doctor about it makes me very anxious.  No one wants to be given bad news so, not knowing exactly what will be said is very nerve-racking.
-1	When i go to the doctors office my main worry is whether or not im going to be getting a shot. I do not like needles and really hate getting a shot or giving blood. 
1	I know that he is going to complain about my weight.  Then he is going to tell me that his wife put him on a diet and how small his plate is.  He will then tell me that his wife is blond and beautiful and that she knows what is best.  Then he will talk about his need to still lose ten pounds so that his wife will be proud of him.....every time I go see him.....same story.....
1	What makes me most anxious is the thought of something being seriously wrong with me. I avoid going to the doctor as much as possible just because I really do not want to know if there is something wrong with me.
1	I think it's just the stress of being there and seeing 5 different people including the doctor, who all do different things and can't answer my questions or come and go too fast for me to ask
1	That I am surprised of his decision, I want to trust my doctor, I want to know that he thinks about my case and tries to help me not thinking of his financial profit. The times are changing and humanity is so important for this profession. I worry every time how expensive will be the next prescribed medicine and what are the side effects, I try to read everything carefully and when read the long list of side effects I become more and more frustrated. Sometimes the doctor is thinking about something else and doesn't listen to me, I have to repeat what I have said, that is confusing. 
-1	I worry some about pain or invasive physical procedures. I worry about something serious being discovered. I worry about encountering new germs and getting sick from visiting the doctor's office!
-1	I feel anxious or worried because you never know what is going to come out of that visit. For one, I battle with high blood pressure. And at times my pressure would be elevated and others not. So when I go and see my doctor it always concerns me because one day Iâm taking pills and the next day I am not. Itâs nerve wracking even though I am considered healthly based off my physical exams.
-1	I do not feel worried when I go to the doctor.  I believe in a simple and necessary procedure that does not require any additional alarm.
-1	I am most worried that the doctor is going to find something wrong with me that will require medicine or hospitalization. I also don't enjoy talking about my weight with the doctor.
-1	That the doctor will find something in a scan or in blood work that would lead me to making life or death decisions. I don't think I would be able to handle that right now in this day in age with everything else that is going on . 
1	Needles, blood and going to the doctors really stress me out. I can withstand pain, but seeing blood and needle scare me a lot. The thought of the needle piercing through my skin and drawing my blood out. I had a complete check out at one time long ago to determine the cause of my vertigo. My primary care doctor sent me to this lab. They took 4 tubes of blood from me. The worse part, they told me not to eat anything prior to the blood drawn. I almost faint. I was dizzy, and feel like vomiting. The nurse me to laid down and rest afterward. It was so crazy. 
-1	I think the things that make me feel anxious or worried is the doctor coming back saying something is wrong with my health. I also gets a little worried when he's going over test results and finding out I'm not doing recommended suggestions like exercise or eat righg. I worried that im gonna get fussed at by my doctor for being hard headed.
-1	The results of tests or blood work and knowing the possibility of something major could be going on. 
1	Just the overall atmosphere tends to get to me. It's never set well with me, and I doubt that it ever will.
1	"I think what makes me feel the most anxious is when I don't know what's wrong with me but my gut is telling me that I know more about what is actually wrong than what my doctor knows.  Sometimes I wish instead of just treating a million different symptoms, they'd just treat the cause or say ""Look honestly, I don't know what's wrong"".  "
1	I am afraid i'm going to get yelled at for something I have or have not done to take care of myself.
1	I had thyroid cancer in the past and I need people who will pay attention to what I am saying and treat me as a patient and not as a disease 
1	I feel anxious because of potentially being told some bad news. I also feel anxious at potentially having more of my time wasted by the purposefully inefficient system they have.
-1	I'm not a worrier and I'm not overly anxious but I think anytime I go to the doctor it's for very good reason - certainly not just a cold. So when I arrive, I am expecting something somewhat serious. Not cancer or some terminal diagnosis but something requiring treatment. 
-1	I know I am not in the greatest health. So when I go to the doctor's office I am quite worried that she may end up giving me bad news. I also have a family history of heart trouble, so I am very scared about that. 
-1	I feel most anxious if I need to have test done and need to wait for the results. I feel most worried if I am called in for a follow up appointment that I was not expecting.
-1	I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorder so it is something I struggle with in my day to day life.  However, going to the doctor sometimes causes my anxiety to increase just because I feel shy and awkward in the situation. 
-1	Not being able to know if something is wrong with me even though I feel quite healthy.  There could be something internal that we don't know and after doing blood tests are the times when I feel the most anxious to get the results back.
1	That something will be wrong, that a slight twinge or pain I've had for a long time will turn out to be something terminal. And even though I've tried to be healthier, and do right by my life, and improve...that it all will be meaningless because I suddenly have some horrible disease (cancer, illness, etc.) that will cut my life short before I can get it back on track.
-1	I am overweight, so it just makes me anxious to have to weigh-in and discuss my weight with my doctor. It also makes me uneasy when I have to do things like pull up my shirt to have my stomach checked. 
1	Sometimes I had white coat syndrome. This is when I went to the doctor's office my blood pressure would be fine and then she would take my blood pressure and it would be elevated.
1	First off, I am generally an anxious person, so that doesn't help.  Mostly for me, it relates to the fact that I am going because something is generally wrong, or I am looking for medical advice.  When I either know or suspect that something is wrong, but I do not know what, it easily makes me anxious.  Combine that with the fact that I always have some sort of idea how the visit will go, but having the visit never go that way, I get easily anxious about the visit.
-1	I dont like when people touch me.. and even though i know him, i dont know him on a personal level like that. plus the germs at the doctor really bother me. 
1	What makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office is wondering how I am being judged by the doctor. The doctors and nurses are human too and it is embarrassing if something happens to me that does not normally happen if someone had taken care of themselves better. Like going to the dentist for example and having bad teeth because I donât brush everyday and could be prevented if I werenât so lazy. Or getting a UTI or a yeast infection because I was holding my pee for too long when I shouldnât have or not wiping myself properly.
-1	My health is pretty good so there isnât anything that I am really concerned about. I guess just getting my yearly physical. I hate getting that every year.
-1	Just wondering how things are going to go. If there's something wrong with me. I don't want to come out with bad news but most of my visits are pretty good. I stay real healthy and workout a lot.
-1	I generally do not feel too anxious when I visit a doctor. The only anxiety I feel, is if the problem is worse that I had imagined. But overall I do not feel worried. 
-1	Nothing. It's better to know than not to. I tend to think that mostly good things happen to me in life, because has been my experience thus far, so that is how I approach all situations...including visits to the doctor.
-1	It depends on the examination, but I am very self conscious of my body shape, and worry they will judge or laugh behind my back. 
-1	I am also worried and anxious that something is going to be wrong with me.  I'm just afraid for the worst care scenario.
1	You never know what they are going to find. Maybe they find something bad that always makes me very nervous.
-1	I am anxious or worried when I google symptoms myself and work myself up over what could be. I get worried that I may be sick with something contagious, especially when I am busy at work, because I often have to be at work to get certain things done. I also do not like being contagious because I worry I will get other members of my family sick.
-1	The unknown answer of what might be the issue. Unless Army doctors- then its the worry of laziness causing further harm. 
1	Finding out what is actually wrong with me. And just having to tell them all my business. I'm not the most social person.
1	If ever I am at a doctor's office, it is normally because I am experienced an unexplained medical issue. I am always worried about what could be wrong. I am a worst case scenario type of person. I always assume the worst and come prepared to hear the worst, whether that is true or not. I also get worried that I will leave the office without many answers as to what is going on. I typically have great blood pressure, but as soon as they take it at the doctors office, it is always much higher due to my nerves!
1	Just get anxious that they may find something wrong with me that will change my way of life. I also feel like there is a good likelihood of me getting sick from other sick people when i go to the doctor
1	I always feel like the doctor is going to look at me weird or find something that is wrong that I wasn't aware of.  
-1	"The thing that makes me most anxious is when I do not believe my concerns are being addressed. For instance, a doctor did not want to discuss my ankle problem during a ""well woman examination,"" and gave me a lecture about this. She said I'd need another appointment. I wanted to ask one or two quesions before I agreed to do that and she cut me off. The ankle pain was having a significant effect on my quality of life."
1	"I guess I am most worried that something will be seriously wrong with me, because I don't have time to be sick. Also, I am overweight--not more than 15-20 pounds--but some doctors make nasty remarks about it. I had one male doctor ask me, "" How do you expect to find a lover when you're fat?""."
1	There is an element of wanting to stay healthy and be on track.  Thoughts might go to the measures you've taken such as exercise and diet to stay healthy.  Have these been adequate or is more required, and will you now be able to accomplish what will be asked of you?
-1	I'm most worried that they will find something very seriously wrong that I had no idea was going on with my body.  There are many stories of people finding out they have cancer or other diseases when it's too late, and they never had symptoms.
1	Because of my pre existing condition I suffer extreme fatigue, yet so many of the doctors want to prescribe me meds that have fatigue as a side effect, like gabapentin. I have to explain that I won't take medication that will fatigue me because I have a small child to take care of. I can barely function as it is with my level of disability, I don't want things that make it worse. Also I have a liver issue Gilbert's syndrome, that affects how I process medication. I've had weird side effects, for example to stemetil for nausea and was told by my doctor they only saw that in children or people with compromised liver enzymes. I have had bad reactions to all types of anti depressants from tri cyclics through SSRIs, which caused me in the former to be almost comatose and dissociated to in the later case have uncontrollable muscle spasms. I feel disbelieved by doctors and dread seeing them because they always want to give me drugs that give me adverse effects. The drugs that don't bother me so much they won't prescribe. For example NSAIDs completely mess up my stomach and acetaminophen is bad for my liver, so the best drug for pain relief for me is a small amount of codeine, not tramadol, not vicodin, not percocet, all the artificial opioids make me hallucinate, but codeine does not. However physicians wont prescribe codeine to me. I have complex over lapping conditions and none of my doctors talk or communicate with each other. I see a neurologist, a gastroenterologist, a urologist, an ent doctor, a breast specialist, an ob gyn. I get overwhelmed with all the advice and the lack of effective treatments for my diseases.
-1	I'm currently still young, so there's not much for me to be worried about. My biggest concern is that there's some rare disease that I may one day develop, or that I get a family related health illness. Apart from that, I just worry that anything at all may have occurred and that I'm not a fit human being anymore. There's no real reason for me to be worried, and I understand that, but at the same time there's still a small sense of discomfort that I have. 
1	I am a generally anxious person and any interaction with a doctor makes me feel uncomfortable. I am uncomfortable with my body and with the shape I am in so that plays into it as well. Mostly, I just feel like a freak and my problems are unusual or like the doctors are judging me and the shape that I am in. 
1	I am afraid that a recurrence of a disease might occur. I am also allergic to many antibiotics, so any time that I have an infection, I am afraid that I will have a reaction if I am taking a new antibiotic. It is just a relief when the doctor tells me what the problem is and that it can be easily treated. 
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried.  I am prepared to accept anything that comes my way.  The only way I will be able to stop giving my murderis ex 65% of my only income, SS, is to die.
1	I am most worried about the wait being too long. It would be great if they used a ticket system so we do not have to wait, crowded in an area where there might be germs left by sick people.
1	I'm worried that they'll find something really wrong with me or that they'll say that I'm worse off than I think I am.  I'm also not a big fan of needles, and actively try to avoid getting stuck with one.
1	Generally do not know exactly what is going to be done.  The rush of an appointment is so out of proportion to home much of your day had to be arranged to be there.
1	It is mainly the fear of not getting any answers to my questions.  This as well as having my body examined by a somewhat creepy doctor who seems interested in me.
-1	I am usually not worried...just the awkwardness of say, a pelvic exam, or being in one of those glamorous paper gowns. I am not anxious about my health since I am only there for routine checkups.
1	I sometimes fear the doctor will provide me with bad news about my health, or no news  at all. Either way, I do not wish to pay large medical bills for these types of outcomes.
1	I have anxiety disorder so it's mostly just that. any kind of appointment makes me anxious in general so that doesn't help. 
-1	I feel anxious about a potential upsetting diagnosis at times especially when a concern could be a symptom of a serious ailment like cancer
1	I feel anxious about what the problem may be, what the treatment options would be, and any recovery time. I worry about my blood pressure, heart rate, and weight, even though I've never had problem with any of those three. The thing that makes me most nervous is trying to explain to the doctor my illness or pain. I always feel like I'm being judged and I can't explain myself well enough.
1	I am always nervous around doctors because If I am at the doctor it is because something is wrong with my health that I have not been able to address by myself. That being said, I also am just nervous around unfamiliar people in general, and as a young and fairly healthy person, all doctors are unfamiliar. 
1	I worry a little about my blood pressure because it runs high in my family but then I also know that if you worry about it, it will raise the pressure. So there is a bit of a feedback loop that goes on where I worry that I am worrying and it will then raise my BP. I also get a little nervous when they do the cancer checks. I know that its very unlikely because I am young and healthy but I had several family members that died of cancer growing up and seeing them deal with that disease is very scary and I really hope that I go a different way. 
-1	I just don't like being in a place that has sick people around since I get sick easily. I don't get extremely worried, but the thought of getting sicks is always just sitting in the back of my mind.
1	Sometimes not knowing what might happen. What if something is abnormal and It turns out to be something bad.
-1	I feel no worries or nerves when I walk into the office, because I know she will take good care of me. She has never let me down, and knows exactly how to cure me and knows what she needs to do in order to get me to feel better. 
-1	the unkown in general. until you talk to them or test comeback there is no actual knowing.   its just wait wait wait wait. 
-1	My biggest worries at the doctor's office are things like my weight an blood pressure.  Doctors very rarely give me any reason to feel anxious about their care.  I do not enjoy routine blood work or shots.
-1	If it is not a routing check up and there is some physical problem that caused me to go there than I obviously would be concerned that the result might show something I would not be happy about.
1	I think it's just generally anxiety of being in a situation that isn't common and also the worry that they may end up finding that something is wrong even though I feel fine.
-1	I'm always worried that the doctor will be disappointed that weight isn't where it should be. I worry about the blood test results. It's part of the unknown that worries me. 
-1	The thing that makes me the most anxious when visiting the doctors office is worrying that I won't be taken seriously and won't get the help I need.  I feel like that happens a lot.  Also, I don't like when I have to get undressed and put on one of those hospital gowns for an exam.  I don't think anyone does.  The worst part is when I have to get a pap smear.  The speculum and the actual procedure is pretty painful too.  Another thing that makes me nervous is fear that I'm going to look stupid when I don't understand something exactly.  Also, if the doctor orders tests, that can be no fun although I know it's necessary.
1	If I have a particular symptom that could require major intervention, such as surgery, I become worried. Pain, particularly orthopedic pain, can often mean a chronic problem has developed wherein I will need surgery or will have to stop an activity. This makes me anxious. 
-1	If I go in for something embarrassing and/or unpleasant. If I happen to have waited a little to long before I went to the Dr because I thought the problem would go away and didn't want to hear any bad news. 
1	What makes me the most anxious and worried is that they do not do a thorough examination.  They move patients through like they are cattle and it's frustrating. People deserve a hundred percent of the  doctors attention for a complete physical that should really include blood work after a certain age. I'm worried that the doctors are working so quickly that they will miss something serious and by the time it's caught it will be too late and I'll end up dying from something that could have been fixed had it been caught in a timely manner. It scared me to think that could happen to me. 
-1	I am always anxious that anything I have that is bothering me will turn out to be something serious and untreatable. I always worry that I have cancer or will develop it at some point, because both my parents died of cancer. Although all my doctor visits are basically well visits, I still worry he will find something serious.
1	I just don't like the process and while I'm not a full blown hypochondriac, my mother was and I just worry about if something will be wrong with me, even though I don't spend most of my daily life worrying about random sicknesses.
1	I am anxious that my health is already ruined. I think about death too much and I am anxious that I am going to die
1	I am worried about what kind of conditions that the doctor might find that I don't know of. I am also worried about things like high blood sugar and type two diabetes. I wonder if the doctor is judging things about my body, like my weight. This is often something I think of, the doctor judging my weight... I feel like I even hold back from going to the doctor because of the feelings of being judged. 
1	When you are my age 66 any DRs visit can be worrisome. Your body breaks down with age. You worry that you are suffering from some kind of health issue.
1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office if I'm really sick. I feel this way because I wonder if something is seriously wrong with me. I think there may be other things wrong with me that the doctor may find that I didn't know about before. I wonder if there is something wrong with me that the doctor will not be able to cure or fix easily. I also think about how healthy I am in general compared to other people.
-1	I am most anxious about the discovery of an underlying or latent condition that is not showing symptoms. I feel relatively fine and try to stay in good health but you never know what may come back in your blood work or what the doctor may find during an examination. 
-1	I still fear needles so I feel anxious when anything with needles is required. This includes vaccines and blood tests. Even the prick finger tests make me fear.
-1	That I am not going to receive the proper care and relief to my issues. That he is going to make a mistake due to laziness or make a wrong decision due to his comfort level
-1	That they will find something that is a medical problem. That my a1c will be too high. That my best efforts to take care of myself aren't good enough. 
-1	I usually do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I only got bored if I need to wait too long.
1	I never know if I'm going to get bad news. I've lost a lot of family members due to several different illnesses (walking pnuemonia, breast cancer, liver disease, etc.) so I'm always on edge that I could be next. 
-1	there is always an element of anxiety about any exam. doctors are people too.  are they having a good day? are they focused on me? do they have time to listen to me? do i really feel what i think i feel. will they believe me when i describe what i feel?
1	I feel anxious overall. I would be anxious over the wait time in the lobby and not knowing what to expect at the appointment.
-1	Just knowing that I have to have Lab work done and hoping the results are going to be where they should be.
-1	I feel worried that they will find something, mainly cancer, that I have not noticed going on with my body. I worry that they will tell me that I am not healthy for my age. I worry that they will tell me that I need to make changes in my lifestyle. 
1	Just going to a doctors office makes me a little anxious. I have some anxiety issues so when doing something or going somewhere new I get nervous. I would also be a little worried that any issues I have would be passed off as just anxiety symptoms.
1	I tend to feel rushed and looked over quickly. I am hesitant to tell my physician any issues I am having due to this. This makes me anxious as I feel I am not getting a thorough evaluation and something might be missed. This is a cause of worry for me.
-1	At times I feel worried about getting the results of my blood work. I feel relieved once I find out that there is nothing abnormal and I am in good health. 
1	There is always the opportunity of hearing bad news.  The memory of hearing bad news in the past about my own health, or a loved one's health.  The idea that an appointment could lead to a scary or painful procedure.  Also, the possibility of financial loss.
1	I'm overweight and very self-conscious/embarrassed by it.  I know I'm not taking the best card of myself and I just dread being told what I already know; it feels shameful.
1	In general I get stressed when going to a doctor. There is no certain reason why I get that way but I do. I think it may go back to my childhood going to doctors worrying about getting shots, etc.
-1	I don't really stress much because I know my body.  I have a slight degree about the worry that something else might appear. but all in all I trust my doctor.
-1	how much time it will take, I don't like to wait.  other than waiting I don't mind going to the doctor's office.
-1	I am afraid that something may be wrong.  Or if something is already wrong, that it may not be easily resolved. 
-1	If that when I do go in for something minor he has to have a sit down with me in order to mention something serious.
1	I am a cancer patient. I am approaching my 60th birthday, and I am beginning to experience health concerns that are related to my age. It causes me anxiety to learn about changing health parameters, such as blood pressure, that are more difficult for me to cope with due to my increasing age.
-1	I feel anxious and worried when i feel like my doctor may give me some terrible news about my health
-1	I DON'T OFTEN VISIT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE FOR MYSELF.  WHEN I DO GO TO A DOCTOR IT IS BECAUSE I AM EXPERIENCING AN ACUTE ILLNESS THAT IS NOT GOING AWAY WITH SELF CARE SUCH AS THE FLU.  I FEEL ANXIOUS BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IS WRONG AND MUST USUALLY BE GUIDED INTO CONCLUSIONS.
-1	I sometimes feel anxious prior to arriving to the doctors office because of the unknown result. I believe that my condition can change from time to time and this causes a little worry. I trust my doctor's knowledge of medicine, his ability to diagnose conditions, and treated appropriately.
1	Visiting the doctors office will always make me anxious due to the reason of the visit, or the idea that maybe the results of an analysis of blood work or urine sample is positive. Also getting an injection or the idea of getting an operation is frightening to me. The feeling is competently normal. Even if you are just doing a routine check up . The doctor can have a lot of patients to see before you ,and the idea of waiting in line for 30 min can make me anxious. You always assume the worst even if you have a mild cold or headache. With the flu season you always feel like you are the next person to have gotten it . Or when you get a mild rash from eating something with  citrus in it. Other than that I'm very happy after seeing my physician . It is calming  to know that everything is ok.
-1	"Not much.  I don't like giving blood samples, so that would be the biggest ""fear"" or cause for anxiety.  The other one is the prostate exam."
1	That not only will something be wrong but something that I didn't even predict would be wrong as well.
-1	the possibility of the doctor discovering something i was unaware. while it's good they are able to identify anything which needs to be addressed, i'm obviously hoping that i leave the doctor with a clean bill of health. i'm always worried that this will not be the case. 
-1	Just that they might find something wrong with me.  Like a mole that is too big or some lump I did not notice.  Nothing major just the general anxiety that comes with going to the doctor.  You never know when something that you think is small or did not even notice could turn into something big.  You hear about it all of the time.
-1	Most of the time I worried that I might forget stuff that I need to tell him in order to help me with my condition.
1	the not knowing what to expect and the knowing i usually get no answers and rarely ever do i ever feel better no matter how many  times i go and then i just have to get used to living with whatever the problem may be
1	I'm most worried about the germs at the doctor's office and catching something from others. I don't want to get sick, even if I already am. 
-1	Being unsure as to what the doctor may tell me concerning my health. Going to the doctor does not always go the way I would like it to. I do not always get the best results. Doctors do find issues that have to be resolved.
1	What makes me feel the most anxious or worried in a doctor's office would be the fact that they will be giving me news on something I don't wanna hear or they are telling me I'm going to have to give labs and give blood.
-1	Probably the possibility of outcomes. I'm always nervous that the problems I'm there for will be something more serious. 
1	The entire time. I don't just go for anything, but when I do it is usually serious. They have a tendency to treat people like cattle, and that makes it all the worse for an anxious person.
-1	"I don't typically go to the doctor for checkups, I only go when there is an issue. So I am always a little hesitant and worried something serious could be wrong. I have had ""good luck"" so far, but you never know what may be happening next."
1	Most of my anxiety is the result of concerns about what my diagnosis might be and whether or not my treatment is effective. One of the chronic illnesses I have can have serious, life-threatening consequences if not treated properly as can the medications I take for it. I am not anxious about the actual physical process of being examined, with the exception of paps smears and mammograms as these are sometimes a painful process. I normally choose female physicians for all of my medical procedures and this the direct result of years of interacting with male doctors, many of who did not seem to understand my efforts to communicate symptoms. It may be me or it may have been them, but the end result is that I am much less anxious in any medical situation when I am attended to by a female doctor.
1	I don't like going to Dr's offices.  I think of sick people and death when I go there.  I lost a child at 19 weeks of pregnancy which makes me even more anxious when I am in a Dr's office.
-1	I feel anxious going in for blood work, and while waiting for the test results for cholesterol or diabetes.  I fear the lifestyle changes that may result from bad results.
1	The most obvious answer for me would be either finding a potentially new problem or having an existing but controllable problem change or get worse.
-1	I'm a very self-conscious person, so sometimes I worry that something might be wrong with me. That's really the only anxious fear I ahve.
1	The uncertainty of what's causing my problem makes me anxious or worried.  I have to be really sick and can not find any resolution on my own to go to a doctor.  I will have exhausted all possible natural solutions first before I consult a doctor.  I am anxious of what they will say is wrong and if they will judge me for my actions or inaction.  I worry that something is seriously wrong.  
1	I hate it when they arrive late. I'm left sitting in a filthy room, waiting for them to come in and put their cold hands on me. Once she arrives, she is busy logging on to her computer and trying to convince me that I need to go on some blood pressure medication when I've never had high blood pressure in my life. It shoots straight up when I visit the hospital in anticipation of ill treatment. 
-1	I may have lost a ton of weight, but I'm still fat. I still have man boobs, and I absolutely hate taking off my shirt ever. I hate talking to people in a closed room about what's wrong with me.
-1	If it is not a routine office visit, I would be anxious/worried about what the test results are or what further testing is needed.  Maybe I need to have further tests to find out if anything is wrong, that makes me worried/anxious.
1	I have aches and pains, and I really don't want to stop for surgery right now.  This would be my knees.  I sometimes feel afraid of worse diagnoses.  Plus my doctor doesn't hear me when I say the diabetes test is wrong.  I am diabetic and the numbers don't get good just like that.  Whatev.
-1	Finding out that something may be wrong. Having a couple of scary medical situations, of course, I'd feel uneasy. 
1	I really only go to the doctor when I am sick.  I am overweight and I smoke.  I dread the lectures from the doctor. I know I should lose weight and I know smoking is bad for me.  The only reason I am there is to get help with whatever issue I have.
1	I get very nervous when I have to visit the doctor because I have huge phobia of needles, so I am always worried they will have to run a blood test or give me a tetanus shot or have some reason or another to poke me. I am also always slightly worried they will find something horribly wrong with me like cancer or some incurable disease that only gives me a few months to live. That is always in the back of my mind, that I may be dying or have to get a shot, those are about the only things that worry me about going to the doctor.
-1	Well, most of the time I have been to see the doctor is for a symptom that I am aware of and know the severity of it. Only once have I been not knowing and I was anxious but fully relieved after the diagnosis.
-1	I feel the most anxious when I have a test and I am waiting for the results. I also feel anxious when I am in a lot of pain and I do not know why. 
-1	What makes me most anxious when visiting a doctor's office would be them finding out I have some grave disease. I also feel worried when they overthink things like giving medications or going through procedures that are not necessary.
1	Cancer runs in my family. So I am worried that the doctor will find a lump or a growth somewhere on my body when I get a physical(even though I am in near-perfect health)
-1	If I am having a procedure that is uncomfortable (such as a pap) I am generally a little bit anxious as it is uncomfortable.  Also, as a cancer survivor I get nervous that I may have a test that sparks cancer screening
1	Typically a doctor visit means that something is wrong with my health. Often the results are benign but there's always a chance that the result comes back with a major illness or other issue.
-1	What might be found out, what could be wrong with me.  Especially when going in with a new medical problem, something I haven't really experienced before.
1	I fear I won't be taken seriously, or that I will again be carelessly diagnosed or prescribed another harmful medication.
1	I am most anxious that they will find something that is incurable and will end my life as I know it prematurally.
-1	Due to my anxiety, I just get worried about going out some places in general. The doctor's is one of those places because I am always worried about what is going on with my body. 
1	I have felt anxious at a DR's appointment when they found something wrong with my health. This usually leads to fear and overthinking a condition or trying to guess the treatment plan.
-1	I always feel like this I'm about to get a cancer diagnosis or something. Or they're going to tell me I tested positive for the next black plague. 
1	I'm now at the age where there is a possibility of receiving terrible news.  It ins't likely but still possible.
-1	I am most worried that I will not be diagnosed correctly when I am visiting the doctor's office.  This is due to inconsistency with doctors and PAs that I see.
-1	If my pain or illness is something that is unsure of it worries me because I think it may be some serious thing that I have never encountered before
1	I worry that the doctor is going to talk to me about my weight. I think that they are focused on it and even if I am just doing something simple they want to weight me.
-1	I'm always afraid they might find something bad.  I have chronic abdominal pain and have not been able to get a diagnosis since it began over three years ago. Also, just having to talk to doctors makes me nervous.  I don't know why. It may be because I sometimes have to speak to them for my job and they can be very rude and scary sometimes.
-1	I worry that my doctor is going to miss something serious because he is just going through the motions of another physical or exam instead of being meticulous and caring.
-1	The initial first visit for an issue I am having bothers me most. Without any knowledge from them yet I get very anxious. When they tell me the diagnosis I get worried. 
1	I usually feel a little exposed and also uneasy about the unknown. There is always a little fear that something may be wrong with me. I am worried that the doctor may judge me for having a little extra weight or for not taking care of myself right. I am pretty self conscious so letting someone see or feel parts of my body that I wouldn't normally expose makes me anxious and uneasy. 
1	I hate the anual exams, well woman check-ups. They make me anxious and uneasy. I do dread them. I don't know why, I just do. I also hate mamograms. They make me anxious too. They hurt.
1	I get worried about talking about things that make me nervous. My private body parts are private to me and even the doctor makes me feel uncomfortable. I work to try to speak about these things but just never gets easier. Also worried about hearing I have sickness or disease thats not curable. Things get rougher and rougher with age and when I get older feel like somethings just bound to go wrong with my health. 
1	If I feel I have a serious illness.  I would obviously be afraid because I'm afraid of getting sick.  I like being healthy and being in tip-top shape to do the things I love to do in life.
1	I always get nervous when it comes to my weight because I've had a weight problem for a long time and it has in no way gotten better.
1	Always feel me anxious when I anticipate to see doctor, not for general exam,but probably for X-ray or blood test, or heart test  etc,Because I anticipate bad news, may be a disease or condition will be found.Or scary disease
1	I worry they may call me a liar. I worry they may not trust what I say about what is bothering me. I worry they may tell other people I'm a liar. I worry they may put false things in my medical chart.
-1	I don't really experience any anxiety when visiting the doctor.  I treat it as a normal activity that needs to get done. 
-1	There always is a feeling of dread that during a physical they will find something new and unexpected. The actual physical is not a problem. Though no one enjoys the blood draw.
1	I do not know what he will do or say. I also fear something being very serious and needing to have to go to the hospital. I am not a fan of hospitals. I have had one surgery, and that is enough for me. I do not want any more. Think about it: One guy knocks you out while another cuts into you with a knife. Not something to make you feel good about.
-1	I usually do not feel this way at all whenever i have to go to a doctors office. Again my doctor does a good job of making me feel like im at home, and not uncomfortable. The only time i may have these thoughts slip into my head is if i do not know what is wrong with me and im just acting a bit panicky and uneasy. 
1	I feel anxious that there's going to be something really wrong with me, even if I'm feeling okay.  Just going to the doctor's makes me think about possible problems.
-1	The past experiences with my doctor. Howw she views me. Something i think u views me as more of a number than a perso n.
-1	Any feeling of anxiety when visiting a doctor is usually because I would be feeling particularly unwell or unsure about something, and as result am expecting there to be a real problem. 
-1	I usually know what I am there for, or I have an idea of what my issue could be. I am able to put my trust in the doctor seeing me and I feel confident they will diagnose me with the correct issue. I'm sometimes anxious about what will happen, since I don't know ahead of time. Mostly I just want answers and relief, so I'm more than willing to let them do their job and help me.
1	I guess the only thing that truly makes me feel anxious or worried is just stupid bs that's in my head. I feel ashamed of myself for a variety of reasons, especially when it comes to finances and lack of being able to afford insurance. My doctor has never given me a reason to feel these things though, and has actually helped aleve some of these worries and concerns.
1	I am not a doctor so I don't have the knowledge or equipment to test and find factual results and when you do your own research or diagnosis it usually looks more bad than good and you don't know what's going on for sure.
-1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office when I know my health is not good.  I feel the knowledge that I have about health nutrition can be worrisome when I find myself at a doctorâs office.  I do sometimes get anxious because I was either unaware of my mental condition or physical condition during my visits.  I felt that my physical health was in good standing, but then I take a visit to the doctorâs office, and I am told that I still need to fix my high blood pressure and cholesterol.  Not all visits are worrisome, its just keeping on track with what my doctorâs tells me to do until the next visit.    
-1	"going to see a doctor is never pleasant but i rarely experience any severe anxiety.  i certainly don't experience dread.  i think one reason for this is i'm about to turn 62.  i realize that although i'm not VERY old, most of my years are in the past and i know it's inevitable that my health, at some point, will take a negative turn and perhaps a drastic one.  i can deal with that because, as the old saying goes, ""none of us get out of here alive.""  i think i can deal with whatever i learn at any medical appointment.  the only time i'd be real anxious is if i knew i was facing a painful procedure."
-1	I am most worried that they are not going to listen to what I am describing as my actual problem. And only listen to key words that I might say. 
1	From time to time I am guilty of thinking along the line of assuming the worst rather than keeping it simple. In those types of thinking cycles it is easy to get worked up about some tests because I can imagine the results will come back telling me I have some horrible disease or worse. The reality is usually less traumatic.
1	When I visit the doctor, I don't know how long I'll end up waiting. Sometimes, I'm worried about what I might find out. I really just don't get a lot of enjoyment from visiting the doctor.
1	I worry about the doctor giving me a lecture about my weight or other lifestyle choices. I am also afraid of being told that something could be wrong with me, especially something that I could have prevented if I had taken care of myself better or come in more urgently. I also worry sometimes if I will be taken seriously when I list my concerns and symptoms, or if they will be brushed off.
-1	The situation that makes me feel most uneasy is if my concerns will be brushed off and that I will be treated like I'm overreacting and that I don't know anything. 
-1	The biggest concern is that a serious, non-treatable issue will be uncovered.Going hand in hand with that is that treatment for an uncovered medical issue might not be affordable.
-1	I have white coat syndrome. No matter how many doctors appointments I have I always get nervous! Even if it's a normal check up! My blood pressure rises, and I typically have low blood pressure. But not at the doctor's office! And I know this so then I get nervous about my blood pressure going up, which of course makes it go up more. 
-1	Mostly, it is the fear of the unknown. I have high blood sugar, and I am always concerned that my doctor might tell me that I am a diabetic. That would be very traumatic for me. This relates to my weight, and I worry what my doctor's scale will show for that.
1	it's inconvenient to take time out of a work day to be at a doctor's office.  i don't like the feeling that i may or may not get a solution to the problem i came in with.  i don't like not knowing what's wrong with me, and not knowing if the doctor i'm about to see will be able to help or not.  
-1	I have a history of respiratory issues, and they pop up fairly often. If I go in for a problem like that, I'm always worried it might be pneumonia again, which I've had several times in the last few years. Other than that, I don't really worry too much when I see the doctor.
1	This is easy, I am always worried about cancer or some unknown thing that will kill me. I am constantly asking questions, trying to understand everything and then making sure without a doubt that I am either fine or take steps to get better.
1	What they thing about me and how am trying to make my health better. Am  so worried about what they are going to say about my health getting bad. What will happen next with me and how long I will have left with my family. Am also worried about if my kids will have the same problems with health like I do and like my mother and grandmother. It runs in the family and has been pasted down thur the years
1	I am a young guy with an old guy's problem. I have a high pain tolerance and have been dealing with my ailment for at least 10 years. Most doctors don't seem to believe me when i say i am in almost unbearable pain. I feel like doctors think i'm lying about my problems to get painkillers which is not the case. I fantasize about the day when I won't need to take any medication. I get very anxious when describing my symptoms and lack of healing or improvement because I feel defensive every time i see a doctor,.
1	I just have a general fear or phobia of doctors and always have had this. I don't like being there and never will
-1	i never felt anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office. Its always good to have occasional visit to the primary care physician for preventive care 
1	I think about how much everything is going to cost.  If you have a sore throat they can somehow make that into about $300 in cost.  The appointment?  $160.  The strep test, another $100.  Like, what the hell man!
1	I am concerned about if they find a serious condition that could be life-altering or life-threatening.  I am not concerned about them but what they might discover.
1	I worry a lot about how I am going to pay for it. Then I wonder if thing are as bad as the seem ur are the trying to get more money. I get scared that they are going to tell me there is something wrong that I can't come back from.
1	I rarely go into the office unless I have noticed something is very wrong with me. I generally tend to let things get to a bad point before reaching out for professional medical help.
-1	The only time I'm worried if there is something wrong that I haven't had looked at yet or if I'm waiting for results.
1	Since I'm getting older I start to worry that something will be wrong with my heart, or the doctor will say I have to drastically change my diet and all the good foods like cheeseburgers and milkshakes will have to be eliminated. It's mainly just my aging that makes me nervous that this will be the visit where something has gone wrong that I never even noticed.
-1	I just get nervous that something could be wrong with me that I am unaware of.  Also getting tests done makes me nervous of the outcome
1	I worry that the doctor will find something that is wrong and needs to be treated but the cost of medical care is so expensive that I will not be able to afford treatment.
-1	It's the normal. Everyone is afraid of dying. I'm no different. I'm  anxious that the doctor will find something and it will be something horrible, something fatal, something no one can do anything about. My mother went to the doctor for knee and came out having found out she had a slow moving form of liver disease. It can happen. You can go in with a minor ache or pain and come out knowing what's going to kill you.
-1	I mostly worry about the doc finding something that I never knew about.  Maybe in blood work or a physical exam.  I think that not knowing is the most of my worry.  once the exam or prognosis is complete I rest easy.  i don;t like needles so drawing blood is usually a stressful experience as well.
-1	Usually I get worried because the outcome is unknown and I am not sure what is going to happen. I think alot of this fear is due to not wanting to have some major medical issue come about such as cancer or other very prominent diseases. Also it is not somewhere you go very often and is usually associated with death, illness and pain so these places are naturally scary to someone who doesnt go often or is awaiting a bill of health. Also the cost is another concern and can cause stress in someone who visits because something simple can still be expensive. 
1	I have had nurses and doctors underestimate pain, so I am constantly worried that I will not be taken seriously or believed. 
1	From the beginning, when they leave you in the room alone after taking your basic vitals is nerve wracking. It's you alone in a room and you don't know if they've forgotten you and you constantly run through all the possible worst-case-scenarios in your mind. Being alone is the scary part. 
1	I feel worried and anxious that I will receive bad results or told that I am dying. I'm worried I'm not living a healthy enough lifestyle and it will show up on my tests.
-1	I sometimes get worried I'm going to get some bad news like there is something wrong that's going to cost money I didn't foresee. Also I get worried I might get some type of negative diagnosis sometimes.
1	I was struggling with a condition that i did research on and found out that the symptoms matched a disease i feared greatly so when i went to my doctor and told him of my symtoms he scheduled some tests and an exam, during the exam i had all if these feelings because i feared receiving the news that i was right.
-1	I dont know if I will have good news at the end or bad news. It makes me nervous to go through something like it.I dont like the uncertainty of what the outcome might me
1	I don't like the feeling of not knowing what they are going to do to me. I hate blood and I hate needles. I like to know what to expect when I go places.
1	I worry about what the outcome may be.  If something is seriously wrong with me.  (like getting cancer for instance)
1	Sometimes I feel like I'm going to learn news that I cannot unhear. That I will hear that I am finally dying and that I cannot do anything more to prevent the ill fate that has been thrust upon me.
1	I feel most anxious and worried in a doctor's office because I am uncomfortable in a setting where I feel vulnerable and alone. I don't like one on one settings with someone I barely know. I don't want to be uncomfortable talking about something I don't want other people to know about, or the doctor having to examine me naked.
1	I feel worried or anxious when visiting the doctors because I am not used to doing so. I don't like how white and clean and empty the patient rooms are, how odd and sterile they are. I don't like having the possibility to be told that there is something seriously wrong with me either.
-1	I generally feel anxious or worried.  I feel uncomfortable and cold in the doctor's office.  I am usually stressed because I've had to drive in traffic from a distance.  I get social anxiety.  I am sometimes a bit uncertain about the results.  When I get checkups, I am generally expecting them to go well especially if I haven't had any issues prior to coming.  But you never know if some test result or exam comes back questionable and you have something serious or concerning wrong with you.  Or some expensive testing procedure that of course insurance won't cover.  Money and pricing is always a concern with doctor visits.  Sometimes I feel strange that every doctor can see all my previous digital health information which makes me uncomfortable.  Many times I feel violated for having to sign away all my rights in the paperwork.  And the office staff is usually rude and abrupt and treats you less than humanely.
-1	bad news about my health and the cost of treatments. sometimes visiting doctor and the lab exams he ask me to take may turn up to be costly
-1	The discovery of a new ailment that would lead to new treatments and medicines with uncertain outcome.  You always want to be healthy, but sometimes as you age you are not sure whether something may pop up unexpected.  Also, as you age the number of tests and labs seem to increase. This leads to a time of worry and anxiety to get the results back.  Hopefully, the doctor can put your mind at ease if relevant that the tests are just a precaution. So you do not have to worry while waiting.  Otherwise, you can just try to lead the healthiest life possible and go in to the office confident that you are ok.
-1	I worry that my diagnosis will be worse than I think and will result in a more serious disease than I initially thought
1	When visiting the doctor's office I am always filled with anxiety and dread due to the environment always giving me that feeling since childhood. It probably roots back to a fear of needles and too much media, but it still affects me to this day. Today, it would instead be a fear of being diagnosed with some incurable disease or being told that I can no longer do the things I enjoy in life due to some pain or injuries. Outside of that, a routine doctor's visit is normally only filled with worry on the drive there. I usually leave feeling more ensured and happier than when I came in.
-1	My doctor's office has always been very kind and welcoming. The only things that can make me feel anxious at my doctors office are the financial and insurance aspects of my visit. Even then the people there are always understanding and willing to try and accommodate my every need.
-1	I feel most worried about the long waiting I hate waiting I don't have much patience. It feels like it takes forever to talk to someone. I also feel worried about getting sick from someone else that's sick visiting the doctor's office. I am worried about being diagnosed correctly. Because I don't want to have to go all the way back and then have the physician try to guess again what is wrong with me. It's already a hassle getting to the doctor's office.
1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the unknown.  I always feel worried that the doctor will discover or test for some life-threatening or life-changing condition that will dramatically affect my life.
1	That they will discover something that is seriously wrong with me that I did not know about or did not have any symptoms for
-1	Concern about the possibility of the discovery or diagnosis of a life threatening or changing medical condition.
1	Usually I am in doctorâs office because itâs a last resort and I canât fix whatever is happening to me so by that point I am pretty worried about what is happening to my body and what may happen in the future.
-1	"I just think the overall of feeling of  ""what are they going to say about my current health status.""  Once the examination is completed and they begin to talk, I'm no longer anxious"
1	I get most worried or anxious when I visit the doctor's office, whenever I have to take my little one to see a doctor. I get more worried because I don't take my kids to the doctor unless they are really ill and I see a lot of media talking about really dangerous, possibly deadly, flu's and other illnesses out there. I worry about these because a child can easily get these illnesses from just being at the store and someone sneezes or coughs. They can even get sick if someone coughed on an item in the store and I touch it and then hold my kids. Being a parent is already worrying but having to worry about their health whenever something like this arises, is very stressful and irritating because I tend to get really antsy and nervous while waiting for the doctor's diagnosis. I had to take my daughter to the ER a few times because she had a high fever temperature, and at the time there was a big outbreak of the flu that was nationwide and causing deaths for some young kids and the elderly. Because of this reason, I decided to take my daughter to the doctor to make sure she was alright. She ended up being fine but just the information on the news and the media and her being sick just made the whole situation nerve wrecking. 
1	Money. I have no insurance so if there's something serious and I have to be rushed to the hospital, I will never be able to pay for it. I would rather they just leave me on the examination table to die than help at that point. I'm already in debt because of college loans; I literally can't afford to be in any more debt than I already am.
1	"I worry I am not being taken seriously and that I am going to be told or made to think ""it is all in my head"". I worry that they are in such a rush that they will not really listen and hear me or my concerns. I worry that ""because I am young"", they are going to assume everything is fine and I have nothing to worry about."
1	There's the concern that something could be wrong. I avoid testing altogether. There's just a generalized anxiety with visiting the doctor as well as it can feel like an invasion of privacy.
-1	I don't generally feel anxious when visiting the doctor because I'd rather find out whether or not something is wrong with me than remain in the dark. If I have to go in to have a procedure of some sort, however, then I do feel nervous just because of the uncertainty of the outcome.
1	I always worry that an incurable problem will be discovered and /or that I will find out terrible news about my health.
-1	My family is prone to diabetes, high blood pressure and even a case of ovarian cancer.  I am not typically worried or anxious unless I have a pain or illness I cannot identify as a familiar feeling.
1	I'm always anxious and worried while in the doctor's office because I don't want negative or bad news
1	I am always anxious when seeing my doctor. If I am not feeling well I seem to worry about what is wrong with me. I worry that it will be something serious. I get nervous for just about anything that has to do with a physical examination. It makes me feel uncomfortable. 
1	It isn't the doctor's office that makes me anxious. I deal with anxiety on and ongoing basis. If anything were to make me nervous, it would be the waiting time.
1	I have anxiety to being with, and any kind of scrutiny amplifies it. When the doctor is performing a checkup, I feel like I am in the spotlight and being judged. 
-1	Because of the uncertainly of what's really going on is what I get anxious or worried about when I go see my doctor.
-1	Waiting in the waiting room makes me anxious about being stuck there for a long period of time.  I hate being late or being stuck somewhere
-1	If I'm in there for a specific reason, I can feel anxious sometimes. Even with that, I know that they will do the best they can to help me or find someone who can help. 
-1	I'm most anxious about what the doctor might find.  I worry about possible diagnoses and what they could mean for my future.  
1	I am most anxious that I am going to get some bad news about a problem I have no control over and there is nothing I can do about it
1	Due to the fear mongering that has gripped this fine country, I think most people worry about a serious or deadly diagnosis each time they visit their physician, even if there isn't a specific reason why these feelings should exist (i.e. the person being diagnosed is in good health, eats well, exercises regularly, etc.).
-1	I AM ALWAYS WORRIED THAT I WILL HAVE A FATILE DIAGNOSIS IF I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY OWN BODY.
-1	I very rarely feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctors office. My doctor puts me at ease with any issues or concerns that may come up. The only times I have ever felt anxious or worried, were after having testing done, that could come back with negative results and indicate I have health issues. 
1	if i was really sick or in pain and i didnt know why then i would be fearful, other than that im usually very calm
1	I'm not a particular fan of people getting in my personal space and touching me. I know they need to at some points during exams but I am most definitely not a fan. 
1	I have a general anxiety towards all doctors and healthcare providers. My doctor I trust very well but I still feel somewhat anxious when seeing any kind of healthcare provider. This is something that I just have to deal with when seeing a doctor.
1	I have a chronic condition that killed my mother. I am always worried that it will become worse. Secondly is the unknown. By that I mean what if something new has cropped up? I am a passenger in this body and I will not get a second one. There is always the uncertainty of the unknown.
-1	I think the thing that makes me feel most anxious is when I don't know what's wrong with me and don't know if the doctor will know as well. When I was diagnosed with chronic hives I was always anxious or worried when meeting with the allergist because I wasn't confident that the hives would go away and the situation would be resolved. The fear of them not knowing what to do when I have no idea what to do is what gets me worked up. 
1	I really do not like being there in the first place and then having them tell me what I am doing wrong in my life makes it that much worse. I am worried that they will tell me something bad or find something really wrong with me. I am almost in the mindset that it is better not to know what is going on. I know that is bad but I worry way to much about everything to begin with. 
1	I am worried that the doctor is going to tell me that I have something seriously wrong. Ever since my dad's cancer diagnosis 4 years ago (and his ensuing death in 2015) I have been close to terrified every time I have to see the doctor. 
-1	Hearing bad news or being told that you have a medical condition. Also if the doctor will be caring about the health of his/her patients.
1	I don't like to be undressed in a doctor's office. I don't like to show my body to anyone but my husband. I hate getting tests done and i don't know the results of the test
-1	The thing(s) that make me most anxious while visiting the doctors office is the unknown. Sometimes when I am sick and do not understand why, the waiting to find out causes more anxiety than what it is worth.
1	Most things make me anxious, so it is not necessarily a special occasion. I do not do well with uncertainty, so if it something beyond a checkup or the like, enter: anxiety.
1	I hate waiting. They ask all these questions and when you're healthy it just seems like a waste of time. I could have filled out a form and gotten the same answer: You are well.
1	It makes me most fearful that something will be seriously wrong . Or that something might be painful. But the unknown is worse.
-1	I often worry I have a new medical condition or that an old condition has returned. If that happened I would have to take new medications and have longer visits with my doctors.
1	I usually feel very calm when I'm at the doctor's however, I am for the most part in good health. I guess the only anxiety I have would be them telling me I have a terminal illness or something horribly wrong. 
-1	Well honestly I rarely feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor.  The only time I can see myself being worried about my condition is when I have something that might be seriously wrong with me and it is more of a reaction to the condition than to the doctors visit itself.  I tend to be a pretty calm individual in most situations so it rarely ever comes up.  Though what exactly makes me worried more than anything is simply the possibility of a condition that can only be treated and not cured but I think that is something that bothers most people in general.
1	The cold sterile setting is rather unnerving, causing my anxiety levels to skyrocket. Knowing that anything I say to the doctor could be taken out of context and cost me my License/Job/Freedom due to a simple misunderstanding. The waiting can also cause stress and worry. It seems to take forever for a doctor to even make it into the room to examine you, and even longer to come back and explain what steps are next. Finally, Even when I know what is wrong, or the reason I am there and try to explain why or what helps because I've been through it before, I'm treated like an idiot or a criminal, or a faker while they order more tests to make my bill even higher. 
-1	I am the kind of person who always gets nervous in a doctors office. I just get nervous about the fact that they could find something wrong. Typically, I calm down once I start talking but I am still a bit on edge until I leave even if I have a great visit. I think it is just a natural fear inside of me. 
-1	I am very comfortable in doctor's offices and in hospital surroundings. I grew up in that environment because my mom worked at a hospital, and so I was always there and the other doctors were friendly and doting toward me. So, I am never anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office unless I fear or expect something is very wrong with me.
1	That the doctor is just going to say anything. That doctors dont care to actually really examine a patient. They just have a goal to prescribe a prescription for anything and any reason.
1	i am anxious or worried about what might be the diagnosis , scared of any new illnesses or anything that will make me have to come back for any sort of treatment
1	I just don't like having to go to the doctor. The waiting around, being around other people. Feeling like I might be wasting their time. 
1	I'm honestly not scared of needles, shots or anything like that. I have many tattoos and piercings so to me a shot or needle is nothing at all. I get so uneasy and worried to the point that I'm nauseous. I think it's because I overly worry that the doctor is going to find something or say I'm sick with something, I'll need further testing elsewhere, or I have only a few months to live. I know that's like the extreme, but that really terrifies me just incase. I also worry that the doctor or nurses know something I don't and they won't tell me and talk about it behind my back or something weird like that.
-1	I am always anxioius or nervous because you never know what they will find. I am also nervous about the cost and what my insurance will cover.
-1	I don't feel anxious when I see the doctor. I go in to the office with a good attitude. There is always a chance that he could find something seriously wrong,but I will face hat when it happens,not before.  
-1	I'm a cancer survivor, so I always worry that something seriously wrong will be found. Certain exams are more uncomfortable than others. Sometimes, I feel anxious about possible pain.
1	I have social anxiety, so just getting to the doctor and actually going are tough for me. I feel so much anxiety when I need to visit my doctor, 
1	The not knowing what might happen.  Also the overall wait time.  It seems to take forever between the check in and check out process
1	I tend to get anxious about having to go to the doctor's because of the unfamiliar environment and what the possible outcome is during my visit. I also get worried about the drive there because I don't like driving. I also feel uneasy having to explain my problems, especially if they're embarrassing. 
1	I have social anxiety and any time I have to go to an office and talk about personal things it's very difficult for me.
-1	I worry a little bit that a disease might be found...my dad had cancer for instance, I want to avoid that.
-1	The only thing that would make me feel anxious when visiting a doctor is if I have something that could potentially be serious. I would be worried about it being something worse than what I think it is.
1	It is a little unnerving having to unclothe and have a doctor prod around in private areas. I know it has to be done, but it makes me uncomfortable.  I am anxious about the exam itself more than finding out something is wrong.  Doctors try to make patients feel comfortable about this, but it's not easy. 
-1	I feel anxious or worried if there is a new employee .Example the person who take your blood. If he or she is new I do not know if they have enough experience.. I will not let them  stick me with a needle several times to get blood.
-1	I don't generally feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office. I trust the physician and I don't have any serious ailments so I don't really have reason to worry.  At worst, sometimes I forget to bring my insurance card or have to do paperwork. The paperwork is always the worst part.
-1	I get anxious when I don't know the doctor and do not have a rapport or have had a bad personal experience with the doctor. 
1	My history is long, and results from an accident many years back. The accident was serious and my injuries very severe. I continually deal with residual complications from that accident and also tend to develop new conditions as time goes on and I get older. Its almost impossible for me at this point to not have anxiety after my checkups.
1	Finding out the worst case scenario, even though it is usually very simple treatment. For example going in for a cough and being diagnosed with cancer.
1	I am often unsure of what protocol my doctor will implement. I also feel insecure abut myself and physical condition and this makes me anxious in the doctor's office.
1	I just do not know if they will find out that something is wrong with me. I usually feel healthy but there is always a little uncertainty that something might be wrong without me knowing. 
1	I'm not sure.  Even though my doctor is one of the best ones I have been to, I still get nervous at the visits.
1	I am most anxious when awaiting results. The unknown is always the most stressful for me, because I can't figure out how to proceed. I also don't particularly like needles, but it is more the time between seeing the needle and it actually going into my arm that is stressful. 
-1	Nothing at all.  I feel completely calm and collected when I visit his office.  The only issue I ever have is somebody bringing a loud obnoxious child to the office with them but that doesn't really have anything to do with the office itself.
1	I worry about getting really bad news one day. I worry the doctor will find some condition or disease that has cause irreversible damage.
-1	I HAVE COMPLETE TRUST IN MY DOCTOR SO I'M USUALLY NOT ANXIOUS OR WORRIED. IT MAY COME TO THAT SOME DAY BUT SO FAR IT HASN'T. EVEN NOW WITH MY LAST CT SCAN IT SHOWS A SPOT ON MY LUNG HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT BUT I'M NOT TO WORRIED ABOUT IT YET. MAYBE IN THE FUTURE I WILL BE.
1	When it comes to visiting the doctor the thing that makes me the most worried is simply not knowing how things will you. I hate that there is a possibility that I can get some really bad news that would cost me financially, physically or mentally. It's very nerve racking. 
1	What makes me feel most worried anxious is when my doctor is rushing me to see another pather...this is when he overbooks.
1	I'm worried that a doctor will order a test that will result in negative results (negative meaning detrimental to my health). Sometimes it's easier not knowing that something is wrong than confirming that there is a problem.
1	I feel most anxious about medical exams because I've experienced many life threatening medical issues that have required emergency surgery. I am fearful of death, and also of pain, and having to spend months of recovery. Also the loss of income, and the ability to provide for my family. 
1	I have a medical condition that can get worse over time.  It could require surgery and this makes me anxious about doctor's visits.  I don't delay making an appointment likely because of my good relationship with the doctor.
-1	I think that it would be the part about receiving the worst information about your health. I think that interacting with your doctor should not make a patient anxious or worried, what worries me is receiving bad news from the doctor. Waiting for those test results is also very worrisome. 
-1	I worry that I will get sick from other people there.  I worry that I will hold the doctors back with my long appointments. I worry that my insurance will not cover something.
1	I am afraid that he will find something really wrong with me like cancer or something.  Iâve never had anything like that and am in good health but am always afraid when I go to the doctor just for a checkup they will find something like that.
-1	That I will hear bad news, or that I will be told something that will frighten me. I would not like to hear something negative regarding my health if I do not need to. I also dislike hearing possible diagnoses, when there is no reason to be worried about them. 
-1	exams are unpleasant,  worry about what might be found.  not fun sitting in a paper gown waiting 30 mins in a cold room for the dr to show up.   
1	I feel anxious or worried that my doctor will find something else wrong with me. I'd rather not hear it or know about it, to be honest
-1	Wondering what the outcome of my exam would be. Imagining if there is something wrong and what needs to happen next.
1	I have high blood pressure and it elevates in the office.  I don't want more medications as it is fine otherwise. However, my doctor just keeps adding more even though I have it taken by a nurse at the school I teach in and it is so very much lower - normal in fact. 
-1	My family has an extensive history of health issues and each time I go to my doctor I am concerned that he is going to find something or diagnose a condition.  Often times I am waiting on the test results to see if everything is fine or not and that makes me anxious.
1	That they are going to tell me that something is seriously wrong with me. Not really anything in particular but that something will require some surgery or a massive change in lifestyle. I always think about having cancer, or how scared I would be if I had to undergo a major surgery. If I'm going in for say blood tests, I'm going to worry that my blood tests are going to show that I have major health issues, etc. I still always have these worries and fears, despite the fact that I've yet to have anything like that occur. It's always something minor, but I always am terrified of something major.
-1	For me to show up at the doctor's office with a complaint means that I am acknowledging that I am experiencing something that is beyond my capability and that I need help with. Just there I am going to be anxious going in. And if there are concerns shown for my tale of woe and tests ordered than I am going to be a little bit worried just not knowing what the test will show.
1	I am anxious that there is something wrong with me that I am unaware of. I am anxious that I have some condition that is uncurable or chronic or otherwise scary.
-1	Cancer is always a fear and imaging scares me in case of that. After diagnosis where medications can help, I feel better.
-1	Sometimes I feel anxious that what I think is some pretty minor thing will end up being something major.  Or that I will be one of the cases that end up in the news of doctors doing something totally wrong for the patient (amputating the wrong leg, etc.).  I also don't care for shots...
-1	The thing that worries me is not so much what he is telling me as a patient, but what he is not telling me for some reason outside of my best interest. I am definitely worried that he may not be as thourough as he should be, or that his recommendationas could have a negative impact.
1	I feel most anxious if I am actively having a health issue and have to wait a long time to be seen. Waiting a long time causes me to go to worst case scenario in my mind and by the time I'm in the exam room I am sometimes a bit nervous.
-1	It makes me nervous. I hate weighing in. I do not like that sick people germs in the office. I don't like having to take my clothes off and get in that paper gown. It usually ends up ripping and that's always uncomfortable when that happens. Noone likes to wait to hear if there's bad news. It's always uncomfortable even when I like my doctor. It could be a head game for all I know?
-1	Because I am getting older and am reaching the age when all of the men in my family either have died already or been diagnosed with cancer, I am anxious about that history and the likelihood that it is ineveitable that it will happen to me, and that this likelihood increases with age, and it will be a doctor visit that fisccloses that the end is coming soon.
-1	That I will only bring important things to discuss with him.  That I listen to what he says and follow his orders.
-1	doctors visits usually never make me feel ill at ease. i am in pretty good health and dont have much to worry about.
-1	Family history of blood pressure issues. This always crosses my head as I been told that while my blood pressure is still within the normal range , it is in the higher borderline. The second this that pops to my head is that you never really know if everything is 100% fine. You may feel fine but may still be sick.
-1	I feel anxious when i think something major is wrong. This is what makes me very worried and stressed out and I hate that feeling. I hate knowing that a test is pending as it bothers me a bit. It really gets to me overall.
1	I am very anxious when I am waiting to see the doctor because I am always afraid that my insurance coverage won't be valid and that I will have to pay my medical bill out of my pocket. I get anxious with the thought of getting a disease or infection while sitting in the doctors office.
1	When I go in for something where I'm not sure what the diagnosis is going to be.  Like in my latest example regarding the cyst found in my thigh.  When I went in for examination, I didn't know if it was going to be a tumor or cancerous or a blood clot.  If I was just going in for a physical checkup, it wouldn't be as nerve racking.  However, even then, you never know if they're going to find something wrong with you and that is always a little unnerving.
1	I get nervous when visiting the doctor. Its been like that for a long time but my GP tries to make my visit as comfortable as possible
-1	Uncertainty about a diagnosis that I am concerned about. It's hard not to let information on the internet cloud your judgment, which can lead to anxiety about a diagnosis.
1	It scares me that there might be something wrong with me or sometimes I'm worried that I'm going to get embarrassed because the doctor will point out that I'm practicing poor health habits or something.
-1	I don't get anxious too often with doctors, they are there to help. The only part that makes me anxious is not knowing what the problem is and how costly the fix will be. More often than not it's expensive or time consuming.
-1	I just have a general anxiety that I'm not providing the correct information or that there is something wrong that I don't know about. I also don't like needles or pain so I get uneasy that blood tests will be ordered.
1	I am always anxious that there will be bad result or bad news.  I also am a little uncertain that the doctor is taking my actual thoughts or words into consideration. I know that he actually went to medical school but I live with me and know how I feel and what I am experiencing and to have a doctor disregard and dismiss my thoughts is upsetting.  I also do not like going to doctors I do not know who fill in because of bad experiences with rude doctors.
-1	"I'm just generally nervous when talking to people I'm not really familiar with, so going through the whole chain of interactions from front desk to nurse to doctor is a little bit stressful for me. But not the ""I'm afraid"" sort of stress. It's more of a ""where do I put my hands? Why did I say that? "" sort of stress."
-1	When visiting a new doctor's office for the first time I often feel worried they won't be able to help me fully or prescribe a medication that works for my body.
-1	There is very little that makes me anxious.  Doctors dont make me anxious at all.  I just don't enjoy hearing possible bad news.
-1	Typically, its a situation when I know something is wrong with me, but I'm also aware that the costs may be too expensive to do anything about. I had a tonsil infection, and I was unable to eat comfortably for days. I didn't know how much the medicine would cost and I had to pay out of pocket. It cost me $300 at the urgent care to get treated and to be able to eat again. It's always an affordability issue.
1	What makes me feel most anxious is not knowing if there is anything wrong with me when it seems like there is not. It is also just the unknown and maybe the doctor having to bear that bad news to tell me. There is also me having to worry what the doctor will think too. 
-1	I feel most anxious when there is an awkward kind of conversation, I'd rather just sit and listen to music or something and relax than have to converse.
-1	White coat syndrome. Usually when I attend the doctor it's something I've decided isn't going away by itself (common cold etc) so I usually am anticipating the worst at the appointment. 
1	I'm anxious about being around people in general, and going to the doctor is not too much better. I am in good health thankfully, so I usually only go in for minor stuff.
1	I am often anxious that I will be judged if I speak the truth about my health care needs and concerns. I am concerned that I am sent to different doctors who ultimately don't have answers for what is going on with me. I am worried my doctor will continue to push me to take meds that I suffer side effects from. I worry that I will fail to convince my doctor that I am really having problems.
1	I just don't know what problems may pop up. I usually am healthy but recently I've been feeling a lot of different stuff. 
-1	I worry whether or not I will receive bad news. The longer I go without seeing a doctor the worse this feeling becomes. Similar to the dentist.
-1	I am usually not anxious or worried about visiting the Dr.  I have had many procedures that would probably worry most people but I tend to take it in stride.
1	I fear what the doctor might tell me. I will worry from the day I make the appointment until I finish the visit. If I were dying, I don't think I would want to know. Doctors don't seem to understand this fear.
-1	It depends on the reason for the visit. If it is for a minor ailment, there is no reason to be anxious. I have no reason to feel anxious about a visit unless I the doctor gives me reason to be. i.e. bad health news
1	I think what makes me feel the most anxious and worried is that I might have a serious condition or disease. Sometimes being examined feels a bit uncomfortable as well.
1	I only go to the office when something is bothering me, so I am worried about my condition at the time. I am bad about thinking the worse, so I tend to dwell on that until I see the doctor.
1	My doctor is very blunt, so when I go to him I am a little nervous. He will tell me if I gained weight and he will usually talk about it with me constantly throughout the visit.  I'm usually worried that he will tell me that there is something seriously wrong with me. Thats been my fear for awhile. I just hate sitting in the office because I feel like there are a lot of germs and I will get sick.
1	I do not like being scrutinized with weight, blood pressure etc. I would prefer to never go to the doctor, however I know I need to. I don't always feel that doctors are really listening to all of my symptoms and I don't like taking unnecessary medications.
-1	Because I worry about that something is wrong with my body like perspiring too much when I exercise. She did a papsmear and did not find anything so I felt better. I worry about bad results.
1	What makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor is the possibility of finding out something is seriously wrong with me.
1	I feel anxious or worried because I can never tell if my blood pressure will be of a normal reading and that is one of my biggest concerns
1	I'm a single mom. I have two teenagers who rely on me and my financial and emotional support. I am the one constant in their lives. The one person they couldn't live without.  This is mainly the reason for my anxiousness when I visit the Dr's. I want to be there for my children as long as I possibly can.
1	Mostly waiting a long time in general makes me nervous and it seems like waiting is longer than the actual exam from the doctor. Other than that, it's fear of having some kind of illness.
-1	Mostly it's the unknown. I certainly don't want to be sick, but being that I haven't kicked the smoking addiction, I know at some point I will be. 
1	That they will schedule a bunch of extra test just so they can bill the insurance companies for more.
1	One of the things is my weight. I've always been overweight and I dread even getting on the scale and another person knowing my weight. I also worry I'll be lectured about it or it will be named as a cause for whatever ailment I might have. I often don't go to the doctor when I should so that my weight is never known or discussed. I also worry about my issue, which I may think is trivial, turning out to be something more serious than I thought.
1	I have an innate fear of going to the doctor. For no apparent reason either. It is the fear of what the doctor would say, and finding something wrong with me. There is also the aspect where I would have to do things that are uncomfortable to myself, such as things that should stay private. On top of that, it is seeing the bill afterwards and paying it. 
-1	I would only visit a doctor if I was pretty sure there was something seriously wrong with me, so the higher source of stress would be whatever that is.
-1	I tend to consider worst case scenarios when I head to the doctor's office; if I have some kind of pain or ailment, I tend to assume it is something awful and imagine the worst possible results. By the time I get to the doctor, I feel like he is close to confirming my worst fears, even if I'm actually fine.
1	With everything all over social media and the news sometimes it makes it hard not to think about what ifs.  Everything is bad for you now so with every appointment it makes me wonder what could they find, is this the visit.  I question every choice I have made since my last appointment.  Also I am very hard on myself, so I always worry what the doctors or nurses think of me.
1	You never know what to expect the doctor to say. Especially if you aren't going on a regular basis then you will never know what to expect from the doctor. example waiting on blood work to process can be the most dreadful expereince as it leads to the patient waiting a day or two before results are complied. the anxious stage of mind comes into play when you are a student in school and waiting the teacher to tell you what grade you may have. This is the same factor that applies to the doctors room when you are always waiting on results.. 
1	I feel anxious when I know that he is checking for new problems to an existing condition.  So far everything has turned out okay, but I still tend to get anxious and a little bit worried.
1	I worry that I will get a positive test result for a chronic condition. For example, recently my tests showed that I have high cholesterol. 
1	When I need specific medication my doctor is very judgemental and when I ask for specific stuff i read about online he totally hates on the ideas and takes a very holier than though attitude with me and says no to any sort of request I make so he makes me nervous
-1	Being in a position of vulnerability makes me most nervous in a doctor's office, specifically if I'm an exposed or unknowledgeable. I feel somewhat at the mercy of the doctor.
1	Sometimes I worry about being diagnosed for something greater than I first believed. I have an over presently fear of getting some horrible news whe ever I have a check or I go in for an exam. It makes me nervous not knowing what I have of rmight need. The suspense of waiting for the results of and exam make me anxious.
-1	Generally the only time I am anxious is if I am taking a blood test or other test regarding Cholesterol, blood pressure etc to make sure I am in normal zones and taking care of myself. 
1	The things that make me feel most anxious when visiting a doctor's office is that they will not make the proper diagnosis and that they will not give me a good enough medication for my ailments.  How could a doctor properly diagnose everything after such quick examinations?  Also, doctors are now so worried about being sued that they will not prescribe medications with addiction potential.  These drugs have worked well for a century and now we must use inferior drugs just because some people decide to abuse the drugs.
-1	At the doctors, I feel most worried if when I do not feel listened too.  I have faith in my doctors to monitor my symptoms and take appropriate treatment.  However, when I feel that they are rushed or thinking about other things - it makes me feel uneasy.  Sometimes, I think that doctors are overworked and take on too many patients.  Their offices are revolving doors.  I wonder if all needs are being met or if they are rushing through one patient to get to the next.  Additionally, I wonder what they would perscribe or treat if they did not have to worry about insurance.
1	I am worried that I wont be heard or listened to. I have had experiences where I have been told that the issue I have will go away with time and sometimes it hasn't. I try to ask questions, only to be passed off to someone else and I have to explain things all over again.
1	I'm worried if I am expecting bad news or know that I haven't been taking good care of myself. I get anxious interacting with certain people who do not seem friendly.
-1	If I am going to worry about attending a doctors visit, the thing that would make me the most nervous is not meeting or following through with their instructions.   Then having to face them, and explain why I didn't meet their goal or follow their advice.
-1	When a doctor makes minor indications that something is wrong, it is my natural response to assume the worst even though it is very rarely the case.
1	I think the internet is a big contributing factor to me feeling anxious, because I often go online to research symptoms and of course I think the worse. More than likely if is never what I worry about. The other worry of course is what the cost of things will be.
1	Because he doesn't have a good bedside manner. I've only been seeing him for 2 years when my other doctor retired. I was hoping this doctor would recommend me seeing a nutritionist, but I didn't speak up about it this time. I don't really want to start searching for a new doctor, either. Guess I have to live with it.
1	"We have to overcome that, especially the quality of cadres. "" I am very grateful for that statement and argue that ""reform"" of the human person is also a must for many branches and administrative bodies. We are not only interested in training professional staff, but also require them to behave civilly and friendly when interacting and working with people."
1	I have a reoccurring hernia and I am afraid she will see it and tell me I need to have surgery again. Also I am afraid when my blood pressure goes up or my cholesterol. 
-1	What I feel most anxious or worried about when visiting the doctor's office is probably the wait of the actual appointment. I could not get into the doctor for a month with a condition that had me worried it was something serious. Unfortunately, the doctor was booked up and then when the appointment came, the doctor was with another patient for a little longer than scheduled so I appreciate her being with someone else and helping them but the waiting game was making me anxious.
1	I am usually worried about being told that there is something severely wrong, which will lead to more problems in my life for myself and friends and family
-1	It makes me most anxious when I call to get advice from the doctor, and it takes weeks to receive a response. If I don't proactively call them daily, I may not be given any information.
1	I have a heart condition that while stable and not harmful right now, needs to be monitored.  Every time I see him I worry that my condition has change and I may require surgery. 
-1	Generally, I'm not really a worrier, but if I were to worry about anything, I would worry most about learning that there is something wrong with me that is not easy to fix.
-1	What makes me most nervous when going to the doctor is that I will get bad news that is not easy to fix with medicine or anything else quick and easy.
-1	I get worried about wasting my money over nothing. Like it's all in my head. or I worry there is something very wrong with me that I won't be able to afford. 
-1	I feel most anxious during the very few times I have been really sick, or am having some kind of pain, especially the internal kind.
1	I just have anxiety in general. I get anxious sitting in the exam room waiting. I also get anxious because I worry I won't be able to explain what is going on with me in a way that makes sense to the doctor. I sometimes get anxious because I have quite a few health problems they might think that I am weak or wanting attention. 
-1	first of all, I don't experience at all any anxious emotions or worries because I know that these places and persons are there for real help.
1	The intimacy of some tests. Pap smears are generally painful; don't look forward to those. And at age 59, I'm running into problems I never thought about at younger ages, like changes in cholesterol and bone density. So even though I'm in pretty good health, at the very least, I have to wonder what fresh age-related disease I'll be at risk of next.
1	"Again, I have not had my current physician for a very long time and we are still getting to know one another and my multiple physical and mental conditions. We are still exploring traditional and non-traditional treatment methods to increase my quality of life. I always worry that my current doctor will get overwhelmed and ""give up"" trying to find solutions to help my quality of life increase. I am very anxious that she will not be able to work with my specialists who treat my many conditions."
-1	When I am most anxious or worried at the doctors office is when I am having lab work done. Waiting on the lab results makes me feel anxious and worried about what the outcome will be. 
-1	When I visit a doctor, I feel slightly anxious sometimes because of the slight chance that the doctor will find an illness based on the standard medical tests give. Also the experience of sitting in a doctors office waiting for long periods of time just waiting for the doctor to visit you.
1	That it will be more serious than I thought and my life could drastically change for the worst. I also worry that there can be a treatment for my problem but my insurance wouldn't cover it. I hate insurances, I think they are evil, and you can not consider a doctor appt without considering consequences from insurances. 
-1	I get anxious about an appointment if it has anything to do with my children or labs pertaining to certain diseases that have a high tendency to run in my family. I'm always worried that one day I'll walk into the clinic and be told my heart is going to give out or I have severe diabetes or thyroid issues. I don't like medications and don't want to be placed on anything that I would have to take daily.
1	If I have a condition that suddenly occurred and I cannot find any information about it. I am also worried about high medical bills.
1	Sometimes I worry I may get bad news about my health. I feel generally healthy but I know that cancer is something that can effect anyone at any level of health. The older I get the more I worry I may not be as healthy as I think I am.
-1	"When visiting a doctor's office, the thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried is the wait between the time that I check in and the time the doctor actually can see me and uncertainty regarding how much the visit is going to cost financially. Primarily the anxiety I feel is induced by whatever ailment I am experiencing and it typically turns into both anxiety and relief....anxiety over what the doctor might diagnose (for instance, it could be the worst case scenario...though likely not) and relief knowing that someone will be able to give his/her professional opinion and action can be taken. However, for the most part, going to the doctor's office isn't anxiety inducing....just whatever symptoms I am experiencing and the possible cost to ""fix"" it. On a side note, I typically don't go to the doctor unless I am extremely concerned about whatever is ailing my body. "
1	What make me most anxious is the results that I have to find out. I think everyone that goes to the doctor's office always worry about if anything is serious or not. At least that is how I feel when I go there.
-1	What makes me most anxious or worried is that the doctor could find something like a disease or something I had no idea about.

-1	The main thing I'm fearful of is contracting something else considering my weak immune system.  If my health isn't good or if I've dropped weight I feel anxious because I know we'll have to talk about it.  I work as hard to keep on weight as other people do to lose weight.
-1	The only thing I would feel anxious about are needles.  Outside of that, I trust my doctor and the advice he's given me has helped me to be very healthy.  I feel no need to be anxious when seeing my doctor.  
-1	Probably just wondering how much it's going to cost. Everyone knows that doctors don't traditionally communicate prices before anything is said and done. Plus you pay a copay as soon as you walk in so you're kind of locked into being there anyway. I also start to worry that whatever I'm visiting for doesn't become a senseless come back again tomorrow or in 3 days so I can charge you for some more arbitrary services. Healthcare cost is so inflated and so many people are in the dark because it benefits the guys mailing out the huge bills.
1	That they will try and find something wrong so they can charge you for tests that you don't need. That they will misdiagnose something and cause me stress.
1	I am always worried that we will have to do a painful test. I really dont like getting shots or blood drawn. I always worry that they will find something really wrong. Also i dont like when they say i have to take off my clothes. I have a gyno for that.
-1	I always worry before my annual PCP visit that maybe my health might be taking a downturn, because every visit prior he tells me I have perfect labwork and everything else. I just want to have A+ health every time.
1	Visiting the doctor makes me feel anxious, and this is obvious when my blood pressure is much higher than normal when taken by health professionals.  My doctor works with me on this matter, and trusts me to report my self-test blood pressure readings. I think there are always unknowns when going to the doctor. You may think you are fine, but the doctor might find something to prove otherwise. I dread getting blood drawn because it is painful. You never know how experienced the person taking your blood is going to be (i.e. they might miss the vein a few times and poke you).
-1	When I visit the doctor's office I am most concerned about my weight and blood pressure.  My family has a history of heart problems and I want to stay ahead of the pack and avoid those issues.  I'm doing pretty well so far.
-1	If I ever have anxiety visiting my physician, it is purely because I have concerns that my health is extremely poor and I may have a serious illness. I find reassurance in going to an appointment at my clinic, as I know if something is wrong, they will find it and help me in the next step in treatment.
-1	There's always the fear in the back of my mind that he/she may find something wrong with me that I'm not expecting.

1	I WOULD SAY FINDING OUT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH ME LIKE A BAD SICKNESS. I ALSO GET ALOT OF ANXIETY WHEN I HAVE TO HAVE BLOOD DRAWN. I AM NOT A FAN OF BLOOD OR NEEDLES. 
-1	I always want to be in perfect health, so since I see my doctor maybe once a year for a physical and lab testing, i get anxious that something may have come up in the previous 12 months that she will tell me needs to be addressed.
1	I always worry that I am not going to be able to clearly  express the health issues I may have, or that I will sound like someone who has nothing better to do than look up health conditions online and adapt those as my own issues. I also worry that the doctor is not going to believe what I tell him.
-1	I very rarely experience any anxiety while at the doctor The only time was when I was dealing with new health issues and they kept telling they didn't know what was going on. That bothered me as having an answer would give me peace of mind regarding the seriousness of the issue.
1	Worrying about what the doctor will say is the most worrisome. Going through checkups and tests which make me anxious. 
-1	I typically don't feel anxious or worried. There have been a couple of times when the symptoms I was experiencing could have been caused by a more serious issue. Fortunately, after testing that was not the case. In those instanced I did feel a bit anxious and worried because what could have been going on had a chance to be serious. Thankfully, it was not. 
1	They could misdiagnosis because it could make the situation worst. A large number of the lawsuits come from misdiagnosis and some people have died because of it. 
1	I feel the most worried if I think something is likely to be wrong, especially if it is my fault. Or if I am trying to get cleared to do something.
-1	I think the side affects of a potential prescription would make me feel anxious and/or worried most. To deal with this- I usually ask questions and try to get a satisfactory answers from Doctors and/or nurses. I also try to learn my options on the prescriptions to see if there is any other alternatives. for instance- the generic version of a branded medicine would make any difference etc. This sometimes help me deal with the level of being anxious or worried.
1	When they have to run a lab in-house and it takes longer than I should -- I worry something is wrong.
1	Forgetting to mention something that might affect diagnosis or forgetting to mention a problem that bothers me.
1	"I would feel the most anxious or worried if the doctor found something wrong or is requesting extra tests or if they specifically say that there is something wrong or something that i need to ""keep an eye on"" or ""monitor"". Those are usually signs of things that either already are problems or have a good likelihood to become problems."
-1	I usually only go to the Dr. when something bad is going on or for a physical, so when my level of worry is already heightened by the stress of what ever is ailing me and compelling me to go. 
1	What they might find makes me feel most anxious. You might feel good but when you go to the doctor, you might discover that you have something wrong with you whether it's a disease or low vitamin levels. Also, the process of examination such as taking my blood and checking me makes me nervous. I don't like needles and I don't like a stranger touching me. 
-1	I think that imagining the doctor telling me that I have something terribly wrong with me creates anxiety.
1	I don't want to be diagnosed with something serious. I fear becoming ill and leaving my family. That is scary for me.
1	i don't like getting check ups, it's too invasive as it is and i've never done well in any type of social situation. 
1	                             I feel worried when I don't know what to expect.  I don't know what the doctor might find wrong.                                                                                                                       
1	Just Them Telling Me That Something Bad Is Wrong With Me It Care Keep Your Worried Forever Man And That's Why I Try To Stay Healthy 
1	I believe what can make me feel anxious or worried about the doctor's office visit is the doctor saying or seeing something that might be off or being diagnosed with something that you did not see coming.

1	Nothing really to be honest. I usually go to the physician for routine check ups. For the most part, I am a pretty healthy individual.

1	During my last pregnancy, OBs would have me stay overnight in the hospital for non-stress testing, simply because they wanted to spend time with their families and didn't want to wait around for the hour it would have taken to observe me. Also, the nurses would tell me to drink water so they wouldn't order an IV, but the doctors always forced me to have an IV, even when I was in the hospital for a short time, drinking water the entire time. Once, the nurse tried to put in an IV three times, permanently damaging my left arm. When she gave up on my left, and starting stabbing my right arm, I was scared I wouldn't be able to use either of my hands the next day. Anyway, all of that was unnecessary and when someone is pregnant in particular, in the US, the doctors only care for the fetus, not the mother. This is why the US has such a high maternal mortality rate...this was told to me by a nurse and public health professional.

1	As stated in the letter of intent, the NHMFL offers the capability to measure actinide materials under unique conditions. Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile sample.

-1	But doctors can make a different kind of mistake. What I found strange when I first started running the health anxiety clinics was how many patients had been told they had a fatal disease when they did not!  Rather than making the mistake that everyone worries a doctor might make, namely missing the diagnosis of a deadly disease, their doctors worried them unnecessarily by diagnosing deadly diseases that were not present. That happened to me once. I had a swollen leg. Being a health worrier myself at that time, I had already made sure by repeatedly testing myself that I did not have the fatal kidney disease the doctor, when I finally got around to visiting him, informed me blithely that I had. I was able to dismiss his opinion out of hand.  But I have had patients who forever after worried about the disease they were told they had.

1	"The fact that I don't always understand their ""English"" and I know that the quality of our medical professionals has declined.  They don't spend a lot of time with patient care because they have to process so many in order to make money.  They don't always order the tests they should because the insurance companies give the clinics a certain amount of money for the number of patients they have.  If they can keep the testing down they will have money left at the end of the fiscal year and they all get bonuses from the money left.  Sad.  Patients suffer."

1	I don't like visiting the doctor because after the blood test I have to view me talk about my results with him. I am sometimes worried that my readings won't be good and the doctor will give me more pills or get mad at me for not following his directions in the first place.

1	The waiting and the waiting room makes me feel the most anxious and or worried when I visit the doctors office.
-1	The thing that causes me to feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor is not knowing what is wrong before I arrive and the price of a new medication she my prescribe.

-1	The only thing I can think of is the Dr wanting me to take meds to get my cholesterol down but they cause my anxiety to go through the roof so I stopped taking them.

As I said earlier, I rarely need a doctor. I have no prescriptions, and ""get sick"" maybe once every 5 or 6 years. "
1	The fear of the unknown is one of my biggest issues regarding medical exams. To a certain degree I'd rather have a disease or ailment and not know about it and have peace of mind, rather than knowingly have a disease and stress over it.
1	I have anxiety so going in and talking to the doctor makes me nervous anyway but I get worried about something being wrong.

-1	I feel anxious because offices are usually cold and the exam room can be initimadating. It would be nice if the exam rooms where more cozy and you didn't have to wait so long before you see the doctor and freeze half to death. I also hate when i have to pay out of pocket after the appointment and wasn't told beforehand what to expect to pay so that i'm not caught off guard.
1	Not knowing what my conditions is and the long wait to see the doctor just for 3-4 minutes and they way overcharge you, health costs have got to come down, many americans cant afford regular doctor visits.

-1	Only slightly anxious when getting a Pap smear done or when I was pregnant and getting checks for dilation. It's not particularly comfortable for me to have someone down there and the procedures are sometimes slightly uncomfortable.
1	Your health is a movable feast. One day you're fine. The next day you receive a devastating diagnosis. Every time you go to visit your doctor, you run the risk of having terrible news delivered to you. That makes those visits extremely frightening. I literally feel sick just thinking about going to the doctor!
1	Because nothing has been solved and my dr sometimes feels like they aren't listening to me. I have done test after test and still can't find out what's wrong with me and i feel like they are thinking it's in my head.

1	you never know what's going on, what they will say, or where it will all go. There is no reason to know everything, even with a doctor.

-1	i always wonder if some new disease has infected me or if i have some sickness but just haven't noticed it before.my fears are mostly unfounded of course
1	afraid of what he has to tell me whether it be good or bad but got to take it  an I know what he is going to tell me will help me 
1	Anxiously hoping that all is well with my body and that I dont have any surprise illnesses. Thats about all.
1	As I get older, I feel that I'll start having more problems. It's always in the back of my mind and am a little uneasy until the tests/blood work comes back.

-1	I'm not that fond of some of the more invasive routine procedures. I'm also aware of the history of medicine, and am concerned that some procedures might be more harmful than currently known (such as mammograms) 
-1	My only thoughts is a dislike of tests and being poked as well as prodded, not worries or anxiety really at all
-1	the waiting for the doctor to see me for my appointment.  The results from my labs. The doctor always makes me feel at ease for my appointments.
1	I just don't like long waits in the waiting room and I'm uncomfortable around the other patients in the room. I also don't like receiving bad news from the doctor, like I gained weight or my cholesterol or blood pressure is back up.
-1	I don't agree that I am anxious or worried. Worrying contributes to more worrying. When I am worried, I pray. Being anxious causes one to be more anxious. When it happens, l pray. 
-1	not being able to get to see the doctor in a reasonable length of time do not like to sit in the waiting room with other sick people
-1	I feel that most of the anxiety I experience at a doctor's visit has to do with my remembering to relay all pertinent information and to ask all questions (especially since I tend to forget an important question fairly often). I also feel anxious when going through a breast examinations, a rectal exams, or Pap smear procedures--due solely to the physical nature of the exams.
-1	If I have been having pain, I am anxious to find out what is causing it.  Most of my visits are routine physicals.

1	going to the doctor ids very scarery bacause you do not knoe what tjey will find anf you do not really want to know

1	to find out what is wrong with me and sometimes I don't want to hear the truth because it will have me overthinking about it

-1	Not liking my primary care doctor and not being able to do anything about it because he works for the VA.
1	If I am going for a regular exam, I worry if everything is going to be ok. I always expect or think the worst instead of just letting things happen. 
1	I might be worried how bad my problem is, but more likely I would be anxious about pain. Blood draws and shots are not really one of my favorite things!
1	I am only worried when there is pain (like when I broke my fibula) and the Dr can't say what has caused my pain. It took my hospital 4 weeks to finally figure out my fibula was broken. They took an xray the first day I went in, but the fracture didn't show. I was continuously in pain, and went back 4 times. On the 2nd visit, it was determined I had shingles and no xray was taken. I actually had shingles and a broke fibula at the same time. The stress o my leg caused the shingles.
-1	Finding out something that is totally unexpected. If I'm going in for pain in my ankle, I'm expecting some good/bad news regarding my ankle.  If I'm just going in for a simple biometric screening and leave being told I'm Hep-C or Diabetic, etc .
1	That they will say anything about Cancer and that really scares me alot do u have it or do you want money from me etc
-1	A little anxiety or worry at the doctor's office arises when (although you try to avoid it) it is revealed that you disagree with what the doctor is suggesting. They tend to become rude or completely unhelpful after that. 
1	I wouldn't want them to find that I had a debilitating disease. No one wants to endure a life threatening disease that would wipe out one's savings and place a strain on family.
-1	Nothing really. They know me so I feel comfortable around the Doctor and his staff. The only thing that makes me feel anxious is what to get mom and me for lunch.
1	because i have a few health conditions that are chronic i am always fearful she is going to find something else wrong with me
1	I just get most anxious when I get shots, have to have an IV, and when I have to get blood drawn.  I also get anxious when I have to give a urine sample.
1	if i think i have something bad going on. if i think it is bad i over think and get myself worked up
-1	Usually the thing that worries me the most is the cost of the visit if the visit is not covered by my insurance.
-1	the thought of having my blood drawn or that I might find out something that I dont want to know or bad about my health
-1	Usually don't feel negative then. Just really dislike having to wait a long time in the waiting room.
1	I have a fear of needles so I feel uneasy or worried about whether or not they will need bloodwork. I always get worried too that they won't find anything to help me with my condition.
1	What makes me most anxious about visiting the doctor is them finding something seriously wrong with me that cannot be treated or is very difficult to treat.
1	Worry that the doctor won't take my complaint seriously. Worry that a serious health problem will present as I get older.
-1	i'm afraid to learn more bad news from my doctor about my condition that i didn't want to know. Ann visiting doctor's office everytime does make very anxious and nervous
-1	I just hate going to the doctors it is not pleasant. So many other thing I'd rather do. Always afraid of the what ifs
1	I do not like being naked in front of anyone other than my husband, so there are negative feelings around that. Also, there is always the possibility of bad news.
-1	That my blood pressure shall spike (I think I have white coat syndrome) and they will want to increase my blood pressure medicines.
1	I dont like to find out my co pay since it changes so much for where I go. I don't really understand why it does but it's not the insurance I use since I was told everyone no matter what get the same charge depending on what they are going there for
-1	Just general not knowing what might be wrong or what the treatment options might be. The unknowing is the worst for me. 
1	Normally, if I'm at the doctors, I'm in pretty poor shape and it's a last stitch effort. I'm worried and anxious mostly because of how little faith i have in them... and for very good reason
1	I've visited doctors who I don't feel take the time to listen to all my concerns and symptoms. Which was a real problem for me. It took years for My endometriosis to be diagnosed.
1	I am not anxious when I go to the doctor.  They take all the time with me as is necessary and I never feel rushed.
1	I have several health issues as well as my family does, so I'm always concerned my health has gotten worse or I've developed a new health problem.

-1	I don't like being touched by strangers, particularly in intimate areas of my body.  It is uncomfortable having to remove my clothing, especially for a female nurse or physician's assistant.
1	"I have ""white coat syndrome"" because my old doctor was often mean to me - part of the reason was my fault because I am a recovered alcoholic and I was drinking when I saw him and I was terrified he was going to find something major wrong with me"
1	I worked in the field for a number of years, but not in a professional capacity. I have some knowledge but math is not my strong suit..
-1	I have had t surgeries on my feet over the past two years. I am always anxious and worried when seeing him. I am always praying that things are a lot better with my feet. 
1	I do not enjoy others looking at my nakedness. I do fear sometimes that the doctor could find something I'm not aware of.
-1	It all depends what I am seeing the doctor for. Routine checkups I do not worry about. When I have a problem I may start to wonder what may be wrong.
-1	I have osteoporosis and I feel worried waiting for scan results.  The medicine I am currently taking has caused leg pain severe enought that I can't walk for several hours, and I am afraid that this pain will reoccur.
1	When I have no clue what is wrong with me and neither do they so you know you'll end up going through a treadmill of specialists to figure it our
1	I think that I'm being ruched through my visit. I feel like any questions I have arem't taken seriously and I feel under appreciated
-1	uncertain of what my problem might turn out to be. Not being able to take the medication proscribed. My body has a hard time adjusting to some medications. So I may have to try two or three to find the one I can take. This has proved hard to do during my life. I have had some bad reactions from previous medications. 
1	because of the unknown and also do to seeing and watching many programs about doctors do not help either this makes me jittery.
1	The unknown is what I am most anxious or worried about.  What if they find something wrong with me ?  What if they tell me something that I don't want to hear?  I also get anxious when I get on a scale and I have to get weighed when I go to the doctor. 
1	I am typically most anxious or worried about the results of different lab whether its the standard panel, STD screenings, and the pap smear results.  I take pride in making sure that I am as healthy as possible, but the results from lab almost always have me concern.  
1	The Dr. knows best. But my family dr. seems to always find something wrong maybe cholesterol or diabetes I can't afford to be sick I have a heart condition and it takes all my payroll for that
1	just going to the doctor and waiting on them make me worried and then wondering what they may find if doing tests
1	Finding out something is wrong with me.Also the possible pain associated with the procedure and the stress.

1	I am worried about my health status, that I might go under operation for my sickness and that it would cost a lot too. 
-1	When I go to the doctor I'm always worried they will find something wrong. It's just a crazy feeling. Why ? I don't know.Its like that all of the time no matter what the reason for me being there.
-1	I worry sometimes that the doctor will find something that is wrong with me and need to do other procedures to help me get better.
-1	Nothing.  I have no anxieties or worries when visiting my doctor or his office.  They are very thorough and efficient.
1	afraid they might find something, sometimes afraid to ask questions hate being in the waiting room not sure what else to type ummm
-1	To be honest with you after my mental institutional visits there isn't too much that scares me other than me over reacting to other peoples transgressions.  Like I said I am smart and powerful there is only so much many times before I no longer walk away.  It's common sense.  Follow the rules.  However there still are people who don't do that.  Grown adults too.  What makes me feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office is they won't help me because I can't pay for it.  If that happens I have to figure it out on my own.  
-1	Mainly wondering if he's going to recommend something like shots or blood work that will be unpleasant.

-1	i'm always worried that I forget what the doctor says after I leave the room and walk to my car. That is all I have to say
1	the germs and if my child were to contract and illness that they didn't even have yet. especially at a well child visit when they are perfectly healthy.
1	That they will say something they saw in my lab test results was not looking good and it will be bad or not so great news, that they say something is wrong with me
-1	my weight and my blood work . about my a1c is what i worry about the most. even though i watch everything very careful
1	I am not so much anxious about the Doctor as anxious about the explaining of my previous history. I hate starting over every 2 years or so.
1	I don't like disrobing and being probed, I don't like being weighed, and I can't stand gynecological exams, which I find painful. Being made to wait a long time beforehand causes me stress as well.
-1	just going raises my blood pressure.  but my ortho is so handsome it puts me at ease!  i worry because i feel like an old car falling apart
1	I am always afraid that my cancer might come back so I dread the tests that I have to take to make sure it will probably be like that for the rest of my life

-1	I only go when feeling sick and do not have the energy to tell what is wrong.I do not like to go to the doctors and usually have a problem and am feeling bad/.
1	When I tell them about my problem and they ask numerous questions and then says to go get a prescription without explaining why.
1	I am rushed into the doctors office like cattle.  he never reads my files or listens to my complaints.
-1	My issue is I'm worried that my doctor will judge my health personally and make it seem like I'm a bad person because of my health issue. I'm coming to them for help and I don't want to feel like I'm being scolded for a health problem.
1	Worried that something might be very wrong or require surgery or an invasive procedure. I am very afraid of needles.
1	There is always the worry that there might be something wrong and it does make me nervous at times so that is why going to the doctor can make me anxious
-1	not knowing what to do when I go see my doctor and he says I have something wrong that I need a drug or a shot or surgary . I always check with my daughter and sometimes even take her with me to the doctor appointment .
1	I feel anxious or worried about whether my tests will come back okay. Also, I get anxious about getting blood drawn. And I'm worried that my questions will be stupid.

-1	I am not anixous or worried when I go to the doctors office, because I know he's going to tell me what is the problem and how to take care of it
-1	I really don't feel anxious. I go seeking relief, not fear.I think my biggest concern could be the possibility of a long wait which doesn't happen often now. Being Type 1 diabetic I am more concerned with A1C and creatnine levels but I don't really worry.
1	I AM JUST HOPING THAT I AM HEALTHY AND NOTHING IS FOUND, IT MAINLY DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF DOCTOR I AM SEEING AND WHAT I AM THERE FOR
1	My doctors office staff is not the most friendly or helpful to you There are few that are nice, but not over helpful.
-1	Having rude and uncaring office staff, sitting around sick people in the waiting room and staff not letting you know if the Doc. is running late.
-1	That something unexpected pops up and we have to make major decisions about the next course of actions.
1	Because to put it right out there - I don't well I am not used to, physical contact. I have been alone so long, I barely do more than a handshake. I never hug, never am close to anyone. So, when a doc is there checking and taking blood or all that, it is nervous. It is hard. Especially when I need to get an ultrasound on my testicles. As I said..... it is hard.
1	That they will find I have some dangerous illness and I will have to either spend a large amount of money getting myself better or be satisfied with a shorter life span.
-1	When i visit the doctor's office I am most concerned that whatever test they may perform, the results will not come back good.
-1	I am too old to worry about the stupid stuff. Tons of doctors have seen my junk. I had a nursing class watch me give birth. (I was the only one not screaming, it was my 3rd kid). So unless someone was going to do a procedure that I knew was going to hurt really bad I do not get anxious.
-1	Anxious for the results of health issues and treatment plan. Worried how health issues may be impacted by new treatment plan and medication 
-1	Not sure if they can help me or not or what might be wrong.  Hopeing the doctor will take their time and listen to me.
1	The fear of judgment from the examiner in regards to my obesity, I know every time I go I am going to get a lecture about loosing weight. 
1	i am always worried something could be wrong that i did not expect. If you look hard enough something is always wrong
-1	If I can't properly explain symptoms I'm having and be able to convey them to the doctor, this would make me anxious and hoping that I was making myself clear.
1	My mind is thinking about all the dreaded diseases I might have since last visit. I think about friends illness and hope I don;t have them.
-1	I feel worried if I do not know what to expect or I do not know how long it will take to do what they want
1	Are they going to change my meds? Are they going to have to order blood work or something involving a needle of some sort or another./
1	mainly the things that make me most worried or anxious are the follow-up appointments and anything new she might find
1	These issues were not a result of my current doctor, but one in the past.  He made me feel very unsafe and vulnerable by his predatory behavior.  He asked inappropriate questions, and I did not know how to get away from him, however, I did refuse to see him again, and I told them why.
-1	I worry That he will find something wrong.  also I hate being weighted because I am overweight. Don't like getting undressed.
1	Only when I have unexplained symptoms am I anxious. If I have been unable to treat something I tend to over react.
-1	"It has to do with my anxiety issues, the crowds of people, the small room.  I also worry about my lungs as I am a smoker and attempted several times to quit.  He has put me on Chantix which I did not succeed at, them patches, gum, etc. which have not  helped yet.  He tell me ""You have to put your foot down about it"". I need to quit as soon as possible and get very anxious about my exams."
1	I do not like sitting and waiting and then being rushed through the exam as if I really don't matter.  My time is just as imprtant and for the doctor to only give a couple of minutes turning you over to a nurse pract. just isn't right
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried about visiting a doctor, that's what I'm there for.  The only time I'm in any way anxious is when I've been tested and am waiting results.
1	THAT I WILL GET A DIAGNOSIS THAT I AM NOT HAPPY WITH, I.E., WE HAVE FOUND CANCER IN THE EXAMINATION BUT IT IS VERY TREATABLE AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE SPREAD.  THE ARTERY CLOGGED IN YOUR HEART HAS BEEN CLEARED AND A STENT PUT IN AND OTHER CLOGS HAVE BEEN CLEARED AS WELL.
-1	"I most worried that the doctor will simply ignore my complaints and do the ""see me again in three months"" nonsense I've been dealing with for the past several years. "
-1	I am rarely sick.  when I go to the doctor it is routine follow up on chronic diseases I have dealt with for over 20 years. 
-1	I have never felt any sense of dread or nervousness or anxiety about an exam . I really have no reason to feel that way. 
-1	i feel i may have wrong with me that i do not know anything about  but it is best to get an honest opinion
1	If I am not sure of what is causing the problem, my anxiety will be higher than if I understand the issues.
-1	The only problem I have I. Any Dr's office is the wait.  That is all I dread but I also know each patient is being cared for professionally and tenderly by the staff.
-1	I only feel a little anxious because of my blood pressure.  I have been put on blood pressure medicine to control it but I am working very hard to get off of the medication.
1	what makes me feel most anxious about visiting a doctor, is that after getting an examination or a health check i always think that their going to find something a lot more serious or even life threatening than i had expected
-1	Nothing makes  me anxious  or worried about seeing my doctor. She always  gives me a good checkup and tells me if something is wrong and how to fix it.

Thanks be to God, it has recently been decided (and the doc concurs) that, absent specific symptoms, those my age and older can skip ""routine"" colonoscopy due to cost-benefit evaluation and in light of the difficult/increasing physical burden posed on the aging by rigorous draining preparation.

-1	the unknown, or how bad something is really going to be. or if it wont be anything at all. I try to know get myself worked up before I know what is really going on. 
1	Might be something wrong with me that is serious.  I really believe that God put all cures here on earth and you must follow what he intended.  I think a lot of doctors should not be doctors but went into medicine for the money.  Very disturbing.  I think most medications do more harm than good.  I believe in prayer and natural medicine.  Western medicine is so overrated and people should really research alternatives.
1	Both sides of my family have a history of cancer.  I don't really liked to be touched, and I hate the way I look.

-1	Because my dad died of cancer at a relatively young age, I always have in the back of my mind that the same thing could happen to me, and am relieved when I have a positive outcome.
-1	Wondering if we'll have the time to really talk and get me help.  I don't push enough sometimes, but don't like to be ignore either
1	they don't have a clue as to what bedside manner or proper inter personal skills are and dont want to learn how to deal with patients on a personal level. 
-1	What worries me the most is that one of my conditions has gotten worse, or needing to add another medication.

1	I don't care for doctors or emergency rooms that's what makes me anxious.  I waste my time.  The reason why I get anxious and worried is because of my experience with a majority of doctors, urgent care, and emergency rooms.  I had surgery for a hystertomy, got staph, had 4 doctors visits including urgent care, and ER, went in shock and no one would believe me until a nurse at the ER had tested me after I left the ER.  My GYN said it was pop, my primary doctor completely ignored me after I told her don't look at the paper results look at me, the Urgent care said to take an extra high blood pressure bill, and the ER doctor had me touching my nose with my finger and diagnosed with urinary infection i had no symptoms for.  I suffer to this day and yes I still get hairbrained answers like to go check my eyes for the brain fog.  So that is why I get anxious.  Finally I did get a good learning urologist who performed the other half of my surgery for a urinary band who saw how sick I was and she saved my life from the staph infection after weeks of begging someone to listen that I felt like death.

-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office.  I have no problem going into the office.
-1	I think I'm more anxious about not finding the cause for my pain or injury.  There is nothing more discouraging than being shuffled between doctors who say there us nothing wrong with you based on their specialty and sending you to the next doctor.  In the meantime, the condition worsens, and you can either become so discouraged that  you give up going to the doctor and try to self medicate, or you lie and say you're cured.  
1	sometimes i worry that the doctors wont give me the specific medicine i need. my friend has this problem frequently.

1	Just the thought of having a whole exam and what they could mean. The unknown of if anything could be wrong.

1	I am always afraid of them telling me that I have something bad wrong with me and that I am doing to die. Those words are very harsh for anyone to hear.
-1	I am sometimes worried that I can't convey my issues well enough. I'm also cognisant of other people waiting, so I don't want to take too much time. 
-1	That he's going to scold me for still living with my boyfriend...someone he doesn't trust and doesn't think is good for me.  He's also probably going to tell me I need to stop worrying about others and to start taking care of myself.
-1	i guess like everyone going to the doctor makes me a little nervous and unsure about what the visit might bring. you always hope for the best but have in the back of your mind about what a diagnosis might be. 
1	I want everything to go well and most healthy well people are not at the doctor.  Just want to get a good report

-1	I do not feel worried about going to the doctor, because it is necessary to always visit the doctor to disperse any conditions.
-1	"The chance that she might have  ""bad"" news for me. Something that might alter my life expectancy or be potentially fatal. In general though these thoughts aren't that strong; just a moderate sense of worry."
1	when they do see you its in and out . they don't really evaulate you like they should. and sometimes they get pretty mean and rude with me as well and i don't like it when they are like that
-1	Because I want to get it done, so it dosent conflict with my schedule. So i can get get done quickly. In and out.

1	The thing that makes me most anxious or worried is the possibly of obtaining a negative diagnosis that will have a substantial impact upon my life.
-1	just the setting makes me anxious, worry about what they will find or any additional tests that are required
1	certain parts of the exam are invasive and uncomfortable. it is a cold and sterile environment. i  do not like being poked and prodded
1	I worry that I won't bring up all relevant health information and we will miss something important. I know a lot of diseases can be asymptomatic, so I am just concerned that small things might actually be related to an underlying issue.
-1	I'm at an age where I don't want my doctor to find anything wrong with me, but at my age that isn't going to happen. So it becomes, what surprise are you going to spring on me now?

1	my doctor gives me the way to express my feeling and sometimes does not listen it is frustrating and a little dishearting as I need his attention.

-1	I have several health problems.  I am anxious that things might  not be going as smoothly as I think they are.
1	I really hate shots or invasive procedures (*i.e pap smears) I also hate not knowing what to expect as far what will happen during the visit. This worry always goes away as soon as the actual doctor has arrived. I think it is the waiting that gets me most nervous.

They will see that I am poor, and automatically assume I am there for ""another"" fix, or there for free pain drugs. I'm there becuase I have a legetiment issue with my body or mind, and don't know where else to go. But what they see is a poor, druggie looking to get another hit of their favorit cocktail. They see a ""ignorant hick"" that is incapable of processing complex information such as personal heath. They don't see an individual. They either see an issue they don't want to deal with, or a nice little bonus paycheck. The prior dismiss all my problems stating, ""it's nothing to worry about becuase I (the doctor) don't know at it is,"" the later stating, ""well, I see that Medicaid will pay for these sixteen different tests, let's do them all! (when none of them are nessesary)."" They lie, cheat, and steal like everyone else with power and money. If I should ever find myself feeling so terrible that I am considering seeing another doctor, I will assume I'm inches from death and STILL not go simply becuase they make me feel worse, mentally and physically, every time I go.

1	I'm more worried that I will have to see a doctor who doesn't know me at all.  That's a possibility with clinics.  I have chronic health issues and hate it when I have to explain everything from the beginning - 26 years ago they started.  
1	He doesn't take time to hear the symptoms. He is quick to make an assessment without knowing all symptoms and how the make me feel. He just writes a prescription 
1	That they are going to tell me something I already know and not prescribe me what I really need. Or I really get nervous when blood work has to be done because I'm scared of needles.
1	Obviously it depends on the reason for the visit. I suppose a strange growth might be the most worrisome with a history of cancer in my family.
-1	Nothing. I do not have any serious conditions and mostly go for routine visits. I am a strong believer in preventative medicine
1	The things that makes the most worried is when my doctor has ordered a test and it takes longer than it is supposed to get the results back.

1	That they are going to find something else wrong with me, as if there aren't enough already, and it is going to require more tests and my insurance won't pay for it. 
-1	Nothing that I can think of, but it has been a long time since I've had the need to see a phsyician about a medical problem.

1	I don't know my new doctor and we have already had some head butting so I am not sure what to expect when I go into to see her.
1	When my doctor does a pap smear, I get anxious and nervous, he makes me comfortable and good, he is gentle
1	When I walk into my doctor's office I am worried about what he might tell me because I have to blood work all the time for high cholesterol, diabetes, ect and you do not know if you will get good results or good news, and you never know if he will find anything new or not 
-1	Not much, since I go there once every few months. It's gets very, very annoying-- what else can I do? 
1	It is the idea of trusting this person to be knowledgeable and willing to admit if they do not know an answer and then be willing to do the research.  In my father's case, I was on the West Coast and he was in Florida.  His doctor called me at my mother's request, told me the name of the cancer he supposedly had and told me to look it up.
1	I am always worried that something will be found with my health that is not very good and it always has me worried and anxious
1	What makes me most anxious is visiting the doctors office in general. Even if I don't go for a bad reason, and just a check up, I still get a bit anxious.

1	I do not like the blood checks, I worried that the needle that pokes can have an infections that can affects me at any times that I despises. I do not think that the needles is clean enough. 
1	having to speak with the doctor and determine what a n appropriate course of treatment may or may not be as it pertains to my health
1	Not knowing what is next and what to expect in some situations. To have other people to be the ones to figure out things and me have no control
-1	i am always worried that there is something seriously wrong with me that i am unaware of. that is why i always get nervous.
1	having contracted more serious conditions, due to age, progressing pre-existing conditions. Aging seems to just bring on more and more issues
1	everything there is not one specific thing and theses minimums are crazy to impose on someone trying to answer these questions
1	Because I have been very healthy with no major illnesses or longterm conditions, I am attentive to symptoms and feelings when I am not feeling well. I sometimes wonder when/ how that could change when I cannot identify what might be physically wrong with me
1	Sometimes I get embarrassed and that's why I feel that way. I'm not always willing you share my problems
1	It makes me worried when I get anxious because I don't wanna be sick when I get tests done it freaks me out 
1	That they may find something of greater concern than the reason for my visit, which may lead to more medication, more visits, and more side affects.
-1	Only when there's a new test result is the time I get worried. Also, when more testing is needed would be another I get anxious or worried.
1	My body not being healthy and knowing it might not be but that why I go to the drs is to find out what's wrong with me
1	It's just uncomfortable - especially if you have to undress or if it is gynological or something embarrassing
1	Im nervous because im prepared for the worst.  I avoid doctors at all costs.  They have to check you and examine your body which i dont like.

1	shots make me anxious, as well as finding out something is seriously wrong. Or that I'll be on medicine for the rest of my life.
1	if they are truly going to be able to help me.if they want to answer my questions.nothing else makes me worried at the doctors office..
1	even though i know there's nothing to worry about with my health, i still think that my doctor will diagnose me with something bad
1	That they could prescribe me with a random drug that could end up causing me to die later on.  This is bad. 
1	it depends of the issue I have, if I have a strange pain and the doctor ask to do blood test or deep exam, at that time I will be a little be afraid 
-1	I have no fears or worries of any diagnosis of any conditions I may I have. I do fear the lack of being told of anything I may have or the lack of proper research into symptoms I may have. I also distrust when I have procedures done on me and I'm told it's nothing. Especially after I research the finding they found and find there is some type of alarm to the findings they came up with.
1	I feelanxious that my doctor will tell me theres something physically wrong with me like an illness or something
-1	Right the only thing is hearing that I have major health issues going on.as with anyone everyone hates receiving bad news.

1	I feel most anxious visiting the doctor's office when I need to have blood work and tests. I greatly hate needles.
-1	Nothing really just get a little anxious when i ho there no specific reason that i can think of usually everything goes good and never had any problems there

1	I think it is the thought they they might find something seriously wrong and this is something that everyone wants to avoid.
1	Always wondering if something may be wrong just nervous to hear bad news. Plus you never know why they may be taking blood or whatever 
1	Just worry that she might find something is wrong.  I just don't enjoy all the checking and feeling around on my body.
-1	Only if I have not been feeling well  and I am not sure what the doctor might find. There is a lot of Cancer and Heart problems in my family.

1	Not knowing if I'll be given the best advice or options for my condition. Not believing that that doctor cares enough about to better advice my on what to do. It makes me scared, worried and anxious going to a doctor's office just to leave feeling disappointed that I didn't get the answers I was looking for or the care that I need.

1	Not knowing if I'm going to get the proper care or treatment, and by me not having a good insurance provider you have to deal with it.

1	Them finding something wrong with me that I have no control over. Finding something in a test and their is no cure.
1	WHEN THEY TAKE FOREVER TO GET BACK WITH YOU REGARDING YOUR RESULTS, OR WHEN THEY CALL YOU BACK TO THE OFFICE FOR MORE TEST
1	 I am someone who worries and can overanalyze situations easily. The way I feel can be circumstantial. For example, if I'm in pain and don't know what's wrong, I'll be very nervous to visit the doctor because of what could be wrong. Fear of the unknown or what's to come.
