They will see that I am poor, and automatically assume I am there for ""another"" fix, or there for free pain drugs. I'm there becuase I have a legetiment issue with my body or mind, and don't know where else to go. But what they see is a poor, druggie looking to get another hit of their favorit cocktail. They see a ""ignorant hick"" that is incapable of processing complex information such as personal heath. They don't see an individual. They either see an issue they don't want to deal with, or a nice little bonus paycheck. The prior dismiss all my problems stating, ""it's nothing to worry about becuase I (the doctor) don't know at it is,"" the later stating, ""well, I see that Medicaid will pay for these sixteen different tests, let's do them all! (when none of them are nessesary)."" They lie, cheat, and steal like everyone else with power and money.

Seven years later and poverty is the result.

0.452400	I don't like sitting around in the waiting room not know the people there nor knowing what is going to happen in the doctors office. Uncertainty is not my strong point. I like to know what is going to happen. I understand that can't always be the case but I like to eliminate variables. 
0.500000	I am a major hypochondriac. Every time I go to the doctor's I am convinced that I'm going to be told I have something fatal, even though I'm still pretty young. It gets me really uneasy, unless I know for a fact it's just a cold.
0.428600	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office is that I will be informed with information that details that I have a serious illness that may require drastic treatment or may have no treatment process that is successful at all. I do not like to take prescription medicines If I do not have too. I become fearful for my own health and would make decisions onwards that I hope will only benefit my health and help me move down a process of recovery. I would have faith in my doctor and hope that he/she takes the necessary precautions/procedures to help my recover from my illness as well. 
0.142857	i dont feel anxious or worried when i go to my doctor but if i did have those feelings it would be she might find something i wasnt  expecting to hear.

0.666700	"After having blood work, I know my cholesterol is high and I know that he is going to ""lecture"" me about my eating habits which makes me very uncomfortable, he wants me to bring it down naturally."
0.571400	the visit in general. I don't want to hear bad news
0.500000	I am most anxious about the results. I am scared that they will find a disease or condition that will affect my life. I am also anxious about how the doctor will handle my care. Third, I am anxious because I am self-conscious about my body.
0.952381	Not knowing what the doctor is going to find is my biggest concern. Even if I am not worried about something, ,y family does not have the best health history, so I am always worried. Sometimes enough that I don't even go to the doctor regardless of what is going on. 
0.285714	ususaly when i am there to learn about my blood work or to do a cancer check to make sure i have no more cancer
0.309524	I am usually anxious fron wondering if something is wrong or if he'll find something I wasn't aware of.
0.142900	The only thing that makes me really anxious would be getting shots or have blood taken.   I am in relatively good health so I don't usually have health problems so I am not usually worried when I see a doctor 
0.595238	HAVING TO WAIT A LONG TIME AND GETTING A BAD DIAGNOSIS.  HAVING TO UNDERGO EXTREME MEDICAL ATTENTION.  DRAINING AND EXHAUSTING LIKE HAVING TO FAST BEFORE A TEST.
0.904800	I definitely get anxious when I visit the doctors because I feel like they will find something serious.  I tend to jump to the worst conclusion when a test result comes back and when I am asked to come in again.  I get really nervous/worried when I have to wait for those results because I often go into a rabbit hole of reading things on WebMD and other sources to find out more.  Knowing that these visits are to prevent illness from happening or help cure them only eases these worries a little. 
0.285700	I am very comfortable in doctor's offices and in hospital surroundings. I grew up in that environment because my mom worked at a hospital, and so I was always there and the other doctors were friendly and doting toward me. So, I am never anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office unless I fear or expect something is very wrong with me.
0.285714	I just don't like anyone prodding and poking me plus I don't like the wait time I have to sit through in order to see my doctor and I'm always short on money so I tend to get afraid that my insurance will somehow ask for more money as in a copay mentioned or other medical tests he may want to run
0.666700	i feel anxious with the waiting i suppose, especially if something is wrong i want to know what it is, how serious, etc. spending time in the doctor's office isn't what i would be doing out of choice
0.357143	afraid they are going to find something else wrong with me. i already have several medical conditions that require medication. i dont want to have another one
0.523800	What makes me feel most anxious is not know if something serious is wrong. Also, there are worries about medical coverage and insurance. Costs of medical treatment also make me anxious.
0.666667	"A little fearful of what they might find.  Anxious over what procedures or tests they might recommend and my being in opposition to these recommendations. Worried that new medication may be introduced just to ""try out"" said new medication when old medication is working fine."
0.523800	I feel anxious and worried that perhaps someone will make a mistake that very well could have been avoided.
0.547619	With having MS I want to make sure to address all issues or questions I may have, so I write all of them to reduce being anxious.
0.357143	I always have a slight feeling that there might be something seriously wrong with me. It is actually an unreasonable feeling but it still exists.
0.571400	I do not really feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. If I ever have, it would have been for some symptom or pain with unknown origin that I did not know what was wrong with me and wanted to get to the bottom of it.
0.690476	What may seem minor or unimportant to me could be something she wants checked out. I have to let her be the one in charge and let my worries and anxieties go by the wayside.
0.833300	Just listening to what my Doctor is telling me about my impairments. There is usually never any improvement and no signs of possible or potential improvement. It is essentially my Doctor telling me that I will probably have these issues for the remainder of my life. 
0.571400	Nothing makes me so. I believe in God's providence in everything including my own health.
0.285714	Just going and not knowing what they might find and hoping its nothing really bad or even untreatable
0.571429	if i think i have something bad going on. if i think it is bad i over think and get myself worked up
0.738095	I always get nervous as my Primary never get along, my blood pressure shoots up and I usually end up crying
0.333333	He's going to recommend I do something I'd rather not, like quit drinking or doing more exercise or adding a prescription that I don't feel good about taking.
0.880952	I never know if she's trying to give me meds that she pushes on other people and not really help me since she doesn't pay attention to me 
0.928600	Just the uncertainty of it all. Not knowing if what's wrong with me is serious or mind running away with it all. Thankfully almost every time I thought there was something serious wrong with me it turned out to be nothing. But I have bad anxiety and a panic disorder so it's the worry and not knowing that makes it hard for me to deal with. Once I leave there though I usually feel fine and relieved.
0.666667	To think that something can go wrong or give me bad news makes me worried about visiting my doctor indeed
0.500000	That they might find something wrong with me
0.476190	Waiting for two hours to actually be seen by my doctor.  She is so booked up because she is such a good doctor, but the waiting times are unfair and ridiculous.

The doctors and nurses are human too and it is embarrassing if something happens to me that does not normally happen if someone had taken care of themselves better. Like going to the dentist for example and having bad teeth because I donât brush everyday and could be prevented if I werenât so lazy. Or getting a UTI or a yeast infection because I was holding my pee for too long when I shouldnât have or not wiping myself properly.

0.357100	I worry the doctor will not listen appropriately.  I worry that I'll be sitting alone for a long period of time waiting with only a paper on.  I worry that I haven't told the whole truth inadvertently.  
0.857100	The doctors always like to blame the patent for  everything.  They dont understand  that we  have a  real life out side  our health. I  cant make  it  to  6 doctors  in a  week and  still work enough to be able to pay for gas  to get to them doctors appointments  
0.595238	I do not go to the doctor's office very often - only when there is something I am concerned about.  Therefore, I am anxious or worried that something is truly wrong with me.

0.238095	Just the fact that I could come up with a medical condition that is dangerous and I don't like hearing that kind of news about myself
0.523810	I am most concerned about the doctor telling me that I have or might have a serious, even terminal, medical condition or illness.  This is certainly something that nobody ever wants to think about.  It would be a scary thing to contemplate for sure.

0.500000	I get anxious about what they will say.  Since I have anxiety I worry my blood pressure will be higher then normal because of how I'm feeling and not how it normally is.
0.738100	I worry about the tests.  I'm ashamed that I did not lose weight or do everything my doctor told me and that I'd disappoint them.
0.714286	I'm worried that I will get in trouble for something. I know how silly that sounds, but I'm not sure how else to explain it. I'm worried there's something else wrong with my health that I missed or didn't see because I put off going to the doctor for too long. 
0.285700	If I am going to see the doctor, I may be anxious or worried that they will find a problem that could be serious.
0.309500	That he might find something wrong.
0.523800	I'm always afraid they might find something bad.  I have chronic abdominal pain and have not been able to get a diagnosis since it began over three years ago.

0.666700	What they thing about me and how am trying to make my health better. Am  so worried about what they are going to say about my health getting bad.

0.571400	I am nervous about getting sick or finding out that I have something wrong with me. Overall though, I am anxious about the office's cleanliness. 
0.547600	I always think the worst possible outcome when I go to the doctor. Because I read all kinds of health information online, I tend to think that I have the illness and my doctor tries to remain optimistic with me and not to think the worst all of the time.
0.738100	What makes me feel most anxious or worried is going in there paying my co-pay and them not listen to me.  I do not go to the doctors if there really is not a problem.

0.142857	I not really nervous or worried when I go to the doctor's office other than them having to take my weight.
0.142857	nothing under the sun supprises me. if you think bad bad things will happen f you think about good things good things will hapen
0.571429	Even though I am feeling all right I always wonder whether or not the doctor will diagnose me as having some sort of an ailment.
0.571429	Worried that something serious could be wrong or I would require surgery or some other complicated issue.
0.285714	The wait time either in the waiting room or exam room. I hate waiting on anything or anyone. So, it stresses me to do that. 
0.309500	That the doctor might find something wrong with my health.
0.833300	When visiting the doctor's office, I am afraid that I may get some news that could be very bad. I am also afraid that I may have not been following the doctor's orders as I should and he may be upset with me. I am also afraid of the costs that may be incurred.  I am also afraid of needles so the thought of a shot is upsetting. 
0.142900	I have a severe social anxiety problem, so being out in a public place makes me anxious, but there's nothing about the doctor's office in particular that's upsetting for me. I usually feel more calm once I'm in the examining room than I feel before I go because I know I'll be taken care of.
0.404762	Wondering what the outcome of a prognosis will be can make me feel uneasy. Also worry about paying medical bills can give me and uncomfortable feeling.
0.357143	Mainly just my triage. I am concerned most about my blood pressure and my weight. Otherwise I am fully aware of my conditions so rarely do I worry.
0.547600	"I feel most anxious about the ""what ifs"". What if something were wrong, or something was gong to happen medically. I often get anxious about my interactions with a professiol, I am not a ""people"" person."
0.666700	I always feel slightly uncomfortable being examined, they may be more to do with my personal insecurities than with the doctor or the exam itself.
0.571400	I get most anxious when I'm waiting for test results or something. That's when I feel the most anxious, the waiting. I also feel anxious when something painful, like a shot, is about to happen.
0.238100	The first thing that makes me anxious is getting on the scale. I dread that more than anything, and also I get very worried about cost because I am self pay.
0.881000	I feel anxious that I won't get the right diagnosis or that the doctor won't tell me preventative or natural methods to my health issues.  I don't just want a drug.  I want to know how to prevent my condition from getting worse and what natural steps I can take for my health before taking a drug.
0.714300	Being told things I already know or cannot do anything about makes me feel anxious. Also, being examined makes me feel vulnerable. I had an ob once who called me fat the entire time I was pregnt and that I would be obese after giving birth. I knew I had gained a lot of weight but I was eating well and was exercising. Being pregnt I felt like I had no control over being able to actually lose weight until after giving  birth. It ended up I had edema and lost 45lbs in 4 weeks after delivery but ever since sometimes I feel anxious, dread or worrysome when doctors tell me something I already know eapecially if it is something I have little control over or are currently working on.
0.761905	I always fear I'm going to have diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer. Or find out that I have a rare incurable disease. I always think I have 3 months to live after that come back with that clip board. I honestly just expect the worst and I don't like people touching me.
0.333333	Since I am generally healthy, I am not worried or anxious when visiting the doctor.  If anything, I am concerned that my blood pressure will be low at the doctor's, because it does fluctuate a bit, and I don't really want any higher dosages of medication.
0.571429	I don't have health insurance, so the most troubling issue that I have is paying my health care bills. The second issue is that my doctor is young and seems very quite, she isn't very vocal with comforting me in my medical issues.
0.642900	It makes me most fearful that something will be seriously wrong . Or that something might be painful. But the unknown is worse.
0.523800	I just do not like visiting the doctor.  This brings worry to me and makes me anxious.  also, I am an anxious person anyway so I stay anxious.
0.428600	I worry about new findings or a change in my health.  I also worry if a procedure is going to be uncomfortable or painful.  
0.619048	the part that makes me feel the most anxious or worried about visiting the doctors office is getting bad news about my or my daughters health.
0.714286	That's they might find something or tell me something bad about me that I didn't know and have to be a shot or something 
0.333333	That they might find something new or put me on more medications. I am not a pill popper. Well I don't like pills but I take them because I have to
0.380952	i have a tendency to pass out sometimes so that makes me nervous even if the visit is a routine visit
0.309524	Because sometimes I get sick enough that I would go see a Dr at a government hospital and the Dr would need to look into my ears with a light prob or feel parts of my upper body and ask questions.
0.142857	When I don't know the unknown or just the entire process of waiting for test results to come back can be a little anxious. But overall that feeling doesn't last long.
0.500000	If I have a condition or symptom that I do not know what it is caused by, I can get a little anxious or worried about it. 
0.761900	I always worry that the doctor will find something significantly wrong with me. For example, I am a cancer patient, and constantly worry that he will find my cancer has spread. No matter how simple the problem, I become very anxious prior to my appointment.
0.452381	I'm not usually worried when i go for a check up at my doctors office. If i feel uneasy it's usually some other external factor that is making me feel that way 
1.000000	They have a definite lack of communications skills, and bedside manner, forget it. They either talk down to you or not much at all.
0.428600	that he might lie to me in order to make me feel better
0.714300	The primary cause of worry is the possibility that the doctor could discover something harmful in my body. This would lead to great discomfort as well as fincial liabilities. 
0.142900	I have never felt anxious or worried when I go to see my doctor. The only way I would be if he found something wrong. He has never made me feel anything but trust and loyalty. I am very pleased with this man
0.642900	I don't want the doctor to randomly tell me I've been doing something wrong, or that I have 2 months to live, or some type of cancer. All of those ideas freak me out. I don't want there to be something wrong with me. 
0.761900	The one thing that makes me feel the most anxious has been a couple times when doctors pushed medications instead of making sure I actually needed it.  If there are major symptoms and they don't take the time to find the source and instead just automatically try and mask a problem I feel very angry and defeated.  I've wasted time and then you have to go somewhere else.
0.142857	Depending on my symptoms or what my reason for a doctor's visit are, I sometime worry about what the result will be & how long it will take to schedule a referral appointment.
0.619000	I just don't like medical visits. You're vulnerable and not in control.
0.476200	I'm anxious about what he might say I have and it's untreatable and that worries me a lot.
0.666700	"I see a doctor for one of two things: an unusual symptom or condition, or an annual checkup. During the former, I sometimes wonder if my symptoms could indicate a more serious medical problem, or worry how long the condition might persist, even with treatment. In the latter, a ""wellness check"", I worry that I may have an unrecognized problem that will affect my overall health, or require extensive and/or expensive treatment. Since I am typically in very good physical condition, the thought of being ill bothers me a lot."
0.666700	I just get myself worked up for no good reason. I hate going there, even though I have never had a horrible experience. I guess I don't like other people poking, prodding, and seeing me ked. I am the same way about going to the dentist or giving blood.
0.571429	it is just a feeling I have always had doctors really do a number on me I really dislike going but I have to every now and then 
0.261900	"I feel worried when they see something of concern on my blood work and want to redo it.  Blood work is very telling so it makes me extremely nervous if something looks ""off"" to my doctor."
0.285700	The only problem I have is finding a doctor who will do a thorough examition and LISTEN to what I'm saying.  I don't mind one that experiments as long as I know it is and that we are working together.
0.881000	I am anxious about what the doctor may say is wrong and that it may be something serious and my mind wanders in all kinds of directions . 
0.523810	It is often times hearing a test results and going in to due to symptoms I've being experiencing. Also, some doctor's offices have long wait times that's undesirable.
0.190500	I was most anxious and worried about my own health, especially when I wasn't sure what could possible go wrong with me and before a new symptom was diagnosed and confirmed by the doctor.  
0.142900	I worry about the cost of the care I am receiving.
0.714300	That what the doctor diagnoses me with is serious or untreatable. Also, the environment itself in a doctors office usually makes me anxious or worried. 
0.690500	The fear in the back of my head that they will find something drastically wrong.  I am worried I will get bad news. 
0.285714	Would be worried or anxious for the results of any tests given by doctor at that time. Don't know what would come about because of it.
0.619048	that they are going to whip out some prescription and send me on my way, or that they will  just send me to a specialist and nothing will be solved
0.261900	As I get older I worry a little bit each time that I could have some disease that people tend to get as they get older but it hasn't happened yet.
0.547600	Getting an uncertain or negative diagnoses would cause worry or anxiety. For myself or a loved one. THe feelings are the same
0.142857	nothing makes me feel anxious or worryed when im visiting the doctor because my doctor is very good at what she dose so i dont need to wory about anything.
0.595200	I have a slight fear about needles and not a lot of tolerance with pain. I always have a feeling that if I have to go see a doctor I will need to have needles stuck in me and that makes me nervous. Also, doctors' offices and environments are often unpleasant and do not help one feel more at ease.
0.500000	What kind of news I might get. I worry about what they'll say about my unhealthy lifestyle. The might say something about seeing other doctors.
0.785700	I feel anxious because I know my problems will be over looked or shoved off as not important. It makes me unhappy to be wasting my time. 
0.619000	I think when an exam takes place you are always worried about the doctor finding something serious. You never want to hear you have cancer or something  along those lines. 
0.381000	I feel afraid that the doctor won't have enough time for me, or he'll brush off my questions. Those are my two biggest concerns when I go to the doctor. I don't like my opinion to be brushed off or disregarded, and I hate feeling as though my concerns don't matter. It also makes me really anxious that I wait 45 minutes to see a doctor and then the overall appointment takes only 90 seconds. It just makes me feel really worried that I'm not getting the care or attention that I should be. 
0.666667	The unknown of what is going to happen. Trying to figure out what the problem may be or the diagnosis
0.690476	That there might get be negative test results come back and I'm gonna pair. I get jittery. Sweaty and hate myself. I dread the doctors 
0.714300	If I have an unexpected pain or problem, then i feel worried. I feel that although they can help at times, its up to God to heal.
0.238100	I sometimes get worried I'm going to get some bad news like there is something wrong that's going to cost money I didn't foresee. Also I get worried I might get some type of negative diagnosis sometimes.
0.285700	In my primary care physician office when they are doing any examination that will not make me anxious or worried or created any fear to me because these are only good to help me.
0.547600	I am most anxious that I am going to get some bad news about a problem I have no control over and there is nothing I can do about it
0.333333	I am afraid that I might have a serious life threatening illness that cannot be cured. Also I am worried that I will have to take more prescription medicine.
0.976200	I'm and anxious and worried that I may have a fatal disease. Also, my blood pressure always rises when she first comes into the room. She says it's a phenom called white coat syndrome. I also hate having my weight taken because I am fearful that I have gained too many pounds and will have to go on a diet. 
0.571429	I might be worried how bad my problem is, but more likely I would be anxious about pain. Blood draws and shots are not really one of my favorite things!
0.595238	I may find something out that I don't want to know so that is why I am worried when I go to the doctor most of the time but I always walk out happy 
0.666700	You never know when they are going to find something that is going to be a problem.  Even when you feel healthy, an exam always makes me anxious.
0.428571	I was worried I would have to have a lot of tests I couldn't afford to figure out what was wrong with me.
0.285700	I am generally not anxious when I see the doctor. I am rarely sick and just don't have much fear when I go see a doctor. I guess there is always a fear of something being terribly wrong with me but I tend not to think about that. I guess I am more anxious about picking up an illness at the doctor than anything else, like the flu.
0.309500	The unknown makes me anxious and worried.  Not knowing what to expect or what the doctor will say in regards to an issue I've had.  I spend too much time researching online about various illnesses and going to see a doctor about it makes me very anxious.  No one wants to be given bad news so, not knowing exactly what will be said is very nerve-racking.
0.357143	What is most worrisome to me is when I know something is wrong and I am not sure what it is from the symptoms that I have.  I worry when there is a possibility  of something cancerous.  Usually I know that most problems are an easy fix.  I am concerned about testing costs since I was forced on to medicare at age 65.
0.285700	I really don't feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor.  The only issue I have is that I had a really bad experience with a doctor in the same practice and I don't really like to see him.  If I do, I just pretend that he isn't there. It is so worth it to see our current doctor that I will deal with seeing the other doctor for a minute or so when we are walking to the exam room.
0.738100	I tend to feel most anxious about what the doctor may discover.  For some reason, it seems that every time I have any kind of medical test, the doctor finds something new that is wrong with me.  It makes me feel that I don't won't the doctor to run any new tests because I know they are going to find something wrong.  Based on all of my recent experiences, I am seriously considering switching to a holistic doctor.
0.595238	I get scared of what will be bad news.wich i know is need to be heard.but its being judged secretly.
0.690476	it just makes me scared that they are going to find something wrong with me or something that is life threatening or who knows
0.285700	I don't generally feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. I am satisfied with the service and am treated well by everyone there. I don't feel negative about the experience.
0.261905	Well since you are not in the medical field  you have to rely on the doctor for some answers , you can not be to sure
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, is the possibility that he finds something abnormal during the check up.
0.333300	The possibility of finding something I don't want hear.
0.500000	I feel anxiety when I have to wait for my turn and if I get some blood work done not knowing the results right away.
0.857100	When visiting a doctor's office, I'm mainly afraid of 1) how uncomfortable the examination or procedure may be, and 2) any possible bad news I may receive as a result/following the examination.  Usually everything else (work, payment for services, etc.) is secondary.
0.595200	I feel anxious or worried that I may find ou bad news. I worry that some of my bad habits may have caught up with me. I am concerned I will receive bad test results 
0.738095	Wording what could be wrong and wording how to treat this also wording about the meds and side affects 
0.523800	
0.785714	I just have overall anxiety issues stemming from my bout with depression.  I suffer from depression and experience extreme highs and lows.
0.142857	I get anxious about  having my blood pressure read.  It seems it always goes up when I first walk into the office.
0.142857	nothing the only time this would be true is if I had some very different and strange test done and was going to get my results
0.714300	I am always most anxious about my weight.  I continually try to lose weight, but am much heavier than I would like to be.
0.500000	doctors and nurses are always late and do not have any system that works around the clock.they also mix and lose prescriptions.
0.142900	I fear that maybe i'll walk out with a deadly illness
0.857100	Just the thought that they might find something wrong or give me bad news about something.  Just going to the dr in general makes me a little nervous.
0.619000	Fear of the unknown. I have come because something is wrong and I do not know the answer and I will have a long wait and this will be all I am thinking about because  have to reschedule my whole day to do it.
0.166667	i feel most anxious after i have ad a test done and am waiting for the test results to come back  the doctor always makes me feel good about evrryting
0.547619	Because I have been very healthy with no major illnesses or longterm conditions, I am attentive to symptoms and feelings when I am not feeling well. I sometimes wonder when/ how that could change when I cannot identify what might be physically wrong with me
0.523800	Not knowing what results the doctor will find.
0.761900	I am worried that my doctor will be very upset with me because I am not losing weight.  I keep gaining weight.  I am worried that I will eventually have high blood pressure or diabetes.
0.309500	Finding out something is terribly wrong with me would be very bad news. I'm very relieved every time this is not the case. It's best to check things early and practice preventative care instead of be late to treat something after it develops.
0.738100	I don't know what they are going to do to me, if something will be painful, or what the results of any tests might be. I tend to not think about my health too much but then when I go to the doctor suddenly I have to deal with it all
0.523800	
0.547600	I just don't like al the poking and prodding, and the overly eager attitude to just prescribe medication for every little thing.
0.714300	I'm worried they'll find something really wrong with me. I'm not anxious about the doctor.
0.309500	I'd say just randomly having some new infection that I didn't suspect because I usually do things that wouldn't harm myself so this would surprise me and make me wonder which activity exposed me to this and what I can do to correct it. Also, I sometimes will worry about needles if I have to get one just because I'm not a huge fan at the end of the day
0.976200	When visiting the doctor's office I am always filled with anxiety and dread due to the environment always giving me that feeling since childhood. It probably roots back to a fear of needles and too much media, but it still affects me to this day. Today, it would instead be a fear of being diagnosed with some incurable disease or being told that I can no longer do the things I enjoy in life due to some pain or injuries. Outside of that, a routine doctor's visit is normally only filled with worry on the drive there. I usually leave feeling more ensured and happier than when I came in.
0.857143	I feel that they try to rush and find easy solutions and not find out what the problems actually are.  I feel that they don't listen to patient concerns or problems.  I feel that doctors see patients as money and not actual people.
0.595200	I get worried about talking about things that make me nervous. My private body parts are private to me and even the doctor makes me feel uncomfortable. I work to try to speak about these things but just never gets easier. Also worried about hearing I have sickness or disease thats not curable. Things get rougher and rougher with age and when I get older feel like somethings just bound to go wrong with my health. 
0.404762	When you go you don't know what the doctor is going to say. So you might be worried or  anxious.And you hart might be raceing.
0.761905	My doctor is trying to.put me.on medication that makes me pass out and fall down getting dizzy after I was taken off the only one that actually worked for me 
0.333300	I would be worried that there could be something seriously wrong with me during a visit.  Especially when I've been experiencing pain or unusual symptoms.
0.500000	Mainly the outcome of the visit makes me nervous. As a person that has had a few medical conditions, it always makes me a little uneasy to have a check up not knowing if something is wrong again. Having to take additional tests, such as x-ray's or bloodwork is something that always makes me nervous. While I was sick I would be anxious before every appointment because I would be afraid that the doctor may have found something cancerous or seriously life threatening. 
0.714300	Using my recent visit, I worry about the cost of the visit itself, the work they want done, and anything else (kind of like a lawyer's fees for responding to emails, or making phone calls) that needs to be done. That is number one. Number two, is just being told there might be things wrong with you when you feel like you are pretty good. It creates a psychological tendency to worry about the issue, potentiating the extremity of the issue.
0.642900	Due to the fear mongering that has gripped this fine country, I think most people worry about a serious or deadly diagnosis each time they visit their physician, even if there isn't a specific reason why these feelings should exist (i.e. the person being diagnosed is in good health, eats well, exercises regularly, etc.).
0.857100	"I worry that the doctor might prescribe me medicines just because I went in for a consultation. In other words, the doctor could have very well known that the medicines are just a temporary solution and that my illness would have healed on its own, given some time and rest. Instead of saying ""Go take rest"", he would be forced to prescribe medicines just because he is a doctor! I am not scared of injections. However, I become uneasy and anxious of intrusive procedures like inserting swabs into your nose, throat, ears etc. I am anxious that the doctor might be a racist and would harm me in some way or the other based on my appearance or ethnicity."
0.690476	Because of my age, I'm anxious that he will find something seriously wrong with me.  My blood pressure is usually high before I see the doctor but comes back to normal after.
0.619000	The only thing that makes me nervous is the thought of my doctor actually finding something that could potentially kill me.  I get extremely nervous sometimes, but so far it's always be fine.
0.642857	I am usually worried that they may find something wrong.And my mother died from infection in the hospital, so I dont trust them either.
0.428600	I would feel anxious if I was in the office to hear results. If i was in for a regular exam or check up I would not have nerves. 
0.214286	I have arthritis and it is all over and awhen I get a check up I dread hearing what won't work or what I won't be able to do any more. I dread hearing about what can be done about certain eye problems due to my spinal condition called spondylitis and my migraines already have to wear tinted lenses even at night. Not sure if I will be restricted to day driving only or not.
0.833333	I get anxious or worried because I have to sit around other patients. It is almost like a social anxiety. Also going to wait, I get nervous waiting and feel like I'm wasting time and could be doing other things. So I just try to avoid the doctors visit if possible.
0.142857	Nothing at all, lived and am living a good life, do not fear God or the after-life, ready for whatever comes, spouse and 3 dogs taken care of, all is well.  No anxiety, no worries.  Remember, Pobody's Nerfect  The only perfect person I know got nailed to a cross and I'm not trying to go there ~
0.285700	I don't really mind going to the doctor it doesn't affect me usually. Unless I'm worried about something, but just going in for a checkup I'm usually fine
0.738095	I am worried that my doctor may tell me something is wrong.  I am anxious that my blood work would reflect that I contracted a condition.
0.404800	What makes me most anxious is not knowing what kind of results I will receive about my health. I worry that I may have something unhealthy or otherwise bad lurking in my body. I worry that I may have some disorder that may negatively affect my life unless I act fast. It's the uncertainty of my own health that makes me anxious.
0.523800	
0.285700	I don't know if it will be good news or bad news when something is wrong with me. What if it is something serious but it makes me worried if he just ignores it or does not take it seriously. I just normally get anxious because sometimes you just don't know what it is your'e going to expect.
0.452381	The arriving before time and waiting way past time to finally be seen. The medical bill afterwards and cost of prescriptions.
0.809524	In have not been to doctors much in my life until a few years ago,  therefore my blood pressure always goes up when I see a doctor
0.261900	If I have a real issue that is not just pedantic-like complaining---that it will not be thoroughly dealt with due to insufficient time alone. That would be some mega bullshit. It's why Im trying to learn a lot as to how I can effectively help myself through altertive medicine options such as aryuvedic. 
0.523800	Because I worry about that something is wrong with my body like perspiring too much when I exercise. She did a papsmear and did not find anything so I felt better. I worry about bad results.
0.476200	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor is that he will tell me that I have a major illness or condition that will make it impossible to live my life the way I want to.
0.142857	I have no anxiety or bad feelings. If my tumor grows again, I will have targeted radiation/Gamma Ray knife to decrease the tumor size
0.285700	I am usually not anxious or worried about visiting the Dr.  I have had many procedures that would probably worry most people but I tend to take it in stride.
0.142900	Usually it's just a routine check up, so I never really am too worried. I would guess that the only worry I would have is if something came back unusual from my regular check up, but then again, that would just mean it was caught before I even noticed anything wrong, which would be better than being caught too late.
0.381000	The possibility of receiving bad news is one thing, but honestly it doesn't make me too worried.  If I receive news about a condition, I am then empowered to do something about it.  The only other thing I can think of that makes me anxious is thinking about the bill I'm going to receive later.
0.523800	
0.642857	sometimes i worry that the doctors wont give me the specific medicine i need. my friend has this problem frequently. 
0.595238	I suffer with anxiety so most things make me feel anxuious. I worry that he might find something ELSE wrong with me lol
0.142857	might be told somethings wrong that requires invasive procedure to correct.  Nothinv else to add.     
0.261900	Sometime the wait alone can be worrisome.  And if i am coming to grt some test results sometimes i feel a little uneasy hoping for the best outcome
0.142900	I do not feel anxious when visiting the doctor at all. The dentist is another matter entirely.

0.190500	I am not usually worried when visiting the doctor's office, but I do get anxious waiting for test results.

My family has a large history of cancer, so I constantly worry about developing it. 
0.214300	Fear of the unknown is always the scariest part. Blood work can often reveal unexpected problems. Another thing might be that there is no known way to treat a condition.

0.333300	I really dont have any anxiousness at any of my doctors office visits usually. The only time there is anxiousness is if my doctor orders bloodwork to be done. While the procedure itself is easy, the before hand is what gets me anxious. 
0.738100	finding something else wrong
1.000000	Not knowing if I'll be given the best advice or options for my condition. Not believing that that doctor cares enough about to better advice my on what to do.

0.809500	That the doctor will pressure me into doing things I can't afford, or don't really want.

0.285700	"I am most worried about the ""fear of the unknown"".  In other words, will the doctor discover something that I am not aware of.   I am not worried about taking any shots or vaccines - but more worried on what I don't know at this point about my health."
0.357143	I usually know what's wrong with my health.  but there are times when sometime good comes up. but I trust my doctor
0.500000	The one thing that makes me most anxious when I visited the doctor is anything that has to deal with needles. I do not like needles. The nurses can never find my veins. 
0.500000	just having to see what they say and do and hoping im healthy also i get nervous when i go and try to hope things turn out well

0.571400	I am always worried when I see the doctor because I always feel like they are going to tell me something is really wrong with me. For the longest I thought I wa healthy now every time I go they find something new about me. I donât know if it is they want more money from me or they are really trying to help me.
0.357143	Just not wanting to hear bad news. You always want Everything to be OK. So you get a little anxious until you hear the okay answer 
0.214300	It makes me feel anxious when I'm in an appointment with him and he just goes away and spends a long time outside, leaving me just waiting, just looking the ceiling and worried about what problems I may have, it's really annoying and not a good action of him.
0.309524	That the doctor might find a condition that requires a major medical procedure or life style change.
0.404800	I already suffer from a panic disorder with anxiety so I tend to be anxious anytime I go out in public, whether it is for a doctor appointment or not. However there are certain factors that make me worry. If it is just a physical or a normal scheduled appointment then I do not worry so much. But if I am going in to get an injury looked at then I tend to worry about permanent damage. When I was a teenager I suffered rhabdomyolysis. I was very alarmed and it required a long hospital stay. I would get worried after I got out of the hospital because they were sure if  I would get full use of my limb after it healed.
0.595238	THAT I WILL GET A DIAGNOSIS THAT I AM NOT HAPPY WITH, I.E., WE HAVE FOUND CANCER IN THE EXAMINATION BUT IT IS VERY TREATABLE AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE SPREAD.  THE ARTERY CLOGGED IN YOUR HEART HAS BEEN CLEARED AND A STENT PUT IN AND OTHER CLOGS HAVE BEEN CLEARED AS WELL.
0.761900	I'm always anxious for any stranger to look at me in depth like that, whether it's a doctor, dentist, or person on the bus. It's very intrusive and unsettling.

0.690476	I'm always afraid something terrible is going to happen. Like the doctor will tell me that I have some terrible incurable disease
0.333300	As dumb as it sounds, what worries me the most is what the doctor's will find.  Kind of the concept that ignorance is bliss, if I don't go then I don't have to worry about whatever is going on in my body.  I also don't like having fasting blood draws, so if I can avoid those I generally feel a lot better.  In addition, if it's not a standard wellness visit, generally you already know there's something wrong and I worry it might be more serious than it is.
0.142857	Nothing.  Except if I have to do surgery I may get a little bit anxious or worried but besides that I no problem going to the doctor.

0.666700	Finding a difficult to cure physical problem
0.690476	There were times when I had not been to a Dr for a few years. When I did decide to go for a check up and breast exam, I was afraid because it had been so long since I had been to a Dr.
0.738100	I don't like doctors in general. I always worry they will find something that I don't know about. I have a great doctor, but it is just a scary process. The physical evaluation is also worrysome. I don't like people poking around my body. 
0.476200	Walking into the doctor, you have no idea what is going on with your body. Sometimes you might need to do further study and look deeper into the body to see if there is anything wrong. There is always uncertainty if you go into the office with some kind of symptom that seems normal, but it could be worst than you thought.
0.571400	Forgetting to mention something that might affect diagnosis or forgetting to mention a problem that bothers me.
0.547600	I am a person that gets worried every time i go to the doctor.  I'm just afraid i will hear something bad while there.

0.142857	nothing really unless I am going for a followup to a previous issue. my dr and staff is great about making you feel at ease
0.404800	I mostly worry about the doc finding something that I never knew about.  Maybe in blood work or a physical exam.  I think that not knowing is the most of my worry.  once the exam or prognosis is complete I rest easy.  i don;t like needles so drawing blood is usually a stressful experience as well.
0.333333	As I age, new health conditions occur, or a condition becomes more of an issue, which causes anxiety sometimes...
0.142857	This question does not apply to my because I am never anxious or worried. I have a mind set of it is what it is. Either it is something I can fix or it is in gods unchanging hands. I can only intake what will be told and get what needs to be done or changed.
0.619000	My history is long, and results from an accident many years back. The accident was serious and my injuries very severe. I continually deal with residual complications from that accident and also tend to develop new conditions as time goes on and I get older. Its almost impossible for me at this point to not have anxiety after my checkups.
0.761905	My mother having to be up my rear end when it comes to my medical information. And the fact that the doctors allow her to be here while I am an adult is really uncalled for.

0.142857	I don't feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office. I don't have chronic health conditions or anything to be anxious about. 
0.238100	I really don't like being touched by strangers. Even though I have been to my primary care doctor it still feels like being touched by a stranger.
0.714300	Being sick and assuming it's the worst possible thing. I'm worried about getting sicker in the waiting room with other sick people around. I'm worried about procedures that might hurt or feel embarrassing, such as bloodwork or bad side effects or something, and embarrassing as far as potentially showing body parts I don't normally show and talking about bodily functions
0.309500	Even though I'm comfortable at my doctors office and have known him for years, I always get a little anxious when going in for an exam. I think it's mostly because I'm worried about what they'll find that's wrong. Most of the time it's only something minor or nothing at all, but I still get a little worried.
0.642857	I always have a feeling they have something bad to tell me. since cancer runs in my family , I always think they are going to find some kind o cancer. I get anxious because I hate having to wait to see the doctor for my results.

0.261900	I guess it is the fear of not knowing.
0.142857	I feel anxious when I do not know what going on with or if it something serious i have going on with me. Also I feel anxious when I have to wait a long time for doctor come back with result.

0.571400	I do not have to visit the doctor often enough to have worry.
0.904800	I am always afraid they will find something wrong with me.  I absolutely fear having something serious and needing surgery or some horrible disease like cancer.  It's terrifying for me to visit even if it's just for a cold.  
0.714300	You just never know what is going to be found out. I have a lot of iffy family history that makes me nervous so I always dread going to the doctor
0.738095	When the doctor tells me I have strep throat and I need a penicillin shot in my buttocks. Also, when the doctor take to long to come back with my lab results.

0.928600	I generally am uncomfortable around doctors and downright panicky around dentists.  I think this is all due to bad experiences as a child that I just cannot seem to get over.
0.738095	I AM UNABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY.  I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A FEAR OF GOING TO THE DR AND NOTHING BEING WRONG THAT I IMAGINED THE PROBLEM AND THIS MAKES ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
0.571400	I used to be worried about the cost most of all, but I now have stable finances and appropriate insurance so that is less of a worry.  I worry that they'll tell me something scary about my health, like needing surgery or having a chronic uncurable condition.  I've needed surgery that had me on bed rest for a week and it wasn't pleasant.
0.452381	I am not sure what he may say. I am nervous of hearing any type of report. Then I do not want to be placed on machines.

0.642900	Usually it's things like how bad my cholesterol is, maybe anxious on things that might be suggested by my doctor...and definitely not looking forward to full (yearly) or prostate examition.
0.190500	It's uncomfortable and totally abnormal to be semi-ked in an exam room with someone you see once a year at best.   It's going to make anyone anxious.
0.142857	i do not feel anxious or worried when i go to a doctor.  whatever i am told has to be dealt with good or bad
0.785714	Normally, if I'm at the doctors, I'm in pretty poor shape and it's a last stitch effort. I'm worried and anxious mostly because of how little faith i have in them... and for very good reason
0.714286	that they will find something wrong...or, that they can't help me with the problem I am having. that's all I can think of now.

0.333300	The only thing that makes me nervous are physical tests. I hate injections and pap smears. Also, I am a smoker so I get a little afraid to hear bad news of abnormal result.
0.333333	The unknown is frightening. I don't live the healthiest lifestyle and I sometimes worry about the further decline of my health as i get older.
0.285700	Just because if you're going to the doctor, something is wrong with you.  You don't know what's going on, and if it's something serious.  Nobody wants to hear that bump on their head could possibly be malignant.  It's fear of the unknown that makes me nervous, not necessarily fear of the doctor.
0.285714	I really am not her anxious but I have lost my last three doctors to retirement. This time I picked a younger one hoping he will not retire til I am gone.
0.452381	Something comes up with my system that he may call my attention to that I couldn't see or recognize on my own before showing up.
0.857100	One of the main reasons I don't have a primary care physician is because I never liked going to the doctor as a child. Having physicals scared me really bad and I'm probably traumatized. So I am in no hurry to go to the doctor for any reason. If I get sick I just wait it out.

0.619048	When visiting the doctor office I am most worried about bad news. My family has a history of medical issues that I have managed to avoid
0.452400	I don't always speak up for myself, especially with a new doctor, so it makes me anxious that I may agree to a treatment/medication/etc that I don't actually want to go through with.

0.785700	I am always concerned that there is some underlying issue that I am not aware of, and am fearful that I will get test results that reflect this. Also I am not a fan of being touched even in normal circumstances so that is stressful for me.
0.476190	I never know if I will be able to give them enough details for them to make the proper diagnosis . And I'm also worried that they will tell me I have something terrible 
0.714300	Well I consider myself rather poor so I always worry about my doctor finding some kind of condition I have , that would be very costly to cure. So basically I am afraid of the money I will have to spend. 
0.142900	The waiting room makes me feel like that sometimes just because you have to sit there and my mind starts to wander sometimes. Usually I am fine though.
0.809524	I don't like them picking at me and don't want them to find something they think they have to treat.
0.666667	Anxious because of health concerns and my worrying that as I age I will, or may, have more health issues
0.428571	The only time I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor is if I've had a major test and am waiting for the results or if it's about one of my children.
0.666700	I am concerned that the doctor may inform me that there is something seriously wrong with my health.  I am afraid of finding out about an incurable disease or health issue.
0.738100	Because I only get to see a doctor when there is something wrong, I am always waiting for the bad news.  I need to see a specialist or I need to go on a new medication which I probably won't be able to pay for.  So, that just puts more stress in my life and makes me anxious at the doctor's office.  In many ways, it's just less stressful to live with whatever problem I have and not go see a doctor who will just tell me about the problem that I can't do anything about because I can't afford the co-pay.
0.428600	I always feel like I am going to hear bad news when I go to the doctor for a checkup. I have been dealing with a disease since a very young age and I recently have begun to feel like maybe this illness is even worse than anyone originally thought.
0.333333	It makes me anxious to think about something being seriously wrong with me. That's my worst fear. Other than that the doctor does not phase me. 
0.809500	"Money is the first of the most important concerns. The old saying ""I can not afford to get sick or go to the Dr, hospital, etc.. Applies to most of us including me. The second worry  concern is what the Dr finds out during lab work, exams, etc and the diagnosis and the ""Cost"" I am always concerned that whatever the Dr finds through an exam or test is that they advise you on a standard rule of the most expensive treatment or specialist they can give. I have had many persol experiences with this. There is no such thing as persol, affordable, think out of the box, healthcare treatments. I am treated like a robot in a robot system. I go to my family physician and if there is anything wrong I get sent all over town to specialists and have many appointments and a lot of time and out of pocket expenses and find out later that all of that was not necessary and the health problem could have been handled and treated through my family Dr. simply and a lot less expensive. "
0.857100	Not knowing what is going to happen. Worrying that there is something wrong with me. Not trusting the doctors.
0.690500	I worry about all the things that could be wrong with me that I didn't notice, but the doctor might find out. These might be expensive to fix, or embarassing, or something that I was foolish not to notice on my own. I might not be in as good of health as I had thought.
0.476200	It depends on the situation. If I am seeing my doctor, say, because I am not feeling well or in a lot of pain, then of course I'll feel anxious and worried that something might be seriously wrong. If it's just routine checkups, then I'm relaxed.
0.547600	There is always the opportunity of hearing bad news.  The memory of hearing bad news in the past about my own health, or a loved one's health.  The idea that an appointment could lead to a scary or painful procedure.  Also, the possibility of financial loss.
0.452381	They may find something wrong. Because I rarely go, I am worried they will find something I haven't noticed or overlooked. 
0.404800	I don't worry so much about getting a predictable diagnosis or treatment for a physical condition I have already noticed and/or need to have taken care of. What I worry about is whether the doctor will tell me it's worse than I thought or find something else wrong with me.
0.666700	  If someone there or around is ging to get me sick.  If someone will give me the wrong diagnosis.  If someone will give me the wrong medication.
0.761900	I think it's just the idea that, while I may be there for one thing, they may find something else wrong with me. The idea that all the care I take to be healthy and to make sure I am well might mean nothing because my body might betray me in a way I have little control over. 
0.428571	i would like to know what problems that linger because of my age and history and when i worry i don't like it because i fear it is more dangerouse than what it really is
0.190500	I am a little worried that my health problems will be worse than what they seem.
0.690476	Thinking that they will find something that I am not looking forward and giving positive results when I am a negative. This just happened to me. 
0.785700	I worry that I will receive random and unexpected bad news regarding an unavoidable health problem. Additionally, even though I am a healthy weight, exercise, and otherwise take care of myself, I expect without reason to be scolded for doing something wrong health-wise.
0.261900	nothing but the bill.
0.452400	Getting there on time and hoping to not have to wait, sometimes the uncertainly always makes  me nervous.
0.452381	because wondering over night what he is going to say gets me hiped up and worried because your not really sure depending on what you go and see doctor for
0.571429	I just generally dont like going to the doctor because you have to wait forever to be seen and then you have to sit in the waiting room exposed to all the other sick patients. Also i dont like taking medicine especially pills .
0.309524	You never know what the doctor may find. I am getting older and have friends with serious health problems . So far I'm in fairly good health.
0.428571	you never know what could be found. You might feel fine but test can indicate otherwise.  I usually expect that all is well but one small thing can lead to a bigger problem.  I most worry about how the doctor will react to my questions.  I hate being prodded or poked.  The starkness of the room does not help either.  The wait for the doctor can be unnerving also.  I just want to get in and out quickly.  The cost can also be a factor in how much i might be concerned.
0.238095	I get anxious a lot it is part of my makeup I take medication for this when I go to the doctors office you have to wait in the waiting room full of people
0.142857	I usually don't get anxious or worried because if something is wrong you can only trust in God to take care of it.
0.761905	My doctors office staff is not the most friendly or helpful to you There are few that are nice, but not over helpful.
0.357143	"The chance that she might have  ""bad"" news for me. Something that might alter my life expectancy or be potentially fatal. In general though these thoughts aren't that strong; just a moderate sense of worry."
0.142900	When I am unsure as to what is wrong with me and I when it's a new dr. that I have never met before. Also when I am having a medical procedure done that I have never had done before.
0.785700	I worry that something could be very wrong.  I could potentially be diagnosed with a terrible disease like cancer.  To me, it's just the fact that my day could have been going very well, and that could be changed with a few sentences.  I get concerned that something could have been wrong with me for a while, and that it might be too late to be reversed.
0.642900	I have a tendency to avoid going to the doctor unless it's necessary (even though I know it's not smart), so when I do go, it's usually because something is wrong. I worry that it's going to be something more serious than what I expect, or that something else wrong will be found.
