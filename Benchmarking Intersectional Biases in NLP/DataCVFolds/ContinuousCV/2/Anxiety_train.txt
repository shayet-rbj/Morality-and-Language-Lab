0.809500	I am always worried about the outside chance that I may develop a serious condition, like heart disease.

0.952400	Just the general idea of going to the doctor makes me uneasy.  I do not know why I feel this way but it is always like this.  I even just make the appointment and I get super anxious.
0.761900	I am transgendered and I have been treated hideously by many medical professiols because of it. Add this to the fact that I believe very little of what doctors say and you probably get the idea.

0.190500	I'm almost never anxious or worried, but as I get older, there's always the chance that the doctor will find or notice something that I haven't. I'm a good weight for my height, but I don't exercise much, so eventually I'm sure he'll tell me I have high blood pressure or cholesterol, but that hasn't happened yet.
0.142900	I think the thought that something is wrong worries me the most but overall I am not concerned about seeing the doctor.

0.785700	I just feel like you never know what they might tell you or what unwanted testing they will want to do.
0.761900	The unknown of what the results of a procedure will be.
0.547600	The unknowing of how they will treat my condition. I have gone through a lot of medications and it can be tough on me.
0.238100	Just the process of going to the doctor.  I get nervous about giving blood and the overall exam process.
0.666700	I never know how long I'm going to be there, how I will be treated by office staff, what things the doctor may say or find.
0.547600	Waiting for the doctor and fear of judgement.
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried, because I'm not a worrier.  Maybe about how much it will cost....
0.142900	When I go to find out something is wrong I am usually nervous but for a regular check up I am usually at ease.
0.619000	"I'm always worried that I will do or say the wrong thing and be a ""bad"" patient. I have issues with anxiety surrounding being a ""bad"" person or doing something ""wrong""."
0.452400	if I go in and have no clue what's going on. A completely new thing never experienced before and cant ID it well
0.452400	If I need to get blood drawn or get shots. Anything painful. Or anything uncomfortable to talk about. 
0.571400	That I might have something wrong with me that could be bad.
0.333300	I am some sometimes anxious if I think I am overweight and not been eating or working out like I should
0.452400	There always rush of people
0.166700	Bad results 
0.357100	I'm anxious and worried all day, regardless of where I am. Going to the doctor just adds a veneer of annoyance.
0.381000	I always get anxious when going for something that is hurting, or my anxiety because I think that they all think I just want pills or something like that. So, instead I deal with a lot of pain and anxiety, because of the anxiety it causes me to ask about it. Its a horrible anxious loop.
0.381000	Just the uncertainty if I have a major illness that is going to kill me
1.000000	That I'm not getting the best help possible. That my doctor is so preoccupied with what's wrong with his next patient or the one in the other room that I know he's go back and forth between that he's not paying the least bit attention to what is going on in my room. 
0.571400	My medical condition, if I think it is serious
0.523800	I'm mostly worried if I have no idea what the problem might already be. I usually have an idea of what the issue is before I go and the uncertainty, when I have it, is difficult.
0.166700	Just if something is wrong. I don't want to be unhealthy or discover a bad problem. 
0.238100	Having to wait a long time for service. 
0.666700	They will rush me through. There is a large population here. In my small town growing up everyone knew everyone. I went to church with my doctor. Here all they want to know is what kind of insurance you have. Usually they don't take mine. I just don't go and treat myself. I avoid vaccinations and unnecessary treatments. 
0.547600	The waiting times which happen and you are in a check up room alone. 
0.285700	Their incompetence. I take care of a (non-family) disabled adult. Many doctors appointments are just terrible for them, because the doctors seem incompetent and inept. So that person doesn't want to see the doctors because they know it will be stressful.
0.523800	Them finding something out that could be really wrong with me. I want everything to be okay and get a good report.
0.571400	Afraid if there's going be a long wait.
0.666700	They aren't careful. They're in a hurry.
0.785700	When I'm there, I'm worried if he's had a bad day. I feel like that could affect his examition and/or dealings with me. Sometimes I wonder whether or not I'm going to have trouble with my insurance. There are times when I'm worried about how much time I'm spending there, and if my kids are okay where they are. 
0.142900	I mildly dislike needles, and poking around in my private areas is more annoying than embarrassing, but I get over the annoyance and look away when they do the blood draw.
0.238100	most likely the unknown of what exactly is wrong. 
0.500000	Mostly, I am an anxious person in general. Plus, I'm always a bit worried that something will show up that is wrong with me. Doctors offices in general make me a bit anxious.
0.333300	I dont like to give blood. I get dizzy so that bothers me sometimes. I also get anxious waiting for the blood test results at times
0.333300	Find something that could effect my family or myself in any way
0.571400	I'm worried that something may be wrong with me!
0.738100	I feel anxious when the doctor takes a long time to tell me whats wrong. I feel worried when I dont know what my problem is.
0.142900	I only feel anxious when I know there's something wrong with me already. I worry that the treatment might be expensive or not effective.
0.500000	I only go when I think something is terribly wrong, so I am worried that I might be right and it's not some simple ailment.
0.238100	Waiting on the dr to arrive in the room and then not knowing what the outcome will be of your symptoms.  Also can get nervous when waiting on him to provide you with test results.  It's an uneasy feeling.
0.500000	I am always afraid that they will find something wrong with my health and it will lead to death. It is fear of the unknown.
0.881000	I am always worried that the doctor will find something bad.  Even though I know there is nothing I can do about it I am almost convinced every time I go in for a visit I will leave in a worse case scerio 
0.619000	I don't go unless there's something wrong, so I'm always a little nervous about the outcome.
0.714300	Discovering a medical condition that may be unbeknownst to me. 
0.714300	I am very paranoid and I feel that things never work out for me. I always dread and fear the worst,
0.738100	I find it most uneasy the thought that they will find something serious wrong with me, and even worse, what this problem will end up costing me, both emotiolly and fincially.  I worry that any treatments will simply be out of my budget.
0.428600	When I am not sure what to expect or am not quite sure what is wrong with me, then I get a little anxious or concerned.
0.881000	Going to a doctor could always mean something bad. You never know what you're going to find out when you're there. So it makes me fearful every time I go to one

0.285700	I become anxious about blood draws and injections.

0.714300	I am most anxious about hearing bad news. I am worried that something would pop up positive on tests. 
0.500000	Anticipation of unpleasant news. Usually not an issue. Occaisolly though, you go in worried to begin with.

0.428600	Probably just that I am worried that there's something wrong or that it's worse than I imagined. 
0.142900	Blood work or additiol studies that might be needed and take a few hours for results. 
0.166700	I am not really anxious about seeing a doctor because I feel it is better to take care of any problems right away rather than waiting for them to get worse.
0.357100	Just worrying about what might be wrong with me. I hate to be sick, but I trust my doctor.
0.642900	I just hate the whole experience. I think it's the attitude of the doctors. They seem like they are better than you. I get super nervous.
0.190500	That there could be something wrong.
0.904800	I worry about whether I am going to die. I believe if I'd had more money I would have had better care. I do not get to choose my Dr. I have to go where my insurance will be accepted and these Dr.'s are always different. I never see the same one twice. A few years ago everyone had a family Dr. who knew them all their lives. No longer. 
0.404800	Un unknown illness or condition.
1.000000	I am most scared I am going to get a death sentence. I have really bad health anxiety.
0.642900	I have a tendency to think the worst. I am a pessimist. I think something much worse is wrong with me than ever is. 
0.547600	The cost
0.142900	Nothing generally makes me worried other than the thought that something might be serious wrong with me.
0.547600	getting scared that there will be something wrong
0.500000	That they won't take me seriously. 
0.761900	I feel worried because I'm a very secretive and self-reliant person. Visiting the doctor is all about depending on someone else and letting them examine and judge you. I don't trust them not to reveal my persol information to anyone they see fit, even if I would strongly object.
0.690500	The idea that I might find out something bad about my health. Especially if I've already been worried that something bad is wrong and I've been researching health issues online that might apply to my situation.
0.142900	The only thing that really makes me feel anxious is when I'm awaiting test results.  I generally feel pretty calm.
0.285700	how easily my condition can be treated
0.142900	Nothing usually. I am generally very comfortable visiting the doctor. 
0.642900	I worry about what is wrong with me. The doctor doesn't make me feel this way, and I am hoping whatever is wrong isn't serious. It's just the whole waiting game I guess.
0.809500	"I don't like most examitions especially the ones that invade much of my ""privacy"" as far as private parts. That always makes me nervous. It's just not a good feeling to have the doctor look at parts that are usually not disclosed unless to an intimate partner."
0.785700	I am anxious that my doctor will criticize my lifestyle or my habits without seeing me as a person. I am worried that my doctor will not listen to me. I am worried that something will be wrong with me.
0.785700	Having someone exam my body and tell me that I'm unhealthy. 
0.142900	I'm not sure if it counts, since it doesn't actually relate to the actual doctor's office, but the drive over there makes me feel the most anxious.  I have panic attacks when I drive and I really hate to drive because of it.  If that doesn't count, I guess the only anxiety I would feel is if my doctor wasn't in that day since they have three different doctors and I only like him.
0.595200	I feel the most anxious about how much money it will cost me when I'm there. If I'm told I have a serious medical affliction, I practically have to accept my death. This is understandably unsettling to cope with, and thus I to an extent don't want to visit a doctor for this reason.
0.809500	What kind of tests will they have to do? Will they hurt? Will it be expensive? What if they find something serious? Will I have to have surgery? How will that alter my way of life? Do I have the time in the day to tend to all of this? 
0.333300	I worry that I won't get the full attention of the doctor and won't get all my questions answered. 
0.761900	I want to live forever, but as I get closer to 40, I've had a few more issues.  I hate that I now have to start getting rectal exams and things like that.  I just don't ever want to get bad news.
0.452400	I do not enjoy having someone exam my genital area. Otherwise, it is par for the course.
0.357100	Not knowing what will happen.  Not always taken good care of myself
0.142900	If I felt I had a loss of life sickness I might be nervous, but otherwise I'm never nervous.
0.166700	Being weighed and having my blood pressure taken is usually nerve-wracking. I have struggled with my weight all my life, and the last couple years my blood pressure has not been stable.
0.571400	Having to wait for so long in waiting room. Then having to wait in examition room. My mind wanders and too much free time and quiet is not good when I am at a doctor visit. I don't want to be told anything is wrong with me.
0.238100	Fear of my health getting worse.
0.285700	It doesn't really apply because I'm not anxious or worried when I go for appointments.
0.571400	It's an unfamiliar environment and people usually go to the doctor's office when there is something wrong with them healthwise or they are afraid something could be wrong. The uncertainty is likely what causes me the most anxiety.
0.261900	nothing but the bill.
0.666700	I start imaging the awful diagnosis that he could discover, like cancer. 
0.142900	Nothing does, I have no anxiety when visiting a doctor.
0.285700	The thought of maybe them finding something wrong. 
0.142900	I would feel anxious not knowing the outcome of the visit. It would scare me to find out that I have a problem with my health.
0.190500	Pap smears.  It's just an awkward situation, though what actually gets me is it can hurt LIKE HELL.  I'm pretty good with pain, it's necessary so I shrug it off, but it's certainly not something I look forwards to in any way, shape, or form.
0.928600	That they'll find something really wrong.
0.571400	I usually feel anxious because if I am at the doctors office there is something wrong.  Something wrong means it's going to cost a lot of money.  I don't have health insurance because I can't afford it.
0.571400	I'm done writing pal, this is ridiculous for the pay.  
0.285700	Getting test results for things that i'd rather not knows, for which if the results are bad it's totally going to be my fault cause I made bad decisions in  my past.
0.142900	I only feel anxious or worried when I know I am about to receive a shot.
0.666700	I am worried I will go home still not knowing what is wrong with me.
0.142900	idk why but the only thing that makes me a little anxious is having my blood pressure checked. For some reason when the cup goes on my anxiety shoots up and they always have to retake my blood pressure a second time.
0.309500	Just the fear of the unknown. Not knowing whether the doctor will find somethng wrong with me, and if he does find something wrong, how serious will the condition be. 
0.690500	That they are going to tell me that I am overweight or shame me for my weight. 
0.761900	I'm always anxious for any stranger to look at me in depth like that, whether it's a doctor, dentist, or person on the bus. It's very intrusive and unsettling. I'm also worried that my doctor will give me bad news or even worse will refer me without telling me why and it will take weeks to learn what's wrong with me.
0.595200	I worry that they will not help me deal with my health issues but will send me away with no help. I feel that my health concerns are rarely taken seriously enough. 
0.142900	the fear of the unknown
0.452400	Whether my condition is more serious than I expected
0.666700	I worry that the doctor won't listen to my concerns or do anything to help me, or that he still won't diagnose my chronic health issues yet again.
0.142900	Nothing
0.904800	I worry they aren't gon be able to help me. I also worry that it could be something bad.
0.357100	I'm turally anxious, so I feel that way about most new/unusual experiences.
0.142900	Uncertainty if there will be something really wrong with me
0.523800	Usually it's the unfounded fear that the doctor is going to find something this visit that will drastically change my life.
0.285700	I don't really get anxious or worried when I go to the doctors.  It doesn't make me worried unless they tell me something is wrong with me.
0.309500	That I will forget to ask something or tell them something that is relevant. 
0.142900	I don't usually feel nervous or anxious. I am generally calm. 
0.619000	I am worried about a potential health problem that I might have that was previously unknown by me. A lingering disease or illness is a scary thought. I also sometimes worry about the costs. 
0.642900	There's always a chance that they are going to see something horrible.
0.333300	I would be worried that there could be something seriously wrong with me during a visit.  Especially when I've been experiencing pain or unusual symptoms.
0.738100	I have health conditions which could lead to serious problems. Especially when my doctor is looking for signs of cancer, I'm anxious. I know that it could be bad news for me.
0.690500	blood test. I am terrified of needles and the results.
0.214300	finding out
0.452400	I have social anxiety. I feel nervous about interacting with the doctor and staff. I feel inferior.
0.761900	I once got diagnosed with diabetes and they wanted me to go on Medforin and I refused instead I relied on altertive therapy and next time I visited the Doctor they had NO evidence of this diagnosis.
0.976200	I feel the most anxious about visiting a doctor in general because of the dread of the diagnosis.  I am worried about what a doctor will find wrong with me. I am also worried about the fincial burden tests will entail.
0.166700	Seeing if I have gained weight.
0.976200	What may come out of the visit - such as a bad diagnosis.
0.285700	I don't like waiting around sick people.
0.714300	Since I'm getting into my late 30's and I used to party a lot when I was younger, I'm always a little worried that it will filly catch up to me.  I worry about it a lot when I'm at the doctor's office.
0.714300	I feel anxious about getting the right service I need. I feel anxious about the cost 
0.142900	Nerves in general. No one likes to go to the doctors. But int he long run you know you need to go, even if its for something small. Because that small thing could be something large and if you didnt go something worse could happen to you.
0.738100	I just get really anxious in general when going to the doctors office. I think it is a combition of something being wrong and I also just don't like the whole waiting environment and all of that. 
0.428600	I don't usually feel nervous, but I might if I know there's something wrong with me

0.619000	I worry about getting bad news.

1.000000	I don't like the idea of taking medical tests. I always expect the worst and always thing that my blood work or other related tests will come back bad or that I will be diagnosed with something really bad. I also do not like the very sterile and fluorescent lit environment that Dr offices are in. 
0.619000	I don't like needles and there is always a worry that they will find something that is serious. I worry they will find cancer or something like that when examining me. I don't want to have to battle a serious health issue so I get a little anxious.

0.571400	I worry that I will have bad test results or that I will be kept waiting too long
0.595200	The unknown. I like know what's going on in a situation, and the few times that I do need to see a doctor outside of routine visits, it means something is not right and I don't know what's wrong.
0.761900	 I am usually nervous or anxious because it just has a cold environment and you're unsure of what's about to happen

0.309500	The unknown of how any results I am waiting on will come out. 
0.619000	I think what makes me anxious or worried is a sense of the unknown. I don't know what they're going to come back with. They could come back with some terrible medical problem, even though it's unlikely.
0.571400	Just the worry of what the doctor says the condition coudl be. I'm also always too nervous to ask many questions.

0.285700	Maybe about what could be wrong with me. I get anxious every time I see the doctor and don't really know why. Maybe because I didn't do what I am supposed to do or finish my medication which I am pretty good at.

0.976200	I am worried about what they'll find and that they'll say. I rarely see the doctor so when I go, they always find something new that's wrong with me.
0.690500	I have a neuro condition and there are a lot of uncertainties around it. So when I have to be seen for it, it can be a long experience full of many questions. With uncertainties, it causes me anxiety because I don't have a game plan set it stone. If i have a reason why things happen, or a plan, i can deal with it, but when I don't have answers, it makes me nervous.
0.714300	I feel anxious that the issues I have that I think are probably relatively smaller problems are the result of a larger issue that needs to be taken care of. I worry whenever I go to the doctor that he will find something serious that can negatively impact my life.
0.190500	I would say just not making enough progress on the things I was given advice on last time. It's easy sometimes to hear information in the office, but applying it to daily life can be much more difficult. 
0.404800	somethiong is wrong with me

0.595200	I am afraid I will have testing that results in me being put on more medication or that something termil will show up that I've missed
0.142900	I dont get anxious, hes doing his job and will tell me what he thinks. Yeah there could be bad answers like i got cancer or something but for the most part its not that heavy
0.571400	That I will be termilly ill or have cancer. I get scared of the lights as well.
0.500000	It's awkward and uncomfortable.
0.142900	I wouldn't say that visiting the doctor in general makes me anxious, but there are certain procedures that I do dislike and cause me to be apprehensive, such as having blood taken, or having to take off clothes.

0.476200	It is not the most comfortable environment, and I may have a medical condition I am concerned about.
0.333300	I don't like being examined (especially pap smears) and getting shots. I feel most anxious about pain from shots and blood tests.
0.571400	they check me and ask me a lot of persol questions
0.619000	"Not knowing what will happen. You usually see a doctor when something is ""wrong"" and you're trying to figure out what it could be. "
0.547600	I worry a lot that I am not being told what I, as an individual need to do. I feel as though there are very standard treatments and more often that not, these are not the best for every single individual.
0.738100	I'm worried about getting bad news. Usually when I'm at the doctor, something is wrong with my health.
0.119000	Honestly, the only thing that bothers me is the long wait. Besides that.... nothing really makes me anxious...I figure the worst that will happen is I find out I have some kind of flesh eating disease.
0.738100	i worry that they are going to have bad news for me. i also worry that they are simply judging me. i also worry that things will arise that cost a lot of money. 
0.785700	It's not knowing test results. I want to hear quickly that I don't have serious illnesses. Then I can calm down and deal with what's bothering me.
0.142900	I have not had any worries when visiting the doctors office.
0.452400	Getting there on time and hoping to not have to wait, sometimes the uncertainly always makes  me nervous.
0.190500	Other people, like a waiting room that's too crowded. Or people coughing and sneezing. i don't do well with others usually.
0.666700	The unknown of what is going on with me. 
0.571400	If I think something is wrong with me. If I haven't been there in a long time.
0.285700	Nothing really, I've not had a bad or surprising experience with a physician. The only thing I would worry about is how long is the visit going to take!
0.500000	I am anxious when i visit the doctor and I can not pin point why I am. I feel like she is rushed and if I have a concern that day they she is not going to talk to me about it. It sort of makes it feel like pointless to even go in to the office.
0.714300	I always worry if they will make a mistake if its something being done. Also, I wonder if theyll find something else wrong. I worry also that I will make them uncomfortable.
0.571400	That i am going to be sick. That the doctor will be rude
0.642900	I am always worried that I am going to find out something that I don't want to hear. For instance, I am worried I could be diagnosed with a major health issue. Also, I fear sometimes that I will be reprimanded for not properly taking care of myself in between visits. 
0.500000	I just don't want to be unhealthy and that makes me anxious. The thought of there being something wrong and how I could afford to take care of myself. 
0.595200	"I have what I would call ""doctors anxiety"".  I tend to always get nervous when I go to a doctor.  Once I'm there, and start seeing the doctor, I usually feel better and less anxious."
0.142900	I think they will try to shove something down my throat.
0.714300	I am most worried about the bill.
0.428600	I think it's just the fear of the unknown. If I'm not going for any particular reason, you never know what they could find that could be potentially bad. It's just a little scary.
0.214300	I have a history of certain medical conditions and I'm getting to an age where those conditions may be more likely to occur.
0.428600	Unsure of what will happen. 
0.714300	I feel most anxious about whether or not I will receive a bad diagnosis.  Often I let my mind wander into the worst of possible situations.  It would be horrifying to me if I received a diagnosis like cancer.
0.452400	I don't always speak up for myself, especially with a new doctor, so it makes me anxious that I may agree to a treatment/medication/etc that I don't actually want to go through with.
0.309500	I usually just get anxious that they'll ask me to do something that makes me uneasy, like having my blood drawn. I have no real reason for it, but I dread having my blood drawn. I'd like for it to stay where it is.
0.285700	You always hear horror stories about doctors finding serious issues during routine checks. Although the odds are minuscule the thoughts still cross my mind 
0.571400	It is the waiting and wondering if they will take the time or just throw a prescription at me.
0.428600	Visiting the doctor's office, one usually feels apprehensive. The reason for this is that there's always a chance they can find something else wrong than what currently ails an individual. In other words, while I'm seeking treatment for one problem, I may end up having multiple reasons for my sickness.
0.547600	I would worry the most that they would find something life threatening or dangerous that is not outwardly apparent, and can only be found in a checkup.
0.381000	I get worried that there is something seriously wrong with me, potentially lethal.
0.714300	Well sometimes you might have a small problem that you think is bigger. So I try not to panic until I talk to the doctor and find out what's wrong and usually it's nothing really big.
0.214300	The thought of my numbers for my blood tests being bad are what worries me the most.
0.714300	Believe it or not, the smell. After that, I feel anxious sometimes being around sick people. Filly, I just get an uneasy feeling whenever I see a nurse or physician. Don't know why.
0.785700	I may receive life-altering information. Or, to treat something, I may start heading down the wrong path when it comes to treatment. The cost is also a concern. 
0.547600	I generally do not get worried when entering doctor's offices due to the fact that I usually have a general idea of what is wrong with me.
0.738100	I had a bad experience with my doctor when my daughter was born and from then on going back makes me nervous that something else will happen. 
0.452400	It's mostly wondering about if I actually have a condition that is wrong with me. It doesn't have much to do with them being a shady doctor.
0.500000	I am concerned that there is something going wrong with my body 
0.309500	That something might actually be wrong makes me feel anxious, but what makes me feel even worse is if I go in with a problem that turns out to be nothing.
0.190500	I only feel a very small amount of anxiety in case something comes up that I wasn't aware of.
0.738100	"I am always anxious that the doctor will not listen to what I have to say or write it off as ""all in my head,"" or they will not give me a satisfactory diagnosis and just throw antibiotics at me."
0.142900	If I feel anxious and worried, it must be the test result have some issue and doctor needs to talk to me personnel.
0.714300	Just hearing or getting back the results from tests or seeing what I've read or seen is true.  Guessing that the worst may come true from what the doctor says.
0.357100	If they look at the chart, and then exit the room immediately. This happened when I had interl bleeding from a wrestling accident. I immediately knew it was more serious than I initially thought.
0.976200	I have to go so long between visits to a physician, and my general health and nutrition are so poor that I dread hearing I have a serious illness every time I go. I worry about my wellbeing. I fear that years of poor health and dental care will catch up to me every time I see a physician.
0.166700	Nothing makes me feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office. I can also relate to what he's saying on a technical level and understand all of the different tests so it is hard to make me feel nervous.
0.428600	"I am worried that he will say something like ""this is rare"" or ""I have never seen this before"".  I want something routine that is easily eased."
0.928600	I just worry that they will find something that is terribly wrong with me.  I stress that until the exam is complete that I could have some issue that I did not know about.  
0.595200	I usually feel worried about what the results of my health assessment might be. I also get nervous about interacting with doctors (or people) in general, but I usually tell myself there isn't much to worry about just to calm myself down. 
0.476200	I do not like going to the doctor's in general so when I have to go to a doctor I feel restless and worried sometimes for no reason.
0.142900	Not a lot. It would have to be something quite serious that i'm concerned about for me to be nervous or worried. I don't recall the last time i was worried about an issue i was having to be honest. The only thing i may worry about is the cost of an antibiotic and if it's available in generic form. 
0.261900	The thing that makes me most anxious is just uncertainty.
0.166700	Just finding surprises regarding my health. The next thing would be the cost. Though I have insurance, It's hard to see what it covers or not and what I will end up paying.
1.000000	I have chair anxiety and I always have, dentists, doctors, anything like that freaks me out and I think it is a lot of my own neurosis but also the fact that doctors have had a very strange demenour with me and always made me feel like they thought I was too unintelligent to understand what they were telling me.
1.000000	I'm scared that she will find something wrong with me.  Something that will change my life.
0.547600	that theyre going to come throgh the door with some scary results.

0.690500	I sometimes feel anxious when I am unsure of an outcome. Say I have been having a gging pain or some kind of physical discomfort, for example. It makes me feel uneasy not knowing if these things could be serious or not.
0.500000	If i feel like something is wrong like pain. It gets me worried before i talk to the doctor because I'm not sure what's wrong with me. It always is not as bad as i initially think
0.595200	I feel most anxious about what they may tell me or if I have to take off my clothes. 
0.142900	I am worried if they will have to give me a shot that day
0.285700	I usually am anxious anytime I am at a doctors office cause I always worry something will be wrong with me.
1.000000	finding out something bad about my health
0.142900	In the back of my mind i worry that the doctor will find something terribly wrong with me like cancer and that is scary. But this is not at the forefront of my mind and i do not think of it often
0.619000	 I feel like they won't believe me when I say I am sick, and I'll have to pass some sort of test in order to get a prescription. I worry my copay money will be wasted if they just tell me to go home and wait it out.
0.857100	The doctor commenting on my weight
0.928600	Being weighed, being judged, not wanting to divulge information that may make me look bad. 
0.404800	I tend to be a hypochondriac so when something is bothering me enough to go to the doctor I worry that he will find something wrong with me. My mind can make me fear going to the doctor stronger than it should be by a lot.
0.761900	I always worried they will find something is wrong
0.142900	I do not feel anxious when visiting the doctor at all. The dentist is another matter entirely.
0.357100	The most obvious thing in my eyes...that they will find something wrong that I was not aware of.   It is similar to getting your car worked on.  You always worry the mechanic will come out of the shop and say your &lt;auto part here&gt; is also broken. 
0.285700	nothing at all
0.666700	That I'm going to go in for one thing and have something else come up
0.452400	I always have that lingering fear at my yearly ladies appointment that it will be discovered that I have cancer or something.  I think many women feel that way. 
0.285700	The only thing that makes me anxious is the wait time to see her.
0.952400	I fear most that they won't find a solution to the problem I'm having. My pains are real and sometimes they act like I'm faking it.
0.142900	Mostly time constrictions, which really has little to do with my doctor at all. She's pretty great, I must say.
0.142900	I am not usually anxious, but I guess it does cross my mind occasiolly that she may find something wrong during an exam.
0.428600	Trying to find out why I'm having certain symptoms 
0.690500	Just the not knowing if anything is seriously wrong. Also visits are usually annoying because you have to wait so long and it can be hard when you are sick. 
0.714300	I'm worried they'll find something really wrong with me. I'm not anxious about the doctor.
0.738100	Waiting for the doctor to give me results. Fear of the unknown.

0.523800	I'm not particularly comfortable with anyone touching me. I also worry that something is terribly wrong with me.
0.142900	Mostly it's the cost of going to the doctor. I don't normally expect the worst as far as my health is concerned.  
0.142900	I AM WORRIED THEY ARE GOING TO FIND SOMETHING MAJOR THAT IS WRONG WITH ME.
0.738100	I just don't really like doctor's offices or hospitals in general. I worry that I will get some bad news though things are usually fine, but I worry a lot in general.
1.000000	Fear of whether or not there's something wrong with me, and fear of how much treatment will cost. 
0.714300	I am always anxious that a problem will be something serious, even though it usually isn't. It is in my ture to prepare for bad news whether it is particularly likely or not.
0.166700	If I'm undergoing a procedure that could have bad results, that makes me anxious. Also, if I have to wait a long time.
0.571400	I always worry that a simple problem is actually something very serious 
0.761900	I usually imagine a worst case scerio, so I am worried about finding out something is seriously wrong with me. I also worry that the Doctor wont take my concerns seriously.
0.571400	I get most anxious when I'm waiting for test results or something. That's when I feel the most anxious, the waiting. I also feel anxious when something painful, like a shot, is about to happen.
0.285700	Just having to be there, really. What if they find something wrong, what if there's some sort of problem, etc. Its more general, low key anxiety than anything specific. 
0.500000	I get anxious about what they will say.  Since I have anxiety I worry my blood pressure will be higher then normal because of how I'm feeling and not how it normally is.
0.666700	I feel that anxious that my doctor will find something really wrong with me.  I worry that I will have to go to the hospital or have some procedure done.  It is the fear of having a serious medical condition.
0.761900	"The bill is number one with a bullet.  Then after that I would be most worried about whatever condition I came in for being worse than it appears, or worst case scerio a big ol' shrug of the shoulders from the doctor saying ""I don't know what causes that..."" then endless testing (oh wait that goes back to cost).  Also lost time I have to take off of work because no doctor keeps a schedule that takes into account peoples working schedule."
0.666700	when i have a problem i'm concerned about and they're trying to figure out what it is, and it becomes apparent it could be something bad
0.690500	I worry that they might find out I have a medical condition or disease that I will have to deal with. I am also nervous they might say I have not been taking good care of myself, like not exercising enough or not doing enough to watch my cholesterol.
0.619000	I am anxious because I know I am overweight, and I dread being weighed and measured. I am anxious about my blood-pressure reading and blood sugar readings, as high blood pressure and diabetes run in my family. 
0.857100	it makes me worried when i don't go as often as i should. So i know there is a possibility of being deficient in something that i could have prevented had i went like i was supposed to.
0.476200	That I may have to have a shot.
0.357100	When visiting the doctor's office sometimes I fear that I will hear the words cancer or something like that.
0.214300	I am most anxious about possible serious problems that are manifesting.  I worry that I may be worse off than I think.
0.642900	I would feel the most anxious about finding out bad news.  I would be worried about finding out I have a health problem.
0.904800	I am worried because I'm overweight and self conscious. I'm worried they will give me a hard time about my size. I'm worried they will find something wrong with me. 
0.571400	I am scared they will find something that is termil. My father passed away from cancer when I was very young, and I get extremely anxious that I will get blindsided with something terrible. 
0.571400	I don't like being examined and you never know what may come up.  There's always a worry that a doctor will find something wrong.  
0.571400	I'm worried I'll have a condition I didn't think about. I'm worried I won't be able to live.
0.904800	I guess, obviously, the thing that makes me most worried is the potential for finding something wrong. The second most worrying thing for me is being in that close proximity (prodded, touched) by someone. I also worry about catching something from all the sick people in the building.
0.881000	I don't want to have to take my clothes off. Most of the time the basic rule of society is to avoid being ked in front of other people, it's hard to adjust to the idea that it's supposed to be normal to do for medical professiols.
0.833300	I have a general anxiety towards doctors. I feel as though if i go to the doctor i am going to get bad news. No matter what i go for, i feel like they are going to find a termil illness that i did not know i had. 
0.500000	I feel anxious because I am afraid my doctor will miss something because they don't care that much about my health they just want to prescribe me something expensive and then send me away. 
0.976200	I cried last time I went because I couldn't handle the stress of him treating me like I'm stupid or asking why I'm gaining so much weight. All he could say was I'm referring you to a phys doctor. 
0.571400	Being forced to make a decision in a short amount of time about something that can affect my life long term. I also have to shell out a lot of money for a service that has a high chance of not helping me.
0.571400	If I am at the doctor's office for a routine checkup I usually feel fine. If I am there for a problem, I sometimes worry about what the diagnosis will be, such as what is the exact problem, cause, and how long it will last. I tend to worry a lot about physical pain when I have an injury, and worry that it might not heal properly, or that I might be in pain for a long time.
0.333300	turally worrying whether or not all is well. I also think the enviornment of the doctors waiting room and the doctors room can be intimidating. 
0.714300	What makes me feel most anxious is that the doctor is going to discover a serious medical condition I did not know I had. I am anxious that this will affect my quality of life going forward. This makes me anxious to some degree about visits.
0.761900	Probably the idea that something is very wrong. I am rather overweight, and I know that leads to major problems.
0.238100	I'm occasiolly nervous about what the diagnosis will be or if there will be one. There have been times that I've had to go back a few times before being referred and finding out what is really wrong. 
0.595200	Sometimes I just get worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me, and that I will need surgery or something too costly.
0.547600	I just don't like the sterility and seriousness in the office. It's not because I'm afraid of what's he's going to tell me.
0.571400	That something will be seriously wrong
0.333300	I feel most anxious while I am waiting for test results to come back. Most often they are not bad news but it is the waiting that gets to me.
0.428600	Not knowing whats going on or why I feel the way I do (symptoms). Not knowing how long the wait times are.
0.690500	That the doctor will find something wrong with my health.
0.357100	How long it takes. The test that I have to take.
0.738100	When they are scowling and in a bitter mood. It's not my fault but they still end up taking out their anger on me. It greatly pisses me off. So i go home think whether or not they truly told me what I needed to hear
0.476200	I get anxious because I am afraid that the dr. will find something wrong with me that I did not know about. 
0.690500	I am most anxious that the doctor will tell me that something is wrong. I know that if something is wrong, I will have to do/take something that is very inconvenient or expensive.
0.309500	Nothing in particular. As I said, I've been going to the same place for years, so I'm very comfortable there. I get a bit anxious when I'm sitting there waiting, simply because I hate waiting for anything.
0.714300	I guess wondering whether or not they are going to be honest with me. If I knew they are going to try to push an antibiotic or prescription, I'd already be defensive. I don't take pharmaceuticals. 
0.785700	I usually assume the worst, when I have a doctors visit. Most of the time I was right. 
0.761900	I worry that they are going to tell me something is wrong, that I am sick or dying. Just a general fear of receiving bad news.
0.309500	I feel little uncomfortable to describe some pain about mine body.
0.214300	I am most worried that the doctor will find something wrong.
0.142900	The one thing that would bring about this feeling is not knowing. When you have to wait on test results and you dont know what will be the outcome. 
0.547600	I feel the most anxious about being weighed or having my blood pressure taken and it is high.
0.404800	I don't honestly feel anxious when visiting the doctor. I am there to get help. I can imagine if I had a severe health problem that my anxiety level would be much higher but so far I have not had that experience.
1.000000	"Everything. The sights, sounds, smells... The possibility of learning something terrible about my health... The vulnerability of having to undress in front of people I don't know well... The humiliation of having issues blamed on my weight... I had a terrible pediatrician as a kid who berated and terrified me and snuck up on me with vaccitions, and I've had a lot of medical anxiety ever since. My ""white coat syndrome"" in regard to my blood pressure when I see a doctor is HORRIBLE."
0.404800	If I think something is actually wrong with me. I'll be a bit nervous until I get the results. Usually I try to keep calm.
0.333300	I feel anxious when I have been waiting for a long time and I have a symptom that is bothering me, such as pain. I just want to stop feeling the pain, but I'm dwelling on it because of the long wait in the waiting room.
0.404800	
0.214300	I'm always worried that my doctor will find something horribly wrong with me like cancer
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious in a doctor's office is the uncertainty of it. I don't like feeling bad and not knowing what is wrong, and wondering about the diagnosis can be nervewracking.
0.738100	Just sitting there wondering what they will find or if my condition is changing for the worse.
0.333300	I have always been anxious at the doctor's office, from when I was an infant.  Nowadays, it's not so bad, but mainly the sterility of the room, and the hyper-awareness of my body, plus being poked or prodded at, makes me nervous.
0.261900	Doing blood work. 
0.809500	I worry the doctor will find something I did not expect. I also worry that if something is wrong, it will be expensive to treat. I tend to fear for the worst.
0.857100	I always worry if they will find something wrong.  As I get older, this is more likely.
0.238100	I know that my physician will want to spend less than 5 minutes with my care and that annoys me. I feel anxious in order to get my most immediate needs out as quickly as possible knowing that he will soon sprint for the door. I do not feel that I am receiving adequate care with him and am looking to change physicians.
0.785700	Because they take tests and the waiting in the room while the Dr. is on the way can be worrisome because it could go really well or really bad. Its the anticipation and unknowing that can make one feel anxious.
0.190500	Just that something might be wrong but only slightly have the feeling
0.285700	I am not typically anxious about visiting the doctor's office.
0.690500	I worry that my doctor would find something wrong with me. I want to go in there alive, and come out fine without any problems. I'm also not comfortable with people touching me, even if it is my doctor.
0.714300	What might be found that I wasn't aware of or couldn't see.  No one wants bad news, especially at the doctors!
0.404800	Unexpected changes in weight, blood pressure, etc. (i.e. the unknown.)
0.309500	Just about my health. I don't worry much at all but sometimes I think that maybe they'll find something wrong, like maybe my blood pressure is bad.
0.571400	Going to the doctors office is just an activity that makes me unsettled. Generally you go to the doctor to fix a problem, but if not then there is a good chance you may get sick after you leave since there are several other sick people there usually. If you have a specific problem you are struggling with (nerve pain, for example), it seems that they know more than the average person about causes and possible medications to help, but really they are just guessing about what might work and what not and it's just process of elimition. It's frustrating.
0.500000	I do not like getting blood drawn, and I get scared to hear bad news.
0.142900	I don't really get anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office.  I don't see a reason to get anxious or worried when in most cases the illness you have is just something simple or common.  Even if it is a rarer disease, it can usually be treated in some way.  
0.619000	worried something might be wrong. 
0.285700	I usually expect the worse. I usually find out my fears were unfounded and the problem is easily solved.
0.619000	Of course I am concerned there may be some serious issue that I didn't know about. Everyone is a bit paranoid about their health and little pains or symptoms that they experience.
0.381000	I am mostly worried about the worst outcome. If I have a problem that I do not know what is going on, I am worried that the diagnosis will be poor and that could affect my lifespan or quality of life in general. I am also anxious when they lecture me about my health habits because I don't need a lecture as an adult, I understand my choices.
0.547600	If anything has changed, if my health has worsened even though I feel okay.

0.642900	I hate having to talk to people about myself, and I feel like if I say something's been bothering me they'll treat me as if I don't know my own body and as if everything's my fault. I feel like they look down on me when I'm not in 100% top condition.

0.714300	I am turally an anxious person, but when I visit my doctor I'm paranoid he's going to find something that I didn't know was wrong with me. I think this is tural.
0.452400	The bill, for one. I can self diagnose online for free. We only go to the doctor to get pills for a condition we didn't know we had. I would rather die a horrible cancerous death than bother going on chemo or any BS like that.

0.142900	I don't. I'm always calm when i visit my Dr
0.523800	The fear that soemthing worse might be wrong with me then initially thought. That uncertainty can make me very uncomfortable.
0.690500	I'm mostly worried about not asking the right questions while I am there. I'm not usually sure what I need to be asking. I then worry about whether  I'll be able to understand all the information that is going to be thrown at me. I'm just hoping it sticks so I can move on with my life as comfortably as possible. 
0.214300	Just the wait and time it takes to get through everything.
0.690500	The thing that makes me anxious when visiting the doctor's office is the possibility that I could have a health problem.

0.571400	I am never that anxious, but if I am it is usually jut generalized anxiety that i always have. I have social anxiety in almost every social situation.

0.476200	the fear of the unknown, especially at my age, is what makes me worried.  Everyone has the fear of cancer.
0.642900	I have longstanding health problems and I'm always worried they are going to say there are signs that they are getting worse. This makes me anxious and worried.
0.738100	i had having female check ups those seem so invasive
0.214300	That I'm going to have an underlying problem that is going to be a long-term health ailment. My biggest fear is that I go in for one problem, but my Dr. discovers something more horrendous. 
0.142900	Usually it's just a routine check up, so I never really am too worried. I would guess that the only worry I would have is if something came back unusual from my regular check up, but then again, that would just mean it was caught before I even noticed anything wrong, which would be better than being caught too late.
0.142900	What makes the most anxious is when they're running extremely late and I have to sit there and wait.  It gets me upset that they don't care that I've had to take time out of my day and they should be courteous to others as we are to them.

0.309500	The ever-present possibility of long wait times.

0.785700	cause i know he doesn't care.  i think i have white coat syndrome too where i get nervous...especially with the new doctor.  He knows nothing about me.  So i just don't go to the doctor.  I've had a cold for 3 weeks and won't go.
0.238100	I do not get anxious around doctors.
0.285700	I would say that I feel most anxious when the doctor's facial expression says something before they even tell me.  if the doctor looks discouraged about test results I usually become anxious or worried.
0.571400	Finding out that I have something more serious than I thought I did in the first place. Generally I only got when I am very sick.
0.642900	After having some tests done, I'm always fearful while waiting for the results.  She will usually tell me what to expect, but I worry about everything.

0.666700	I am worried that the diagnosis would be something completely different from what I expected it to be. I am worried that something may be more serious than it seems.

0.738100	I never know what could be wrong with me.  I'm most worried about not knowing what the procedure might entail, if anything will hurt, and if a new condition will be discovered.
0.523800	I am always worried that they will tell me something is wrong.  Going to the doctor gives me general anxiety.
0.309500	That they will find something unexpected that is detrimental to my health.
0.714300	Not knowing what the outcome will be. I'm not a hypochondriac per se, but I do tend to think the worst thing whenever something is wrong with me physically. I dread getting a bad diagnosis but usually it's not that bad and can be easily fixed.
0.428600	Without a doubt, giving blood or receive a vaccition such as a flu shot. I really don't like needles:)
0.381000	What makes me most anxious is just being around people, and having the environment be chaotic and loud. 
0.500000	Well if he insist on taking another test
0.523800	I always worry before a doctor's appointment. I always worry that I'll get bad news.

0.357100	I feel in many cases that the answers I get are just stock answers. No thinking out of the box. I would have zero issues if my doctor asked me to exercise or eat better for 2 weeks and then come back as a suggestion. Instead, it feels like receiving a pill is what I usually get. That is when I feel anxious of what just happened and worried that I won't get better. 
0.500000	I feel worried that I will not be able to describe the problems that I am having because I don't remember things about them, like how often they occur and for how long.

0.428600	how much the price of meds will be
0.619000	Sometimes I'm afraid there might be something wrong with me that I don't know about yet. 
0.738100	I feel this way because I do not know what the doctor is going to respond with after he alyzes my condition.  I am then feeling stressed because I will ultimately have to sift through the facts and determine how I want to proceed.  I get worried because I am afraid the doctor is going to provide a misdiagnosis or find something else wrong I may not have needed to know about at the time.
0.190500	I have a history of medical problems. Every time I go to the doctors I pray nothing else will be wrong. Along with my current issues are stable/improving. 
0.595200	I just feel worried that they don't have my best interest at heart. They just want to line their own pockets. They also don't spend much time explaining things or giving altertives.
0.571400	I get worried that something may be wrong and I don't know it.
0.333300	I only get anxious when I visit the doctor when I think there is something wrong with me that I am not sure about. I Google my symptoms and start to get even more worried before I even see the doctor. I am worried about what the doctor may say and I fear the worst. 
0.142900	When I have something wrong and the doctor takes a long time to figure out what it is. Though I suppose the worst is worrying about the cost of the procedure.
0.547600	Misdiagnose me or just scam me into spending more.
0.261900	"I always worry about getting that ""I don't know what's causing your problems"" answer - or worse yet, the clear implication that it's ""all in my head."" I fear the doctor won't find anything, when I absolutely know that something is wrong."
0.142900	The only thing I ever feel anxious or worried about is (1) waiting too long for the doctor to appear and (2) worry about whether I going to get a nurse who will do a painless job with the needle!
0.666700	The fear that something might be wrong.
0.738100	that he will find something that is untreatable.
0.904800	It's just uncomfortable having your body examined by a stranger. Waiting in the room, sometimes half ked, is really not my idea of fun. I am afraid of being judged by the doctor or afraid of finding out some sort of bad news about my health.
0.333300	I feel most anxious when I'm going to have to have blood drawn. I have a thyroid disorder, so it's fairly often so they can check my TSH. I don't like needles and I am a lot better than I used to be, but I always get a little nervous about the stick.
0.476200	It depends on the situation. If I am seeing my doctor, say, because I am not feeling well or in a lot of pain, then of course I'll feel anxious and worried that something might be seriously wrong. If it's just routine checkups, then I'm relaxed.
0.881000	I am incredibly anxious to begin with and I'm not a huge fan of going to the doctors. I hate the unknown, but I hate bad news even more. I also get scared of being judged by the doctors and nurses. 
0.571400	He telling me that something is wrong with my results.
0.738100	I often feel anxious or worried about them always wanting to discuss my weight. Not my problem the reason I am there. They are always trying to blame me being overweight a little.

0.309500	Just the possibility of things that could go wrong. Things could always go awry. The doctor could always find something that you did not know you had going on.
0.142900	I get a little anxious if I have to wait awhile for my physician. Sometimes I'm worried if something new is bothering me and finding out what it is. 
0.381000	It's not a remark on my confidence in my doctor; it's more of the fact that I'm worried that I have some underlying condition that is more serious than I anticipated.
0.714300	I think I worry the most about what could be wrong. Even though I'm in excellent health, I have somewhat of a fear that something could be wrong with me when I go in.
0.476200	Nothing specific.  I do not take great care of myself and have a rough family medical history.
0.785700	I get anxious going to the doctor because I don't know what they will say or have me do, and I don't know if I will be able to explain my problem well enough for them to understand.

0.666700	worry that something is wrong

0.690500	The not knowing why they do what they are doing when they are doing it. I have yet to find a doctor that will answer my ongoing questions as to WHY things are done and What the purpose of those are, in a complete way. Sometimes the answers that I get just make me have more questions.
0.595200	I worry about what the doctor might find. I feel much more at ease once it is over and I am given a clean bill of health. Until then, I get nervous about anything that might be going in my body that I didn't know about. 
0.285700	"I am most worried about the ""fear of the unknown"".  In other words, will the doctor discover something that I am not aware of.   I am not worried about taking any shots or vaccines - but more worried on what I don't know at this point about my health."
0.571400	Nothing makes me so. I believe in God's providence in everything including my own health.
0.547600	How long the affair is going to take. How poor the doctor's bedside manner is going to be. How much of my problem's they'll casually write off as being about my weight and nothing more. Whether or not they'll believe me about problems I'm having.
0.619000	There is always the concern that you might have some serious health issue that you didn't spot and that a doctor may notice. I also am not a fan of being touched by those I'm not close with so I get a bit anxious due ot the amount of physical contact involved in most appointments.

0.309500	if it isn't something that is easily diagnosed then there would be cause for concern. most of the time it's a cold or a cough so not anxious usually.,
0.285700	I am worried that if I go to the doctor for something minor, something else will be found that is more serious. I live a healthy life but somethings you can't prevent.

0.190500	The only time I have ever been anxious when seeing a doctor was when I was pregnt. I would be worried they would find something wrong with the baby.

0.142900	"I'm not anxious or worried when I visit a doctor, at all. There isn't a need to be. It's not as if I ""must"" by some law follow what they ask me to do, it's merely a choice. I'd be far more worried to visit a dentist and worry about needing a cavity filled then seeing a doctor. "

0.142900	The most worried I get is being concerned about having to wait to long to be seen.  Other than that, there isn't much to be worried or anxious about.  Whatever I am there for, the doctor will do his best.

0.738100	Being examined and evaluated more than anything. Insecurity, if I had to put it another way.
0.595200	Them finding something wrong with me that isn't easy to fix.
0.500000	Needles primarily, but once it happens it isn't htat bad. It's the anticipation that bothers me.
0.690500	Everything about going to the doctor gives me anxiety. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, so it can not really be helped. I am concerned that I will only hear bad news, or that the doctor will be cold and judgemental, or any other number of things that could be negative about the experience. 
0.619000	What they may find or tell me what is wrong.
0.238100	Just know I don't go enough and dont stay on top of my health and past health issues so when I go I am slightly worried about things I neglected to keep checking on being worse 
0.690500	Being judged. Having to get kid. 
0.142900	That I'll have a super long wait. I really don't get nervous about visiting the doctor. 
0.166700	It does make me worried if I have some sort of condition that feels unresolved or it could worsen. I know it is good to figure out what is going on, but it worries me to imagine what it could be.
0.690500	not being able to properly explain my condition and not receiving adequate treatment
0.642900	I get irratiol fears that my ear infection will somehow end up being cancer. This is the mindset I normally have when I visit the doctors so I normally have a healthy amount of anxiety when I have to go in.
0.952400	I am afraid I might be told something I don't want to hear, such as cancer.
0.452400	I can feel anxious about my doctor finding something wrong with me.
0.595200	Honestly, just the thought of having to go into the office and waiting. I have gotten to the point in my life now where I freely discuss health issues and concerns. 
0.547600	Am I going to have the issue addressed or will I have it out aside again.
0.238100	"I'm turning 40 this year, so I do get a little anxious these days when I go to the doctor. There's always a little ""what if he finds something"" voice in the back of my head, even though I'm quite healthy overall. I don't really mind going all that much, though."
0.190500	I'm worried that I may have a hidden condition of some sort. I generally feel healthy, but there is also a small thought in the back of my head that I may have hidden, lingering cancer or something. I don't want to get bad news. 
0.690500	Finding out that I might have a chronic disease.
0.357100	It's not so much the doctor visit that concerns me.  It's the lab results.  As I am under aggressive treatments for my Cancer, my lab numbers fluctuate with various modalities and medications and that gives me modest concern.
0.404800	It's a little irratiol, but sometimes when I'm in the waiting room, I worry about that the doctor might find something terribly wrong. I know there's nothing really wrong because I feel fine, but in the back of my mind, I still think something might crop up that will be a terrible burden to treat. 
0.738100	I hate shots. I hate shots a LOT. I'm always in fear that my affliction will result in a blood test or a shot of some sort and that's when I get REALLY tense.
0.452400	I mostly just get worried that I will have some unforeseen symptom that they notice that could mean something bad. I also get worried I will need a shot that day.
0.142900	nothing i know my body and the health care system as well as my doctor so there is nothing to be anxious about
0.619000	"I guess there is always the possibility of seeing a doctor for a simple check-up and having them start a sentence with, ""Oh my god, why didn't you have this mole looked at sooner....you have a week to live."" I don't really think that way until I am half-dressed and being examined.  So I would say there is a moment of feeling vulnerable in that situation, but I don't obsess or anything."
0.642900	I'm anxious about what might be wrong with me and how much the treatments will cost.
0.285700	Nothing much really....
0.476200	Typically I am just worried something will come up during the exam. My doctor is capable of making me feel better. The diagnosis of things is typically explained properly as well with little questions from me.
0.809500	The fact that I would ever be in a position to where I would have to visit a doctor for anything.
0.785700	I worry about being judged or put down again. I worry that there will be something terribly wrong with me and the dr will miss it or dismiss me based on my appearance.
0.285700	Maybe having bad results.
0.761900	Worried that I get diagnosed with a serious illness.
0.142900	In the past I had struggled with Anxiety and Depression. I do not currently struggle with these issues and they have since been resolved. Due to the ture and cultural stigma relating to mental health it was somewhat difficult for me to deliver my concerns verbally to my doctor. This made me feel very anxious and worried before my appointment, but once I filly maged to communicate my concerns I was put at ease by my doctors professiolism and demeanor regarding the issues. He helped a great deal my overcoming this medical condition and now I no longer have these issues and no longer need medication for this.
0.881000	How much my insurance will cover.  If the doctor will tell me something I don't want to know.  If they are going to treat me with respect and give me the time that I need.
0.571400	Fear that I may need to spend more money. Whether it's a follow up, a medication, or even just a test.
0.285700	Nothing about going to the doctor makes me feel this way.  Usually I feel annoyed because of the kids, the waiting, and the cost.
0.714300	I have a severe case of white coat syndrome. As soon as I walk into the office I start sweating profusely. Strange because I am a doctor...
0.381000	I'm getting older, and I know I'm not as strict with myself about maintaining proper diet and exercise.  I know it's for my own good, but visiting my doctor means confronting my own shortcomings in this area.
0.714300	If I have a health problem I usually get anxious over whether the doctor will be able to help me or not. I get worried about what tests or procedures might be necessary and whether any serious diseases might be discovered.
0.357100	There's a lot that I don't know when I go into a doctor's office, and I'm often concerned that I'm forgetting to say something that is relevant to my health. I don't know what is and isn't necessary to know, and the whole experience makes me aware of my own frailty and mortality in a way I usually am not.
0.714300	Health problems for me tend to get found when things go wrong. I have had serious health problems. Ever examition feels like it could lead to a new treatment, a new bill, a new health concern. 
0.214300	that he might find something wrong with me that i was uware of or that is bad.
0.738100	I am always afraid even if i  am doing  everything right that I'm going in and they are going to tell me bad news. I have what they call white coat syndrome and it makes me feel bad. 
0.666700	when i am experiencing a medical problem I sometimes have anxiety about it. The unknown makes me anxious 
0.642900	I think the feeling of finding something seriously wrong. I've been lucky to not have very many medical problems in life so I only have to go to the doctor for something minor. It's not a familiar place so that makes for some anxious feelings overall. 
0.833300	When I visit a doctor's office I am always anxious because I don't know what he is going to find. I am always worried about my physical health.
0.523800	I think it's just the fact that I could get really bad news at the doctor. 
0.690500	I always worry that the doctor I'm seeing won't be attentive to my needs. I have encountered several doctors that seem to have a script that they recite, no matter what ailment I'm being seen for. I worry that the visit will not accomplish anything, and it makes me feel quite helpless.
0.595200	I am afraid of the procedures that cause pain.Also finding something is wrong with me is scary.
0.238100	What makes me the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the possibility of receiving really bad news whether it pertains to me or my children. This holds especially true every time my daughter has a checkup or when my wife and I had our hearts looked at to ensure we didn't have any issues go unnoticed for the majority of our lives.
0.500000	"I don't want to hear anything bad. I know I am not in the greatest shape and I need to ""get busy"" but do I? No.. like everyone else we want to be in denial. "
0.166700	The thing that I experience the most anxiety from is the fact that there are other people at the office. I always have anxiety when being in the same room as multiple people. However, one on ones with the doctor or nurse doesn't bother me at all.
0.642900	Recieving bad news. Getting a wrong diagnosis.
0.785700	The fear that something adverse may be discovered. Also the existential feeling of a lack of control over a possible health issue.
0.381000	I think there's always that worry in the back of your head that there may be something really wrong with you and the doctor is about to find it and tell you.
0.357100	I'm usually worried they won't believe me about whatever problem I'm having. I've had this happen multiple times, and both issues turned out being detectable, serious ones even though the first doctor didn't believe me.
0.523800	If I truly think something is wrong with me, then I am most anxious when she is  giving the physical examition.\
0.523800	I am worried that there will be something that will be expensive. Unfortutely we are in a position where we don't have great insurance coverage and we don't have a lot of savings so a medical issue could be very costly to us. 
0.714300	I lost trust , because i want doctors to tell the truth if they are not aware of some type of medical problem before, rather than using someone as a guinea pig for their experiment.
0.666700	I am most anxious and worried when visiting a doctor because I am fearful that they might find something seriously wrong with me. I am not a hypochondriac but I usually only see a doctor when something is bothering me.
0.690500	Thinking that you have some major disease. 
0.452400	If my blood pressure it too high, or my weight is too high.  I work out every day and I've been a healthy eater my whole life, so when my weight goes up, I get pretty upset because I feel like there's no reason for it.
0.619000	I guess I am always afraid that something will turn up on a test that I was not anticipating.  There are so many detriments that can lie dormant, and something may turn up even without symptoms.  In some cases, I tend to wonder whether its better to know than not, because then you begin to live as if you have the indientified ailment.
0.642900	I have a touch of health anxiety, so I tend to expect the worst. Even if my symptoms are fairly benign, my imagition gets the best of me.
0.285700	I don't normally feel anxious for myself, but i do get nervous for my child and unborn baby. I worry that a simple cold is actually cancer or that the baby will have some rare disease. With myself, I worry that I will have cancer and won't be able to raise my kids. The actual doctor doesn't make me nervous at all. 
0.595200	I always fear the worst. I think I'm going to end up getting something really bad and those thoughts run through my mind while im in the office.
0.214300	I feel anxious that something might be wrong with me. I worry that I might get diagnosed with something bad.
0.452400	I feel most anxious before the uncertainty of answers. I understand trained medical professiols are not supposed to let on emotiolly about the prognosis/diagnosis of a patient. Still, I rely on the small nuances in their expression or tone, body language, etc. to gauge the real severity of the situation.
0.833300	I am most worried that my doctor will notice that my health has been going downhill since the last time I saw them. I am also uneasy about the physical examition that involves my doctor physically touching me under the hospital gown.
0.666700	That they'll find something seriously wrong with me. I'm always afraid I will have some termil illness.
0.714300	I just want answers, which is something I can never get. I really don't even care if the answers are not good, I just want some answers, that's all.
0.142900	When they have to draw blood from my hand for some test.I am not afraid of the test result but the pain of the needle.
0.738100	I am worried if anything would be wrong. I'm worried what my doctor will think about me. 
0.285700	I am not anxious or worried at all when I visit the doctor's office. There is not point in it. If something is wrong then worrying about it isn't going to help the situation get any better.
0.904800	I never look forward to seeing what it says on the scale, to start. Then the pressure I feel about the decisions I make about my own health seem to come under scrutiny and that makes me extremely uncomfortable. I can't wait to be done with the appointment.
0.595200	I have anxiety about a lot of things. I don't think it's something in particular that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I just do and it's hard to pinpoint exactly what I'm anxious/worried about. 
0.642900	I don't feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office. I usually feel relieved that something that is going on is going to get taken care of here. I don't like to go to the doctor but I feel better once I know what is going on with my health than not knowing. 
0.785700	Going to the doctor makes me uneasy because it's so persol and I'm concerned there may be something more serious happening.
0.523800	I only get nervous about a bad diagnosis.
0.142900	The most worrisome thought would be they're going to find out some things wrong that can't be fixed. I mean if you find out you have to take medicine or have a light surgery it's fine. You go there and they tell you that you have cancer, or heart failure all because you went there because you had a slight cough and are slightly fatigued..... I mean who expects that to happen?
0.642900	I think just the thought of them finding something  wrong is why i get really worried , 
0.642900	I just worry in general about my check up results.  I'm getting older and weigh more than when I was younger.  I just get a bit anxious on blood pressure now too.
0.142900	I can't. I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I feel calm and indifferent, and a bit bored.
0.142900	I don't really feel anxious about visiting the doctor's office. If anything, I might be worried about arriving late to the appointment. I wouldn't like being late.
0.690500	I am always afraid that they are going to find something seriously wrong that I am not aware of.
0.666700	I always expect a clean bill of health but I get anxious and worry that they will find something wrong with me and that is why i do not like to go. Id rather not know
0.809500	I worry about what disease I may have after reading information online about causes of severe pain. I worry about my organs and as I age, there seem to be more things wrong and more things that I have concerns about.
0.619000	Fear of the unknown. I have come because something is wrong and I do not know the answer and I will have a long wait and this will be all I am thinking about because  have to reschedule my whole day to do it.
0.547600	My anxiety stems from uncertainty. Each time I go to the doctor for a physical exam, I have to do blood work. Even though I am relatively healthy, I do not know what that blood work would come back saying. This has little to do with my doctor and more to do with just the uncertainty of the human body. 
0.523800	I just worry sometimes that they might find something that I already didn't know about.  I don't like to be surprised usually.  Especially when it comes to my own body and health.
0.523800	I'm little bit afraid of bad news.
0.571400	You worry about what could possibly be wrong with you. Worry about getting certain things done. or worry about how people percieve you.
0.476200	That my doctor will find a new problem with me. That I have a new bacteria or that I have a big problem;
0.428600	I'm getting ked in front of a mostly complete stranger who is poking and prodding me, literally looking for things that are wrong...
0.595200	Just the notion that a test result could reveal something bad.  Cancer, for instance. 
0.595200	Uncertainty.  Anything can happen. I could be walking out of there and know that I will be dead in a week or I will no nothing more than I did before. 
0.404800	I seldom feel it. Maybe because the doctor is gorgeous or maybe If I'm afraid to find out that something bad is happening to me which I'm very thankful that it hasn't happen to me yet.
0.809500	Just the overall experience. You never know what to expect or what they could find that isn't necessarily good.
0.166700	I rarely get anxious at the doctors office.  If I go to the doctor when I feel like something may be wrong, then I may be anxious until I know that it is not something serious.
0.857100	I feel like my doctor is judging my body. I feel like I am inferior because I am not in good health and have many problems compared to my doctor.
0.738100	I fear that they are going to find something really serious is wrong with me. 
0.642900	Getting my blood pressure taken and going on the scale to measure my weight. Two things I dont think many people like doing.
0.619000	I worry that the doctor will find something that i am uware of. I fear what they find will be painful or expensive to treat.
0.190500	That they might find something that I have wrong with me. I have to doctor a lot for my problems and I'm paranoid that I will get something that is caused by the medicine.
0.142900	Nothing makes me feel nervous about seeing a doctor
0.547600	I just do not like the whole experience, or the sterile smell of the health care faculties. 
0.452400	I am not sure what the outcome will be. Is he going to give me any news I may not want to hear.
0.761900	I am worried that my doctor will be very upset with me because I am not losing weight.  I keep gaining weight.  I am worried that I will eventually have high blood pressure or diabetes.
1.000000	When I had to go in for a CT scan of my head after a surgery (I moved shortly after this surgery so this hospital was new), the doctors started freaking out because there was a significant amount of blood around my brain, which we knew about after my surgery. They however didn't and they admitted me and were contemplating doing emergency surgery even though I wasn't displaying any alarming symptoms like I should have. Long story short, that even made me terrified of going to the doctor, because being hospitalized that rapidly even though I felt fine was really disturbing, and to think that if things didn't work out for me, I could have never seen the outside world again just like that. 
0.428600	Being in a doctor's office makes me feel anxious because I am vulnerable and surrounded by people I do not know. That is an uncomfortable situation for me. 
0.428600	I worry about new findings or a change in my health.  I also worry if a procedure is going to be uncomfortable or painful.  
0.595200	them telling me something that I don't want to hear
0.523800	I have no problem with being in a doctor's office since I used to work in one. But, I do hate when they take my vitals then have me sit for a half hour before doing their quick 5 minute check up. 
0.523800	That I'll get sick from being around so many sick people.
0.142900	The only thing I get worried about is what my number on the scale will be. (weight)
0.761900	That I will receive bad news but mostly because of my social anxiety as soon as I come in I'm terrified. 
0.714300	Getting results back from tests when trying to find out if certain symptoms may be signs of a new condition or decline in health will make me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. 
0.238100	Not much really, unless I'm going there because I think there is really something wrong with me. Like finding a lump in my breast or something of that kind. But generally, I feel fine when I go there.
0.500000	What makes me feel anxious sometimes is seeing other patients with various ailments waiting to see their doctors. When I'm thinking there might be something wrong with me, it unsettles me a bit to see other people who aren't well.
0.381000	I am worried that I am going to get bad news or poor test results.
0.381000	I don't like to have closed contact with people in general. Visiting a doctor and having the doctor examine my body is uncomfortable for me. 
0.547600	I worry about getting bad news. I also don't really like strangers touching me so this causes anxiety.
0.666700	"A lot of them have elitism or an ego about them. I expereinced this several times with doctors. Or while you are sitting there at your lowest point, barely able to hold your head up, they will talk down to you. YES THEY DO. fuck em. Sorry but I can't with medical doctors. There is so much intellectual elitism and yet they haven't actually ""cured"" anyone of diseases because the underlying issue of what everyone is eating isn't addressed. We act like if we can eat it, it's our food source and will go in and out of the body. Unfortutely people forget that in anything, if you burn dirty, or the wrong fuel, you will RUIN the machine/your body."
0.285700	When my doctor is checking my weight I get worried because I am trying to lose weight to control my diabetes 
0.500000	More so the results of testing or the results for why Im there.
0.523800	I get anxious when I visit the doctor's office because of the fear of what could be wrong. I think that it is deep rooted from the loss of my first born child.
0.285700	I am not at all anxious or worried about anything.  My doctor is just wonderful.  I go every six months.  I was just there, and he is a great doctor.
0.738100	I am mostly nervous about the cost of the visit.  To a lesser extent I am worried about what he might find (ie cancer) or something of that ture. 
0.285700	I don't usually get anxious when I see my doctor.  I might get anxious if I see a new doctor b/c I don't know how he will treat me.
0.476200	I am always about any appoiment, every time I go se the doctor I just don't like to wait.
0.500000	That they won't know what's wrong, or that they won't take me seriously enough.
0.833300	I get anxious thinking they will think less of me for how little I've taken care of myself. Which is not true really. I exercise every day. Literally every day. The results are not very noticeable, but I would be WAY worse off if I didn't exercise. 
0.571400	The possability for bad news.
0.857100	I am just anxious and apprehensive when I go into new environments and have to deal with people that I don't know and situations that are uncertain, that includes doctor's offices.
0.142900	What makes mw feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office is finding out that there could be something seriously wrong with me and also having to get a shot or blood drawn.
0.500000	I just get anxious for some reason.  I don't like being told something is wrong with me so I get worried.  Also I hate having to give blood or do other procedures that could hurt.
0.642900	That they won't hear me. Or that I'll get some dreadful diagnosis and then be faced with decisions that I don't want to make.
0.404800	Having something wrong with me that will require me to take a medication that is the only option to cure what is wrong with me but at the same time will have side effects which will continue to effect me for a while.
0.142900	I dislike going to the doctor in general so I always feel anxious being in a doctors office.
0.190500	It's uncomfortable and totally abnormal to be semi-ked in an exam room with someone you see once a year at best.   It's going to make anyone anxious.
0.714300	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office when I am awaiting any test results or physical examitions. I worry because I fear something may be wrong and I would need medical treatment.
0.357100	Since I have a mental health issue on top of physical health issues, am always anxious that they will not take me seriously when I complain of some heart related issue (although I have a heart history).  Unfortutely, a mental health issue is rather like having a giant red mark following you around and often professiols have a hard time looking beyond that for another explation for a problem,
0.714300	I am an anxious person anyway. Going to the Dr is a very persol matter, which makes me nervous. You do not know what to expect.
0.238100	Nothing in particular.  I'm pretty much comfortable there.  Nothing has ever happened that I would be terribly anxious.  I think a certain degree of anxiety is normal if you are sick and going to the doctor.  I think the anxiety is more related to the illness or symptoms than seeing the doctor.
0.285700	The bill. And if they can actually help
0.547600	I guess I worry first because it's full of sick people and the energy is negative. Anxiety about the future is also a general condition existent in all and a doctor's office is a good symbol for that. No one knows what the shadow knows.
0.428600	I am an anxious person in general.  So after having waited in the waiting room, and then waiting again in the exam room as I wait for the doctor to come in I am already getting anxious and worked up.  It's not because I fear what I might learn or what might happen, but I'm just nervous in general about meeting the doctor and the waiting and anticipation helps fuel my nervousness.  I am far more nervous about meeting and talking to the doctor than I am about what might happen or what I might learn during my visit with the doctor.
0.595200	Occasiolly, I may feel anxious at a doctor's office because I have a fear of needles. I always have to lie down when I need them to take a sample of my blood. I also become anxious because if I am unsure about a medicine or pill I haven't taken before, I am worried about the possible side effects.
0.452400	I always dread what the doctor will find out, like if I have some horrible illness. I also feel like he talks at me rather than to me. This worries me because I don't feel that I'm a part of my healing program. 
0.833300	I would be most worried about being told I had a terrible disease. I would be andious about being told I needed urgent surgery. I would be worried about being told I needed to take manh drugs for the rest of my life.
0.619000	I am not a people person.  Even though I like my doctor, any time I have one-on-one with people that I do not deal with socially, I am uncomfortable to some degree.  I recognize this, and know that my doctor is there to help, but I am still anxious.  The waiting does not help.
0.642900	The main reason is that I am almost always anxious, especially when around other people, that is something in fact that I would probably be visiting the doctor for.  Other reasons would be just worrying if something may be wrong.  Most of it is due to the fact that I have an anxiety problem and it doesn't really take anything to make me that way.
0.642900	I guess worried that the Doctor may find something wrong or more serious than I thought. The uncertainty of going to a doctors office brings about a tension and I know that elevates my blood pressure. Some times a problem might be embarrassing to talk about and that brings about a feeling of anxiety as well.
0.142900	I am only anxious if something might not be covered by my health insurance plan. My biggest worry is money.
0.619000	I dont like waiting. Then I worry that they might find something wrong with me.
0.142900	I don't usually feel worried or anxious when I go, I live a fairly healthy life and I feel healthy. On the rare occasions where I do feel anxious is when I hurt myself working out. I've sprained my ankle badly before and I felt anxiety cause I didn't know if I broke a bone or something more severe. So the anxiety stems from not knowing the severity of my injuries.
0.738100	Waiting for test results.
0.642900	I sometimes feel somewhat anxious or worried about my general health profile and whether or how much my health might be declining or how much I might be developing risk factors for future problems.
0.238100	Other people that are there that may be sick, and I end up catching what they have.
0.309500	Just that I would rather be somewhere else.  I am usually OK, but there is always that thought that they might find something.  But then again, that is a good thing because then we can treat it.
0.404800	When I am there because I know something is wrong, i dislike the suspense of waiting.
0.333300	Contracting something from other sick people, or feeling vulnerable just being in the office when I don't really want to be there.
0.428600	"That there might be something wrong with me that I just didn't ""feel""."
0.690500	I don't like being poked and prodded while wearing a paper gown.
0.285700	there's the inevitable 'you need to be taking a statin' but that doesn't bother me much.  I know its coming, I know she's doing it because thats what the establishment teaches her to do.  my understanding of the issue, based on recent research, tells me different and the establishment it just lagging.
0.761900	Even though my overall health is good, I always worry when I go to the doctor that she is going to find something wrong with me. This is not based on any real evidence or health concerns, but I still worry about it quite a bit.
0.166700	Just the uncertainty of which tests I have to undergo and what shots are going to be given to me.
0.142900	When I have a problem and I work myself up by googling signs and symptoms which usually tends to point me towards the worst case scerio.  When i go to the doctor to confirm my conditions, I get anxious waiting to hear what I really have going on.
0.571400	If I already have a bad feeling before going to a doctor then I will be worried that they might confirm my suspicions.
0.452400	I worry about nearly everything, but that is one thing that I oddly don't general worry about.  I would say the only thing I might be slightly anxious about would be to find out I have something I didn't realize (tumor, heart condition, cancer), but that seldom crosses my mind.
0.666700	With some health care providers in the past, I felt that they were too rushed and a little rough. During my first pregncy, I saw one doctor in the practice who gave me a quick, rough interl exam. Even my husband was cringing. When a doctor's bedside manner is impersol and they seem rushed for time, it usually makes me feel nervous, and I am much less likely to ask questions, lest I annoy the doctor.
0.285700	I am anxious just because I do not want to get a bunch of drugs to take that are bad for me.
0.619000	I just generally feel that I am worried to discover that something is wrong with me. If I am just there for a checkup, you never know what it is you are going to find out. Just the atmosphere of being around other suffering people makes me anxious.
0.142900	the results of whats wrong with me 
0.571400	I hate going at the doctor, maybe it's that sense of uncertainty that kills me.. I fear the physical pain but I can bear it well enough.
0.666700	I mostly feel anxious when I am at the doctor because I don't like needles or pain whatsoever. If I have to give blood or get an exam, I get so nervous because the pain makes me feel sick.
0.738100	Not having a proper conversation that may get to a root.
0.928600	I am afraid they will find something wrong with me!  I do not like them trying to talk me into testing that I do not want.  I used to fuss about my weight and my blood pressure.
0.666700	The uncertainty of what may be found during the visit
0.476200	I'm not worried as much about the examition as I am about finding that there is something wrong with me. I always worry that I will have a bad disease or contract something that could be bad, even fatal for me.
0.333300	I might be worried something might be found that might be bad but I try to be optimistic and pray.
0.904800	I just hate being out of my element and hate having people I don't know touch me
0.761900	Will I be helped or just shoved through the system?  We don't see doctors anymore unless we can pay their price to see them.  We see s now and while I'm sure they are very good I'd like to know why doctors are letting them take over when they went to school for.
0.666700	I am a bit uncomfortable being social in general outside of people I know very well, so I'm usually more worried I am going to make a fool of myself. I also worry that the doctor will be disappointed with the ways I have been handling myself, even though I've never been treated harshly for such a thing. Filly, there is always the small worry of finding out about a debilitating condition that might change my life.
0.857100	Getting some sty infectious disease or being given news about some complication with regards to my health. I really don't trust doctors or visiting them for any reason. I try to stay relatively healthy to avoid having to go to one.
0.809500	Having found the possibility of a life threatening diagnosis.  If not then a chronic disease.
0.714300	It's just the uncertainty. I don't know what they're going to do or say and I don't necessarily trust that they'll make the right decision. As such I just feel a general nervousness and uncertainty when going in.
0.666700	I get anxious just being there. I am a person with high anxiety, so just being in the doctors office causes me as great deal of anxiety. I also get anxious that something will be wrong with me.
0.285700	When I go to the doctor's office for something serious - that isn't just a regular checkup - I'm more worried about what's wrong with me than what the doctor's gon do to me. I know my doctors aren't going to do anything weird, or try to make me take any weird medicine that doesn't actually work so that I'll just keep coming back to them. I feel like I can actually trust my doctors, even though I understand that not everyone feels that way with their own doctors.
0.547600	I don't like attention being on me. I always feel anxious when being seen for myself (and not my kids) and being examined. I would prefer to just skip over all of it!
0.690500	I am overweight and I know that the doctor will say something about that - and that may be what is causing some issues.  I just don't want to hear that I have something really wrong with me.  Most of that is just in my head, but I still get worried that it may be true.
0.142900	Getting weighed 
0.261900	That the examition/treatment might be painful (such as the time when I had an ingrown toeil remedied).
0.690500	I feel most anxious or worried when it comes to what the doctor might tell me is wrong with me. When I am waiting to see the doctor, my mind starts to race with negative thoughts. While I understand the doctor is there to help, I would usually not be seeing the doctor at all if there was nothing wrong with me.
0.238100	I don't feel anxious about the visit. I have lived a healthy lifestyle. I don't expect bad news.
0.785700	how to describe what's going on with me so that I can get real help, not just lip service.  
0.690500	I am most anxious that the doctor will find something seriously wrong.  I worry that someday he will discover that I have a serious health condition.  As I get older these concerns are slowly increasing.
0.738100	Because I'am getting older not any younger.
0.619000	The only thing that makes me nervous is the thought of my doctor actually finding something that could potentially kill me.  I get extremely nervous sometimes, but so far it's always be fine.
0.547600	I get scared that they're going to tell me something is really wrong, even though I have no reason to think that.
0.285700	The long wait
0.261900	Hearing news that is not good.
0.809500	I have medical PTSD from a very bad experience with an ambulance and hospital. Anything medical worries me. The nurse, in particular, is rude and has no business being in health care. She has mocked my mental health and has gotten away with it. I am afraid of actually telling them how I feel because of this. 
0.833300	I expect bad news. Usually i go to doctors when something is wrong so im on edge anyway.
0.642900	I only have two doctors. I don't like going to my primary care doctor because I don't feel any connection with him. I only go when I really have to, and I feel like I'm judged there, both by my doctor somewhat, and by his assistants. I don't get anxious or worried when I visit my other doctor. 
0.547600	With many problems due to a gastric bypass and anemia, I get worried when I have stomach issues or symptoms related to anemia so when I go to Dr. I think the worst in those cases.
0.809500	Getting wrong advice because I don't fully understand medical language.
0.452400	I would be worried that something may be bad as I get older.  I typically have good health, but always think the next visit could show a bad diagnosis, worse health, etc...something that could impact my family as well as myself.
0.738100	Bad news. That is all that needs to be said. There may be things that are wrong with you and you may find out on that visit. You could have cancer, you could have lupus- there are thousands of potential scerios that will start to unfold after that visit and its only human to be scared of those potential outcomes.
0.333300	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor when I have something I need to get checked out and I'm not sure what will be found or the diagnosis will be.
0.547600	I am always a little worried that something is wrong with me, and I didn't know it. I also get worried that the doctor will be judgmental of my life, like if I gained some weight or had drinks over the weekend. 
0.809500	First off I have social anxiety and general anxiety. So everything makes me anxious.  Second off having a strange person poke and prod at me bothers me to a high degree.  Then there is the worry about whether something is wrong physically with me.  
0.833300	I know that they are there to make money.  I don't want to be another product along the factory line.
0.976200	I had GAD, so even small issues cause my anxiety to kick into overdrive.
0.523800	I feel most anxious when I know that I will have to undergo some kind of testing. Sometimes I worry about receiving negative results, or the doctor finding something unexpected. I worry that I might have an illness that could possibly be debilitating or even life-threatening.
0.666700	Fear of receiving bad news, fear of a painful procedure, fear of expensive medical bill
0.833300	I feel nervous that they might find something seriously wrong with me. I like to avoid the doctor sometimes for that reason.
0.142900	I worry about the cost of the care I am receiving.
0.428600	If the doctor will find anything that is seriously wrong with me out of nowhere.
0.785700	I am worried something is wrong with me, or what other tests and labs or procedures might be recommended. I also worry about money. Sometimes I worry that I am not explaining my issues correctly, or that my doctor is not considering all angles of my care, even though I know he tries. 
0.428600	I am usually most concerned that the doctors will find some health issue that I was not aware of or that I am not taking care of myself well enough. 
0.142900	I feel worried that I there should not be any major or serious issue with my health and I can should get complete relief after visiting the physician.
0.428600	The feeling of the unknown is probably what makes me the most anxious.  I try not to think too hard about it, but there is always a possibility of getting bad news when anyone is visiting the doctor.  
0.190500	It's the unknown, the uncertainty of it.  If I am there, it's because I was uble to figure it out on my own, or uble to gain access to what I need to treat myself.  Again, a Dr should be viewed as a partner in helping you achieve good health.
0.833300	I just don't usually trust people in general that easily. I also hate that I feel like there job is to judge my everything I do. I feel like many doctors don't follow their own advice which makes them hypocritical. 
0.642900	I get most anxious about being diagnosed with something else, haha. The doctor doesn't make me nervous, just the whole idea of potentially having another thing wrong with me.
0.928600	Just the uncertainty of it all. Not knowing if what's wrong with me is serious or mind running away with it all. Thankfully almost every time I thought there was something serious wrong with me it turned out to be nothing. But I have bad anxiety and a panic disorder so it's the worry and not knowing that makes it hard for me to deal with. Once I leave there though I usually feel fine and relieved.
0.761900	The thing that makes me the most worried when visiting the doctor is the unknown.  That I will find out some dreaded news that I did not know before. 
0.142900	Just making sure I am doing what is right for my body, keeping my blood pressure in check and following my heart meds as expected.  I sometimes worry that my benign condition will suddenly become something to worry about.
0.500000	Generally, I'm not worried, unless I'm in pain from a specific problem.  Then, of course, I'm concerned about finding a solution for the pain.
0.238100	I suppose there is a degree of the unknown. They is always the possibility of them finding something unexpected. Overall, I'm comforted to see a doctor and know they are looking after me.
0.857100	I am anxious about all of the things they check regularly because these things are likely to have some result or they would not check for them in the first place. 
0.142900	Getting to my appointment on time.
0.142900	I don't have any anxious feelings. I've know this doctor for many years and he is a nice person as well as a good doctor.
0.261900	When i feel something is wrong with my body and I'm hoping it is nothing too bad. 
0.285700	I am worried that my blood pressure will be high or my weight will be high because i haven't done what she told me to do and I haven't been following the diet that I agreed to follow. I am also worried about finding something else wrong with me. 
0.761900	I'm anxious because I don't know what is wrong with me and I don't have any confidence in finding a solution. Mostly, I just go to get relief from whatever is ailing me but I don't expect to be healed.
0.595200	If I go to the doctor's office, it's because I already know that something is wrong.  I'm in tune with my body and only go to the doctor's when absolutely necessary.  So, I get anxious if I can't tell what's wrong with me and worried about the diagnosis; some people in my family died fairly young.
0.761900	It's always a little awkward to have a physical.  I worry that my breath smells.
0.452400	Just the uncertainty of the experience. Not knowing if the doctor is going to discover that something is wrong.
0.690500	My doctor seems reluctant to prescribe me certain medications, and it makes me think that he views me as someone who is drug seeking.
0.714300	I am always most anxious about my weight.  I continually try to lose weight, but am much heavier than I would like to be.
0.285700	The sterility.
0.285700	I don't want to hear any bad news, so it is a little worrisome to have an examition by a doctor. However, if it is a problem which is rather simple like a cold or the flu, then I'm not too worried about those situations.
0.571400	That the doctor is going to find or determine that I have an issue or condition I was uware of or not expecting.
0.595200	"The underlying thought ""what if they find something""! It's a universal fear and it is what puts off most people. The worry starts when the nurse and doctor start with the small talk and only abates when it's over and they say you are fine."
0.928600	I have a lifelong phoboa of doctors/hospitals, etc. Big time. Comes from a near death when I was three. Ratiolly/intellectually I know it is safe and good and helpful, but my body and mind go FEAR to the enth power. I even sweat walking by an ambulance. Have tried everything and can't undo it. 
0.500000	I am usually not very anxious about going and seeing a doctor.  Seeing a new doctor for the first time always makes me anxious or if I'm worried about my current symptoms and her diagnosis but generally, I'm not anxious about seeing my current doctor when I need to.
0.666700	The one thing that makes me anxious is not knowing if there may be some things or issues I might have that I am not aware of. 
0.571400	What makes me anxious or worried is the uncertainty of not knowing what might be causing me to feel unwell. Whether is it something serious or minor.
0.547600	I am most anxious or worried about them finding something I did not expect that will negatively impact my health. I am also worried that they will tell me I have been doing something wrong or that I am putting on too much weight.
0.619000	The most anxious part is the waiting, whether it is in the waiting room or inside one of the examition rooms. It is the time where I think about what's going to happen, what the doctor might say, and the necessary questions I need to ask. Since I don't know all of this ahead of time, I'm trying to think of questions for any scerio, which is stressful. 
0.833300	May receive news/diagnosis that you do not want to hear
0.357100	What makes me most anxious when visiting the doctor is myself. Aside from strep throat, which I get fairly often, I usually have a worse case scerio that turns out not to be so bad afterward. 
0.666700	I just get myself worked up for no good reason. I hate going there, even though I have never had a horrible experience. I guess I don't like other people poking, prodding, and seeing me ked. I am the same way about going to the dentist or giving blood.
0.666700	I wonder whether I am going to have wait a long time. I also wonder whether something is going to be wrong with me. 
0.833300	I always feel like I may be getting judged and also wondering about the outcome. 
0.547600	I hate feeling like I might have some lingering undetectable disease that's going to kill me at any time and suddenly finding out about it and realizing I only have a few months to live.
0.571400	If they will find anything wrong 
0.785700	It's just a weird experience altogether. Having a stranger poke and prod me is not something that makes me feel comfortable. They ask a lot of questions and the little gowns are way too small and don't make me feel any less ked.
0.738100	What makes me most anxious is finding out that I have some horrible sort of disease or illness. I also tend to feel worried that I'll be taken advantage of.
0.785700	Nothing in particular about visiting the doctor, except for the last one I visited. (I tend to be a bit high strung or anxious, anyway; I have chronic clinical depression.)
0.690500	I worry that there will be something seriously wrong even if I am just going in for a cold.  Many times I think about what could be the worst possible scerio as far as sickness could go.  Or I am afraid that the doctor won't be able to figure out what the problem is and I will have to continue to be in pain.
0.571400	I always get uneasy when a doctor is feeling around my body. I'm always waiting for a bad response, like a lump or something that shouldn't be there.
0.833300	Just the nervousness of being there. I don't like visiting and you always worry a bit that something may really be wrong. 
0.833300	What makes me feel most anxious is that the doctor will start telling me that some of my symptoms are all in my head or that the doctor will decide that he wants to try some new treatment.  I am very drug sensitive and don't do well when I have to take a new drug.  I have had way too many bad reactions to medications, so now I have anxiety over any new medication I try.
0.881000	I have a really bad anxiety disorder that makes it hard to cope with that situation. Also, if a new nurse is involved who doesn't know me well, it is hard to cope with. 
0.928600	"I worry that I'm going to find out the treatment for whatever is wrong with me is going to be uvailable to me due to cost. Also I hate the general ""invasion of privacy"" feeling that it causes, particularly if I happen not to be alone when I am visiting the doctor."
0.738100	basically i feel uneasy because it's a sense of what is gon be wrong this time? i also in the back of my mind wonder if i will be mis diagnosed based on previous bad experience of filly getting wrist surgery 8 months too late
0.285700	I only feel anxious or worried if I suspect something's wrong with me. Otherwise I'm always pretty relaxed in the doctor's office, and pretty comfortable with the nurses and staff in general.
0.381000	I get anxious about being weighed, about what my blood pressure will be and about getting ked.
0.666700	Doctors finding tumors.
0.214300	Because at home my blood pressure is good but as soon as the doctor comes in to take it, it goes up
0.142900	the only thing i worry about is when i have to get a shot. i hate needles.
0.690500	finding out something bad
0.238100	Anything that requires a time-delay worries me: bloodwork, urine alysis, etc. The lab can take a while and my mind always wanders to the worst that could happen. 
1.000000	I feel the most anxious or worried about finding out there may be something seriously medically wrong with me. I usually don't feel super worried if I go in for sinus infection symptoms, or something routine. Last time I went, it was for a breast lump, and I was terrified. 
0.500000	What kind of news I might get. I worry about what they'll say about my unhealthy lifestyle. The might say something about seeing other doctors.
0.642900	Always worried that something I can't fix will go wrong. I'm like that with everything not just medical problems. Bring my car to the mechanic and wait anxiously until I get the diagnosis. Same is true of my health. I'm sick I go in to find out what's wrong but going to be anxious until i get the all clear.
0.833300	Are they going to see my scars and ask me about them? What if they call the police on me and have me committed against my will?
0.381000	It makes me feel most anxious or worried when the doctor wants to do numerous tests without explaining why those tests are necessary.
0.333300	I am mostly worried about long waits. I am sometimes worried about a possible diagnosis.I am sometime worried bout the doctor's mood.
0.547600	I have more of an untural fear of doctors and dentists. This is most likely due to the fact that I so seldom need to see a doctor. If I had been unhealthy and seen a lot of doctors, I suspect I would be way more comfortable with the process. But I assume it's much better to be healthy and see a doctor seldom and to be sick and see a doctor so often as to not be uncomfortable.  :)
0.833300	I worry that a simple problem is actually the beginning stages of something serious. I also worry that the doctor may miss something that leads to prescribing the wrong medication.
0.666700	Finding a difficult to cure physical problem
0.571400	Just being there meaning something is wrong just puts me in an anxious mood.
0.761900	Sometimes, I'm worried that the exam will show something bad...a disease or condition that will require expensive/extensive treatment. Actually, the first thing that stresses me is the weight check.
0.500000	if it is a follow up for something unknown
0.809500	I just hate going there I've always been that way. It's kind of hard to explain. The doctor isn't a big deal but the nurses and assistants are different all the time and do different things like look at different things I don't think really matters. Then there expressions change and they say nothing so this makes me anxious. So pretty much the whole thing I hate, I'm just always happy to get out of there.
0.523800	That something severe is wrong with me
0.571400	Will I remember to tell them all the necessary information.
0.357100	That he's going to tell me something bad. I worry I'll have some medical condition that requires extensive treatment.
0.857100	I'm worried that the doctor will find something that is detrimental to my health. I also don't like people touching me. I'm nervous to find out my weight.
0.333300	Sometimes just the unknown. It takes awhile in the doctor's office to wait. Also, what if on the off  chance there is bad news healthwise? Those are things that comes to mind.
0.214300	I only get anxious/worried if I think I could have a serious health problem - and the doctor is giving me feedback on it. It is typically something I am familiar with so I am not that worried.
0.547600	I am always most anxious to see if my Doctor is in a bad mood or not. I see my doctor every 4 weeks and we have a tough relationship. I am kind and calm but I am not afraid to advocate for myself. I also become anxious when I am sick and would like to know the my outcome of illness.
0.619000	I just don't like going. It smacks of weakness and it invades my privacy. It's also time consuming and expensive.
0.261900	Recently I worry more about if the doctor will accept my health insurance, than if there is something wrong with me. Also, I'm worrying how much of the bill is my responsibility and how much insurance's.
0.619000	I guess there's always the back-of-the-mind fear that the doctor will find something wrong. That's not usually a huge concern for me, though, because I've always been quite healthy aside from my weight, which I'm working on. Mostly I'm just anxious because there's nearly always SOMETHING uncomfortable in a doctor's visit. Taking off more clothes than I'd like to, or painful examitions (and I have a VERY low pain threshold - I consider those blood pressure cuffs painful), or being told yet again that I'm overweight as if I couldn't see that for myself.
0.357100	Just the waiting process makes me nervous because I just want to get it over with. Usually, doctors visits have been pleasant but I just want to get them over with so I can continue my day. If I sit in the office waiting for a long time, I start getting stressed over the potential wait in regards to whatever I have planned after, and it just makes me nervous overall waiting.
0.714300	Not knowing what will happen
0.690500	I am sometimes worried about what diagnosis the doctor may give when I have a serious health concern. I also get worried that the doctor may dismiss my concerns or that I won't be taken seriously.
0.690500	If I have something wrong with me that is concerning me that I want looked at, yes I feel anxious. If I am just going for a yearly wellness visit, I am at ease.
0.500000	Not sure what they're going to say, if something is wrong with me.
0.666700	"I am always worried I am going to get a ""death sentence"".  I also worried that the procedure will hurt.  I also worry that the doctor will tell me something that I should be doing, because what I am doing is not good enough."
0.476200	When I have a gynecological or sensitive problem that I feel embarrassed about. I'm getting to be less worried about that but especially when I was young that was a main area of discomfort.
0.333300	It's extremely silly, but ever since I had to learn to perform blood pressure readings in a high school atomy and physiology class I find the idea of the brachial artery being shut off extremely creepy, which stresses me out and raises my (actually a bit too low, when it can be accurately measured) blood pressure. I then get anxious about the fact that the reading will be incorrect, which makes me worry more and drives the reading sky-high. It's an annoying and very nerve-wracking cycle that happens almost every time I go to a doctor's office.
0.738100	If I visit a doctor's office, I'm worried about several things. I worry that something is wrong with me and it's going to be worse than I imagined. I also worry that I will be misdiagnosed, and I also worry about what the doctor or his nurses think of me, particularly if I have to disrobe during the examition.
0.619000	im scared what they are going to tell me about my condition and the  office just makes me uneasy, it is not like im going there for a good reason.
0.238100	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because I can never be completely sure what diagnosis I am going to get. It would be silly to say I wasn't worried or anxious that I could get some negative news regarding my health.
0.738100	Mostly just the fact the person is usually someone I haven't met before because I do not have a stable family doctor, and also the cost. 
0.214300	I will be worried if they will told me to undergo medication because I will need money in order to that.  I hate expenses.
0.261900	Just the idea that even though everything feels and looks good, there's the possibility that something is wrong. The unknown is what makes me the most worried.
0.857100	I'm anxious about the doctor discovering something that's going to dramatically change my life. There's always the possibility that something dire might turn up.
0.190500	I don't worry much when visiting the doctor.
0.500000	Just that I may have to switch medications or that something new will be discovered. That she will not be able to find or fix what is wrong. That she won't give me a recommendation if she feels it is not needed. 
0.619000	I tend to expect the worst so I often feel anxious about what the actual diagnosis will be. 
0.428600	I dont like needels  
0.738100	I am worried about them finding something big wrong with me.  Something that would change my life drastically or something that cannot be fixed.
0.142900	I'm more worried about the cost than anything else. I'm very healthy, but I'm afraid of the high cost of falling ill and having any medical issue. That's what concerns me the most 
0.285700	The anxious part is just the exams in general. I don't have great health insurance so if they find anything wrong I couldn't be able to afford it.
0.285700	In good general health. Not expecting any surprises. Mostly go for routine annual checkups.
0.428600	What the diagnosis will be. If there is anything wrong with me. 
0.595200	I usually do not have anything serious wrong with me so that is not a worry. However, I am always just a little bit afraid that they will find something new is wrong with me that I didn't even know about. I know this is not likely but it is still a fear of mine. 
0.357100	The possibility that I may be examined health problems.
0.333300	Anixous that there will be something wrong.
0.333300	What worries me is the possibility of the doctor finding something seriously wrong, like cancer. Other than that I don't really worry about doctor appointments.
0.666700	They will get me hooked on some medication that makes me worse and dependent on office visits. 
0.333300	If they were to tell me that I have a loss or restriction of mobility.
0.547600	I get worried if they can't figure out what is wrong relatively quickly. I would start to think it is something serious and potentially lose sleep over it. Luckily, I've only had that happen a few times, and in the end the problem was resolved.
0.404800	I am most worried about whether or not the diagnosis will be something minor or major.
0.381000	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is that something could possibly be wrong. Even if I go for a normal checkup and I do not have any signs of anything being wrong with me, just going to the doctor makes me slightly anxious because I know that if there is any bad results this is the place it will come from. 
0.452400	I feel worried if I think I will get a bad result or hear something I don't want to. I also get nervous around needles. 
0.452400	If I'm sick but I don't know what I have, I might be a little anxious to hear what the diagnosis is.
0.142900	i dont. i am healthy and i have a healthy lifestyle
0.928600	I am afraid that the doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. I am also afraid that the doctor will make a mistake or mis-prescribe me a wrong medication. I also feel that the doctors do not really listen when I tell them something. 
0.571400	I feel anxious when I require blood draws and I also get anxious sitting in the waiting room. I get worried that there could be something wrong when things progress so slowly during the appointments. 
0.142900	There is nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. The doctor has always been patient with me, and very understanding. There's nothing that makes me feel out of place, and the doctor always explain what will happen ahead of time and the reason why.
0.381000	Just hearing her 'official' word on lab results, I'd say. I've normally already looked at the numbers thanks to an online portal where they post results, but I don't necessarily know what they mean and I don't generally feel like doing research (e.g. to see if a small change in my triglycerides is significant) when I know I'll see her within a week (lab work always a week before I see her, results usually online a few days prior to appointment with her). It's ever so slight. 
0.357100	I can't put a finger on it, but possibly hearing that I am doing poorly in some aspect of my health.  I try to be a healthy person, but it would be hard to hear that something is seriously wrong, and I guess that's where I become anxious.
0.142900	I don't get anxious at the doctor's office. If I have something wrong with me and they run tests then I might worry about the results, but otherwise I'm pretty calm.
0.595200	I feel nervousness in general, like maybe the doctor will find something that wasn't there before. I am worried they will lecture me about smoking cigarettes. And I am just anxious in general when I go out in public.
0.523800	The possibility that they could find something wrong with me.
0.142900	Waiting around sick people, more often than most.
0.595200	I used to feel worried when discussing the symptoms and progression of sickness. Now I don't care to the same degree unless I am presented with a new symptom. 
0.142900	nothing -I do get upset and tend to walk out if he she has not seen me within 30 minutes of my appointment
1.000000	I HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS.
0.381000	I WAS FEELING WORRIED ABOUT FINDING OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME OR IF MY CONDITION WAS IMPROVING. I GUESS I AM ALWAYS ANXIOUS ABOUT GETTING ON MORE MEDICATION THAN I WANT TO.
1.000000	Just that I don't go very often at all, and I'm not young. Sooner or later, they are going to find something wrong. I also don't like getting undressed for anyone. I have major self esteem issues, and as I said, I am a very nervous person. 
0.285700	I hate needles and whenever going to the doctor, that is my first thought that makes me anxious, are they going to want to give me a shot. Since I do not take pills, sometimes a shot is needed and I hate those. But, I can take them without much pain, it's just the idea- maybe some fear left over from childhood- I don't know. But, that is mainly what makes me anxious. The other thing is doctors always have to rub or push wherever it hurts and that bothers me.
0.571400	Not knowing what is wrong with me and I get worried about if anything has gotten worse
0.547600	I always feel anxious and worried about what may be the outcome of whatever is going on.
0.142900	I really don't feel anxious or worried at all going to the doctor. I feel relieved that I am going to get better with her help. I guess a worry would always be finding out news that you may die soon, but I'm young so I really don't think about that.
0.619000	I worry that the doctor will just brush off my concerns. I also worry because I have a history of cancer in my family.
0.309500	I usually have alot of visits to the doctor because of a few health issues i have. And always when i get examined i am anxious even thou i know i am okay i would always be anxious cause you never know how your body is going to change wether in a good way or bad.
0.976200	The fact that they make assumptions and don't listen to me. I've witnessed them giving incorrect information to other people and I'm always annoyed that they will do the same to me. So just based off of previous encounters, I dread that. 
0.500000	Even though I'm very healthy overall and generally feel pretty good, there's always that gging idea in the background that they may discover something seriously wrong that isn't currently presenting any symptoms. It's also just an anxious situation in general when another person you don't know well - or know at all - is examining your body and mind and peering into some persol and private things, even if you trust them to be objective and professiol about it.
0.333300	I tend to be anxious in general. I worry the doctor won't understand my concern, won't be able to help me or will choose not to.
0.500000	It is a woman and though I am not ashamed to undress for her,it still leels a little bit uneasy.I would feel worried,when I have to see her,when I have sudden complaints,that don't go away.
0.214300	Obviousley, him finding out I'm sick. Him finding out something on me is broken. Or even him telling me I'm uble to reproduce. 
0.571400	My doctor often tells me to quite smoking, but have not quite yet. I get worried that he is going to get mad at me for still smoking.
0.261900	Not knowing whether or not my condition is improving.  Sometimes, it's hard to tell without lab work, as I feel fine most of the time.  
0.285700	Not really much does.   I am a level headed person.  The only thing that would make me anxious is if I felt something was wrong, not with the care I actually receive.
0.881000	I am worried that they will find something serious. Although I'd rather know than not know.
0.238100	Only if its about something new that could be something very bad, or just awaiting answers on previous tests. Otherwise im always fine.
0.523800	 Not knowing what the outcome will be. Wondering if they will be able to figure out what's wrong, and give me the proper treatment. 
0.928600	I am always concerned that they will find something that will require further testing. In my past experience, further tests can be expensive and painful, and for me have always turned out fine. But even still, it is scary to decide to ignore the doctor's advice and not do further tests. 
0.238100	I have always been anxious when I go in for a physical , hoping the results be favorable
0.785700	worried about getting illnesses
0.357100	Having someone poke me and hover around me. I like my space.
0.547600	I'm very overweight, and I worry about disappointing my doctor because I haven't lost any.
0.142900	Poor communication makes me wonder about the doctor.
0.309500	I am always a little hesitant when I go to the doctor because I very rarely go (other than annual exams). If I am there then it is for a valid reason. Perhaps that why I am usually a little hesitant and worried. I am worried about what they will tell me. I always have my children on my mind and worry about not being well enough to care for them. 
0.642900	I have a tendency to avoid going to the doctor unless it's necessary (even though I know it's not smart), so when I do go, it's usually because something is wrong. I worry that it's going to be something more serious than what I expect, or that something else wrong will be found. It's not really the exam itself that bothers me, but the potential for serious health problems.
0.809500	Now we cannot see the Dr.'s we trust. We have to see Dr.'s that are assigned to us. Usually, I am rushed through or disrespected. I don't go for this reason. I'll just die in my home. 
0.952400	I have social anxiety. Going to see a doctor is like being asked to perform on broadway completely ked without ever having been given a script. You don't know what to expect. You feel like the doctor might be secretly judging you, and when it's all done you might find out that you are gon be dead in a month.
0.452400	I think I'm always just worried about what they are going to find out next. After all is said and done I feel all the anxiety is gone.
0.571400	I feel anxious because I know she is always going to find something wrong. If it isn't my thyroid it is something else. I am worried because she always wants to put me on that blood pressure medicine with a diuretic, which made me sick and pass out constantly last time. My doctor is a real piece of work. She doesn't think of the tural approach to things.
0.904800	I know that my specific concerns will likely not be addressed
0.238100	I REALLY DO NOT FEEL VERY ANXIOUS GOING TO THE DOCTOR UNLESS I GO THERE WITH SOME COMPLAINT. IN THAT CASE, I HAVE A SLIGHT WORRY THAT THE CONDITION MAY BE MORE SERIOUS, PERSISTENT, OR REQUIRE MORE ATTENTION THAN I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH. ALMOST ALL MY VISITS ARE FOR ROUTINE CHECK-UPS, AND I FEEL NO ANXIETY ABOUT THEM.
0.357100	Sometimes, I felt uncertain about my disease condition and related treatments when visiting the doctor's office. I was not sure if I should take a new medicine for my disease. 
0.642900	Now that I am getting older, I worry they may find something that could be serious.
0.333300	My cholesterol levels and my sugar levels. I have high cholesterol though my LDL is good so not concerning. My sugar levels have spiked the last few years and several times I have been warned of pre-diabeties.
0.738100	Generally I am worried about the possibility of needing to get my blood drawn, as I have a severe phobia of injections.
0.809500	For me, it is the complete feeling of powerlessness. When I go to my doctor, I am both afraid of bad news, and no news. Bad news that will change my life, and also receiving no news at all, requiring me to repeat this same excruciating process in the near future. Good news is always the hope, but when I visit the Dr. I tend to look at things more pessimistically than I do in other aspects of my life.
0.476200	I'm anxious about what he might say I have and it's untreatable and that worries me a lot.
0.142900	When a treatment is not working and we have to explore altertives
0.690500	Shame, afraid that I will be judged for not taking better care of myself. Anxious based on past experience when the doctors wouldn't listen to me and couldn't figure out what was wrong.
0.690500	I worry about all the things that could be wrong with me that I didn't notice, but the doctor might find out. These might be expensive to fix, or embarassing, or something that I was foolish not to notice on my own. I might not be in as good of health as I had thought.
0.404800	I don't worry so much about getting a predictable diagnosis or treatment for a physical condition I have already noticed and/or need to have taken care of. What I worry about is whether the doctor will tell me it's worse than I thought or find something else wrong with me.
0.714300	Fincial requirements are number one. I have insurance but can not afford very much out of pocket expense. As far as whether the treatment is correct, I seldom worry about that cause I can just skip the recommended treatment when I get home. So I have to make sure whatever is done is covered by insurance or I probably will not do it.
0.666700	  If someone there or around is ging to get me sick.  If someone will give me the wrong diagnosis.  If someone will give me the wrong medication.
0.309500	That the doctor might find something wrong with my health.
0.500000	I worry that the doctor may find something serious wrong with me, and I worry that he may prescribe tests or medications that will cost more money than I can afford to spend. I'm fairly healthy, so mostly I worry about the costs.
0.428600	because of my past history, my body is not how a normal healthy person my  age is. It seems like everytime I go to the drs. it seems like something else pops up
0.142900	Don't really feel worried. Just depends if its something major would make me feel worried. 
0.523800	I have had breast cancer and am now always ready for the shoe to drop when I am in to see her.
0.142900	The language barrier.
0.381000	I am afraid that my blood pressure is going to be high and then this will be the visit I'm stuck on blood pressure meds.
0.142900	The times that I have felt anxious has been when I didn't know what was wrong.  I had knee pain a few years ago after injuring it playing basketball.  I was nervous or anxious that I would find out after examining it that I would need major surgery.  It turned out to not be a big deal and I just needed to rest and rehab it, but it was a very anxiety inducing day for me. 
0.619000	I get worried about cost of visit and needed things after. I also get anxious thinking they will have nothing but bad news for me.
0.738100	What makes me feel most anxious or worried is going in there paying my co-pay and them not listen to me.  I do not go to the doctors if there really is not a problem.  I do not like going to the doctors.  So I get worried every time I go there because it is more than likely them not listening to my problems again.
0.142900	I might have to waste some time in the waiting room.  I prefer to spend my time as I choose to spend it.
0.571400	The unknown. Possibility that they will find something wrong with me that requires medical attention. 
0.452400	I feel these feelings sometimes because i do not always know what to expect from my doctor. I also dont know what they may find wrong with me if anything. It is always a nerve wrecking experience.
0.214300	I have a general anxiety disorder so sometimes even the most common events can make me feel anxious. It really has nothing to do with the appointment. it just happens.
0.738100	What makes me most anxious is finding out the worst possible news in regards to the medical conditions I have had. I feel this way because I am a worse case scerio kind of person.  So I already have thoughts of what they might tell me.
0.500000	I hate going to pay a copay and then not get what I feel is the best option for me. It stresses me out to go and also I don't drive so getting there its not an easy task in general. So its just getting there and still having unresolved concern.
0.476200	Just sitting there, waiting for her to come in, thinking about how to tell her what has been going on with me (why I'm there to see her), about what she will find/diagnose.
0.476200	"Always experiencing the worst case scerio when identifying illness. For instance, ""my leg pain is getting bad"" with the doctor response of ""well, I guess we should saw it completely off""."
0.785700	The exam itself especially from a gynecologist. I hate being nude even with a Dr I really like and trust. I feel exposed.
0.857100	The whole think.  The waiting, the gowns, the sterile environment.  It makes me very anxious.
0.785700	I am worried that my doctor will do a seemingly common test that will indicate i have a life-threatening medical condition that i was completely oblivious to.
0.261900	If I have a real issue that is not just pedantic-like complaining---that it will not be thoroughly dealt with due to insufficient time alone. That would be some mega bullshit. It's why Im trying to learn a lot as to how I can effectively help myself through altertive medicine options such as aryuvedic. 
0.285700	How seevere is my condition.Some doctors like to practice fear mongering.
0.238100	Visiting a new doctor can be a bit stressful because I don't know if he/she will listen to me or be accepting of me. Beyond that, there is always a bit of anxiety that something might be wrong with my health.
0.214300	"I think there is a general anxiety when visiting a doctor or dentist's office. I feel more anxious when I am in the office because of a serious problem I am having. The anxiety is not caused by the doctor but rather by the possibility my ""ailment"" might turn out to be serious."
0.428600	just the wait always makes me anxious. 
0.595200	What makes me feel worried is the thought of a bad health report. As I get older and my body starts to slow down, I feel I'm more prone to bad health. What if I suddenly have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, or my urine shows signs of XYZ, etc, If a doctor comes back with news like that, it's sure to have me worried at least a little.
0.857100	"I feel the most anxious about the unknown.  Even totally healthy people can have bad things happen and I have not been living the healthiest lifestyle.  I worry that there will be something wrong with me that cannot be ""fixed."""
0.142900	I do not feel worried about a visit.
0.452400	I get anxious about my lab results for my condition and also about my weight. 
0.452400	Since I have had numerous medical issues, I do have some anxiety or worry that something may be amiss when i discuss current symptoms or have to get certain blood work done.  I usually, however, keep things under control!
0.785700	I would feel out-of-control.  I would feel depersolized and treated as a body.  I would feel vulnerable.
0.714300	I've had exams by very rude and impatient ER doctors before that made me feel less than human. 
0.452400	THat something will be wrong with me.
0.761900	I'm always worried that what they think is wrong with me is incorrect. I think that it is something worse than what it is.
0.738100	That the doctor may find something wrong. That I may not be taken seriously. General anxiety and panic due to mental health issues.
0.238100	I am not sure why I might feel anxious or worried.  
0.857100	Going to the doctor's office makes me feel like I'm going to take a test I haven't studied for. I'm fearful of potential health defects but also of just being judged in general. I am aware on a logical level that this is silly but the feelings persist anyways.
0.809500	The possibility of health issues is always a concern. However, I am quite an anxious individual, so just the base process of attending this appointment fills me with an uneasiness and a sense of dread. I feel a lack of confidence and a sense of embarrassment, even seemingly without just cause.
0.738100	I hate having to slightly disrobe for something that is no fun at all! If the doctor looked like Brad Pitt, then I would be happy to go. 
0.761900	That they will discover I have some horrible illness or that I will need some awful treatment. I also just dislike the environment (cold, reeking of disinfectant).
0.523800	Asking everything I want to.  Not forgetting something.  Trying not to be too much of an annoyance.
0.333300	I feel a bit anxious when I visit the doctor simply because I'm in a position where I may learn some worrisome things about my health. The potential is always there for negative news when you're visiting the doctor, so a bit of anxiousness seems inevitable. 
0.547600	Being in that paper gown makes me uncomfortable. You aren't always at your best when you need to visit the doctor. I may have a serious problem or feel very sick.
0.404800	Its the whole scene of making the trip their, sitting in the waiting room, surrounded by strangers and their aliments with my my thoughts that drift off to cooler place I wish to be. 
0.238100	its usally a long wait when I go to the doctors the waiting makes me anxious and when I have to wait to get results makes me feel worried some times.
0.881000	I feel most nervous that they are going to tell me about something that will kill me that I was uware of. 
0.142900	This depends highly on the current health situation. If I had a serious health issue, I'm sure I would feel some anxiety about the diagnosis and treatment. Maybe more so about the costs than anything else. 
0.452400	I feel like they might found something bad. I also think that I may have a bad condition.
0.666700	What makes me most worried when visiting the doctor is learning that I have an illness or other negative condition that was preventable. Next is learning about an illness or condition that is neither treatable nor preventable.
0.571400	I don't know what the outcome is going to be.  Is this going to be a serious issue?  Will it be expensive?  Perhaps, I'm also somewhat anxious about whether or not they will be able to tell me what is wrong at all.
0.404800	I always worry that they will look at my former diagnosis and decide or judge me verses taking a look at whats bothering me at the time. for instance, I was self medicating with alcohol, i came in drunk several times, so when i get asked several times if im still drinking in the same visit, its irritating. Are you sure you havent drank this week? its patronizing. 
0.928600	I never know what to expect.  It's good that i go but it's extremely stressful knowing they could find something drastically wrong.  There is nothing I like about it.
0.142900	Nothing beyond whatever I'm there for.
0.166700	That I will be embarrassed, and also I worry about the result they will give me.
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, is the possibility that he finds something abnormal during the check up.
0.452400	I worry if the doctor may be right in the diagnosis and I worry that the doctor would prescribe a medication that would eventually harm me in the long term. I feel that the doctor only concern about making her quota for the day and would not give me the full attention i require.
0.666700	I'm most anxious when waiting around. If there are test results in limbo, etc. My general experience is relief when I take care of whatever issues are at play.
0.357100	Mostly just that the doctor is going to find something really bad.  I am not worried about what the doctor will do or the physical examition itself.  Just the part in the back of your mind that he may diagnose something very bad.  That is what makes me worried and a little uneasy.  Not a whole lot just in the back of my mind.
0.738100	I'm more worried they might find something bad that I wasn't aware of. This is more me worrying than anything as it's rare they find anything serious. Most of the time the problem isn't serious and they can treat it. I just kinda hold my breath when I'm at the doctor anyway, you never know if they'll find something you don't know about....
1.000000	I am worried about the cost, about whether or not the staff are friendly, if whatever I am going in there for is going to end up being something worse than I expected. There are a ton of reasons to feel complete and utter anxiety and worry while you're in there. That's why a lot of people don't go. 
0.404800	I am usually worried about the results of a blood test and just making sure my numbers are okay in general.
0.381000	I tend to be anxious in unusual social situations. Being in a small room with another person puts me on edge regardless of the actions of the physician. 
0.142900	I feel most anxious about anomalies showing up in my blood tests and the embarrassment of getting a pap smear.  But in general, I do not get anxious or worried when seeing a doctor.  I see doctor visits as a necessity, and any medical problems must be detected and dealt with head-on.
0.738100	Nothing
0.642900	I'm just a very anxious person in general, and I have white coat syndrome, so my blood pressure rises when I go to the doctor, which in turn makes the doctors/nurses worried, which makes my anxiety increase. I also get anxious that the doctor will find something wrong with me, which will have a negative impact on my life.
0.238100	I tend to worry in general, and when I get blood work done I worry that my results will not be good. I worry that conditions that I have will not improve from one appointment to the next. I'm on medication for these conditions and I worry that a combition of these medications and changes I've made to my diet and lifestyle won't have a positive effect. So far I have had positive results, but I worry every time that that won't continue. When I first started seeing my primary care doctor I was worried that I might not like her or might not be comfortable with her, but we have developed a pretty good relationship. 
0.285700	I am generally not anxious when I see the doctor. I am rarely sick and just don't have much fear when I go see a doctor. I guess there is always a fear of something being terribly wrong with me but I tend not to think about that. I guess I am more anxious about picking up an illness at the doctor than anything else, like the flu.
0.428600	I don't like getting my blood drawn. I hate needles.
0.642900	If the doctors says unpredictable things or some thing bad it scare me to see the doctor.
0.452400	I mainly worry when I am not certain about what is going on with my body. What is causing issues of illness.
0.166700	Just the out-of-routine occurance. A visit to the doctor is not a normal daily occurance for me.
0.142900	Nothing, I love visiting my doctor.
0.642900	Can they be trusted?
0.595200	Just doctor's in general make me nervous no matter how many times I have been. I think they call it white coat syndrome. I am fearful of a scary diagnosis even tho I have never had one before. 
0.595200	Waiting for news. 
0.357100	The chance of receiving bad news I suppose. I have cancer in my family and it is always a worry of mine. 
0.571400	I do not have to visit the doctor often enough to have worry.
0.785700	I'm not sure there's anything specific. The whole visit is overwhelming. I'm nervous I won't get to tell them what's wrong. That they will be rushing and not listening to you. If you go for a physical and tell them things that have been wrong with you, you have to worry about insurance because it's no longer a physical. You worry about them overbilling because if you aren't requesting an itemized bill, you know they are.
0.714300	I am always a little worried that they are going to find something seriously wrong with me. The only doctors I have been to in the past few years are baby doctors and they are typically very good at relieving those worries.
0.714300	i hate to go to clinic  the atmosphere makes me sick more
0.666700	I do not visit the doctor's office often but when I do I always automatically get an un-easy feeling of nervousness. I can not explain why I feel this way.
0.142900	My health is what worries me. Not knowing if something is seriously wrong. New doctors also make me a little anxious.
0.333300	Just the unsureness of what could be wrong with me. 
0.642900	I am not an anxious or worrisome person, but I do often feel these emotions in a doctor's office. Sometimes I worry that my condition may be worse than I am assuming. Also, I guess as a gut feeling, I just don't like doctor's offices, which helps to invoke these emotions.
0.809500	Cost is always a big factor and then you worry about what they may find and what treatments and/or prescriptions that you will have to take and what side effects could be included. 
0.500000	When I have to get on a scale. I hate getting on a scale...period. I'm not morbidly obese or anything, but it makes me very anxious. I wish people didn't insist on weighing  people everywhere. 
0.428600	Just the rush rush of it all. I do not really trust that dr's are really listening to what you are saying.
0.309500	I think that what makes me worried the most is that they might  find something really wrong. 
0.476200	I always believe something is wrong when they don't just tell fast. I feel that they are annoyed someone came to get better.
0.666700	The language barrier concerns me most.  What he says and what I think he means are sometimes different.  As an example, they tell me that tests I need to take for an existing condition are preventive; they are not preventive if I already have the condition.  The tests at that stage are diagnostic.  They are more concerned with a patient taking standard tests than treating them for the condition the patient is most worried about. 
0.785700	My family on both my mother's and father's, have histories of terrible diseases as well as cancer. My dad died of cancer at a young age. There is also quite a bit of mental health issues, the cause of my mother's suicide. I've spent a lot of time in hospitals watching people die and just driving by a hospital gives me the chills. I worry because I always expect the worst when it comes to doctor visits.
0.547600	I think it is usually the possibility of illness or a bad visit and finding out something is wrong.
0.285700	NOT APPLICABLE
0.642900	I would feel most anxious while visiting the doctor's office because I would fear that there was something else wrong with me instead of what I was going in for.
0.142900	I worry about what my blood pressure will be that is basically all that I worry about them doing
0.523800	"Really, the only thing that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the potential for unknowns. While my health may not be the best, I have never encountered anything ""serious"" when seeing my doctor. I am always somewhat concerned that he may one day find something that requires serious medical attention, and that worries me."
0.142900	I feel most worried that the doctor will find something, maybe it's cancer, or some other neurological disease. But even though logically, I shouldn't worry, it just becomes automatic. 
0.190500	"Mostly it's finding out something is wrong. Other than that, it's more of ""did I cut my ils, or wash well"", and making sure I don't smell. The exam is just ""there"", and doesn't cause me too much worry."
0.214300	just the thourht of the unknown like getting bad news but not usully that bad of and experience as far as worrying goes
0.571400	There is nothing in particular, it is just a generalized anxiety I get just by going to the doctor. It is just an uneasiness that I get just being there. 
0.809500	I am always worried about bad news. My mind always goes to thinking that any results will come back bad. I also fear being told I will have to come back for more testing.
0.523800	Uncomfortable questions. And also the dread that he will find something wrong with me. 
0.238100	I not the type of person who gets anxious or worries about anything. If i felt anything it would be uncertainty about finding out about some condition I wasn't aware of.
0.381000	I would say the only thing that really makes me worried is the chance that my doctor will have some bad news for me after a checkup. Something like cancer or another terrible disease.   
0.238100	I am always anxious about my blood work.   However, nothing ever turns up bad so that is a relief.  
0.142900	Having to do an unexpected procedure that either is somewhat painful or time consuming. Having to wait to see the doctor. 
0.571400	I don't really feel anxious when I visit my main doctor (as described previously), but I've had a certain amount of doctor phobia as long as I can remember/since I was a small child.  I'm really irratiolly afraid of needles and especially injections.  I am capable of having blood drawn if I lay down, but I have a feeling there's part of me that always expects at a GP's place or something that they're going to want to give me a shot or something...  I know that won't happen at the endocrinologist's office, ha
0.619000	I get nervous because a lot of people in my family have had cancer, I've been pretty healthy my whole life but I'm afraid my luck will run out and I'll get it too.
0.428600	I am most anxious about the doctor not knowing what the issue is.  I am anxious about anything requiring surgery.  I am fearful of debilitation.
0.500000	Don't have any complications or disorder. Still anxious about needles since I was little.
0.452400	I usually get my blood drawn when I see my doctor. He does it as a good habit, I suppose. I'm terrified of needles.
0.523800	I only go to the doctor for a yearly physical exam, pap smear, and mammogram or if I am feeling ill. I am concerned I may not be explaining what I am feeling properly and give iccurate information. Then, I would receive the wrong treatment.
0.714300	My blood pressure is always high and it is even higher when I go to the doctor's office.  I am always anxious because I'm expecting it to be high.
0.500000	I worry that my doctor might tell something bad about my health.
0.619000	I feel a bit anxious about visiting the doctor's office, due to the results of my vital signs and weight.  Sometimes my blood pressure is a little high when I am at the doctor's office and my physician even knows that this is due to a little nervousness at his office. The reason behind this uneasiness is the fear of finding bad or high risk results about my health.
0.690500	Not knowing the severity of my condition and the thought of being given drugs that will have terrible side effects.
0.357100	I am most anxious of being called out because I haven't kept to a low saturated diet as much as the doctor recommended.  I hate admitting I haven't followed instructions.
0.714300	I worried about what the diagnosis the doctor will tell me.  Will it require surgery, how long the recovery period will be if surgery is required, is it a termil illness, or a decline in my mental faculties?
0.571400	I never know if something is wrong that I don't know about or if the doctor will find something that I didn't know was wrong. 
0.571400	"I call the chair that I sit in closest to the doctor the ""hot seat"".  :o)  I am always a little nervous going to the doctor.  I wonder if what I am going in for might be something silly and I am making a big deal about a small thing.  Also I worry that they won't find whatever is going on with me and after testing they don't find anything.  I feel a little foolish after that."
0.142900	Sometimes I may feel that way but it is not because of the actual visit is. It is more because I have to be there in the first place, meaning something is really going on with me and I am anxious to find out what it is.
0.476200	I worry the most about the diseases that the other patients are bringing to the waiting room. I also worry about the cost and the excuses my insurance company will give me for not covering what they are supposed to cover. I worry a little bit about the quality of care and whether or not anyone in the office will take their profession seriously during my visit.
0.738100	about what he will tell me if something is wrong.sometimes my sugar levels are high and he gets a little upset because he is very concerned about it.
0.285700	I really don't feel nervous visiting.  If it's a check up I feel pretty good about it and don't really worry about what they might fine (I can't change it anyway and would rather know).  I think the only thing I don't like is when they take blood.  Sometimes it goes smooth and other times it's painful as they have to restick me several times.  Other than that it's all good.
0.952400	I think that I'll be diagnosed with the worst condition and will need surgery. I have white coat syndrome so my worries are numerous and most of them are silly but I'm working on meditating to control my anxiety. 
0.690500	I haven't had a male doctor since I was a child.  Now I have a male doctor and I feel very uncomfortable with him.  I think that if I had either a female physician or a male physician who was more concerned and caring I would not have these feelings.
0.357100	I'm sometimes a little anxious about being physically examined by someone I don't know well. I'm sometimes a little worried that there might be something seriously wrong. And crowded waiting rooms and long wait times are stressful, so I don't look forward to that.
0.642900	Even though I am relatively healthy and have no family history of major medical conditions, there is always the chance that something can go wrong. I wouldn't say I am extremely nervous when visiting my doctor but I am a bit anxious. 
0.904800	I don't know what could be wrong with me; the mystery bothers me. I would love to have straight answers at all times.
0.904800	I'm usually worried that I will get bad news. I get anxious that they will tell me something is very wrong. Or if I don't know the doctor I get scared that they won't treat me right. 
0.666700	I am usually anxious or worried because I fear that something will be wrong with me.  I worry that I will find that I have diabetes or some other bad news.  
0.642900	That i am wasting my time and not going to get the help i need to fix or understand my problems. Most of my problems are not real bad just yet but they are problems i want to understand before they become major issues.
0.785700	The unknown.  I never have been comfortable with doctors and the older I have gotten, the less I trust doctors, especially since the ovomitdon;tcare tax went into effect and we are refused treatment once we reach the age that we cannot work and support the correct number of career welfare families.  
0.690500	The results of tests.  That can mean blood work or various other tests.  I also had unprotected sex which made me nervous waiting for the test results for that.
0.238100	I'm often worried that the solution to my problem will be complicated or very time-consuming/expensive.
0.690500	The lack of transparency and uncertainty can be burdensome. Knowing that the doctor knows more about what's wrong with me than I do, and them not sharing all of that information. 
0.166700	I'm not typically worried or anxious when I visit a doctor's office.
0.952400	I am most worried that he will neglect to find the source of the problem, and I will die due to an error that was easily preventable with a little care for his job. I think they have no consequences for patient deaths, so they do not care if they miss things that will save lives. They do not care for their patients anymore, they just milk them for their sheckles.
0.285700	I do not like having blood work done. I hate needles and it makes me uncomfortable.  I also dislike going to my gynecologist. 
0.190500	I'm not worried just cautious and aware..educated... 
0.166700	I worry about my doctor's age and how long he is going to remain in practice since he is well aged. I also worry about some of the staff at the office and how many have left over the years. Just general white coat anxiety is what makes me feel most anxious, I have always had that and always will.
0.571400	I'm passed the point where I receive good news at the doctor
0.261900	Just the concern that something may be worse.
0.142900	I don't really feel anxious at all at a doctors office. I feel like I'm doing things that I should probably do more often, but I don't because of fincial reasons.
0.547600	More worried just in case doctor told me something worst thing. 
0.714300	I worry that the doctor will find a health problem I am not already aware of. I worry that the doctor will get short if I ask too many questions. I worry that the doctor is so attuned to conventiol options that he won't think broadly about new possibilities to address conditions with less side effects and more benefits.
0.500000	I am worried that something might be wrong. I don't usually go to the doctor so when I do, its because of some pain or problem so I am anxious that it is very serious
0.881000	I always feel like they will find something else wrong with me, I take enough meds now
0.571400	Certainly there's some anxiety or dread in going to the doctor. Whether it's just an exam or you're going for a specific purpose, there's always some uncertainty about what the doctor will say. It could be everything's ok or you have some serious medical problems. That uncertainty makes it tural to be anxious.
0.666700	Most doctors offices are terribly sterile and uninviting and don't foster any since of being a caring individual. It makes me feel like a piece of meat.
0.642900	Usually it's things like how bad my cholesterol is, maybe anxious on things that might be suggested by my doctor...and definitely not looking forward to full (yearly) or prostate examition.
0.166700	The only thing I fear is the wait. This makes me anxious because I do not like to waste time. Sometimes this can be the worst part of the doctor visit.
0.142900	Not knowing what is wrong with me if I have to go to the doctor or maybe having to get more tests done than I thought.
0.142900	getting blood drawn is what makes me the most anxious. when i get blood drawn i always pass out.
0.285700	It'll sound odd, but okay. It's extremely rare for me to catch a cold, but I always feel a little anxious about the potential germs. The main reason getting sick bothers me is that it'll get in the way of my weight training (and I happen to be a training stimulus addict). Ironically enough, nothing else bothers me...I maintain a single digit body fat percentage virtually year-round, and my doctor often comes to me for fitness advice ;-)
0.714300	From the smell when I hit the door until I escape, I am anxious about everything. I trust them to a point but am always wondering what they aren't telling me which isn't really fair to my current doc because she is very thorough and takes more time than any other doc has ever spent with me. My blood pressure always skyrockets although it never is away from medical facilities but filly my current doc figured this out. I expect bad things to happen because of past experiences.
0.642900	The unknown of what the doctor will say. You are always worried that the doctor will find something unexpected. 
0.500000	I have high blood pressure. I'm always anxious about have my blood pressure tested because it varies so much and it is usually high when I go to the doctor's office because I have walked to get there. Sometimes it bothers me because the nurses get a high reading and are overly concerned. If the doctor takes the blood pressure later it's usually lower, but the nurses don't seem to understand that.
0.833300	i am getting older now,and i sometimes wonder,if something really horrible will be found wrong with me.it seems i wake up with a new ache or pain daily.
0.142900	I usually feel quite good so I am never nervous about my checkups.  Fortutely I am extremely healthy and always have been.  The worst problem I've had is sciatica and I went to PE for that. 
0.523800	If anything it's that the doctor might tell me something is going on with me that is worse than I am aware of/anticipating. 
0.857100	I'm afraid they will find something else wrong or needs to be taken care of that will cost me more money out of pocket even though we have insurance.
0.761900	I just worry they will find some major health issue wrong with me. 
0.500000	Hoping my chronic health conditions are not gettimg worse. Nervous about test results. Trying to be optimistic.
0.428600	the wait and being around other people who could be sick 
0.738100	What makes me most anxious about a doctor visit is two-fold: the thought of finding out something dreadful is wrong OR that nothing is wrong and I look the fool. 
0.285700	I really don't feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor.  The only issue I have is that I had a really bad experience with a doctor in the same practice and I don't really like to see him.  If I do, I just pretend that he isn't there. It is so worth it to see our current doctor that I will deal with seeing the other doctor for a minute or so when we are walking to the exam room.
0.809500	What worries me most is thinking of  all the things the doctor might find. It's stressful to think you may have some disease or cancer and the doctor is about to change your life forever.
0.690500	Sometimes when going into the Dr's office with symptoms that seem like they maybe severe I become anxious while waiting for the exam and tests to determine my issue.  I also get anxious because it seems like the dr always wants to discuss worst possible issues first.
0.642900	I feel anxious about going to the doctor at any time.  I am not a fan.  I can become a little worried about the idea of tests or anything out of the ordiry.
0.642900	I worry that I wont cover all the things I feel like I should talk to the doctor about in order for them to give me proper medical care and that the reason I wont is because I worry they will think I'm some kind of hypochondriac (although I see a doctor less than once a year, sometimes if you have a lot of concerns when you see them they seem to become pretty tired and dismissive as the exam proceeds.)
0.595200	When the doctor is concerned about particular health issues I may have, I get a little anxious and worried but he has been the calm one in this relationship. He makes me feel better by explaining the whole process of care very clearly.
0.547600	In my current situation, the cost is my biggest concern. Otherwise, I don't really have issues with seeing the doctor. There's only the slightest worry about what might be wrong with me.
0.238100	The potential for a negative visit usually is what bothers me the most. If I've never been to a particular doctor's office, their demeanor mostly gives me cause for worry.
0.761900	Mostly I worry about my condition and how it will affect me. I also get nervous around doctors in general, because usually when you have to see a doctor, you won't be getting good news. So I'm usually already feeling a bit anxious before I even see the doctor.
0.785700	The things that make me feel most anxious is interacting with the doctor and feeling like a may be scolded. The other thing I don't like is just going to the doctor tends to make me feel a general unease. It triggers my social anxiety.
0.714300	Thoughts that there is no point to visit the doctor, I just spend time and money without any results.
0.333300	My worries at the doctor are usually less about the actual meeting with the doctor than surrounding matters like cost and health insurance. I am sometimes concerned about prescription side effects or misdiagnosis, but am willing enough to accept my doctor's recommendations that it doesn't bother me.
0.142900	I sometimes think about how much the visit to the doctor will cost me. I think of it more as an annoyance than I'm being taken advantage of.
0.142900	I am anxious to have the exam over with but worried that maybe the results will not be good.
0.500000	Not knowing what is going on or what problems might be occurring in my body. 
0.309500	i be so anxious to see things like my blood presser and worried if it going to be high 
0.238100	I'm a anxious person in general. But when I go to the doctor am a little more anxious I think just because I'm afraid she might find something bad, like cancer.
0.428600	Not knowing if everything's gon be okay or if there's some issue the doctor might discover that I didn't know about.
0.309500	I feel anxious and worried because I don't know what the doctor will tell me after examining me.
0.404800	during an exam, you do not know what could be found, so that is nerve wracking
0.761900	The idea of receiving bad health news or finding out that there was something extremely wrong with me or my health.
0.238100	The potential for being diagnosed with something serious, I suppose.
0.690500	I always worry that the doctor will find that something is wrong with me and I wouldn't even suspect.
0.404800	Even though i am calm with my doctor,  it's always an anxious time as you never know if something could be found wrong. 
0.714300	I suppose that it's fear of the unknown.  As I get older I hear about all of the various health issues the others have experienced and I worry that something serious will happen to me. 
0.500000	I have several chronic pain and breathing issues.  I'm always concerned that one of these issues may evolve into something that may become very serious.  I don't like surgery and I don't like hospitals, and I'm always concerned that either may become necessary.
0.523800	Not really about the doctor but more about what I might find out and how much it will cost.
0.785700	I'm always afraid they will discover some terrible new disease I have to go with the ones I currently experience. 
0.785700	You never know if your next physical could be the one that you find out that you have cancer or some other life-crippling ailment.
0.428600	Well, experience tells me that a little thing can be indicative of a big thing. How do you think I found out about a cancer that resulted in a 3 month hospitalization? A doctors visit, thats how. So, it would be rather unusual to not have trepedation when repeating the visits later. I had to abandon a cafreer because of physical pain and even the doctors that realize the source of the problem are too chicken shit to say so for disability. Seven years later and poverty is the result.
0.142900	I worry that they might find something that I didn't know about and it is very serious.
0.452400	my doctor takes hours to come into the office to see me. that makes me really anxious because sometimes i have other things to do that day. also, i just met him so i get anxious about describing all my issues to him.
0.333300	I am hoping that I get a clean bill of health from my check ups. You never know what a doctor might find. It produces anxiety in me regarding possible health problems arising.
0.214300	What makes me most anxious is now knowing what the doctor might find, that is medically wrong with me, during the office visit.
0.476200	Diabetes runs in my family.  I want to make sure that I never get that disease ever in my life. I'm always anxious at the thought of the doctor telling me that I have diabetes whenever I come in. 
0.142900	I don't typically feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office.  I know my body and my health very well.  Visits to the doctor's office, up to this point in my life, have been relatively event free.
0.142900	That I might have to get blood drawn which doesn't hurt it's just an annoying process.
0.642900	Even if nothing feels wrong, I'll get nervous that I've got some major health issue that I wasn't aware of. I'm in my late 30's, and although I'm in pretty good health now, I'm always afraid that issues of some sort are just around the corner for me. 
0.309500	Being in a doctors office. 
0.619000	Just the thought that something serious could be wrong.  The thought I might catch something from the other sick people.  That I might have to have some kind of treatment.  That I might have to have a shot.
0.404800	It is uncomfortable to have someone examine my body, that is essentially a stranger, so intimately . It is uncomfortable no matter how often it occurs.
0.857100	Most of the times it's the uncertainty about how severe the illness is, the pain involved when getting diagnosed etc.
0.714300	The unknown of what they might find from running test.
0.690500	Getting on the scale and being told that my blood levels are normal when I am having symptoms related to a condition I am on medication for. Also,  an abnormal mammogram, even though it has been a false finding every time.
0.738100	I am anxious and worried that something more serious may be wrong with me than I think. I am embarrassed to talk about certain things with my doctor. I just want to get the exam over and done with because I don't like to be looked at and touched. 
0.476200	just what to expect from a check up.Just thinking what if they find something wrong with me.
0.952400	I feel anxious because I am afraid he will find something wrong or he will want to send me somewhere for tests I do not want
0.238100	WHat makes me feel most anxious is just the overall doctor visit which I always find unpleasant.
0.785700	They could find that i have a dangerous health issue. 
0.214300	Being in hospitals. The sounds, the smell, the sights. I guess it goes back to when I was young, every time I went to the doctor as a kid something was wrong. I guess some of that anxiety cared over to my adult years. 
0.500000	I don't know, really. I'm not scared, just nervous. 
0.547600	 Usually the thought that he might find something that is an illness or has the potential to be bad,  like a tumor or whatnot. It's not so much the examition itself as it is the potential negative outcome of my labs being bad, etc.
0.500000	I am most anxious about the results. I am scared that they will find a disease or condition that will affect my life. I am also anxious about how the doctor will handle my care. Third, I am anxious because I am self-conscious about my body.
0.857100	I'm not sure I can change what will happen. I really don't need to know the answer to many questions I can't afford to treat in the way I would need to do. most problems go away if you can not worry about them long enough.
0.285700	
0.333300	I'm anxious when I am really sick and don't know what's wrong with me. I go into the office expecting the worst. It also makes me anxious when she doesn't know what's wrong, and I have to get more testing done. I am also anxious when I have to see another doctor because my doctor is on vacation. 
0.666700	I am always worried that the doctor will discover something that could lead to something complicated and unwanted.
1.000000	Im afraid that the doctor lacks the basic knowledge to access the condition and prescribe appropriate treatment.I worry that the individual may be more concerned about fincial gains rather than offering sound judgement.
1.000000	When I go to the doctor and they take a long time to tell me what's going on. I also gets worried when I'm not sure about what my problem is.
0.261900	I just always feel a little uneasy and nervous waiting on a diagnosis. The feeling of uncertainty is always a bit unsettling. I try my best to not let it bother me to much.
0.238100	It just makes me anxious having to be examined.  I don't have a good reason.  It feels kind of intrusive.
0.714300	Whether they are going to find something wrong and try to pressure me into some 'treatment' which will suppress symptoms and interfere with my body's attempts to heal and rebalance. I really wish that I could find a holistic practitioner who could help me live a tural and healthy lifestyle, making the most of traditiol medical knowledge and modern medicine. 
0.619000	the uncertain of your health or finding some bad news about you
0.857100	I'm worried that they won't look for what is wrong with me and think it is all in my head. I'm scared they might find something bad wrong with me and I'm terrified of having painful procedures and tests done. 
0.500000	I just don't like waiting. I am in pretty good health so I'm not really worried that something terrible is going to turn up. I am always a bit anxious to find out my weight since I have struggled with it in the past. 
0.285700	I never feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. Even if the appointment is to discuss test results. I am confident if that there is a health issue of concern, my doctor has researched the best possible demerits to present to me.
0.619000	I feel anxious or worried the most when I am sick and go to the doctors. I feel like I may receive some bad news sometimes. It's just an atmosphere where you are not sure if everything will be okay. But I trust my doctor so I am not entirely anxious. 
0.714300	"I've had a bout with thyroid cancer so every doctor visit I think ""what's next?"" and how much will each referral and testing diagnostic cost. It worries me emotiolly and fincially."
0.333300	Just the fact that I have to go the doctor at all. I have been sick for a while so it just makes me nervous to be there at all, and a little anxious but I know I feel a bit better now, so it is getting better with the axiety.
0.619000	Often times it's the possibility of having to argue with them about what would be a better treatment for ME. There are certain meds that just aren't necessary, and I hate that I have to go in with the mindset of having to be my own advocate and ready for mild confrontation. A doctor should have my best interest in mind and not just what is easy or done out of habit for them. I also worry I won't be listened to when I try to do my due diligence to list ALL symptoms pertaining to whatever is ailing me. 
0.547600	usually what they may or may not find. You never know what problems you could have until you get an examition. I usually trust their skills and judgment and that they'll do their job well though. 
0.904800	I worry they will perform a painful procedure.  I worry they will recommend that I have a painful procedure.  I am anxious about rather or not they will listen to my needs, concerns and rather or not they will spend enough time with me.
0.761900	I get anxious or worried because I always expect something bad to come out of the situation.  I'm always thinking something more serious is going on than really is. 
0.785700	when my brainscans come back and I'm finding out the results
0.690500	I get worried that I will have to get shots. I've had a phobia of them for a while
0.500000	The fact of going there just sparks tural anxiety. I don't want to face any underlying issues. I don't worry too much but just want to be sure all is well. 
0.690500	Usually any procedure that involves the doctor inspecting private areas makes me worried.  I don't feel comfortable with that at all.
0.381000	I think it is just the fact of the unknown. Everyone comes across health issues at some point in their life and im just nervous waiting for mine. Worrying that my blood test will come back abnormal or the doctor will hear something in my lungs or see a lump somewhere. 
0.523800	I am very paranoid about my health. The thing that makes me feel the most anxious or worried is me thinking about what could be wrong and what the doctor will tell me. I am always afraid he is going to give me horrible news.
0.881000	If there Is something wrong with my health. If I have to take any long term medication. The process of getting better if there is an illness.
0.809500	I am most worried about finding out bad news about my health when visiting the doctor. More than that I worry about any treatment I may need. I worry about any physical pain I might have to endure and how I will pay for it. Since I can't afford it and my insurance isn't adequate, I worry because I know I probably won't receive proper treatment. 
0.142900	I am not anxious or worried about doctor's visit, but concern about time I don't like the waiting
0.142900	I don't feel anxious when visiting the doctor
0.523800	One of my biggest concerns with visiting a doctor's office involve receiving bad news or being treated too quickly and the doctor not doing a full job. As patients we sometimes wait long periods to see the doctor, so the idea we can be pushed out fast is worrisome.
0.642900	I just worry the possibility that they find something wrong with me. I'm never worried about the doctor doing anything wrong or making mistakes. I don't have the healthiest lifestyle so I expect bad news when I visit the doctor.
0.500000	Unless I am really ill I don't feel anxious. The one thing that worries me most is when a doctor briefly feels for breast lumps, although that's done so quickly there's not much chance of it. So the chance of having cancer of some kind makes me most worried.
0.190500	I was most anxious and worried about my own health, especially when I wasn't sure what could possible go wrong with me and before a new symptom was diagnosed and confirmed by the doctor.  
0.642900	The diagnosis. I sometimes already have some idea or thought about why I feel bad and I'm afraid that the doctor's diagnostic confirm my suspicions.
0.571400	I feel that the doctor might find something that is bad like a health condition or a disease that I have recently developed.
0.142900	i don't like waiting for results especially if it was for something that might be serious. 
0.690500	"Feeling as though the physician doesn't have the time to ""deal"" with you.  Questions not answered, followup not proper.  "
0.809500	I worry that something could be found to be wrong with my heart. Sometimes my blood pressure is higher than it should be when they test it. I worry that the doctor will think I am faking the physical pain and anxiety I feel so that I can get drugs from it.
0.857100	Oftentimes, the silence that hangs in the air from other patients. 
0.857100	I think lack of trust is a big issue. I'm also squeamish about needles and other procedures. Also, bad memories about my parents' medical treatment.
0.738100	The longer i wait, the more anxious i become. As i become more stressed anxiety builds. The waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me to become even more stressed.
0.761900	I'm not sure if I know.  It seems to be an automatic reaction.  It may be in part that I don't want to be told that I need to make major changes in my lifestyle.
0.952400	Number one is that they will find something wrong even if I am there to treat something minor.  I will be nervous and worried and then it will most likely be nothing, a mistake.  Or the treatment will do nothing for me.
0.285700	Just the activity of going to visit a doctor for them to possibly tell you something about your body you may not know. The experience in and of itself is a little bit nerve wracking.
0.333300	My biggest fear would be a diagnosis which revealed some serious medical condition which I was uware of.
0.452400	Worried because just in case doctor told me something bad about my health condition.
0.190500	Mostly the attitude of the doctors and their staff.  It makes me a bit worried if the staff is not professiol in handling the appointments and/or paperwork.  
0.452400	Unless it's for a regular check-up, I'm at the doctor's office because I''m either injured or ill. My condition would make me a bit anxious. There is also the small chance that the doctor might discover something serious that I was not already aware of. 
0.809500	"Money is the first of the most important concerns. The old saying ""I can not afford to get sick or go to the Dr, hospital, etc.. Applies to most of us including me. The second worry  concern is what the Dr finds out during lab work, exams, etc and the diagnosis and the ""Cost"" I am always concerned that whatever the Dr finds through an exam or test is that they advise you on a standard rule of the most expensive treatment or specialist they can give. I have had many persol experiences with this. There is no such thing as persol, affordable, think out of the box, healthcare treatments. I am treated like a robot in a robot system. I go to my family physician and if there is anything wrong I get sent all over town to specialists and have many appointments and a lot of time and out of pocket expenses and find out later that all of that was not necessary and the health problem could have been handled and treated through my family Dr. simply and a lot less expensive. "
0.619000	I am afraid I will get bad news.
0.761900	That they will find something wrong with me that is very harmful and that would be life changing. Today going to get checked by a doctor with all the things that can go wrong is a very stressful thing.
0.571400	I'm worried about the readings of my vitals that the nurse takes. Those are generally the best way to tell how I'm doing. By the time the doctor comes in, I'm more apprehensive at what the numbers are more than I'm worried about him as a person or physician. 
1.000000	I feel worried each time I visit my doctor because I feel he's going to add me on more medication. He said that my blood pressure continues to increase. The medicine that I'm on already makes me feel dizzy at times. I don't want to be placed on more medication. 
0.785700	Gynecological examition makes me so anxious and worried because first thing you have to show your private parts, second the thought about the test results.
0.809500	I'm afraid of receiving bad news about my health
0.452400	As this hardly ever occurs, well, ... hard to say. However, most times (very few), I've mostly felt more neutral, than anxious. Any anxiety would be related to waiting time.
0.476200	Its just a very nerve wracking experience, if you don't go to the doctor that often like me, you just never know what illness might pop up.
0.238100	Not knowing what the results of tests or an examition might be. It makes me a little nervous,not knowing what to expect.
0.571400	The thing that worries me the most is that there will be costs I'm not aware of to the visit. We are on a very fixed income and a lot of times there are additiol fees tacked onto bills that I wasn't expecting. Sometimes it's because I asked a question, which is frustrating.
0.333300	As I get older, I recognize that my body is aging as well. As the body ages, it tends to degrade. What makes me anxious is if he finds something wrong and wants me to go see other doctors or have tests performed. I don't want to spend the time having to do that.
0.619000	I am particularly uncomfortable with physical examitions and so they make my anxiety flare up.
0.928600	The idea that I might have something else to add to the pile of illnesses I have. Or that with my Sjogren's since I'm more likely to get lymphoma will it show up, especially since cancer runs in my family.
0.595200	I feel like I'm being judged
0.619000	I think doctors often seem to guess at what is going on with their patients, though it is an informed guess, they may not be making a careful assessment of their patients health and rely a little too heavily on previous experience to the extent where they may not recognize or are dismissive of other symptoms. They can often seem resigned to a bad outcome, and at the same time be uninformative about what is going on.
0.428600	"The only time I might feel anxious or worried with visiting my doctor would be, the not ""Knowing"" what's wrong. Not wanting to hear any dreadful news."
0.238100	I don't want to feel anxious, but there is something about me that is turally anxious. I know this about myself because my BP reading inflates every time I go for a checkup.  I feel I am this way even in social situations although no one takes my BP under those circumstances.  
0.142900	I only get anxious sometimes in the waiting room because I get social anxiety. 
0.642900	It worries me that my physician will give me bad news about my health. 
0.404800	waiting for my appointment is a very stressful situation. The longer i wait, the more anxious i become. As i become more stressed and anxiety builds, the waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me to become even more stressed.
0.547600	I am a very nervous person. When I have a doctors appointment I am very antsy and high strung. I fear my diagnosis will one day  be cancer.
0.714300	"I have to be KED! Well, not exactly. The gown is open in the back though, making me feel exposed and vulnerable. I don't want to turn my head and cough while he checks out my ball sac. Sh*t, he's looking down there a bit too long. Is he gay? Oh, no, here come the latex gloves. ""Bend over,"" he says. "
0.642900	I have a fear across the boards with doctors and dentists. Im afraid of bad news such as cancer or the likes. I think finding out the bad news would make what ever it is get worse faster. I also worry that i will be looked down on, due to weight. Although it hasn't been the case, its still in my head.
0.333300	I always feel a little anxious when someone has to look at my ked body. I also worry that being anxious will throw off my blood pressure readings, I have low blood pressure, and want to keep it that way. I hate getting on the scales as I know my weight is not great for my height. I am always a little anxious when the blood results are given to me. I want to be in excellent health and if I am not I want the doctor to tell me it is something that can be changed by diet or medication.
0.857100	"I worry that the doctor might prescribe me medicines just because I went in for a consultation. In other words, the doctor could have very well known that the medicines are just a temporary solution and that my illness would have healed on its own, given some time and rest. Instead of saying ""Go take rest"", he would be forced to prescribe medicines just because he is a doctor! I am not scared of injections. However, I become uneasy and anxious of intrusive procedures like inserting swabs into your nose, throat, ears etc. I am anxious that the doctor might be a racist and would harm me in some way or the other based on my appearance or ethnicity."
0.714300	Although I try my best to keep myself healthy, I never know what a medical check-up will bring. I'm just an anxious person in general, so it's hard for me to sit still when someone else has information about me that I don't know. The anxiety comes from wanting to make certain that I'm physically and interlly OK.
0.761900	The number one reason for anxiety when going to a doctor is the cost. I fear they are going to recommend something I can not afford.Or find some form of cancer or something.
0.547600	Well, I'm 38, so I just don't want any unwanted surprises. :-) 
0.690500	Wondering if they will they get frustrated. Will this be fruitless and a waste of money. Can they help me.
0.761900	I am usually worried that he will discover something that is drastically wrong with my health.
0.166700	When I have to discuss my results that do not know about with him
0.833300	I worry that something is seriously wrong.
0.166700	The doctor is not totally alert. Wrong diagnosis. Visiting a doctor for the first time.
0.571400	I always fear the worst when I have a symptom or pattern of symptoms. As such, I am not so much anxious about the doctor in particular, but about learning about conditions I may have.
0.619000	I am anxious when my mother is there with me. She will ask questions and sometimes , when the physician asks me a question, she will pop in with her input before I speak.
0.381000	I'm frequently worried that I won't be able to correctly explain my problem, or mess it up so that he won't fully believe me. It's also worrisome that doctors frequently prescribe things that you know isn't what you need.
0.571400	If there would be something in the results that was unexpected and it would create some anxiety
0.142900	Just waiting for test results for days instead of getting them the same day of 
0.619000	Worried that I might get bad news or that I'm moving backwards towards progress that was made before.  It's almost like you don't know what's going to happen at each appointment.  Just deal with each one separately.
0.142900	just the office in general, the coldness , and waiting
0.142900	None so far as I have been taking care of my health on my own. My routine medical checkup has been good and when I do need to see my physician periodically it was more on getting the flu shots or some mild illness.
0.333300	when its a dental checkup i feel anxious.
0.666700	Generally, when you enter a doctor's office, it's either to receive treatment or advice regarding an existing issue or concern.  The best case scerio when going is that nothing is wrong, or it is not as serious as suspected.  The anxiousness or worry stems from the altertive scerio, that the issue is more serious, the issue requires additiol treatment, and the issue may not only affect my future health, but could include significant out of pocket costs.
0.666700	I would just get a little worried about what the doctor diagnostic would be, hoping that what might be wrong would not be major or life changing.
0.523800	 One never  knows the outcome .. the potential is there for all  kinds of problems.
0.904800	I definitely get anxious when I visit the doctors because I feel like they will find something serious.  I tend to jump to the worst conclusion when a test result comes back and when I am asked to come in again.  I get really nervous/worried when I have to wait for those results because I often go into a rabbit hole of reading things on WebMD and other sources to find out more.  Knowing that these visits are to prevent illness from happening or help cure them only eases these worries a little. 
0.428600	Finding out what is wrong with me. Or having him find something new that is devastating. I worry about what the diagnosis might be.
0.785700	I feel most anxious or worried about any possible negative diagnosis or treatments that might be advised to take (especially if invasive). Just the initial feeling of not knowing what is going on or what the problem is is already enough to cause a general feeling of anxiety. Some testing (and not just treatments) are also worrisome (fear of needles... I go through it, but I still hate any type of needles/pin pricks, etc.).
0.142900	Whether I need to be here.  Whether they can help me.  Whether this is a good value for my money.
0.523800	I am worried when the time to know the results of tests. I am worried whether my conditions are getting better, dosages of medicines are right for me in the past three months, when I may proceed for reproduction, ... etc.
0.428600	I am most anxious or worried because of the possibility of finding something medical problem with my health
0.523800	finding out something wrong could make me feel a little anxious or worried but in general I prefer to know.
0.833300	I always think something will be wrong. I think they won't take me serious.
0.809500	That they'll look down on me and brand me a drug seeker, or not believe what I'm telling them.
0.928600	It is just uncomfortable.  It is not something you do everyday so when the time comes for an appointment it makes me anxious.  I worry about gaining weight or my blood work numbers not being in the range they should be.
0.285700	Having to weigh myself in the beginning. 
0.500000	I'm always anxious because I go when I have a problem, not just to visit.
0.142900	The needle if i have to get a shot!

0.142900	I am most anxious when I do my blood work or when I have a pap smear. I always fear the worst. I don't know why, but I always feel like something is wrong. Things usually turn out alright, but I still always doubt things.
0.928600	What makes me feel most anxious is not knowing what the doctor may or may not find. Even if I'm feeling fine and believe that I'm healthy, you just never know. I'm also a bit of a hypochondriac, so in the back of my mind, I think I'm always think there couldbe something wrong. 
0.642900	I am worried the doctor will find something that is wrong with me and that I have health problems I wasn't aware of.
0.285700	Whenever anyone goes to the doctors, we are going at our most vulnerable state. We think there's something wrong with us. We always await the worse news. But as I've gotten older, I've realized it's not as scary as I thought.
0.571400	When I have to get a cancer screening or something of that nature done. I really get worried when my kids or loved ones visit the doctor to be honest.
0.357100	I feel anxious that they'll find something else wrong with me. I hope that I'm doing the right things and that I don't walk away with unexplained tests or something else that I need to watch out for. 
0.619000	Just the unknown of what is going to happen.  No one wants to get shots or have to draw blood, or find out something looks strange on you.  Those things would make anyone anxious and nervous.
0.142900	I am mostly anxious about the diagnosis. I also get anxious about being left in the examination room for a long period of time before getting seen. It almost becomes claustrophobic to the point that I need to get up and open the door.
0.142900	I feel that I will receive false or very bad news from my doctor. I have seen doctors give patients wrong information which led to worsened health. 
0.142900	I would feel anxious visiting the doctor if I had something going on that was scaring me or that was something major that was wrong with me. Sometimes I worry that if I go in for something that it won't be solved.
0.619000	I feel a little afraid that the doctor will find something wrong with me tat i didnt even know about yet. As i get older i know parts of my body will not function correctly and im anticipating that on a visit
0.428600	I do not experience anxiety ot worry very much about going to the doctor.  For me, it is more worrying when I can do it between work, kids, homelife, etc.
1.000000	i feel like the doctors are not being honest with me and saying that I am not healthy just so they can prescribe me a bunch of baloney. I have been depressed and very anxious for a while and wanted to bring it up to the doctor but feared they would force me to take pills or force medication for the sake of them gaining money rather than helping me which makes me step back and not want to visit the doctor unless I absolutely have to. 
0.142900	The unknown of what the answer will be. I've had some pretty serious health issues happen and there are chances of reoccurrence. 
0.714300	As I get older and feel more aches and pains I'm worried that he'll find a tumor or some organ failure or some bone turning to dust or some incurable disease.
0.595200	Oh there's always the worry they'll find something that ends up being deadly cancer or something. I'm also worried about having to do the prostate thing because I'm getting to the age where it's going to happen so I'm a bit anxious about that.
0.285700	The feeling that you could have an underlying condition that is not effecting your quality of life but could. You would only find that out when visiting the doctor and being examined. 
0.595200	I get anxious sometimes because you never know what is going to found or if something could go wrong. It is not a guarantee that everything will be checked to be fine.
0.857100	Not knowing what is going to happen. Worrying that there is something wrong with me. Not trusting the doctors.
0.714300	Being sick and assuming it's the worst possible thing. I'm worried about getting sicker in the waiting room with other sick people around. I'm worried about procedures that might hurt or feel embarrassing, such as bloodwork or bad side effects or something, and embarrassing as far as potentially showing body parts I don't normally show and talking about bodily functions
0.309500	Just being there is sometimes unsettling. It is hard to keep bad thoughts out when you are surrounded by sick people and the smell of a doctor's office. However, I know that my health is separate from others, so I try to keep the bad thoughts out by focusing on myself first. I get a little uneasy when waiting for test results or after an exam, but I know that I can get over it quickly.
0.571400	I always get anxious that the doctor will criticize me in some way or blame me. I also get anxious that I will receive bad news and require more medical care that is outside my financial budget.
0.309500	My greatest fear is that they will not listen or take serious my myriad of chronic and acute illnesses. They seem to often deal with my main issue that I came in for, but don't want to give me the time to deal with the other smaller yet still importan reasons I came in.
0.690500	Just not knowing what exactly is wrong with me is scary. If i go in knowing oh it's just a sore throat or the cold or something isn't that big of a deal. but if i'm going in for a blood test or something like that, it gets a little scary.
0.333300	Whenever I am worried about visiting a doctor it is due to what I am in there for. I am worried something could be wrong with me and it will be a long and expensive process if something is considerably wrong with me. 
0.571400	i am anxious to talk about what is going on with me and im anxious to find out if something new is wrong with me
0.357100	Sometimes I feel anxious or nervous when I'm getting a physical exam by a physician because I'm worried they will find something wrong. 
0.619000	I am sometimes afraid that there will be something seriously wrong with me. I sometimes dread hearing the worst, but so far, it has always turned out just fine. 
0.428600	I feel the most anxious or worried about what the unknown could be when I visit the doctor for an illness other than a cold. I wonder what could be the cause and if it is something serious. 
0.285700	I don't have a good track record with caring, thoughtful doctors. Most tend to disregard what I say or think about whatever's happening to me. In addition, I have a poorly understood chronic disease (CFS/ME) that many doctors refuse to even admit exist, despite overwhelming new information that it is a biological illness.
0.142900	I actually never get anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office. The doctor is there to make sure I am well. There is no hidden motive involved. They provide a service and I am generally alright with the service I personally receive. 
0.500000	Having to wait a long time. This is a waste of my life.  Doctors seem to overbook their appointments.
0.285700	I was anxious about the cost.  I am not anxious about the actual visit itself or about my doctor. I recently lost health coverage through my employer so the cost is the source of all my anxiety when it comes to the doctor.
0.809500	I am worried about getting bad news.  I also worry about being embarrassed or feeling awkward.  Usually it is the fear of bad news that worries me the most.
0.142900	Just the waiting process. i do not like to be in a room full of strangers waiting to be seen by a doctor. Other than that, i am completely comfortable with it and do not have any problems at all. 
0.285700	If I am having symptoms that I don't understand, or if I haven't been to the doctor in over a year, I sometimes afraid of what I will find out. It's nothing big, because other than diabetes, nothing really bad has happened to me.
0.285700	I think getting a bad dianosis is probably the worst part about going to the doctor and also what keeps me from going to the doctor is that fear that something will not be good
0.476200	I feel anxious or worried because I feel like I can predict what they are going to say. They are going to talk about how I need to lose 20 pounds and they will ask me questions about my lifestyle and recommend ways to lose weight.  It is a sensitive topic for me and I just don't want to talk about it, let alone with a stranger.
0.571400	I feel most anxious about the fact that there may be something wrong with me that I have not noticed or realized yet and that can lead me to be concerned. 
0.571400	when we visiting the doctor it would be very difficult to seem it.It would be very fair of it.Getting a treatment it would be very important of it
0.690500	I've always been anxious when going to the doctor's office but it has nothing to do with my doctors or their staff. I'm always concerned that some small ailment will end up being a larger issue. I've also had family members diagnosed with serious illnesses, so I worry that my time will be up at some point.
0.571400	I never know what to expect. My family has a history of cancer, so I'm always afraid that routine scans or checkups will result in them finding something that shouldn't be there. I'm concerned that I won't know how to react to what they tell me, or that  they won't find something until it's too late. 
0.666700	I am not a social person, so I have some difficulty speaking about my problems and issues. I am also worried about what the doctor may have to say about my health. 
0.619000	Your doctor should listen to your answers and offer you suggestions for managing your anxiety symptoms. A family doctor, however, does not specialize in mental health conditions and may not be qualified to treat you. He should provide referrals to psychiatrists or psychologists in your area that are better qualified to work with you and create a treatment plan for you.
0.619000	I worry that something about my health will be wrong. I'm afraid that I will have a terrible health issue, or even something minor but inconvenient. I think about how I'm a bit overweight and that is going to eventually cause health issues. I wonder if this appointment will be the one where I find out that my weight has caused some issues.
0.809500	What makes me most anxious is the fear that my doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. I also fear many of the procedures, as well as just interacting with medical people in general. The latter comes with me just having an avoidant personality disorder.
0.785700	That they'll find something wrong with me or something like that or tests will come back positive....
0.357100	I am more worried about getting the news than I am after I have received the news and know how to take care of the situation.
0.142900	I worst fear is that of catching a cold or flu from someone else that does not take the same needed precautions as I do. for example, washing hands.
0.571400	That I'll actually find myself and that will actually read to do something that I don't actually either want or need; basically that I won't be completely honest with the Dr.
0.309500	I just don't like being at the doctors.  I always remember what happened with the Tuskegee men's study and I'm worried about how doctors can abuse their power.
0.333300	I'm a pretty calm person and I don't get too nervous - but when at the doctor's for a problem I do sometimes have in the back of my head the idea that I might be really sick, or he might find a problem, or I might hear difficult news.  So I get a little uneasy and uncomfortable sometimes due to the unknown but not too bad.
0.642900	I just get anxious that something could be wrong with me that I dont know about. You never know what your bloodwork will come back saying
0.547600	I really get nervous about multiple things such as giving blood or other tests that I have not experienced. I can say I am kinda a baby when it comes to tests and such that doctors may do. This may stem from the fact I have not been to the hospital before for anything serious
0.214300	Mainly Iâm concerned about spending too much time in the waiting room around people who have a contagious illness. 
0.547600	Finding something that was unexpected.  Going in for a routine exam and getting bad news would be the worst. 
0.142900	If I have a problem that I'm unsure what it is. Everyone is always scared of the what seems like the inevitable. The inevitable is the big C word. Cancer. Either we die from a heart related problem or cancer most likely. It's just a matter of time.
0.547600	The main anxiety I have about visiting a doctor is receiving bad news about my health. I also fear having to undress or be naked in front of people I don't know
0.190500	Nothingg at the moment.  I'm mostly healthy expect for my weight from drinking habits.  I started having random pain that was constant and moderate to serve I would worry about what the diagnosis is at that point.
0.285700	I would only feel anxious or worried about visiting the doctor's if I thought I had something serious wrong with me. If I thought I had a serious disease or a potentially embarrassing disease, then I would be worried. 
0.547600	When I do go to the doctors office, because past doctors have never believed me on my condition I was always feeling anxious and worried throughout the visit. However, this has slowly went away. Still for some visits I become anxious or worried that my conditions may be developing further in a negative way. 
0.666700	One thing that makes me feel most anxious is the fact that there might be something wrong with me. That worries me, and I stress out about it.
0.285700	I get worried and anxious when I'm not sure if my problems will require some kind of procedure or if I will get a diagnosis I don't want to hear (like having cancer). The doctor herself doesn't make me feel uncomfortable or nervous, it is the consequences related to my problems that make we worried.
0.595200	I feel worried about whether I can get my questions answered and whether I can get the care I need. I have at times not received the treatment I feel I needed or the correct medicines when I have needed them. 
0.690500	That they will tell me something bad that I do not want to hear, that I am not in good health. I worry that it will be something that I haven't been doing right. 
0.190500	I have anxiety, and going to do anything where I am being examined bothers me to some extent. I don't worry about any potential problems, it's just general anxiety.
0.690500	I am always a bit anxious with doctor appointments. I think that there is just that factor of the unknown that makes people worry. 
0.261900	I don't. I feel relaxed and I don't care. They are people just like me, and if they are trying to do their best for me, I don't have to worry about what is going on.
0.285700	I'm generally not a person that worries much about anything. Unless, I am in a great deal of pain or agony, I'm confident that there's nothing seriously wrong with me. Now, if there's every an instance where I'm experiencing great pain and the doctor can't figure out why, then that would make me anxious.
0.428600	When I am waiting to be told what is wrong, because you are left in a room alone for a decent amount of time. Your mind seems to wonder off and start thinking of everything that could be wrong. 
0.142900	usually I am most anxious or worried when I have to visit the doctors office for my children. I never want to see my children in pain and taking them to the doctor with the thought that they may need a surgery or another inverention is what worries me. I also want to make sure I am making the best deicions for my child's health - it is a big responsibility to have someone else's health in your hands when they cannot make decisions for themselves yet.
0.928600	I am always worried that something will be very wrong and I don't like being touched by strangers. I also worry that I will need to get my blood drawn and needles scare me
0.571400	I used to be worried about the cost most of all, but I now have stable finances and appropriate insurance so that is less of a worry.  I worry that they'll tell me something scary about my health, like needing surgery or having a chronic uncurable condition.  I've needed surgery that had me on bed rest for a week and it wasn't pleasant.
0.142900	I would feel most anxious about any test results I may be getting back.  I would also be a little anxious about the potential that something may be very wrong and I would need an extended hospital stay.
0.666700	What makes me feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is getting the results back from lab work. I am not the most healthy person so I am somewhat worried that I may have some illness that is undetectable that can be found in blood work or x-rays. I dread the idea that I may have some kind of serious illness and that it will affect my life significantly. 
0.595200	I experience this as many times. When I want to saw the doctor, at that time he come to office too late or leave. This behavior is the worst behavior of the Doctor's attitude. This is very wrong action. 
0.761900	Being able to adequately explain my concerns, anticipating the response of the doctor, being ignored or talked down to, the actual physical exam also makes me anxious because I don't like being touched.
0.476200	What makes me feel most anxious is if they discover something that is wrong with me that I do not expect in the least. I am a very healthy person, but it would be extremely upsetting if something like that came up.
0.500000	I just hope he doesn't come to me with bad news with something wrong. I am most fearful of cancer which can strike anyone without warning, and causes emotional harm for the whole family.
0.476200	Anything can go wrong at any time. I'm in good health, but you never know. There is always this little bit of anxiousness that something could be wrong or something in the future. 
0.881000	When I visit a doctors office the thing that makes me the most anxious is worrying about getting a shot.  For my entire life, I have absolutely been terrified of needles and getting shots.  Each time I go to a doctors office this thought and idea continuously races through my mind and I find myself often sweating and shaking out of nervousness for no reason.  Also when I visit a doctors office, I worry about how much the visit is going to cost and what is actually wrong with me .
1.000000	i am an anxious nervous sort of person. no matter what it is. grocery shopping. walking down the street, appointments. im always scared and on guard. 
0.619000	I sometimes feel like I am being judged by my doctor. Also, I am anxious that I will be misdiagnosed again. 
0.309500	I really can't think of anything, other that coming in one day and finding out a have a NEW doctor that I wasn't informed of beforehand, especially after having gotten used to my current one.
0.357100	The thing that worries the most is if my insurance is going to cover things that I might need to do. This bothers me more than any kind of procedure that I can imagine getting.
0.952400	I worry that I will be criticized, belittled, or that they will find something significantly wrong with me, such as cancer.
0.690500	"I get nervous by the ""formality"" of the setting. Sometimes the setting is too clinical and not very personable. I worry about these things and not about the outcome of the visit."
0.452400	Normally, I'm pretty healthy. I think the waiting time both in the lobby and in the examination room just gives the mind enough time to overthink things and think the doctor's going to be coming back with bad news. There's just a sense of uncertainty about what might pop up.
0.357100	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is really that it's just a one on one meeting with someone that I don't know very well, and that the things we talk about are on a very personal level.
0.928600	I am worried about what is causing all my pain and problems. Add to that how long it is taking to find out it makes me more worried each time I go
0.761900	I am always anxious because unless I am going to see the doctor for a specific problem I believe if they are looking for something they will certainly find something.  
0.309500	I don't have much anxiety or unease that I can think of.  I suppose that occasionally I am worried about what sort of diagnosis might be involved and that there could be some sort of serious condition
0.333300	I don't like people having to touch me as they are strangers and I feel my space is being violated. Also, I do not enjoy going to doctors.  I do it because I need to so I can be healthy.
0.214300	That my blood pressure will be high when I'm getting it checked there. I take a couple of prescriptions for that and it's always lower when I test it at home vs. what the number are in the doctor's office.
0.761900	I'm always anxious that I will get some bad news about my health, especially if its something I don't see coming. I enjoy being active and feeling healthy. I wouldn't want anything to jeopardize that or to have a long/lasting effect on my family. I don't want to be a burden to anyone. However, I also would want to catch any problems as soon as possible to hopefully battle whatever it is that I have going on.
0.809500	I don't like waiting to see the doctor, and I don't like the small talk aspect of doctors in their offices. I just want a diagnosis, prescription, and to get out. I respect the medical profession but being in a waiting room full of sick people really makes me not want to go to the doctor at all. 
0.285700	Iâm just really scared of getting hurt like receiving a shot. Iâm also scared of hearing results such as me having a bad disease or something really scary happening
0.476200	That the doctor will not believe me when I describe my symptoms - or that he will argue with me about how I feel.  
0.809500	Obviously that there is a serious condition. I rarely go to the doctor, so if I'm there I am likely in a lot of pain and in a state of worry. So while I am there I am thinking about what could possibly be wrong.
0.619000	What makes me most anxious is the thought that he may give me bad news.  I particularly don't like to wait for results from test because I start to worry the results might be bad. 
0.785700	I worry that I will receive random and unexpected bad news regarding an unavoidable health problem. Additionally, even though I am a healthy weight, exercise, and otherwise take care of myself, I expect without reason to be scolded for doing something wrong health-wise.
0.785700	I think it is the closeness and intimacy in a stranger looking at and examining my body, as well as not knowing what is wrong or what could be wrong with me.
0.547600	The most anxious or worried that I feel when visiting the doctors office is if I am feeling symptoms that might indicate something serious. I have a tendency to think the worst of situations and I worry that I would be facing something serious.
0.142900	That I'm told there is something wrong with me then I will feel anxious.  I just hope there is no bad news whenever I go to the doctor.  Hoping not to hear anything but good news that all is well or will get better. 
0.357100	I worry most that the treatment will be invasive, or there will be a lot of negative side effects for any medication required.
0.642900	I am worried that my weight will be too high or my blood pressure will be elevated. I am usually only at the doctor if there is something actually wrong with me and this in itself brings me lots of anxiety. I wonder if they will know how to help me and I also wonder if it is something that is deadly or long-term. 
0.690500	I feel the most anxious about having my body examined. I am okay with getting shots I need or having blood drawn, but the thought of having a stranger touching and looking at my body makes me uncomfortable and anxious.
0.285700	I absolutely hate going to the doctor.  I hate the way the office smells and have since I was a child.
0.571400	sometimes things dont go well and you have to do things to make sure that they go well and this is sometimes stressful
0.500000	I am always worried that I will have a serious illness or disease that is incurable. These are not the fault of the doctor but my own fears. I think especially because of my family's past that I have a higher chance to get cancer.
0.690500	I feel most anxious and worried about receiving bad news or news that means high costs or extended time away from work.  I am also nervous about potential uncomfortable tests and procedures.  Sometimes I think that my doctor is silently judging me for my appearance or other physical quality/attribute.
0.190500	i don't like being weighed so i feel somewhat anxious about getting on a scale in the doctors' office.
0.738100	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when seeing a doctor is which problem I should choose to bring up, as he says I can only bring one up during a visit. So, it causes me a lot of stress trying to figure out which problem is more pressing. I am stressed to go and see him, because I feel like he doesn't care to help me feel better. 
0.571400	I usually present with a specific problem.  Feeling somewhat anxious about a new problem is a normal response.
0.357100	If I am having an issue that I am not sure about or pains that I do not have all the time.  i do worry about terminal diseases and things of that nature.  If you are experiencing things that you donât know anything about it can be a highly tense situation.
0.666700	When visiting a doctors office it's usually due to an illness or something else that is wrong with me so it makes me nervous while I'm there. I'm nervous what could be wrong and the treatment that will be provided and I'm also nervous that hopefully the doctor is correct.
0.238100	I always feel anxious at the doctors office because I'm scared of catching someone elses sickness, or getting bad news.
0.595200	Any time I get routine checkups or blood tests, I start worrying that they will find something wrong with me.
0.571400	I am nervous about getting sick or finding out that I have something wrong with me. Overall though, I am anxious about the office's cleanliness. 
0.285700	I feel a little anxious to know if I have good news or bad news. Obviously I am hoping for some good news, but it doesn't always turn out that way.
0.190500	That theyâre going to find something that means I have a bad disease or issue. Iâll need more medication or surgery. 
0.404800	The idea that I'm going to have to pay for it, or will need to buy medication, or will have to put up with a serious amount of tests.
0.642900	I think I'm afarid of the what if? What if they think I have something wrong that I do not and then they mess me up for life with meds or surgery I do not need, I have seen to make people abdicated to pills to need to be that way. Plus the cost and hassle makes me out of sorts.  
0.285700	I just generally feel this way whenever I am out and about, doing things. I am a bit shy so I get nervous when I'm interacting with a lot of people.
0.523800	I don't know why I get nervous when I go there, but I do; I guess I'm afraid of the bad news they might give me; but I'm not afraid of the doctor at all. I am very relaxed when i am there 
0.428600	Mostly what upsets me is the fear of the unknown. I rarely go to the doctor because I have a good understanding of the human body and various illnesses/injuries. So when I do go, it's because I either need a treatment I don't have access to or I have a condition that I cannot quantify, which is unnerving to me. 
0.500000	I am always fearful that the doctor will find some unforeseen, unusual issue of which I was not aware. I also wonder what my lungs sound like considering that although I quit smoking 5 years ago, I smoked for four decades previously.
0.595200	A lot of times my concerns and symptoms are dismissed, and I am rushed out of the office.  It feels like my doctor is only there to put out fires and deal with absolute emergencies.  With smaller issues/pains that could potentially develop into something worse, she doesn't have the energy to investigate or deal with them.  The same attitude is prevalent with other doctors I've seen.
0.738100	I worry they will find something bad.  I don't like to hear negative things about my heath.  I worry I will have to take more medication and I don't react well to medications.
0.761900	I don't care for going into doctor's offices or hospitals.  It makes me nervous due to the fact that I could come in contact with germs and illness.  I also dislike people poking and prodding me.  I don't care for testing they do either.
0.690500	I worry that anything I bring up in regards to my health will not be paid attention to because of my history of anxiety and will be written off as psychosomatic or as a result of my anxiety. I get anxious that they will brush things off and give me the standard lines about relaxing more, destressing, etc. I also feel anxious that they will think I'm crazy. 
0.285700	When visiting the doctor's office, I am most likely to feel anxious or worried about someone there making me sick.  I absolutely hate to be in small areas full of sick people.  If I could isolate myself in a little personal bubble/pod while in the waiting room, I would certainly not mind the doctor adding a few bucks to his rate to cover it.  Why don't you invent that and throw me a few bucks?
0.547600	I always worry about the what if. What if something is wrong what do we do if something is wrong. Sometimes I think too much into something and that just makes me worry.
0.761900	i worry that something is wrong withe me. i worry that they wont know how to help me. i worry that they will tell me bad news. i worry that they will tell me i am overweight and need to lose weight. I cant go to the doctor without being told that i am overweight.
0.571400	When I am examined for anything the thing that makes me the most anxious is the possible results, regardless of the likelihood of a poor outcome.
0.428600	The fact that you never know if the doctor is going to find something that is terribly wrong with you or not.
0.595200	Whenever I see the doctor, I get anxious as I always have the thought in the back of my mind, that I might have a serious, incurable illness.  It is one of those things that I can't let go, and worries me.
0.452400	I don't feel too worried or anxious when I visit the doctor. I only get annoyed every time my weight is brought up. I also don't like it when they have to draw blood or if I have to pee in a cup.
0.142900	I am worried that I am just another customer and that I am the only one who truly cares. I wish medicine was a much smaller thing and that doctors practiced more independently. 
0.214300	Fear of the unknown. He might find something wrong that I don't want to know or hear about. I usually wait as long as possible before going to the doctor. We don't have a lot of money so I wait until the problems pile up and I have no other choice but to go. 
0.857100	When I am at a doctors office I am worried because I don't know what will happen. They do not converse very well about the procedures they are following. They may perform these procedures every day and seem to forget that not everyone knows what the procedure they are doing entails.
0.476200	Walking into the doctor, you have no idea what is going on with your body. Sometimes you might need to do further study and look deeper into the body to see if there is anything wrong. There is always uncertainty if you go into the office with some kind of symptom that seems normal, but it could be worst than you thought.
0.285700	I just am not the kind that likes a lot of waiting. I think that it should be a quick and easy check up that comes in the office.
0.142900	I don't have at issue at all.  The only thing I don't like is like mammogram or pep smears that it could hurt.  Also fasting blood work could get me hungry.  Other than that I don't have any worry or fear.
0.547600	I don't like being weighed and evaluated by the medical assistant. I would rather not see so many people when getting care.
0.142900	the cost or chance some of my blood work would come back showing a positive result for some unforeseen disease.
0.357100	I think what makes me feel the most nervous is learning that there might be something wrong with me that I did not know about before even going to the doctor in the first place.
0.690500	Uncertainty is the key to promote anxiety in my opinion. During the visit, I am worried when I meet with the PCP to discuss the outcome of the examination. The main reason is the uncertainty about the result. What if something really bad happens? What is my current health condition? I cannot control my feeling in the uncertain condition.
0.285700	I feel one never knows what may crop up, but I really don't get worried or anxious about Dr's appointments.  Perhaps a little uncomfortable because I find Dr's appointments are not really enjoyable
0.595200	You're afraid of finding out answers in case they might be bad. You're afraid of the cost. You're afraid of being embarrassed. You're afraid of being vulnerable. You're not sure what's going to happen, and there's a possibility of bad news, so you immediately only focus on the negative.
0.381000	I am always concerned about discovering I have a sickness, or being lied to by my doctor in some way
0.190500	What usually concerns me most is how much it is going to cost. Though I have insurance the bill can sometimes still be considerable.
0.285700	If I am going to see the doctor, I may be anxious or worried that they will find a problem that could be serious.
0.881000	I am concerned that I am broken that there is something wrong with my body that is not fixable or is not responding to treatment. This anxiety resonates with me every single day, but is at its highest when I am getting an exam at the doctor's office.
0.547600	I feel anxious or worried he is going to diagnose me with some untreatable illness that I will have for my entire lifetime. He also always tells me to quit smoking which sucks but is also necessary for my health.
0.381000	When I don't know if I've collected enough symptoms through tracking to be able to get a diagnosis. A diagnosis is hard to get, but once you have one, you can make a plan and do something about the problem. I hate knowing something's wrong but not being able to get help for it, and every time I go to the doctor with a problem, I'm afraid it's going to happen again.
0.619000	If I am going to the doctor for a health problem I can get a little anxious nervous and scared. I have a habit of always fearing the worst.
0.142900	What makes me anxious when going to the doctor is maybe finding out something that is worse then what i thought
1.000000	I am afraid and worried when I have blood work done because  I always think they are going to find something wrong with me. Also, I am afraid they are going to change the dosage of the medicine I am taking for my auto-immune disease because they would rather go by the lab work then how I feel. 
0.666700	I get worried that the doctor will find something is seriously wrong with me and I'll be blindsided by the diagnosis. I once had a regular checkup with my OB GYN where my doctor suspected I had a lump and referred me for a mammogram. This was alarming as I had no idea that would be an issue. I was also in my 20s. The mammogram showed that I was fine. But now I worry about it happening again.
0.642900	Not sure if they know what they're doing. Doctors seem to be really good at Emergency Care, and invasive procedures but a lot of the rest of the care they give is hit and miss or just plain wrong.
0.333300	I do not feel anxious at all when visiting a doctors office for normal reasons. They tend to be good at diagnosing and treating conventional illnesses. I just do not trust them with anything beyond that really. The only other reason I may be anxious is if it is flu season. The last two times I have had the flu, I caught it at the doctors office seeking treatment for something else. 
0.642900	That I could potentially find something wrong with my body or something that's out of sync, whether it be blood pressure or even my weight. I feel like if something could go wrong, even a small chance, it's something that I'll think about.
0.976200	I normally have a lot of anxiety when seeing a doctor not necessarily because I am worried the doctor will not be good enough, but because I am afraid about the uncertainty caused by not knowing what is wrong with me since I am at the doctor to find out what it is. I may find out that it is something really bad so I am scared of that. I am also afraid that the tests that need to be done will cause me pain or discomfort, and I am especially scared of needles.
0.285700	I am worried that the doctor might find a problem that has persisted for a while but has been unknown to me because there were no symptoms. I worry that the problem could be expensive to treat, or that it might be debilitating. I am not worried about talking to the doctor. In fact, I'd rather know about a problem sooner than later.
0.500000	I think it is just being anxious about your overall health. You do not want anything to be wrong, so you keep thinking about the worst case scenarios while waiting at the doctor's office and you can not get the thoughts out of your head.
0.690500	I worry about judgement of my ability to express my concern adequately. I have encountered many impatient doctors. I often remember questions that I wanted to ask after I leave the appointment.
0.619000	I'm typically at the doctor's office when I'm not feeling well or something is wrong, so I feel anxious or worried about what the diagnosis or problem will be.  Depending on the issue I might also feel worried or anxious about the potential testing or treatment (if it might be painful, etc).
0.309500	That they will find something wrong with my health. I am also still a liittle nervous about injections/vaccinations. The older I get, the more anxiety I have about that
0.571400	Usually if I am seeing a doctor it is because something is wrong.  I am a natural worrier and tend to worry that it is the worst case scenario.  Even though I usually know deep down it's not the worst case scenario, I feel tense until the doctor tells me that.
0.142900	If I don't know what is happening to my body. When the symptoms are unknown and I am anxious to find out what is wrong. Only happened to me twice. I think it is the unknown that rattles people.

0.142900	Nothing, I've never felt discomfort or anxious when going to the doctor. Worrying about something I can't change is pointless and just adds further stress to my body so I keep myself calm and take the punches as they come.
0.428600	Feeling anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office can be caused by apprehension. The possibility of sick people in the waiting room -- passing along their own illness is always a concern.

0.404800	That my weight has gone up, that my doctor will judge me, that there will be some sort of bad news. 
0.214300	Contracting the flu or another airborne pathogen while waiting in the waiting room. Other than that, not much. Most of our visits are well checks where we have no urgent medical treatment needs. So, we spend most of our time making sure our hands are washed and cleaned and use both face masks for protection.
0.404800	I hate social interaction the most. I don't care about the results, because I know that I'm in good shape and doing everything correctly.
0.976200	I feel like the doctor will tell me something bad, something that will effect my life or the way I lead my life. I am fearful of all possible outcomes. I worry about these things that may hurt my family if I am sick.
0.142900	Just hearing some bad news but I know they are just doing their job at the end of the day, so whatever they do is understandable.
0.619000	I would feel anxious or worried about a doctors visit if I had a strange pain or feeling in my body that I haven't had before. Not knowing what could be the cause of the pain or illness would make me worried about what the diagnosis could be. I would slightly doubt the doctor fully understands what I am feeling and if the treatment would be the correct procedure for me. I would not feel anxious or worried if I was just going in for a regular checkup or follow up. Only when I am experiencing something I have never experienced is when I would start to worry.
0.571400	I hate small talk with people I don't know that well. Hate answering the same questions over and over, especially ones I don't think are their business or that I know how they are going to respond and I also know I am not going to change my behavior. 
0.452400	The thing that makes me feel most anxious is the thought that something might be wrong with me.  It has nothing to do with my doctor or how he performs checkups or physicals.
0.785700	Having insurance issues that make payment difficult is one of my biggest anxiety factors. I also have a hypochondriac streak and expect terrible news about my health.
0.571400	I am always worried when I see the doctor because I always feel like they are going to tell me something is really wrong with me. For the longest I thought I wa healthy now every time I go they find something new about me. I donât know if it is they want more money from me or they are really trying to help me.
0.214300	I just don't like not knowing what's wrong.  Sometimes when I go to the dr I jump to the worst possible scenario of what my ailment could be and probably over stress about something that I don't need to stress out about.
0.714300	Embarrassment mostly. I have GAD and every unknown situation feels me with dread. Pelvic exams are especially uncomfortable.
0.142900	Well now adays I am mainly anxious that the costs of the visit will out weigh the need to go in the first place, I am a woman so I am technically now a pre existing condition.
0.666700	"After having blood work, I know my cholesterol is high and I know that he is going to ""lecture"" me about my eating habits which makes me very uncomfortable, he wants me to bring it down naturally."
0.571400	I feel like I am not going to be able to clearly explain how I am feeling to her. I don't want he to think I am over exaggeration anything so I kind of hold back but then I feel she won't really understand what I am dealing with.

0.285700	When I not sure what I will face with the doctor. I felt anxious. If I have to stay there for too long or have a lot of exams, I feel nervous of course.
0.190500	I think the most obvious answer is that nobody wants to hear something is wrong with them.  I have an unnatural fear of death anyways.  I do not have a regular physician because I am almost never sick.  So on occasion, when I have been sick or something has been wrong that I felt that I needed to go the doctor, I have worried that I would hear bad news.  The mind tends to go to worse case scenario.  I go to get a yearly mammogram and a yearly pap smear-neither of which is a pleasant experience just for the fact that it leaves me exposed. So that is enough to cause anxiety but add to that the possibility that they will find something wrong is always enough to cause worry.
0.500000	Not knowing what the problem is that you are seeing the doctor for.  SOmetimes small little pains can lead to big problems.  That will definitely cause me to be anxious and worried.
0.500000	The thought of finding out that something is worse than i thought. Especially during the cancer screening. I also worry when i am actually hurt because i know now that they are less likely to prescribe useful medication because of the opium epidemic. A cough that used to get prescribed cough medicine now gets crazy lung numbing pills that are newish to the market. not a fan. I worry about anything they may find, and how i will pay for all of it. 
0.785700	I struggle with my weight and it makes me uncomfortable when at the doctors, also I'm always worried that there is the possibility that they will find something truly wrong and expensive.
0.714300	There is always sense of anxiety when you go the doctor. You might feel healthy and fine, and then the doctor  might find something. It happened to me a few times, when I went to the doctor. So, there always there sense of uneasiness. Just my 2 cents. 
0.285700	I simply get nervous thinking something will be wrong with me which is seriously life threatening. Sometimes I get like this, but it isn't often. My anxiousness subsides once I see the doctor. 
0.571400	I'm a very introverted person.  I prefer to keep to myself and am usually comfortable talking with anyone outside my immediate family about health issues or mental health issues.  As such, even though I'm fairly familiar with my primary care physician, it still makes me a bit uncomfortable and a bit nervous, or anxious.
0.642900	I think I always think the worst when I go, I act as if I am going to walk in and they're going to tell me I have some deadly disease. I usually feel like when I leave I feel better automatically no matter what is wrong just because I find out there is nothing wrong with me (that can be long term bad).
0.142900	The most anxious I feel is the wait for the Doctor. I understand that they are busy, but when I sit around waiting long past appointment times I feel like they do not value my time in the same sense that I value theirs by being on time.
0.333300	Nothing really makes me all that anxious. Sometimes I dont like talking about my mental health issues like anxiety or depression because that just sucks. 
0.881000	I get anxious and worried every time I visit the doctor. I'm not quite sure what it is to be exact of the reason that I'm so afraid, but I think that it has a lot to do with me being afraid that something is going to go wrong. When I'm worried, my blood pressure usually shoots up from me worrying a lot. I feel so much dread when going to the doctor. 
0.785700	I am always concerned that there is some underlying issue that I am not aware of, and am fearful that I will get test results that reflect this. Also I am not a fan of being touched even in normal circumstances so that is stressful for me.
0.785700	I never visit the doctor for a good reason, i'e either sick or injured so worrying about the worst case is human nature. Plus the whole thing is uncomfortable, with the doctor feeling up your member, them taking your pee, the waiting room, and paying for it all.  
0.857100	I try to take good care of myself, but I know I don't always make the best choices. And I worry and have anxiety all the time anyways.   So it's just worse when I need to visit a doctor. I always think and worthy about the worst possible scenarios.

0.714300	I am worried that something will be wrong with me or that I will need to undergo expensive treatment.

0.381000	While being pregnant, I always worried about the doctor appts. Is the baby ok? Will the heartbeat sound strong? Are there complications.  I have found that specifically with this circumstance, I was very anxious.
0.785700	I am mostly worried that my care will not be effective or that I don't receive the best care locally. I travel two hours away to a large city for specialized care that is muck better
0.452400	I sometimes feel a little anxious about going to the doctorâs office because my family has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Although I try to eat better and exercise regularly, I sometimes feel that I am going to get bad news from my physician. There are so many factors right now in regards to eating habits, physical fitness, and stress that may easily change your health outcomes. I sometimes associate doctorâs visits with something going wrong in your life. I always expect the worst and think that something bad is going to happen to me and that I need to change something.   
1.000000	"When visiting the doctor's office, my biggest worry is that they will ""find something seriously wrong.""  I don't think that is an uncommon fear, and maybe not even irrational, but it does occur."
0.547600	I am usually worried that something will hurt. I also donât like that Iâm usually in some form of undress. It makes me uncomfortable.

If I had to think of something that makes me anxious, it's the thought of what the visit to the office might cost me, and how much I will have to pay out of pocket since I don't have insurance. Other than that, I don't get nervous when I go to the doctor.

0.404800	I sometimes worry that there might be something major wrong with me. Like I fear the worst sometimes like if I would to be diagnosed with cancer or something life threatening. 
0.666700	I feel most afraid that the doctor will gloss over what I am saying and not try to understand. I then cannot be reassured by anything said.
0.666700	The fact that I may find out bad news about my health makes me feel worried. For example, my last visit was a pap smear. A few days later, my doctor emailed me saying that they have to do my pap smear over because there were not enough cells to test.
0.428600	I always worry that they will find something that is going to be a problem in my life.  I think I go in hoping for the best and expecting the worse.  But so far so good, nothing wrong with me yet.(knock on wood)
0.238100	Wondering how much the payment will be. Wondering what I might need to solve my issues. Wondering if I could get help for my migraines or would I be stuck with them.
0.476200	Just learning something new about my health, especially if it's something negative. But haven't really experienced that so it makes me worry that one day something might come up unexpectedly.

0.142900	I have a severe social anxiety problem, so being out in a public place makes me anxious, but there's nothing about the doctor's office in particular that's upsetting for me. I usually feel more calm once I'm in the examining room than I feel before I go because I know I'll be taken care of.
0.619000	I think when an exam takes place you are always worried about the doctor finding something serious. You never want to hear you have cancer or something  along those lines.

0.500000	The thing that makes me the most anxious is that they will diagnose me with something worse than what I expect.  Also, I sometimes worry they will notice something irregular that I didn't notice on my own, such as a tumor or heart conditions like high blood pressure.
0.142900	If I have something wrong with me and I can't pinpoint exactly what it is I get a little bit worried, since it might be something serious.  I always get restless when I'm waiting to hear the information that the doctor will tell me. 
1.000000	Well usually when I go its cause theres something wrong with me thats causing a pretty bad ailment and so I already go into it expecting something bad. I can be a bit of a hypochondriac and that may play on my experience a little bit. But then its also because a lot of the procedures they must do to check you out, are uncomfortable or downright painful. And sometimes, doctors tell you that there is something they found that concerns you and they get you super worried, when they shouldnt say anything until test results come back. Many times I have had them distress me thinking I had an issue such as an enlarged/inflamed liver, just to find out theres absolutely nothing wrong with my liver. The days of stress from worrying waiting for those results is unnecessary. 
0.523800	"One incident stands out from my 67 years - my current physician said ""we"" needed to check my heart again. Turns out I had a murmur. Subsequent tests revealed a mitral valve problem, which will be corrected via robotic surgery. That was scary for me and still is as the surgery has not been scheduled. Generally, I am somewhat apprehensive concerning new complaints (e.g, a mole). Part of my anxiety is related to having seen family members suffer with various diseases. For example, my father died of cancer at age 40 (I was 11). My mind tends to go to ""cancer"" when I have an otherwise unexplained pain. Generally, however, I find the typical examination to be quite routine and not anxiety inducing (except in the circumstances i have outlined above)."
0.833300	When visiting the doctor's office, I am afraid that I may get some news that could be very bad. I am also afraid that I may have not been following the doctor's orders as I should and he may be upset with me. I am also afraid of the costs that may be incurred.  I am also afraid of needles so the thought of a shot is upsetting. 
0.619000	I feel concerned and worried that I might receive bad news when I go to to the doctor. I feel this way even when I have no reason to feel this way.
0.285700	If the doctor found something strange or maligns after the tests.  If I have a chronic condition that affects my entire life. 
0.547600	Mostly just wondering if theres anything wrong with you that you don't know about, and the possibility of it being something dangerous like cancer. Everyone has a fear of uncertainty that makes them uncomfortable and nervous.
0.857100	I worry that the cancer in my eye is active again.  I worry that the doctor is going to tell me that i need my eye out.  I worry that the cancer will spread...even though it was small and i had radiation treatment to hopefully correct it. I worry that my family will fall apart if something re-occurs in my body.  I wonder that the doctor will tell me that I need more treatment and that it's not over
0.619000	im afraid they will tell me something bad or tell me that im unhealthy because of my weight or vitals
0.666700	I worry about the cost and about having a doctor that might not seem to care about me. If I go see a doctor, I want them to wholly focus on my health when I'm there, and I worry they won't do that.
0.142900	Getting blood work because my veins are not good. I hate that I may get stuck 4 or more times in order to get blood done. 
0.714300	Well, seeing a new doctor is unnerving. Especially if you've ever had a bad experience with a doctor. Also, feeling like your needs may not be met or like there is something unexpectedly wrong with you makes you feel anxious or worried. 
0.547600	Getting an uncertain or negative diagnoses would cause worry or anxiety. For myself or a loved one. THe feelings are the same
0.285700	sometimes having ot ask for my anti depressant medicine to be refilled gives me a little anxiety because I kinda still feel ashamed and wnoder if they really want to fill it for me.
0.523800	Well, I don't want any bad news. Also, I just feel like I want to get it over with. I feel as if I am very rushed.
0.142900	I usually am worried about the cost. Also I worry that my illness or pain might be something worse that will cost more to treat. 
0.333300	I am nervous about my weight and what they will say to tell me to lose it.  I get anxious that I will be judged.  I hate putting on a thin gown and the office always seems cold.  I hate the paper and waiting an undisclosed amount of time.
0.666700	Worst part is the waiting room, where I come up with worst case scenarios in my mind about all the horrible things that arenât wrong, but they could be. Basically my own mind is why Iâm anxious and worried, nothing more.
0.761900	I feel anxious when I got to the doctor because sometimes im not sure what they will tell me. I get worried because they could tell me im dying and there is nothing that they can do about it and that its too far gone, or they could misdiagnose me and then I could die from getting treatment that I dont even need. 
0.881000	Expenses are a big part of it, but I also don't feel very thrilled about finding out what may be wrong with me either.  Plus, my injury made me feel very useless, I couldn't work or do a lot of other things and those feelings sort of colored all of the experiences that I had at the time if that makes any sense.
0.333300	that i cant afford it or im going to have something keeping me off work too long. the wait also makes me anxious.
0.714300	If I have an unexpected pain or problem, then i feel worried. I feel that although they can help at times, its up to God to heal.
0.738100	"I always think there's some random disease they will tell me i have. Im not sure why. I guess its the whole ""not knowing"" thing. "
0.381000	because i am not sure if i will ever get better an i tell the dr iwnt to get better but he says its a long journey
0.357100	I never know what is going to be said so I always have some level of anxiety with doctors visits. I also have had a few bad experiences. 
0.928600	I am anxious that the doctor visit will end up costing a lot of money. Sometimes I think that ignorance is bliss and I would rather not know if something is wrong. If you look hard enough something will always be less than perfect.
0.547600	i'm always anxious about results and i hate having to wait. the wait always makes me worry more and i'm the type of person that usually thinks the worst when something comes up
0.714300	The most worrying experience would be getting bad news or news about a problem that will be hard to fix. Also, getting news that will include discomfort or inconvenience.
0.714300	I always feel anxious about visiting the doctor. I worry about my test results from my last visit. I worry that I will get better news about my health. 
0.261900	There's always a bit of worry that something is wrong that I didn't notice. I just like to be fully prepared.
0.261900	Most of the time it is the wait to see the doctor.  The sitting to get back into the office then the waiting once I do get into the examining room.  I worry that something new may be needed that will cause an extra charge. So all in all I would say waiting and money.
0.523800	What makes me feel most anxious is not know if something serious is wrong. Also, there are worries about medical coverage and insurance. Costs of medical treatment also make me anxious.
0.571400	I am worried since I am getting older that something will go wrong. As you age, it's sure that something won't work like it used to.  I want to make sure that I am examined thoroughly and that the doctor spends time doing the appropriate tests.
0.690500	I hate stepping on the scale and I hate to be partially naked in front of people I don't know. I'm also always a little nervous that the small thing I mention just in case, could turn out to be something big and a bad diagnosis. 
0.500000	I am most anxious or worried about that  there is something unexpected that I  didn't think could be a concern.  I would be worried that there would be many tests investigate further.
0.619000	The thing that makes me the most anxious is when a doctor does not talk much when they dont act like they care.  When a doctor seems like he is having a bad day can make me anxious 
0.333300	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office for something that is not routine (outside of my regular appointments). It is the unknown that I worry about.
0.666700	I don't go to the doctor unless I really have to. It's expensive. So because I can't go for check ups when I need to, I always worry that something major could be wrong.
0.142900	The thing that always gets me going is the blood pressure cuff.  It gets really tight around my arm, and I've always hated that.  But actually seeing the doctor is usually pleasant and problem-free. 
0.761900	The thing that really bothers me about going to the doctor is that he will order another MRI on my back again. I had a frightening extreme case of claustraphobia one time a year ago in a very small MRI machine and I am afraid that I will experience that again.
0.571400	I am afraid they will discover something about my health that will be negative, about which I was previously unaware.  Sometimes, I worry they will suggest preventative measures such as immunizations, with which I am not 100% comfortable.  However, in my experience, most doctors I have encountered are quite accommodating to different approaches (mine is more wholistic) to health, as long as they are working/workable.
0.571400	There is always the possibility of finding out something is really wrong or that something is going to be extremity difficult to treat. 
0.714300	When I visit a doctor's office I feel most worried when his or her expression is worried and when he or she can't explain exactly what is going on.
0.357100	I am a very reserved person and being examined, even by someone I trust, feels somewhat invading.  I also am thinking about whether the exam will produce any negative findings such as high blood pressure or less than favorable results with any bloodwork that has been done.  I go in trying to relax and talking to myself in a soothing way but it usually just makes me more tense.  
0.166700	Mostly about pain.  If I know that a shot or some test like bloodwork is required, I do not like it.  It's not enough to make me avoid them but it does add to my slight worry.  
0.142900	I am always completely relaxed when I go to visit my doctor's office. He is very friendly and his staff always puts me at ease.
0.619000	"Anxiety is two-pronged, in this case: first, that the doctor may ""find something"" in my results, and second, the fact that he or she might not actually be correct about those findings. Doctors, again, are only human, and prone to mistakes or oversights. This makes all of their claims at least somewhat suspect. "
0.381000	I am generally not too anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because of the strong relationship I have with my physician. What would make me most anxious is if I'm seeing the doctor for an ongoing illness that is severe and am dreading a diagnosis of a major disease/cancer. 
0.357100	I really don't care much anymore. I am 69, have lived a full life, and I fully expect my health to deteriorate and I am capable of accepting that. The only thing that makes me close to anxious about visiting the doctor are painful shots, but I can handle it. 
0.285700	It makes me feel worried that he tells me that I have some disease, that gives me a lot of pain if he told me that
0.857100	I really get anxious when I think about my labs coming out bad. The doctor always seems like it is my fault they are coming out bad even though I'm trying my hardest to improve my health.
0.523800	I GET ANXIOUS AND WORRIED ABOUT STUPID THINGS. MY JOB, MY FUTURE, MONEY, MY FUTURE RETIREMENT. BILLS
0.547600	I feel that a doctor is reacting to my symptoms but rarely cares to work on discovering what is causing it. They are more inclined to just hand me a prescription and send me on my way.
0.809500	When it's an issue that potentially requires more than a simple solution to it makes me feel concerned heavily thinking of what may be options or what could be the potential outcome of everything. There are times when I've become overly worrisome as to what could be happening to my health or whether or not these signs are going in line with what I may be thinking is the issue at hand. 
0.571400	"My doctor does my ""well woman"" exams. I don't think that any woman is entirely comfortable with that. My doctor has a good personal manner of dealing with people, though.  I think any time that I put on a gown with no back on it and nothing underneath, I am not going to be at my most confident."
0.619000	"I'm not talking about my primary physician. The NP that I use is awesome. I'm thinking about the orthopedic Doc that I see because of a broken arm. I've seen him for 2 years and I get butterflies in my tummy every time. He is so quick when he talks to me, doesn't listen to me and talks ""over"" me. I always go in worried about what he is going to say. "
0.785700	I'm afraid they're going to point out a medical problem that may be damaging to me. I'm unsure whether or not I can trust them to make the right diagnosis and prescribe what I need. 
0.904800	"I am always worried about how much the visit will end up costing. If my doctor recommends or requires lab tests or imaging, I often can't afford to pay the bill. I have ""good"" health insurance, but in the US ""good"" health insurance still isn't enough for many of us."
0.285700	I feel anxious most to find out my condition. I get nervous to see my results, more than how the doctor views me. 
0.809500	I fear that they are going to come back and go we just found something terribly wrong with you and... That or its we need to get you on this medication and its going to cost a bazillion dollars and you better take it or there is nothing I can do for you. Or lets run these other tests that I am pretty sure are unreleated but they will boost my bottom line so lets do these. To which I know I will have to seem like a butthead as I ask what specifically they need that test for and why. But of course I dont always trust the answer as again its for making money.
0.571400	Sometimes I get anxious over whether or not something is wrong with me, but mostly I get anxious because I have social anxiety disorder.
0.666700	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is not know what I may have, or what medication I have to take. I am also concerned with the fees I may have to pay.
0.333300	I am getting to an age where cancer becomes more prevalent and also because of family history. I am certain that i will receive the proper care and support from my health care provider and family, but it is still an unknown concern.
0.547600	I am often worried about whether I will be treated with respect, more than anything. Or that the doctor I see will dismiss whatever I am struggling with. I also struggle a little with blood draws-- I get incredibly faint. Sometimes I am nervous for my own health, but most of the time if I'm not seeing my primary care doctor, I'm just rolling the dice as to whether I'll get someone rude and disinterested or someone who's an actual professional.
0.142900	What makes me the most worried when visiting the doctors office is finding out if I have a heath related problem that is not good for me. 
0.904800	I'm usually most worried that I will receive some bad news. I've had a lot of health problems in the past and always feel like the worst possible scenario is going to come true.
0.190500	I am not usually worried when visiting the doctor's office, but I do get anxious waiting for test results. I hate the anticipation of having to wonder how my blood work is going to turn out, and if I have anything I need to be concerned with. My family has a large history of cancer, so I constantly worry about developing it. 
0.738100	Being told that something is severely wrong with me. I just had this happen recently when I went for a physical and ANS turned up positive (auto immune issue). I still have to go to another lab for a more detailed test and I've been putting it off since I kind of dread it, plus, it's is a hassle. I'm also always uneasy when I'm getting examined I don't have a specific reason, I just don't like it. I also hate getting undressed and having the whole staff in and out and you are sitting there naked in a paper gown. 
0.357100	I am comfortable with the exam and tests themselves. What makes me feel anxious is the results of any tests or exams. I guess you could say the unknown. 
0.690500	Overall I do not like doctors, and I have had bad experiences with uncaring doctors before and I do not want to repeat those situations again
0.714300	"The smell of a hospital/doctors office immediately gets me anxious. Moreso however, I almost expect them to say something is wrong (whether or not I have reason to think there is), and either ready injections or prescribe medications. It's primarily the thought of ""what if something is wrong"" and the outcome of it."
0.404800	I always have a little unease that they may find something that is not right. I have always had good health but you never know. 
0.285700	Being in good health and being able to maintain good health. Not wanting to have any issues with my blood work or health. 
0.904800	First of all if there will be something seriously wrong with me. Secondly, if there is something seriously wrong with me and the doctor doesn't realize it because she is rushing through so she can move on to the next patient. Just her getting the diagnoses wrong in general. 
0.190500	More often than not it is just my own imagination conjuring up the worst case scenarios for simple illnesses/problems. There is nothing about the actual visit that makes me anxious. I put it all on myself.
0.476200	When visiting the doctor's office, I am most worried about hearing bad news. The moments leading up to the visit itself is most nerve-racking. 
0.357100	I worry the doctor will not listen appropriately.  I worry that I'll be sitting alone for a long period of time waiting with only a paper on.  I worry that I haven't told the whole truth inadvertently.  
0.285700	The lobbies and the wait time, It takes way too long and people usually have their kids running around being obnoxious.
0.761900	It is always the waiting process, I feel very dizzy at hospitals because of the classic smell and the test results make me nervous even is they might be very good.
0.738100	I am greatly uncomfortable getting blood drawn. I immediately get very fearful of this once I step into the doctors office. It's uncomfortable to have someone touch you and to not have clothes on, etc.
0.238100	I worry a little that they might find something wrong. More than that I worry about having to make choices and advocate to get the treatment I want. 
0.976200	I usually visit the doctor's when something's wrong, so I am always anxious to find out what it is.  In addition, I fear nasty diagnoses, painful tests, or having to take some horrible drug.  I am very relieved every time I leave a health care building alive and ambulatory, as I feel that just going there presents some level of risk.  For me it's basically a choice between two evils-- the disease or the doctor.  
0.428600	I feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office because I'm fearful that something is wrong that I didn't know about and I'm scared how I will react
0.261900	I might get kind or nervous that i might have something really bad or dangerous to my body and my mind. Nothing else but that. 
0.285700	I don't usually feel this way. If I were to be anxious, it would be for a painful test or procedure. 
0.690500	Mostly, I'm worried about whatever situation made me visit the doctor. I don't visit the doctor unless I feel I have a serious problem that won't go away on its own and it will need some medical treatment. This is a very rare occurrance though.
0.642900	Always wonder if maybe he has some bad news after giving his examinations. Also going to a doctor is rare so i'm a bit nervous just interacting with him. If i go to the doctor it is generally because of some problem so i worry about that too.
0.452400	That I may or may not have a serious health confliction and in having one my doctor will look down on me and judge me. I am also afraid about how much everything will cost me in the end
0.357100	There is always a concern that the doctor will find something wrong with me that is serious.  He could discover something that turns out to be fatal.
0.523800	About finding out if I had some kind of eating disorder. Also if maybe the reason I was losing weight was that of something that could not be explained what so ever. Also, I was worried that if I had some kind of disorder, what would the woman that I love say about that?
0.381000	Health matters are always something to worry about. If we dont have our health then what do we have? My doctor was very open when alerting me to things I really need to worry about and address
0.690500	That the problem is much worse than what was anticipated.  In general medical office or hospitals give me anxiety, which compounds the issue of worry and anxiousness.
0.595200	I guess I just do not want to hear any negative information. Being in a doctors office feels a little cold and sterile. The environment encourages you to feel nervous and a little jittery. 
0.357100	Nothing typically does, I only answered the way I did regarding the few situations where I'm not sure what's wrong/how serious/etc. and I'm worried until the doctor reassures me/gets me the answers I need.
0.476200	"I don't feel overly anxious or worried, it's more like a small bit of ""what if I'm really sick"" or the doctor finds something abnormal. "
0.761900	I hate sitting in the waiting room. It is noisy, dirty, and loud with patients, kids and the TVs blasting. The waiting room is not conducive to people who have mental disorders. Then when I am answering the basic, every visit questions (like do I feel like hurting myself or others) I feel anxious that he is not listening or caring how I really feel unless I answer opposite of what I know the correct answer is. He barely looks at me when talking to me and has used another patient's name when writing my prescriptions. I don't trust him nor do I even like him. I want to go back to my other doctor.
0.142900	What makes me the most anxious is that I'm afraid my kids might catch a bug and get sick. Especially my middle son who has a PICC line so he can get sick very easily.
0.476200	What makes me feel most anxious about visiting the doctor's office is my fear of social interactions.
0.285700	Not getting the results back quickly is what makes me anxious when going to the doctor or if she can't give me an answer right away and has to rely on lab results instead.
0.857100	they will want to take my blood pressure and start treating me for something completely different from what i came there for. if you look for something you will find something and that is what they always do they think they are not doing their job if they don't give you treatment for something
0.571400	I worry mainly weather or not i have money to pay for the copay and then if my insurance is going to cover the rest. Insurance companies are so weird you never know what they are going to cover and finances are always my biggest stressor. 
0.523800	I just do not like visiting the doctor.  This brings worry to me and makes me anxious.  also, I am an anxious person anyway so I stay anxious.
0.142900	Nothing makes me anxious.  I am relaxed and calm.  I guess the only thing that makes me a bit anxious is sitting in the exam room wrapped in paper, but I'm fine once someone comes in.
0.452400	I'm worried about the doctor telling me something is wrong with me or I'm anxious about the doctor seeing my penis because I've never had a woman look at it in my entire adult life and I feel like The 40 Year Old Virgin all the time regarding my lack of proficiency with the opposite sex.
0.452400	I don't like sitting around in the waiting room not know the people there nor knowing what is going to happen in the doctors office. Uncertainty is not my strong point. I like to know what is going to happen. I understand that can't always be the case but I like to eliminate variables. 
0.309500	I am always worried about  visiting the doctor because you never know what the diagnosis might be it could be good or bad. 
0.309500	The only thing that I could think of is the fear that I may be sick. Other than that I'm not to fearful at the doctors
1.000000	I have a lot of things wrong with me and I am always afraid they will find something new or I will have to have more surgery which is very hard on me and my family
0.857100	I only get to die once an that is all my life can be.  Most people seem bad at accepting this let alone doing something to make it better.  I dislike the mind and the things we've done with them ever more.  Trying to believe someone is professional vested in myself getting an improved life seems beyond any idea of lies I could ever believe with any safety so I approach all medical professionals as near enemies.
0.571400	I worry sometimes that something serious could be wrong with me.  So, when going to get checked out I fear that they will find something bad, instead of thinking it could be something minor.
0.404800	I sometimes feel anxious or worried because you never know what your blood tests will show even though you may be feeling fine.
0.833300	I might be diagnosed with something horrible. I may need to have further examinations. I may be billed a very high amount.
0.761900	I'm a worrier, always have been, so seeing a doctor, even for a regular checkup, is nerve-wracking to me. I always think beforehand that the doctor will find something wrong or need to do a followup on something that's worrying to him. I tend to get myself worked up before doctor appointments, but that's just my personality.
0.976200	I can't stand to be touched. I have PTSD from being raped and I absolutely hate when they want to do a gyn exam. I am never made to feel like this is okay. When I went to the county clinic for birth control they told me I couldn't have birth control until I allowed them to examine me even though I have never had sex other than being raped and I was hysterically crying. I just wanted to get birth control because I'm getting married and want to be prepared but I ended up leaving with nothing and felt so ashamed.
0.714300	I hope they dont find something wrong with me I wasn't expecting.  I hope they have the answers I need
0.619000	My biggest fear is getting blood taken, so I'm always petrified I'm going to have to have it done. It causes me a great amount of stress. Sometimes I'm worried I might be diagnosed with something I had no idea I had.
0.714300	Not really that I have some condition to where I'm going to die. Sometimes when the doctor is the opposite sex as me it sucks and I hold things back. Some times when it is clear the doctor isn't listening to me I get upset. And most of the time they will judge you and assume things with out knowing for sure. 
0.285700	I hate everything to do with getting any medical thing done.  It makes me feel sick just being there.  The worst by far is getting blood drawn.  I hate it so much and it makes me extremely anxious.
0.857100	just not knowing the unknown of the whole situation. worrying about things that you might be wrong with you ect. 
0.547600	I get nervous around doctors. I am afraid they might find something really bad about me or it might cost a lot of money. I do not want to have to do any procedures or anything or they might be just judging me by my health, as a person not just a doctor. 
0.690500	What they are going to say. What they are going to find. The outlook. The coldness of the doctor. Having to explain things to the doctor. Them not listening. 
0.738100	I'll answer with another question.  How does one feel when they take their car to the mechanic.  its a similar type of anxiety to me.
0.571400	First, how long am I going to wait. I know doctors have little regard for their patients time as I tend to wait 30 minutes to two hours for them to arrive. If I am  sitting in a doctor's office, I have a health issue, so of course I'm worried that it could be serious.
0.738100	Being at the doctors makes me anxious and worried because I dont know what he's going to tell me.  I dont know if something seriously could be wrong with me or not.
0.428600	In general, what makes me the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is when I go for a specific reason. For example, STD testing or I have something I noticed that I want to seek attention for. These are the situations that cause the most anxiety because they aren't specifically routine, but conditional. While I do have an annual physical, I know what to expect based upon historical visits, but when something unexpected occurs it could be anything from minor to severe and you just aren't aware of it. What if that rash is something more? What if that mole isn't right and I need to be referred to a dermatologist? What if that cold wont go away as fast as it should? These are the kinds of situation that cause me anxiety.
0.595200	I think the thing that makes me most anxious is whether something is really wrong or not when I visit my PCP. If I have to wait for results, that is the worse for me. Not knowing is sometimes worrisome and makes me anxious because of the wait.
0.452400	I think like most other people I'm most worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me. I've been very lucky with my health, and would like to stay that way so whenever I go for a checkup there's always a little bit of anxiousness that I might have some disease or something that I don't know about.
0.285700	There is actually not much that scares me. I know I have a light heart condition and moderate CAPD. But I know also that I have quality healthcare and that this healthcare is available when I need it. I have regular check-ups and have cardiac training 3 times per week.
0.833300	The reason that I'm there is usually not a good reason. That in itself causes me to have anxiety, especially if I am not feeling well, or have a problem. Also, medical procedures make me uncomfortable. Examinations usually also get personal or require talking about matters that make me uncomfortable by their nature. I'm also concerned that they are going to find something terrible, or that I'm going to have to do something that requires a lot of suffering to improve the situation.
0.690500	WHEN THE DOCTOR DO THE PHYSICAL CHECK AND KEEP TESTING OR DOING THE SAME TEST AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT GET ME WORRY THAT THERE IS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY HEALTH. 
0.547600	I am anxious at the doctors office because i am sick and do not know what is going on with my body. I worry the treatment is going to be painful or uncomfortable and this brings my anxiety up. 
0.547600	I am always afraid that the doctor will find something very, very wrong. I used to watch a lot of hospital shows, where you go in for a hiccup and you end up dying. I have since stopped watching those and I have been less afraid.
0.333300	I think of the worst possible situations and get worried about being diagnosed with something bad. I am usually able to get those thoughts out of my head though.
0.857100	I just am an anxious person.  I don't like the doctor's office and try to avoid it when possible.  I go when needed though and usually good comes of it.  I just get so nervous that something might be wrong or that they're judging me.
0.309500	My biggest concern is that I will not be able to describe my symptoms clearly enough, or remember all the relevant bits, in order to convey the full picture to my GP. If I do a good job of explaining my symptoms, then I feel she does a good job of piecing the info together and coming up with options for me.
0.285700	The number one thing would be the discovery of something that is asymptomatic. I'm sixty years of age and feel pretty good. So I guess any anxiety I might feel would be tied into discovering an issue that I had not planned on.
0.452400	I hate the unknown, this is what causes so much anxiety when I go to the doctor.  My doctor actually tries to help the anxious feelings since she knows how I feel when I go.  I don't like surprises so my anxiety comes from not knowing what is going on or what will be done about it.  I wish I didn't feel this way so I wouldn't be so uncomfortable about going.
0.595200	For one thing, if there is the flu going around like now, I am very hesitant and anxious to go get bloodwork or general exam because I don't want to end up catching the flu from the sick people there. Beyond that, I just have had a few years recently that I feel going to the doctor is a waste of money for me, I leave with no answers, no solutions and just more broke. I have no confidence in the doctors at this juncture to at least point me in the right direction regarding my health. It is a frustration that I'm currently dealing with as a matter of fact. I personally feel (and many others in similar situations that I have talked with) feel that Novant Health, in particular, has ruined my family practice that I've gone to for decades. In recent years, it's just become a waste of money as I'm shuffled in and out after paying. That in and of itself, the lack of confidence I have now in the process, does cause me anxiety, as well as teh finances.
0.381000	I feel anxious or worried based upon whether my doctor will discover an issue with my health. This means that I will have to deal with the necessary research to determine if my health will require more attention as well as achieve the necessary footing to converse with my doctor on the subject of my health.
0.261900	I'm always a tiny bit worried when I'm at the doctor just because I worry they could find something wrong that I didn't expect but for the most part, this is not something I'm too worried about and I trust that most of my doctor appointments will go generally well as expected.
0.547600	I am just funny about people touching me so I get anxious about that.  Also that something might be found that I don't want to find out about.  Just the whole process of having to be examined.
0.285700	The wait time makes me anxious. And having multiple ppl to interact with that could possibly be sick. 
0.690500	Are they going to be honest? Is this doctor actually a doctor for the right reasons? Who can be trusted? Why can't we find a middle ground as far as chemical drug treatments and nontraditional healing?
1.000000	I'm always worried that something terrible will be found, especially now that I'm getting old. I also worry that something will be misdiagnosed, sending me in a long spiral of unpleasant tests and more appointments that lasts for weeks. Since I don't fully trust doctors, I also don't trust them to cure me if something terrible is wrong.
0.142900	I don't feel anxious when I visit a doctor's office.  I am calm and looking ahead at what I will learn about the doctor and my health.
0.381000	I feel anxious when I have a sudden medical issue that presents itself that needs to be seen by the doctor. Also, when I'm having an unusual test done, like a biopsy, I feel very anxious.
0.642900	I feel anxious when I am at the doctor's office because, even though I am healthy, there is always a chance that a medical problem could be discovered.
0.666700	Social interactions in general are a big thing for me. I am not very good at handling them without some form of anxiety cropping up. I also feel that going into the office is like going into the unkown where I might find anything to be wrong with me that could change my life.
0.142900	I am afraid they might find something that is out of the ordinary. The daunting feeling of fear is what is the most worrying. 
0.809500	I am worried something wrong with me will be discovered. I would prefer to be healthy and not have to worry about dying/suffering so there is always that fear in the back of my mind.
1.000000	"Can I just repeat the word ""everything"" ten times? My health keeps getting more and more... interesting as time passes. Nobody knows why I can't walk more than a few feet. Nobody knows why I'm nauseated all the time. Or why I trip over my own shadow on a regular basis. After a while, you get really tired of doctors saying to you, ""Wow, that's really weird."""
0.857100	i often feel as though i cannot accurately describe my issues because i feel nervous or afraid, and when i do try, i often feel misunderstood or dismissed. i also worry about things i can not control, such as exposure to other sick people or uncertainty about the physicians own care and sterilization practices. 
0.785700	The things that make me feel most anxious at the doctor's office are a) my ability to communicate clearly the symptoms I am experiencing and how often I experience them and b) describing intimate or personal issues with female nurses and doctors.  I am far more comfortable with male doctors or nurses.
0.857100	Sometimes I'm worried that something might come up. Like I might have an illness that I didn't know about. The waiting is really intense sometimes. 
0.261900	I am most anxious that i will get bad new at the doctor such as high blood pressure or something else going wrong. I usually do not have any issues once i am there but the lead up to going to the doctor makes me very anxious and worried. 
0.428600	They usually have some difficulty finding a vein in one arm, but other people are better in other locations. I do dread my colonoscopies since the last one was painful. But not much else..so far, since I'm relatively young.
0.857100	I get extremely nervous and upset with every doctors visit that I have. Iâm always worried that something worse is gonna be found out or even just something new that could potentially be bad. I hate all the tests and blood work and just initially everything about it. I canât wait to get it over and done with and get back out of the office. Iâve always been this way and I suppose itâll never change. Even if it is just a simple checkup or something like that my heart still races and I get very anxious and nervous.
0.666700	Mainly that something will be wrong, when I go for the next check up, I'm getting older and I smoke and this is around the age when my mother started to have medical problems.
0.571400	The most anxious feelings are brought on by the fear of what might be wrong with me. In addition anxiety also builds when trying to decide how I am going to describe my issues to my doctor.
0.595200	It has nothing to do with my doctor herself, or her staff. I'm just not a huge fan of sitting in waiting rooms, and I feel like that tends to cause my heart rate to rise and then for me to just get nervous about being there in general. I feel like hospitals and doctor's offices just have a certain smell to them that I'll never fully get used to. My main issue with my health is also having a history of anxiety disorders, so that definitely plays a huge roll in how I feel about doctor's visits. I think that I work myself up thinking about the unknown, and fearing that something will be wrong, even when I'm just having a routing checkup and no reason to believe that something is actually wrong.
0.619000	It's a personal anxiety that is provoked when an extended period of time has passed between sessions, and I have to say that it doesn't help when they start asking directly related questions back to back.
0.642900	I always feel like my doctor doesn't want to be there and would rather be doing anything else, besides working.  I always feel like I am a burden and not someone who should be there because I deserve to be there.  I find my doctor is always on me about something.  I always feel like when I am asked a question, regardless of my answer, the doctor will interject something else I should do instead of any positive feedback.
0.428600	Although I'm seldom there because of sickness, there is always the possibility they'll discover something wrong.  That worry naturally increases with aging.
0.547600	I don't feel too anxious or worried during a visit because I know my body is generally healthy. However, I always know there is a chance something is wrong, which is why I wrote neutral.
0.857100	That I won't be listened to, or my illness will be dismissed with a bottle of pills and no alternative or other viewpoints.
0.309500	What makes me most anxious is not knowing a diagnosis. I am a planner, so when the outcome is not predictable, it makes me stressed out and worried. I am anxious until I find out what is wrong and how it can be fixed.
1.000000	Not knowing what is wrong with me or having the doctor or nurses find out additional problems that I had no idea about.
0.238100	Just having to have a physical, Other than that i do not mind going to the doctor's office as i generally only go for reason i am aware of..
0.738100	As a female I'm used to the fact that a lot of doctors will tell women that whatever is wrong with them is because of hormones or stress, and so I worry that they're going to miss something important. Particularly since doctors are far more interested in a woman's privates than her heart (annual heart scans aren't in vogue, but they'll nag for a pap) when heart attacks are one of the top killers of women. The problem is, you never know if you got a good doctor or not until you've seen him/her, so I'm always anxious thinking I might be going through the embarrassment and cost of seeing this person that I might never want to go back to for my care. Then you have to start all over again with a different doctor, with the same worries. 
0.357100	I am worried that they may find some problem that will require further surgeries and testing. Not that the doctor is unqualified.
0.666700	I think I get anxious just because it is usually for an acute problem, so it was not something I had scheduled. It ends up making me rebalance my board study schedule which makes me anxious. 
0.642900	I feel worried because I think about the possibility that I have an untreatable disease or a long term disease that will affect my life
0.714300	I am confident that I do not currently have major health issues, but I do struggle with extreme pain from a root cause that is not serious (life threatening). I get anxious when going to the doctor because my pain issues get dismissed due to my relative good health otherwise. I worry that my problem will never get solved and that going to the doctor is a waste of my time and money. 
0.166700	I am not anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I like that I have a woman doctor because I feel I can talk to her about anything, included issues only women have. I feel comfortable if I need to be physically examined because she and I are women. I feel she better understands women's issues because she probably had/ has them two.
0.238100	If im super sick or think something may be wrong then seeing the doctor and getting that either confirmed or not is stressful
0.857100	firstly i don't like being poked and looked over. secondly the fear of having a serious disease is always in the back of my mind when visiting the doctor. lastly it's also just the fear of not having control of the situation. 
0.857100	I am always concerned about finding out information that yields a high likelihood of having a terminal type illness or chronic condition.  I guess I openly feel like I have a chronic condition which cannot be helped without surgery and/or medication.  Both of these alternatives really cause worry for me.  I do not like medication at all.  I feel that the side effects associated with them increase the problems associated with my health. Furthermore, I know any surgery can turn more problematic so I would say it is the uncertainty that makes me most anxious.
0.285700	I do not feel anxious or worried at my doctor office. I feel like my doctors office has everything under control and makes everything as calming and relaxing as possible.
0.142900	I wouldn't call what I feel when I visit a doctor's office either anxious or worried.  It's more like frustrated and indignant.  Especially when I'm on time and they are not.  I don't spend much time anxious or worried in general - why should a doctor's office be any different?  It is what it is - worry never helps.
0.619000	I am worried about something being wrong that would lead to expensive testing and treatments. I also worry about catching the flu from being around sick people in the waiting room.
0.642900	"I have general anxiety disorder - my default brain state is slightly worried, with a tendency to latch onto any ""abnormal"" event as a cause for worry/stress/bad reaction. Specifically with doctor's visits I worry that they will ""find something"" wrong. There is really no reason behind it, and I am fully aware of this. I can deal with it, but I still have to experience it. I actually relax/do better if they do find something, because then I can talk about it, get, and give more info. It is mostly the unknown that is bothersome to my brain."
0.285700	I am worried that the diagnosis will be worse than I initially thought. Although unlikely and Im not a hypochondriac, still, a small part of me feels very anxious about a bad diagnosis. 
0.261900	"I feel worried when they see something of concern on my blood work and want to redo it.  Blood work is very telling so it makes me extremely nervous if something looks ""off"" to my doctor."
0.428600	Are they going to be on time or are they going to keep me waiting around for an extended period of time?
0.690500	I am most anxious and worried when going to the doctors office because I am anxious that something will be wrong. There are several conditions that run in my family, like diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure and more.  Each time I go to the doctor, even for a routine physical, I am always anxious that this will be the time we find out that I have those conditions too.  I do not like taking prescriptions and therefore do not want to have to start taking them for life. 
0.785700	I'm usually worried that I'll find out something negative about my health, due to the poor choices I've made in terms of diet and exercise. 
0.571400	I would feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I am injured and worry an exam may cause more pain or if I feel there is something really unusual about my symptoms and something could be seriously wrong. Regular visits do not cause me concern.
0.928600	I'm always treated like an unnecessary burden that they have to rush through dealing with.  I never feel like I can ask what I need to ask.
0.619000	If I am getting a pap smear, I have been hurt in the past because of carelessness. So, I almost always tense up when I am getting that done due to past trauma.
0.642900	I get worried that I will receive bad news in regards to a a problem that I have going on and I hope it turns out for the best
0.166700	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the long wait in the lobby and after waiting for so long, the doctor only gives you a small amount of time. That doesn't provide you enough time to ensure all questions and answers are given. 
0.857100	A doctor's demeanor and how nice or mean he will me makes me scared. It also makes me scared that they won't be able to diagnose properly.
0.785700	It is the uncertainty that makes me feel very anxious. I don't know what the outcome is going to be and the possible associated costs to treatment also are a cause of concern. I feel that I may be criticized or judged for certain personal choices.
0.500000	I am getting older, and I fear that a condition is in the works that I do not know about.  I fear that something is happening right now that I won't be able to bounce back from.  
0.142900	I'm actually never really worried as although I don't get sick or have to go to the doctor's office often, I am confident that they will figure out the issue and get me back on track health wise, in a good amount of time. 
0.738100	What makes me the most worried is if it's something serious or not. I personally don't have health insurance so anything serious would also probably cost me a lot of money out of pocket. This is particularly worrisome as my personal income isn't that high either.
0.285700	The only thing that would make me anxious or worried is the condition that sent me to see the doctor in the first place.  I'm the sort of person who won't go to see a doctor unless I think there is something seriously wrong.  Not serious in the sense that I might think something life threatening but serious in the sense that it's something my body's defense system seems to be incapable of taking care of on it's own.
0.761900	I think I am just allergic to doctor's offices!  I am one of those people whose  blood pressure goes up when tested in the doc's office.  I look at the trays of sharp instruments lying in wait on the counters and I am uneasy!  I have a vivid imagination.  I am anxious about any invasive tests, about possible pain, about possible bad news, esp. as I get older and older.  I have learned to trust my doctor, and as I have reached the age just this year when my yearly physical exam does not have to include a gyn exam, I am much more relaxed.  
0.142900	Nothing really makes me feel anxious at the doctors office. I have always been pretty relaxed while I was there.
0.547600	"Nobody likes to be ""exposed"" to someone they barely know.  This in itself is enough to create an awkward and uncomfortable environment.  Most times I really don't want to know how much I weigh and that always makes me feel crazy too."
0.309500	What makes me most anxious when visiting a doctor is whether or not I will be able to convince them to address all of my concerns rather than just the one or two issues that they feel like addressing. Other than that I have no worries about visiting a doctor because I realize that I'm getting older and I'm not going to live forever.
0.761900	I'm worried that my doctor won't take time to hear my concerns. Also, I am anxious about possible test results.

0.381000	I get most anxious and worried about the bill I will receive. I have an HMO and pay $25 for PCP office visits. However, after my appointment my doctor's office will re-evaluate the co-pay and what was discussed and bill me for items that came up in conversation during an appointment. 
0.738100	I usually feel anxious that they're going to find something wrong with me than is worse than what I though.  If I have a cough, I worry it might be related to the lungs or that they may not be able to get my symptoms under control.  I worry that I'm going to be judged and this all makes me anxious and worried. 
0.333300	Occasionally, I feel anxious at the doctor's office. I feel like I am in a vulnerable position and I do not know if something will be wrong with me that I did not know about before.
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when I am attending these types of appointments because I am a laid back and relaxed person. I taking everything one step at a time and see no reason to stress over anything.
0.452400	There is always the risk that something could be found that was not foreseen, but on the whole this is not how I typically feel since I lead a relatively healthy lifestyle.
0.285700	I don't get anxious to actually see my doctor, the only thing that may make me a little anxious is when I go to the doctor for a specific pain or something and then I worry that something may be wrong with me and I don't want to get bad news 
0.309500	I feel anxious if I am having a health issue and worried it could turn out to be something serious.  I make sure I get a thorough explanation when my health issues are being explained to me.
0.500000	I feel most worried is when the doctor finds an issue and he does not know how to treat it in the first steps. It is unknown and could be life threatening.
0.357100	I am most anxious or worried about visiting the doctor because one can never know what will be found out about my health. But this stems from the fact that I have largely avoided doctors for most of my life. If I regularly visited a doctor, then perhaps I would be less worried.
0.142900	The possibility of having some kind of surgery. I have always had a fear of having surgery and the operating table in general since I was little. 
0.595200	I feel anxious sometimes because if I need to go the doctor, something is wrong with me.  There concern over the unknown will always lead to a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor.
0.714300	I feel most anxious if a doctor is not open to my full explanation of what my body is doing. Most doctors are too close minded regarding nutritional therapy and so I tend to be skeptical of a doctors quick diagnosis. I know my body the best so I trust my insight more than them.
0.357100	I worry that I'll get admonished for not taking care of myself (my weight has been creeping up lately) or that my blood pressure will suddenly be high or something else unexpected.
0.357100	I feel anxious sometimes about telling them what's wrong with me, and wondering if what they can do to help me. 
0.809500	I am worried that he will not believe me when I tell him my symptoms and that I will feel like a foolish old women.
0.571400	I am mostly afraid of them telling me something new is wrong that I did not know before and that I will have to start taking some new kind of medications.I can hardly afford what  I am on now even with all of my healthcare. I can only imagine what it would be like if they had to put me on more.
0.809500	I have been for several different exams and what bother me the most is, I usually know what the problem is and so does he but I dont really wanna hear what it is. The few rare times when I dont know what it is, Im worried about cost, and what I will have to do for treatment or if something new is wrong that I will have to deal with. You always have the dread of finding something new, when you think you know what is wrong, doesnt happen very often but when it does, it scares you.
0.285700	I rarely feel terribly anxious unless I am experiencing a very painful or unusual condition. If that is the case, I am most anxious about receiving a bad diagnosis.
0.142900	Having to sit on the exam table.  I'm a big guy and it is tough to get on that thing and sit.  I would rather sit in the chair.
0.666700	I am concerned that the doctor may inform me that there is something seriously wrong with my health.  I am afraid of finding out about an incurable disease or health issue.
0.904800	Authority figures in general make me feel uneasy, but i hate going to the doctor. i am not sure why, I also hate getting naked in front of anyone who is not my fiance. That is a huge trigger for my anxiety. I don't like being poked and proded or touched.
0.333300	I just don't enjoy people poking and prodding me. Even worse is that you're paying to be poked and prodded. They usually don't seem very confident in what they are doing or why they are doing it, It feels very impersonal almost like you're a car at a mechanics shop and not a living breathing human with thoughts and emotions.
0.428600	I'm anxious that my doctor might say something is off with my blood levels and or the nutrients I am recieving.
0.714300	With the doctor I've been using, you just never know what he will come up with. He's friendly at times and other times a real jerk. Also, he divorced his wife and married his nurse. Don't upset the Queen!! 
0.976200	I am most anxious that there will be bad news, or difficult news.  I am also anxious the dr. wonât understand what I am trying to explain.
0.142900	I want to be able to find out what the issue is right away when I go to the dr office. I also would like to avoid a run-around with treatments that would be completely pointless and offer no remedy to whatever reason I had to visit the dr office. I also do NOT like dealing with needles, having my blood taken causes me some anxiety whenever it happens. 
0.238100	It depends on my reasoning for visiting the doctors office. If its a matter of me being really sick or something that could of been wrong at a pregnancy checkup I was very worried. I had went in a couple times only to find out I had lost the baby my future pregnancy checkups were always a huge scare and worry but as far as routine checkup it wasn't ever a problem.
0.500000	Being touched makes me highly uncomfortable and I would rather you not do that, please and thank you.
0.476200	I don't like when she rushes me.  I don't like when she does not listen to my health concerns.  It makes me anxious that something could go wrong that my doctor could simply brush off and overlook.  I often wonder about a mole on my back, which she said was benign just by looking at it.  Meanwhile she is not a dermatologist.  And she then referred me to a dr that had killed my friends father by misdiagnosing him.
0.166700	What makes me feel the most anxious about going to a Doctors office is having to wait for lab results. The wait always gives me anxiety because I want to know that I am ok.
0.285700	I am most worried about the cost. I have the very good luck to never have health insurance when I need it, and even when I do it's still a large expense. I rarely feel any kind of anxiety over my health when I'm able to see a doctor, it's when I can't that worries me.
0.428600	I think what makes me feel the most anxious is what they might find. I worry a lot about my health and always fear the unknown. 
0.190500	That my health isn't what I want it to be and that it's going to be terminal or worse. That's it really
0.428600	Usually a doctor's office is cold and this environment causes me to fell tense. Also I often forget to tell the doctor important symptoms and I become anxious when trying to remember them.
0.809500	Noodle's I don't like the pain being told something is wrong in my body really make me worried are just having to visit my doctor 
0.142900	Nothing really, maybe if they leave the examination room ans don't return for a while, I may get a little tense, thinking that something on my account is delaying their return.
0.285700	I don't really mind going to the doctor it doesn't affect me usually. Unless I'm worried about something, but just going in for a checkup I'm usually fine
0.476200	Unexpected health issues, or issues that seem minor and turn out to be much larger. I am fearful for my health as I get older so having a good examination is really important to me.
0.285700	I usually get good reports for the most part. Unknown is always worrisome. Something can happen that is unexpected and you can take things for granted. Health is always one of those things. My doctor does a good job of not keeping me in the dark about anything but you always worry about the what if. Mortality is a scary concept. Worry about what happens to my family is something goes wrong. Worry about how to pay large medical bills even though I have good insurance. No matter how prepared you think you are I don't think anything can prepare you for a very bad medical report.
0.619000	Knowing that a doctor could give me information at any time that could change my life forever makes me a little nervous.  Or when connected to an EKG machine and they tell you not to worry--how can you not be a little nervous.  Or, waiting for a test result that seems to take forever.
0.761900	I'm always scared because I have lots of health problems in my family history. I am always scared that something is going to come back bad or a simple ache is going to be so much more than just a simple ache. I am always worried about what they will recommend or what they have to say.
0.571400	I don't feel anything in particular.  Why should I?  I don't know whether or not to trust what they say. So why should I feel anything?
0.976200	It was just one situation while i was prgenant and i just didn't want to go because i knew i would get myself upset at what they had to tell me.
0.690500	I am worried about something being wrong with me that i am not aware of. I am worried about unexpected medical expenses. 
0.619000	Whether or not that i would bleed once I was in the office. The doctor always needs to draw a significant amount of blood, usually until I get dizzy. 
0.785700	Feeling is the nominalization of the verb to feel.[1] The word was first used in the English language to describe the physical sensation of touch through either experience or perception. The word is also used to describe experiences other than the physical sensation of touch
0.238100	The first thing that makes me anxious is getting on the scale. I dread that more than anything, and also I get very worried about cost because I am self pay.
0.833300	You never truly know what a doctor could tell you. Your body and mind can feel 100% sometimes and the inside of you could be completely destroyed. 
0.976200	The outcome of a diagnosis would be what I fear most. I do not participate in many actual exams, I don not like people touching me. Not even for a shot or checking heart rates. I just get extremely anxious about seeing any DR for fear of bad news.
0.452400	Hardly ever but sometimes i will think the doctor is going to tell me that there is something more that is wrong with me.
0.476200	it would be only when my doctor is not there and i would have to deal with another doctor that i don't really trust or know to much 
0.142900	I'm worried about the cost of a prescription or care. Healthcare here in America is very expensive. Right now I'm luckily on my parents' insurance, because I simply cannot afford my own as an individual. Once that time is up, and if I get sick or injured, I'm screwed. One of the biggest causes of bankruptcy in this country is due to healthcare bills.
0.690500	I feel more anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because I never know what they may find. It is an uneasy feeling going in and having to wait and see what may possibly be wrong with you. It makes me overall nervous and my blood pressure rises a bit when I go to the doctor's because of fear of the unknown. What also makes me most anxious is the kind of tests they may have to do or if I have to get a shot, or blood drawn.
0.571400	What makes me feel worried is that they will quickly prescribe meds and will give you no inside depth to how you can truly take care of yourself by keeping your body in an alkaline state to fight off diseases and ailments.
0.642900	I am never sure if my condition will get worse.  I don't want to have a negative report but understand it is a possibility.    I have to live in reality when it comes to the information. 
0.357100	I had a major illness when I was younger, and it took the doctors a long time to find out what was wrong.  I had to have blood drawn on a daily basis for over a month.  To this day I still hate having blood drawn.  I always look away, and just hate when I have people who aren't that competent drawing blood.  I also worry about what hereditary conditions I may have.
0.571400	I guess the uncertainty of your health is what makes me the most anxious. It really worries me that I don't truly know if I'm fully health even If I feel healthy.
0.690500	Due to the fact Iâve already had 9 surgeries on my shoulder Iâm always worried I might need more. Iâm only 25 and Iâve had 3 shoulder transplants so it always makes anxious when I go.
0.809500	I'm getting older. I always feel my body deteriorating and I'm just always scared something new is going to pop up. I'm not a hypochondriac, yet I do worry about my health because it really isn't very good. 
0.761900	I am most worried about examinations which may be physically painful or uncomfortable, as this has necessarily been a common occurrence for me lately. I am also a reserved person, and therefore may feel physically or even emotionally vulnerable in these moments. This is particularly true if my condition is a source of embarrassment to me, such as a urinary tract infection. I may also be anxious about forgetting to ask a clarifying question in the moment, or otherwise missing the opportunity to inform myself or give the doctor helpful information which can lead to more effective treatment.
0.738100	I feel anxious and also worried about what results will come from the doctors evaluation.  Although I know deep in my mind nothing severe should be wrong I also know there is a chance that something may come back that would make my health even worse than it currently is.  
0.214300	The only thing that worries me is that I might have something seriously wrong with me. Since I had a life-threatening illness about 10 years ago --involving my heart- this isn't an unreasonable fear.
0.571400	Probably just fear of the unknown.  While I'm healthy in general, you never know what might happen or what tests may show to the doctor that you are not even aware about.
0.142900	Obviously there is always that sense of the unknown. That is to say that any normal routine issue can snowball into something much worse. It's impossible to tell with utmost certainty what is happening within our bodies at any given moment but I suppose that's all the more reason we need to take care of ourselves as best as we can.
0.190500	I'm worried that they might find something wrong with me. It also makes me anxious being poked and prodded. It is a little uncomfortable. It's quite personal and not at all private.
0.714300	"What makes me most anxious and worried is not knowing the doctor personally enough so that you know whether or not they have your best interest in mind on that particular day.  I think like anyone off that doctors can have ""off"" days."
0.571400	Sometimes I feel like I'm not where I should be weight wise. I am a shy and modest person for the most part and having a physical exam makes me nervous.  I also am worried he will find something that I had no idea was an issue with my health.
0.452400	What makes me anxious about visiting a dr. appointment is the wait. I see and hear sick people and worry Im going to get what they have. I also feel uncomfortable being in a confined space with people that I know are sick
0.285700	I always worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me. Its not the doctor herself that makes me worry, just the thought that one day she might tell me I have cancer or something.
0.500000	I generally do not get too worried or anxious about anything.  What is, is.  If a problem reveals itself, I will tackle it head on.  Worrying gets you nowhere.
0.666700	I feel the most anxious and or worried if the Doctor may give me different results that I was hoping for, for some unexpected reason, that's why I am always trying to imagine the worst case scenario.
0.190500	I think it is the diagnosis itself. My mind goes to a bad place for a bit thinking of the what ifs and the problems I have been having. My grandfather died of cancer 2 years ago because his doctor wasn't thorough and didn't catch the cancer at all. My mind always goes to that instance and I wish it didn't. I don't feel a ton of anxiety but it's enough to make me think back to what happened to my grandfather. I don't want that to be me.
0.666700	When I visit my doctors office what makes me feel the most worried is that I will be told that I have a chronic illness. I worry because both of my parents suffer from illnesses and I know that they are hereditary. My mother suffers from high blood pressure and my dad from diabetes. I want to avoid both of the illnesses for as long as possible, but since I am overweight I have a higher chance of developing any of these illnesses. Therefor on my annual checkups when I go for my results I do get nervous and anxious because I don't want to be given bad news. 
0.190500	Any medical appointment makes me a little anxious simply because I will have to bare myself and be uncomfortable. The only time I get worried is if I suspect that there may really be something wrong that may not turn out well.
0.690500	That they are judging me. I just get so anxious that most of the time I won't tell them certain things because I'm embarrassed.
0.666700	The unknown makes me nervous.  Not my doctor.  I know that he will figure something out, but its the process of getting to that solution and the waiting to get in, or wanting to know that he can fix whatever is wrong.
0.285700	The results of a test i might have to take would make me feel very anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office.
0.261900	About the only thing that makes me anxious or worried is when they take my blood pressure. It always tests high for some reason and is disturbing to both the doctor and I. I do get a little anxious being around all of the germs hanging around the waiting room.
0.285700	Sitting surrounded by sick people, in an environment where nosocomial infections abound. A doctor's office is where sick people come, and a percentage of them are contagious.  Limiting the amount of time in a doctor's office reduces exposure risk.
0.785700	I worry that something could be very wrong.  I could potentially be diagnosed with a terrible disease like cancer.  To me, it's just the fact that my day could have been going very well, and that could be changed with a few sentences.  I get concerned that something could have been wrong with me for a while, and that it might be too late to be reversed.
0.142900	I am usually pretty comfortable visiting the doctor, the only thing that makes me really nervous is having to be completely naked or getting a gynecology exam.
0.238100	I always get somewhat anxious when visiting the doctors because of all the germs and sick people there presently or before me. I always sit furtherest away from people as possible and hand sanitize to restrict the spread of illness as much as possible. As far as the actual visit, it's not that bad it's just the germs and illness I am weary of. 
0.333300	I would only be anxious or worried if there was a new problem that required tests and a wait for results to find out if there was something to be concerned about.
0.285700	I am afraid that I might be diagnosed with cancer since I smoke.  My mother had lung cancer.  She died two years ago.
0.357100	I am sometimes anxious because they may find out something that is wrong with me that I am unaware of. Going to the doctor is just is a stressful thing.
0.333300	I feel a little worried about the possibility of the doctor finding a chronic disease that is not curable or treatable.  I also feel anxious that I may not be in as good health as the last physical exam.
0.666700	Vaccines and tests that are not needed being given. Getting sick from the people around me in the office. 
0.857100	I am worried that they will find something bad. I am very anxious about my health and am always worried that something major is going to turn up no matter how unlikely that is. I also get worried about pain such as from shots. 
0.666700	I just tend to worry that there may be something wrong with me. My family has had a history of heart and cancer issues, and I always fear that one of those, or something else entirely will affect me at some point.
0.714300	If I have something wrong with me that has been bothering me for a while I am concerned about what the cause may be. I worry that the doctor may find something considerably wrong. I worry that the doctor may run a test that will have a very bad result.
0.261900	It is the waiting time when you get to the office. Getting right in would make me feel less anxious there since I am getting in and learning of any issues as soon as I get there. 
0.285700	The concern on something being actually wrong with me. Being sick is the concern that makes me not want to go to the doctor and self access myself via web md.
0.619000	I typically won't go to a doctor's office unless I am completely sure something is wrong. By the time I am there, I know I have a problem and I tend to worry about how bad it is at that stage. I do not like people touching me as well, so being examined always pushes my personal space limits. 
0.738100	I get anxious sometimes believing the doctor is going to tell me something negative about my health. I also stress out about having some medical procedure that will cost me out of pocket money, for some outrageous medical bill I will receive. 
0.976200	i dont like crowds the last time i went the lady told me to come in the eveing hardly any people .i got there it was so crowded no were to sit anxienty was kicking in bad.went to the window she gave me a clip board to fill out paper work was so nerves i told here i couldnt be in here with all thse people she told the nurse she got me.i had to walk pass everyone it was aweul sat in a room for 2hrs to bee seen.
0.571400	just been to so many doctors feel more worn out and tired of all the appointments. there have been times i've been worried but i don't have the energy anymore for much worry. 
0.571400	That I will not get the proper care I require. I have had multiple instances where I paid for an Urgent Care visit, waited for hours to be seen, and was sent home with nothing but instructions to rest and take an OTC pill, only to end up admitted to the hospital the following day. Such instances include: heat stroke, kidney stones, broken ankle, severely infected sebacious cyst, etc. None of these instances were taken seriously by doctors in the urgent care center.
0.595200	If i really don't know whats going on and I end up in the doctors office I'm just hoping it avoids a surgery or something. If I think they cant provide me with what I need and I have to get forwarded to another doctor I may get a little anxious or worried about my next visit. Going to the doctor isn't very fun.
0.357100	Not knowing the answers are my worst fear. I feel like I want to know my results now even though sometimes that is impossible.
0.190500	The most nerve-wracking part of visiting the doctor's office is the potential that something serious is wrong; but, otherwise, I do not experience a strong anxiety about actually seeing the doctor. 
0.333300	Really the worst part about it to me, is taking the time out of my day to go and wait for a pointless exam that I have no reason to be examined in the first place. It's just a huge interruption every time it comes up, because its usually completely unnecessary.
0.833300	A diagnosis that i was not expecting or finding out that ive put off treatment for so long and it's worse that I thought
0.381000	what makes me the most worried when visiting my doctors office is that a necessary test or screening may be missed or a wrong result may occur from a test.
0.666700	I worry about problems I have no control over. I have had problems with my blood pressure in the past and I worry that my blood pressure will be high again. I worry that some other problem that I am unaware of will be noticed. 
0.142900	when i go the doctors office the past i was over weight diabetic for about ayear and i would get an earful everytime. this last appoint was months later and my conditions had changed dramatically. i had unknowinly dropped 20 pounds in 9 weeks with a1c 10 dropping 10 points as  well. the doctor stopped his lecturing 
0.571400	I feel really anxious when I visit my doctor because I just want to get done with my doctor appointment as fast a possible. 
0.809500	There is just something about a doctor's office that is a little unnerving that I can't quite put my finger on. Everything seems a little too perfect, and I almost feel like if there's something wrong that I'm disappointing the physician or making their life harder.
0.428600	I am sometimes worried that she will judge my life choices or tell me that I am seriously sick. I once had a doctor fat shame me. 
0.309500	I feel anxious being left in a cold room by myself for too long. It leaves me too much time to think and make myself worried
0.714300	There is always fear that the Doctor might bring news of terminal illness that might be afflicted with. So that fear of bad news is what make me anxious and worried.
0.595200	I worry about what the diagnosis might be, and I worry about my health issues. I also tend to be anxious about how the doctor might treat me as a person, or how they will explain things in a way i might understand and be honest with me. 
0.142900	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is not knowing whether something serious is happening or not. I fear the worst but am unable to see whether it is true or not.
0.928600	I'm always wondering what is the doctor gonna find. I lost a parent to cancer at a young age so I always think I'm going to get a cancer diagnosis.
0.190500	I tend to google things a lot (big no-no) whenever I feel exceptionally bad, or have something weird going on physically, so that tends to create a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor. I assume the worst. 
0.690500	I have a mechanical aortic valve, a dacron aortic aneurysm replacement, and a pacemaker.  The valve and graft are twelve years old, and my second pacemaker is 7 years old.  I worry the most that my valve will need to be replaced again, and that my pacemaker needs replacement again.  These things have a limited life, and I know that at some point problems that arise will need to be addressed.
0.904800	I am most worried about what diagnosis they are going to give me and what I am going to do about it.
0.642900	I am worried that they will find something wrong that I was unaware of and will result in a significant financial investment from me to treat. Our healthcare system is a joke when it comes to how much medicines cost. Your health is held for ransom by the drug companies and it's disgusting. 
0.142900	The length of time I have to wait for my scheduled appointment time. Billing seems to be an issue a lot. I get frustrated with the lack of respect of my time.
0.428600	That he might find something I didn't know what was wrong with me.Or that I might need a shot. those things scare that crap out of me.
0.285700	I don't know if it will be good news or bad news when something is wrong with me. What if it is something serious but it makes me worried if he just ignores it or does not take it seriously. I just normally get anxious because sometimes you just don't know what it is your'e going to expect.
0.571400	That the doctor is going to find something very wrong with me.  I worry that if I am sick that I might have a serious illness. 
0.714300	You never know what to expect when you go into an appointment. Usually you are going because something doesnât feel right in your body and that worries you. With the internet nowadays you can always look up the worst case scenarios and no matter how hard you try the thought of the worst is always in your head. This scares a lot of people before they go to visit the doctor and that sometimes includes me
0.619000	That a test will turn up something (I've had 2 different types of cancer). I have had more than my share of being told I need surgery and being quite frightened by the diagnosis so those feelings from those times tend to crop up.
0.142900	The only thing that makes me anxious about seeing a doctor is that they will recognize a problem that I did not know existed. But that is why you see a competent physician.
0.714300	What makes me most anxious whenever I visit any doctor's office is uncertainty. When going to see a doctor, one never knows what may potentially arise in terms of a negative diagnosis. Thus, I am always a little bit on edge every time.
0.357100	I don't believe they have the truth. They have strayed from true health care. Prevention is key. Not pills to treat symptoms. 
0.381000	In general, my health has been good, so I usually don't fear healthcare visits.  This may change as I get older.
0.738100	I always feel like I am going to be told that my cholesterol is too high and that I need to start taking medication for it. I know this is just my doctor doing his job, but I don't like having medications pushed on me. I rather eat healthier and get more exercise.
0.357100	I am anxious about possibly being seek, or needing a treatment. Usually I go visit during routine checkups, I am not very anxious about those. When I go when I do not feel too good, I worry about finding out if I will need a treatment. I also do not like needles, so if I have to get a shot, I feel anxious. 
0.381000	I am most anxious that I will forget to mention something- or what most people probably feel- that they will receive some bad news. In general I keep healthy habits and have not received any bad news. I am 39 so generally I do not expect to hear bad news about my health as I have not so far.
0.238100	I suppose the most anxious thing I have worried about is whether or not the doctor was in a rush. Sometimes they try and push you out and don't like being asked many questions.  
0.666700	What makes me most anxious and worried when I visit the doctor's office is that the doctor will find something seriously wrong with me and I will have some sort of health problem that I've been unaware of.
0.452400	I had a past medical history where a mysterious illness wrecked me and spent a month in the ICU, 2 weeks in a coma. So when I feel like something is wrong again, its hard to not have a bit of anxiety or worries. However when I'm at the doctor's office, I guess its mostly just being judged about poor life decisions. 
0.666700	I feel theyâre give me the same answers all the time and donât really listen or my issues. The doctor doesnât give me their best opinion and advise. They say itsuptometodecide. Iâd like to know what they think. Thatâs why I paid to go see them. 
0.309500	I'd say just randomly having some new infection that I didn't suspect because I usually do things that wouldn't harm myself so this would surprise me and make me wonder which activity exposed me to this and what I can do to correct it. Also, I sometimes will worry about needles if I have to get one just because I'm not a huge fan at the end of the day
0.619000	Just the act of going to see the doctor.  There's sick people everywhere, the office is usually cold, especially in the examination room..  You often have to wait alone in the exam room for a few minutes which increases anxiety..  Shots aren't too bad, but it's still a needle so those suck..
0.809500	That the condition I'm experiencing may require surgery or some other drastic, or painful measure. Since there's a family history and particular diseases that people with my ethnicity, and men over a certain age experience  (prostate cancer)  I fear that I may have it too. I guess to put it simple, it's the uncertainty and the fact that with certain conditions there's really nothing a patient can do to change the situation. On regular checkups, experiencing a cold or something like that  I'm not as worried since I have had many in my lifetime. I do, however, hate needles so I get antsy when I know I have to get  a shot.
0.619000	I feel anxious and worried when I am at the doctors office because I always worry of getting some disease that cant be cured or cancer I am sick all the time with ibs and I recently had hyplori I have alot of stomach issues and bowel issues so I always think of the worst outcome possible I am very anxious
0.809500	A lot of doctors don't get to the root cause of your medical issue.  They hear a few of your symptoms then give you a textbook diagnosis and send you away with a prescription for the symptoms instead of trying to solve the cause of the problem without filling you up with medication.  I want to be properly evaluated, not just medicated.
0.595200	unnecessary tests and procedures make me nervous. I don't like to have anything done that I do not feel I need.
0.619000	I am worried about what will be found when they examine me, if it's something serious or not. I'm worried about the cost, and I'm worried about being judged for my weight. I'm usually very anxious about all of these things. 
0.381000	I do not like to visit the doctor because even when there is nothing wrong they try to medicate you to death.  It seems like they are just looking for a reason to give you all kinds of medicine that is not really needed.
0.452400	I guess just worrying that something will turn up. That the doctor will find something that is very bad. I would say that is mostly what I worry about.
0.309500	I normally don't feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office. One way I would feel worried is if I was experiencing great pain and had to go to the doctors office in order to stop that pain. I generally remain calm and don't expect to find anything too wrong with myself.
0.738100	When I visit the doctor, I'm most worried about them finding something wrong with my overall health, or even something specific that could really harm me.  I worry I'll need some type of invasive procedure.
0.642900	If I'm having symptoms or there's been a change in my condition since my last visit, I worry that something's wrong with me. I worry that it could be serious and that it could be expensive. I don't have a lot of money for healthcare.
0.738100	I always know there will be a conversation about my weight.  What makes me most anxious though is my blood pressure.  It always reacts when I'm in the doctor's office.  I've tried breathing exercises, visualization, hydrating well and distraction.  They work to a certain extent in calming me down but aren't 100% successful.  It's so annoying!  (My blood pressure is fine everywhere else but the office).  They know me well enough that they take an initial pressure and come back 10 minutes later after I've relaxed.  Totally a psychological response.
0.261900	I am always worried about two things primarily. When I enter a doctor's office, and sometimes even before, I am slowed down by the thought of the total cost of the visit. I find it very taxing to my patience that I get charged for my visit to the center, and then I get charged for my doctor's time AND THEN I get charged for my prescription. This is all of course assuming you pay the school's insurance fee which is far higher than the govt marketplace plans available to the public. The second worry I have going in is that whatever I am scheduled to have checked out will be worse than I thought. I have an acute worry that if I go check myself up the doctor will tell me oodles of things that are wrong with me, which sounds scary honestly. I suppose the second reason also ties into extra bills.
0.333300	Doctors cannot always explain what is wrong with you when you feel sick.  My brother had a serious medical condition that his doctors did not understand.  They ran a number of rests but never really understood why he was sick.
0.190500	I am most anxious about visiting a doctor's office when I have a problem related to my heart. I am worried it might be something serious.
0.571400	I get worried because I always think the worst and that the news will be bad because a lot of times it has been. Iâm 35 but I have already been diagnosed with both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis and have had an ischemic stroke. After getting these diagnoses when I least expected them, I just feel like any diagnosis is possible for me.
0.214300	I worry they might find something wrong with me that is incurable. Something like cancer. Also waiting around for long periods of time will sometimes make me anxious.
0.285700	Nothing, I visit the doctor's office with they hope that they can resolve my issue, not worried that they'll make it worse.
0.642900	I do not like the doctors office because its always full of sick people. I do not want to make my health worse by compromising it. I also believe that doctors try to push pills on to people and get incentives for it.
0.666700	I'm afraid that they will give me bad news. I'm afraid of getting sick in the future so I feel nervous.  
0.309500	I get slightly anxious when talking about my pre-existing condition (sleep apnea). Another thing that might make me a little bit anxious is getting a physical (for obvious reasons).  Getting weighed also makes me slightly nervous.
0.619000	If I'm seeing a doctor for a specific problem (rash or cold or pain), I think it's normal to worry about what they might find. As a general rule, going to the doctor for check-ups doesn't bother me, though I do worry they'll find something wrong sometimes.
0.595200	The alone time in the doctor's office is what makes me the most nervous. Usually when you show up you wait in that room for 30+ minutes alone. It is very cold in there, and usually the rooms are a plain white color. I become especially worried after a blood test/physical/etc when the doctor says they will return shortly and I am left alone again.
0.190500	I usually worry that they will not be able to hear the baby's heart beat.  After that I worry that they will come too soon or that I didn't take care of them well enough in utero.  It's hard to know that all is okay until they are here.
1.000000	Everything.  What if I catch something while I'm there?  What if the thing I'm going to the doctor about is 10 or 100 times worse than I thought?  It's horrible.  What if they find something I wasn't even expecting?  So much worry for something that could maybe be handled at home.
0.690500	I always have a fear in the back of my mind that I may receive life changing news. I have had surgery a couple of times in the past and so I tend to think of the worst case scenario. My worry tends to play tricks on my mind and make any form of pain seem worse than it may be.
0.547600	I am just uncomfortable being in a doctors office and having them exam you and touch you. When I think there is something wrong with me sometimes I am concerned they are going to think I am crazy, and there isn't anything wrong, or maybe there really will be something wrong. Just being in the doctors office gives you that feeling of what are they going to find.
0.309500	"I dislike having anything ""invasive"" like a papsmear, but that's probably me (and most people), and does not reflect on my doctor."
0.476200	I just worry that something will be wrong with me or go wrong in the process. Nothing has been wrong with me yet, but I did the most worrying when I was pregnant. I thought for sure something would go wrong with the baby, but everything ended up being okay. I'm just a worrier in general.
0.785700	I tend to feel anxious when I visit the doctor because as much as I like my doctor, I do not like going to the doctor. I am always worried that I will get bad news or a bad diagnosis of health
0.809500	The Doctor finding something very wrong, either cancer or something caused by my diabetes. I don't want to leave my family at a young age 
0.857100	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when I go to the doctor is knowing that I will probably leave with some sort of mind altering medication. I have bipolar 1. That can not be treated with therapy alone. I hate my medications and the side effects of them. I almost died because of the medications that I was given about a year or so ago. I am now horrified to try anything new when it come to medication. Though it does stop certain moods, it turns me into a vegetable that can barley function. 
0.714300	The doctor looking at my body makes me self conscious and I'm worried that when they're talking to me I'll look dumb
0.595200	What makes me most anxious is that I feel insane. Doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result. They keep telling me I'm fine and there's nothing wrong with me and making me waste time when I don't feel fine and need better medicine.
0.690500	Just the idea that something could be worse than it seems. Or that they'll berate me or something like that.
0.857100	Mostly, I am concerned that I will have a major health problem diagnosed or discovered. I am always thinking of the worst possible scenarios in the moments leading to my scheduled appointments, especially when it's not a regular checkup and I am going to the appointment because I am feeling ill or something similar. Those moments always make me anxious, and I usually feel relief when the appointment is over and nothing major is discovered.
0.571400	I've always had some issues with the doctor and I have no idea why. It's bad enough my blood pressure will actual read out higher when I am at the doctors office.
0.738100	I worry about the tests.  I'm ashamed that I did not lose weight or do everything my doctor told me and that I'd disappoint them.
0.809500	Finding out that something is wrong with my health and that I will have a short while to live or that perhaps my lifestyle choices will have taken a significant toll on my body and state of health.
0.166700	I am not usually anxious or worried when visiting the doctor.  The only thing I could say may be a factor is just uncertainty about having a serious issue, but this is not typically how I think.
0.881000	Doctors have a strong and conservative mindset. They are not flexible. They can not look past the main concern and focus on something else. In my personal case, doctors can't look past my weight issues. Even though I have an entirely different medical concern that is not related to weight, they keep focusing on weight. I am also anxious because I do not like physical exams, I do not like to be completely honest because they judge you regardless.
0.881000	I dislike uncertainty, so I tend to feel a good deal of anxiety while waiting for test results and analysis. If I had 100% certainty that a particular ailment could be successfully treated with a particular approach or if pharmaceutical intervention would always work exactly as I wishes, my anxiety would likely abate. The not knowing makes it difficult for me and the waiting for results heightens the negative affect.
0.785700	The single thing that makes me feel the most anxious is the fear of being diagnosed with something that I had no idea I had. I am always scared that when Iâm doing a check up theyâll find something wrong with me, but I know it is better they find it sooner rather than later.
0.309500	I have high blood pressure so I am always anxious about my numbers. I am a senior, so I do worry about things that a younger person would not think about. I hate tests and sometimes I have to go for them, even though I know it is in my best interest.
0.142900	A primary concern for all of us would be the money and how much we will spend on the visit. Also thinking that there might be something terrible going on with me
0.666700	What makes me feel anxious when I am visiting the doctor is wondering what my health problem is. There could be some kind of underlying issue that could be very serious and you don't know until you are actually checked out by the doctor.
0.333300	"Well I'm usually pregnant and towards the end of the pregnancy they ""check"" you for dilation. I just hate that. And I hate pap smears too, which are similar in uncomfortable feeling."
0.714300	"It's that stupid adage of ""What you don't know, won't hurt you"". I know it is bad to think such, but it is scary knowing that something is wrong. I often don't go to doctors until i need to out of fear that they will find something."
0.381000	Uncertainty is what would bother me the most. The uncertainty of if something is wrong and what to do if there is something wrong. 
0.666700	Knowing that I was unable to ascertain the cause or treatment necessary to overcome whatever the ailment happens to be. Knowing that my literal life is in another person's hands. It is an opportunity for life or death, the gravity of it gets to me.
0.857100	For one thing having an appointment at a certain time and then having to wait and wait.  Then when you finally see the doctor he spends very little time with you.  I get anxious about the outcome of my visit and what he will find.  My blood tends to rise a bit in this instance.
0.238100	i feel most anxious about what could be wrong with me i also dont like no knowing and waiting for awhile im a generally anxious person so when it comes to public events i just am not in my overall comfort zone
0.238100	When I first go in, I am worried about possibly having something that wont easily be found and treated properly.
0.142900	I don't usually get worried.  there was a time when I had my self convinced that I had ovarian cancer.  I went to the doctor to talk to her about it.  That day I was worried, but it wasn't anything about my actual doctor that gave me anxiety. It was me self-diagnosing myself that had me all worked up. 
0.857100	What makes me feel most anxious and worried is the fact I may not get the proper help I want. Sometimes doctors fail to understand what I am experiencing and I end up not getting much help.
0.714300	Basically I go when I have problems . So not knowing the issues makes it worse. I feel threatened because of how uncertain everything is.  
0.452400	I dislike going to the doctors in general- I have anxiety and hate needles. I pass out when getting blood drawn, they are unsympathetic...the list could go on... 
0.547600	I just get worried that my glucose numbers are not good enough for my doctor. I'm also worried that they will find something new that's wrong with me.
0.642900	You never know what your results are going to show so that can be nerve wracking. But also being examined fully by someone you donât know very well is just uncomfortable 
0.142900	I only really feel anxious if my daughter is very sick. I want to make sure that she gets the best treatment possible. I have a hard time when she is sick because I worry about her. Sometimes I am worried that she won't get the right treatment plan. Usually my anxiety is relieved when I actually talk to the doctor.
0.238100	I'm worried the doctor will see something that I didnt know was a problem.  Or that something that is bothering me is more serious that it initially seems.  
0.547600	Fear of the unknown.  I am worried about what she might find when doing an evaluation.  I am worried that she might find something wrong.
0.500000	I think its just going to the doctor that makes me anxious  I dont like going to the doctor because I am afraid something will be wrong and illl have to do all these tests
0.857100	Knowing that you don't have all the information, you need to basically take their word even if they aren't telling you the whole picture, and that you don't know what the outcome will be of certain medical procedures until after the fact.
0.714300	Well I consider myself rather poor so I always worry about my doctor finding some kind of condition I have , that would be very costly to cure. So basically I am afraid of the money I will have to spend. 
0.404800	I would be most anxious about something being wrong with me in general. My family has many hereditary health and autoimmune problems and I have a few myself. Several members of my family have also had cancer while young and I have shown some signs of potentially developing two types of cancer in the past. I am moderately concerned and worried about the possibility of developing cancer while relatively young like several relatives. I am anxious in general about talking about myself and having myself touched by another person. I have general anxiety and just don't really like talking to people much, especially about myself.
0.357100	I'm often worried that my health may have deteriorated since my last visit. May blood pressure or weight may have gone up, or some other medical condition may have arisen.
0.595200	I'm always afraid they won't take my concerns seriously, that they think I'm over-exaggerating my symptoms. I've had a doctor flat out tell me I was wrong even though I knew I was correct and it led to a fear that I just won't be listened to. 
0.428600	What makes me feel most anxious when I am at a doctor's office is when I have to take an eye exam, because I feel they never give me sufficient time to focus on what lens is better when I'm getting tested.
0.523800	I worry they are going to find a health condition. I'm always worried they will discover cancer. I also worry in general that my cholesterol will be too high, they will comment on my weight, and other routine health conditions. 
0.571400	It would be finding something terribly wrong with me, like cancer or an unknown illness. That's the worst kind of news a doctor can give someone.
0.333300	That they don't take me seriously. I have gone multiple times with the same symptoms and each time I am given the same prescription and physical therapy recommendation. This has gone on for 3 years.
0.690500	I do not feel comfortable in doctors office in general. It is the way I am. I watch for anything the doctor says that my end up costing me money.
0.547600	I'm not sure what makes me anxious when I go to the doctor, maybe it's the possibility of having to do more tests.
1.000000	I get really nervous around people in authority in general.  Add that to a situation where a person in authority is asking me all about myself what my daily life entails and it makes me extremely nervous even though I trust and respect my doctor. 
0.714300	I am always worried that the doctor may tell me that I have been diagnosed with a serious medical condition.
0.571400	I wouldn't want the doctor to find something negative. Also, the cost deters me from going to the doctor. Medical expenses are so exorbitant that I don't like to go to the doctor if I feel like I can avoid it.
0.238100	Again, it is not necessarily feeling these things outright and instead, just wanted to be prepared and anticipatory. Being aware increases the chances for finding the best solution. 
0.357100	The thing that makes me the most anxious is going in to see the doctor for something minimal and finding out that it was a serious problem. I still remember the time I went to the doctor with my mother to get her checked up and during the time she thought it would be a good idea for me to get checked out too. When we went there the nurse said that everything was fine with my mother so I felt relieved but when she went to my results she had said I had a few traces of kidney stones in me. I began to worry because I always saw myself as very healthy but she reassured me it wasn't that big of a deal.
0.404800	I already suffer from a panic disorder with anxiety so I tend to be anxious anytime I go out in public, whether it is for a doctor appointment or not. However there are certain factors that make me worry. If it is just a physical or a normal scheduled appointment then I do not worry so much. But if I am going in to get an injury looked at then I tend to worry about permanent damage. When I was a teenager I suffered rhabdomyolysis. I was very alarmed and it required a long hospital stay. I would get worried after I got out of the hospital because they were sure if  I would get full use of my limb after it healed.
0.785700	That they will tell me some stuff, and it will seem to make sense, but ultimately it won't help me with any of my problems and nothing will be resolved.
0.214300	I get the most anxious in expecting a negative outcome. Aside from that I am not really anxious or worried at all about visiting the doctor's office.
0.809500	I am very overweight and I'm always worried that doctor's will disregard me or judge me when they see my size and weight. I'm very self conscious about my weight and body type, and I also worry that doctor's will just see me as a problem due to my weight. 
0.714300	I think that most people walking into a doctor's office, even if they look and feel healthy, are anxious and worried about being diagnosed with something terrible. Just a few years ago I thought that I was quite healthy and was told at the age of 30 or 31 that I had very high cholesterol and had to start taking prescription medication to address the problem.  Every time I go to the doctor I'm worried that I might learn of a similar problem.
0.452400	If you're feeling under the weather and the cause is not immediately apparent, resulting in tests - and you need to wait on test results before treatment can be decided.
0.523800	The unknown, not knowing if what health check up could turn up or progress into something worse or more intense. Anxiety hits everyone, and just going to one would incur a little bit of worry or doubt when getting checked out and evaluated.
0.833300	I do not like to be exposed to other people's germs in the waiting room.  If I have something other than a routine condition, I often feel worried about the unknown.
0.738100	i am always worried that the doctor would tell me i have cancer or some other awful disease . the worst case  scenario is always in the back of my mind, im often a little anxious at the doctors office.i worry also about catching a virus from a previous patient because alot of people who go to the doctors office are very sick.
0.571400	I feel like everyone nowadays ends up with cancer or some other huge disease, even when symptoms aren't present. I am generally very healthy, but I do worry about the doctor finding something abnormal that may not have presented symptoms. I like to be in control and have a fear of the unknown. 
0.285700	I usually don't feel much anxious when visiting the doctor's office. Maybe because I used to visit the doctor's office when I was a child. The past experiences sometimes may make me a little anxious.
0.214300	I typically am not very anxious when I go to the doctor. The only time that I do worry is when I'm not sure what's going on with me. As I typically don't get sick, this is not really an issue for me. 
0.595200	I worry that there will be something wrong with me, something that will cost a lot of money to fix and I would not be able to cover the medication or procedure. I do not going to hospitals in general so that does not help my situation at all.
0.142900	I feel anxious and worried when I have to go and something is wrong that I can't figure out pretty much by myself because my mother died from multiple myeloma. It was not found until she was stage 4. So I am always anxious whe I have to wait for lab results.
0.666700	I am generally in good health so I don't need to visit the doctor's often.  When I do, it's usually for something that has me quite worried so it's just that.
0.619000	Never know if when going for a checkup for one thing, some other thing could be discovered. I guess the anxious feeling is that i do not fully understand everything that could be happening in my body until a checkup
0.428600	I am anxious about my health first. Secondly, I am afraid I will get huge medical bill I cannot afford.
1.000000	I have white coat syndrome. Going to the doctor's no matter what it is for makes me anxious or worried. I feel my blood pressure raising. There could be nothing wrong, but a cold and I still get all worked up.
0.642900	Learning the results of tests that I've had taken. I usually get scheduled for tests like cat scans to check my lungs. Waiting til my next appointment to learn the results of those tests makes me anxious to the point of almost being sick to my stomach.
0.142900	I have always been very nervous when I go to a doctor appointment. So that means when I sit down, and they take my blood pressure, it is sky high.
0.357100	Other than a routine physical the older i get the more i worry that there will be something wrong. I feel that the older i get the more i work to maintain a better state of health. In an emergency i am generally fearful of what the doctor is going to say.
0.714300	As I have gotten older, my Dr's visits have turned from normal visits about a cold or virus to more serious health concerns.  I now worry when I go see my Dr. that I am going to be told some bad news. 
0.166700	I have white coat syndrome.  Any Doctors office makes me nervous, you feel like you're being judged.  I have gotten mostly over that but a new doctor will still make me feel that way. When I was younger I had a particular doctor that talked down to me and was unkind and it stuck with me for a long time.
0.666700	i sometimes become worried because i tend to imagine the kind of disease they will find that i am suffering from,i fear the kind of injections and medications i will go through and at the same time i fear loosing my life because of illness
0.357100	I might get bad news or something unforeseen will rise and i might not be able to handle it. The thought of getting cancer has always frightened me. Even getting a dangerous virus has always scared me.
0.571400	I never know if itâs going to go okay. I have a heart condition and sometimes things look great and other times not so great. Itâs stressful and expensive. 
0.642900	I don't want the doctor to randomly tell me I've been doing something wrong, or that I have 2 months to live, or some type of cancer. All of those ideas freak me out. I don't want there to be something wrong with me. 
0.690500	In general, I would feel anxious because I would not be sure what the diagnosis would be.  Also, I'm always worried about having to buy medicine or take time off of work.  So I always feel apprehensive until I find out what the problem and treatment is.
0.714300	That they are going to perscribe me something generic that only helps maybe 10% of my issue or just tell me to take it easy and if it gets worse call like i came out here for a answer not to be told im nuts
0.285700	I have social anxiety so that always plays into my anxiousness. I also will sometimes worry that I will get diagnosed with something bad or that there will be a major problem when I go. Though it's usually in the back of my mind. 
1.000000	The doctor always takes a long time but they're always in a rush to leave. They always write things down but don't communicate. They don't make eye contact and they're always leaving and entering. 
0.142900	I usuall don't worry too much. The uncertainty of what may be found this time pops into my head but it is a minor issue.
0.738100	I am always worried that I have some form of cancer. I smoked for many years and did not take care of myself becuase I was taking care of others. Now I am suffering for it. I want to live a long life, but I fear cancer
0.381000	I fee anxius about visiting a doctor since i dont want any bad news, and i fear being diagnosed with something that would cost lots of money or would be deadly
0.571400	I would be worried about how I'm going to pay for the visit, and whether the problem would turn out to be something that I would never be able to pay for. 
0.333300	Finding out from the doctor that I have medical condition is what makes me most anxious or worried.  The medical condition may require taking medicine or seeing a specialist.  I always feel relieved when I go to the doctor for a physical and it turns out that nothing is wrong with me.
0.571400	My most anxious moments at the Dr's office involve tests which have been recommended and the realization that I will not be able to pay the co-pay and deductible required for most of the needed tests.
0.714300	I just never really know what to expect and I feel that it is a waste of time. There has been wrong diagnoses in the past with people, so who knows. It's like flipping a coin. I'd be more worried about what the doctors says if anything.
0.523800	I feel anxious about telling things to the doctor because I always feel like the doctors don't believe me or think my concerns are not important. I also feel anxious if I have to be undressed for an exam.
0.809500	I seem to get very anxious when seeing my doctor because I always forget what I need to tell them. I am usually worried about what I may find out at that visit. I sometimes feel worried that the doctor may think I am a little crazy because I do not know how to explain a certain symptom. I am sure they know most of the time what the patient is talking about as they have normally seen that problem before. But with myself I am not good at explain a certain pain or feeling. But as far as actually walking in the office and talking with the staff I always feel comfortable. 
0.142900	Nothing does as I do not go to the doctors at all. If i were to go to the doctors it would be something very serious that I need to get checked out with tests, so I would be worried about whatever I was getting tested for. 
0.523800	The main thing that makes me anxious when going to the doctor is wondering if they will find something very wrong with me. I worry about ever contracting a deadly disease where it is unlikely to be cured. This reason alone is why I make sure I see my doctor for my annual checkups. I want to know well in advance if I need to get something treated. 
0.690500	I am worried sometimes when I visit that my weight will be more than the previous visit.  I am worried to he get onto me possibly about the weight.  I am worried that the blood work could show some issues like high cholesterol.  I am worried that the blood test could show high liver levels which could be fatty liver. I am worried my blood pressure could be elevated.  The blood pressure maybe just elevated during that time because I am nervous about our visit.  Usually tho I feel very comfortable with my Dr.  
0.904800	When I see one of my specialists I am afraid she will find that something is wrong and that I will require surgery.  I have already had four of them for a medical condition I have.  She is a great, caring doctor but the fear of the unknown is the worst part.  I have an anxiety disorder as well so that makes the experience even worse.
0.452400	I worry that he will find something wrong with me that I am not aware of.  I get a little anxious when he runs tests and I am not sure why he feels they are needed.  I don't like the explanation that he runs them for all patients in my age group.  I understand that he is pro-active, but sometimes it worries me.
0.523800	The unknown is what worries me.  It's the idea of the doctor finding something wrong that could be potentially serious and leads to a bad outcome regardless of what a doctor can do.
0.238100	If I am not feeling well not knowing what is causing me to feel ill makes me anxious and worried. After the prognosis and diagnosis I start to settle down and relax. 
0.666700	I feel most anxious about some bad news I could get from the doctor's. I am overweight, so I am always worried that I could have a diagnosis related to that.
0.809500	"I am always concerned for surprises. I'm always afraid that they will find something ""new"" that is wrong with me, which is disheartening, considering how many chronic conditions I have."
0.166700	I just don't like going to the doctors office. I am a very healthy person, but the process of being in the doctors office does generate a very small amount of anxiety. Mostly the long waits. After I meet with the doctor, all is good.
0.642900	Mostly my fears are actually going to the hospital and getting sick. I also don't do well with waiting in long lines. I need to be able to get in and out. I also hate not having my records available online. 
0.761900	I always worry that the doctor will find something significantly wrong with me. For example, I am a cancer patient, and constantly worry that he will find my cancer has spread. No matter how simple the problem, I become very anxious prior to my appointment.
0.238100	I don't really get nervous that much. It's more about shots. I hate getting shots and i'm terrified of needles. That's really the only reason. Getting my flu shot was hell LOL.
0.666700	I am anxious that I will have a visit like my last one and that all he will see is my weight and not me. 
0.142900	I dont like getting blood tests. That is truly my only fear. Overall, i would say that I have no fear of the doctor. I am in generally decent health overall, so i dont have much to fear. 
0.357100	I feel anxious because I want to be better but most times I have something new that arises and adds to my disease debt. I try to remain optimistic but until they give you a positive result it is hard to do that so most times I am waiting on them to say something negative. I also just don't like waiting long lengths of time for the doctor to arrive. More times than not the doctor visit will require a needle for blood work so that makes me anxious as well. I am presented with multiple people before seeing the doctor which makes me feel like I have a huge problem that many people have to deal with. I just don't like having bad news.
0.881000	"I worry that the doctor will not take my concerns and thoughts seriously. I worry that I will be ignored and the doctor will think he knows what is best for me without listening to what I have to say.  I worry that the doctor will try to fit me into a ""box"" typical of other patients he treats and not treat me as an individual."
0.428600	I do not usually feel this way but when I do it is usually because I know what I am in for. I typically like to spend time self diagnosing before a visit to the doctor. I usually anticipate the most likely outcomes. I even watch the procedures online in so cases. Knowing whats coming and seeing it become my reality is a little nerve wracking. I get a little anxious from procedures involving me being naked. I think that is just uncomfortable in any case. I also do not enjoy pain so knowing I am getting some stitches can cause some anxiety. 
0.285700	I don't usually feel anxious or nervous when visiting a doctor.  I feel that whatever feedback I get, I can learn from it.
0.381000	To put it simply... fear of the unknown.  Everyone goes through this, unless they're a psychopath (I actually kind of envy them for that).  If you don't know what's wrong, and you don't know how serious it is, you're going to have that fear.  I's normal.  I'm actually wondering why this question is even necessary.  
0.214300	I feel dirty when I go into a doctors waiting room. And especially in the back room where you see the doctor. I think of all the sick people that are in the same area and it makes me feel very dirty. Like I need to take a shower as soon as possible or something.
0.261900	I worry that I come across as complaining about every little thing. I have a terrible habit of ignoring things for a long time until they become a big problem, and then going to the doctor. I decided I didn't want to do that, but now I feel as if I have been put through a ton of unnecessary testing this year because of my complaints to the doctors, and I worry that I am presenting myself as a hypochondriac
0.547600	When I have an acute problem that hasn't gone away on its own, I can feel pretty anxious. I can also feel anxious when I've been waiting for a long time.
0.976200	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is that the doctor will find something wrong with me, and that I could possibly be put on medication for the rest of my life, treating any condition instead of being able to cure it.
0.309500	"My body and my car share some interesting commonalities. When I take my car to a mechanic, I dread hearing, ""Well, it could be the alternator or it might be the wiring or maybe the starter.""  The same is true of a doctor's visit. The worst possible result is lack of clarity.  That being said, of course there are situations where lack of clarity is real, and as long as doctors have a plan for clarifying a situation, I'm OK. Not thrilled, but OK. The main way that doctors reduce my anxiety and worry is by convincing me that they are telling me what they know or believe in complete honesty. If I don't think a doctor is leveling with me, then I get really anxious. I would rather have a truthful, irascible doctor than a pleasant, uninformative one."
0.881000	Well I really can't blame the doctor for this one. I have just always felt very anxious about visiting a doctor (or dentist, for that matter). I am always fearful that they will find something wrong with me that I was unaware of, or that the visit will entail pain I don't want to deal with (such as shots, drawing blood, etc.) I wouldn't say I'm a problem patient though, it's just that I am quietly anxious about my appointments. 
0.285700	There have been times when a test or exam turned up something questionable that needed to be explored with further tests. I have had a few cancer scares. Those times were anxious for me, because I knew there was a possibility I would have cancer. Thankfully, I never did.
0.285700	That I will need to have shots or I will hear the word cancer. I do not mind the exam and any drugs or other things I would need to do.
0.142900	I am not anxious, but I have had a biopsy before and that did cause a bit of anxiety. In that case it was just hoping that the biopsy was benign and not cancer. The anxiety stems from unknown health problems that could be present.
0.404800	I worry that they may try to push a drug on me that will end up hurting me or ruining my life. Of course, I'm very resistant to that and I would reject anything that I couldn't research before I took it. I just feel like I have to keep my guard up and make sure that I'm doing what's right for me in my understanding of things, regardless of what the doctor wants. 
0.428600	I have had health concerns in the past and I worry about things that may come up again when I go to see the doctor.  Since I do not know what he is going to tell me, I naturally am anxious about what I am about to hear.  Those who say they are not anxious are either lying, or just ignorant about what can happen to peope as they get older.  I work in a profession that has a lot of people having health issues and these concerns travel with me when I go in to see the doctor as well.
0.761900	that i will be belittled, and my concerns wont be addressed because they will make up their mind about it with little information and dont do a full exam.
1.000000	I am very nervous about having my body violated or put through examinations that I am not consenting to. Many times doctors have forced me to succumb to treatment that I explicitly said I didn't want, so I have constant anxiety about seeing them. I have been sent away in a police car too many times by care providers that refuse to give me the treatment I need.
0.809500	Worried that they'll find something seriously wrong - or worse, they'll miss something seriously wrong. Worried that they'll suggest I change my lifestyle in ways that make me unhappy.
0.809500	I feel that sometimes when I go to the doctor, I might not get what I am looking for right away. I also fear if I can afford it or if I am diagnose with something that can hurt my health and my future. 
0.142900	I always feel like they may tell me something I dont want to hear or something thats going to be hard for me to correct. I dont like bad news and I never want to hear bad news at all
0.619000	I was always somewhat anxious about all of my prenatal visits. I had struggled with infertility and had experienced a miscarriage prior, so everything related to the pregnancy made me nervous. It wasn't specific to the doctor. 
0.309500	I just get anxiety and my chest tightens up.  I am not sure why.  I have high blood pressure and it is always worse when I visit the doctor.  
0.142900	Going to the doctor's office can be a real source of anxiety. ... examination, then all that time sitting there is probably making you dwell on your worries 
0.261900	The only thing that I would feel anxious about is whether the doctor is going to find something wrong with my health.I have minor kidney disease, which worries me slightly, and my mother has diabetes- so I'm uneasy about my a1c readings
0.833300	I am most anxious about the cause of the problems I'm having as well as whether or not I'm wasting money with a particular doctor who won't address the problems until other costly procedures have been completed. 
0.642900	Finding out about something that may be a short term or long term sickness.  Having to change my lifestyle for a long term or permanent time.
0.285700	"I always have this general feeling that I will receive bad news when I visit the doctor's office even though I usually don't. I'm a healthy individual. But there's always a sense of ""What don't I know?"" that might pop up. Receiving test results always makes me a bit anxious because of a false positive test that I received one time in my life."
0.785700	I am just an anxious person anyway, so anytime I have to go see my doctor I usually feel this way. I feel like when the doctor walks in he is going to give me the worst news ever, but it is not like that at my usual doctors appointments.
0.833300	Mainly that being sick sucks and there are any number of things that could go wrong. It's no fault of the doctor's and is inherent to my own temperament. 
0.142900	I am worried whether my weight, blood pressure, white blood cell will change for the worse. When I go for a screening whether it will show something I do not want to know I can fight.
0.238100	I think he will give me some bad news about my bloodwork or that I've gained too much weight.  Ultimately though it always goes better than expected.
0.619000	There is always a chance that something bad can come up. Being in the office knowing that you may find out awful information is stressful. Likewise, if you haven't been listening to the doctors recommendation, you bound to get yelled at  for that.
0.523800	Sometimes I go into a doctor fearing the worst when I go into see him. There have been times in the past with previous doctors that their first diagnoses wasn't always the correct one. For that reason alone I'm weary sometimes.
0.404800	ONE THING THAT MAKES ME ANGRY OR WORRIED IS ABOUT THE HEALTH TIPS WHENEVER THEY PROVIDE ME , BUT I FOLLOW THEM RARELY WITH THAT WHILE I GO FOR A CHECKUP I AM SACRED ONLY FOR THAT PURPOSE .
0.642900	My health isn't stellar, and I often worry that there's going to be a new condition pop up that I haven't had to contend with before. 
0.404800	Last years diagnoses of cancer and then surgery and then a good diagnoses that they had caught it early.  That does make my appointments more stressful than before.  I think even before that that you wonder or worry more about your health as you get older.
0.142900	I have felt anxious or worried only once when seeing my doctor, and that weas when I had a naccident which fractured my hip.  I had never before experienced a broken bone and was fearful about how painful or long the treatment for recovery would be.
0.619000	When I don't know what is wrong with me and the doctor can't seem to find out either. It make me anxious and uncomfortable, but I try to remain calm so I can get accurate tests done.
0.381000	The unknowns make me feel the most anxious and worried. If for example I am having a very bad pain and I have no idea what it could be I feel very anxious waiting to find out because I always feel like it will be something bad. 
0.238100	Nothing really. I just go there and they take care of things. It takes a bit of extra time out of my day but it's only a hour. 
0.476200	I worry that I might have a serious illness.  I don't have much money, so I can't really afford to be sick.
0.142900	I usually do not feel anxious or worried.  I have not had any serious health issues to date.  I sometimes get a little anxious waiting for blood test results.
0.571400	I think its probably fear of the unknown... or if I know or think I know what's going on, its a fear of dealing with the issue and what comes with it.
0.881000	I worry that something will be wrong with me. I worry that she will criticize me for not having lost weight or exercising enough.
0.595200	That I will not be believed when I say I am in pain outside of the normal, that they will decide things about my health based on my appearance rather than my symptoms or not do the right testing because they think they know what my problem is without checking
0.500000	I feel anxious at a doctor's visit whenever I think there might be a possibility of something being seriously wrong (like the time I found a breast mass) or if I feel like the visit and/or tests might be very expensive.
0.452400	My biggest fear is that he would find something really wrong and need me to come back for further treatment. I guess that's a good thing in general, as I would be identifying a health problem... so I guess the anxiety would come from the possibility of having that problem at all.
0.142900	Anticipation of receiving possible negative news.  No one wants to hear anything negative at the doctor's office.
0.381000	I don't ever feel overly anxious. I usually go when I need to have an ailment treated with medication. Diagnosis is normally simple and routine. 
0.571400	I am worried first and foremost about the cost of procedures.  Next, I'm afraid of being misgendered and then misracialized.
0.904800	Nothing that the doctor did or said, but mostly what I might have wrong with me. I am naturally anxious in these types of situations because I always fear the worst, and getting any sort of negative medical news can be devastating for me. 
0.142900	"It makes me nervous to think about expressing some kind of embarrassing or personal symptoms that might not seem ""normal"". "
0.785700	I think what make me anxious is just the whole environment of being at the doctor's office. It is not a comfortable feeling at all. It makes me feel very anxious. Further it makes me worried because I always feel like they are going to say things that are terrible. Or that the doctor is going to do tests I do not want nor like. In all the atmosphere of the doctor's office makes me anxious at best. It is not a good feeling. It just evokes bad feelings and the want to not even go. The anticipation sitting in the examination room waiting for the doctor not only creates anxiety but also worry. I have never been to the doctor's office and can say I felt at ease and calm. The whole experience of going to the doctor is just not conducive of good feelings. 
0.404800	Social anxiety is one of those things that you have to keep facing, over and over, no matter how scary it is. If you let it take over, it'll get too hard to even leave your house. I was terrified to get help, too. It took weeks before I finally gathered up the courage to make the call. I arrived for my appointment early so I could have time to sit in the car and compose myself before I went in. Once I was in the doctor's office, I shook so much that I could barely grip a pen. My voice came out in rapid little bursts, and I was drenched in sweat.
0.619000	I feel anxious when I walk into a new doctor office. I also hate going to some doctors because they are slow or way too quick in my opinion.
0.333300	"For the past couple of years my Dr has been monitoring some ""suspicious nodules "" in my lung. So I always dread going in after having the xrays or Cat Scans done to monitor it. My dad died of lung cancer so it scares me and I dread going in to find out if its ok or not"
0.285700	If the doctor hesitate to tell me about my health reports after examination i would feel most anxious and worried.
0.452400	That a symptom is more than I thought it was. That they're going to judge me for something and give me worse care. That they'll do something that my insurance doesn't cover and I won't realize it until I get a huge bill.
0.714300	I get very nervous about hearing bad news. That I am dying, or that my blood pressure is too high. I have always been afraid of doctors.
0.428600	I am always worried about bad news or if something is seriously wrong with me. It's always anxious when you find out something is wrong with you or if you need to change something in your diet.
0.142900	I am most anxious that the doctor will find something fatally wrong with me. Though I do not believe it is very likely any time soon, I worry about such a diagnosis happening one day. As someone who has a history with cigarettes and medications, I would not be surprised if I experienced a bad prognosis at some point in time. 
0.690500	What would make me feel most anxious is taking test, removing my clothing, getting shots or being told that I have a disease. Most doctors office visits are stressful for me because I have chronic anxiety, however, sometimes I am able to calm myself down during the office visit. I do worry about germs of other people as well, and worry later if I could get sick from them. I usually rush home and shower. 
0.285700	The only time I fell anxious or worried when going to the doctor is when I think that I might have something wrong with me.
0.738100	I am pretty anxious in general, but working in healthcare, I feel I know a lot of the bad things that can happen. It's hard for me to get some of those things out of my head.
0.142900	I'm not anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's for an exam. I don't really like waiting and I dread the expense, but nothing about the appointment itself gets my very worried
0.595200	I worry that the doctor will find something going on in me that I will not be able to afford the treatment for, or that the treatment will have serious side effects. I worry that the doctor might see something embarrassing or shame me for being overweight.
0.619000	I worry that something is going to be wrong with me that I can not fix.  I don't like waiting in the waiting room or in the exam room.  I usually can't wait to get out of there.  
0.428600	I don't really feel anxious about visiting the doctor, I feel like I am wasting my time. I'm not worried either.
0.261900	Its the anticipation. I know I could feel find but they chance that they find something or my blood work shows elevated LFTS or other medical issues such as anemia sometimes worries me.
0.238100	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is just not knowing.  Not knowing on a few visits if I was going to have to do a basic test as the hospital and all the trouble that entails.  That's all. 
0.690500	I always assume the worst. I usually think that something is going to come back worse then what I initially went to the doctor for.
0.333300	depends on why I'm there, last time was for my back sciatica and I was expecting a worse case thing because the pain was severe, but it turned out not to be a major issue and in a few months I was good again
0.142900	If I am waiting test results that can be a little nerve wracking.  I do not like to wait for results to tests or blood work. 
0.738100	I am always nervous about what they are going to say about my health or my conditions.  I generally never really get anything to positive, so I always try to prepare myself for what is to come.  If I get a good report, then I'd rather be pleasantly surprised, then be hopeful and become disappointed.  
0.404800	Because I have a physician's assistant who is in our family I can usually get a good take on what is wrong with me. However, when something major happens such as the prostate cancer I went through and still must be checked on a periodic basis ... I admit I feel a little anxious and worried before the visit is over. Once I get the all clear signal I am back to normal. I usually do not sweat over it until the day of the visit.
0.547600	I am not sure. I guess it would be if it is just a check up or for a specific reason. If it is for a specific reason then I am always worried about what they may find or tell me.
0.523800	I don't feel a lot of these emotions. I usually am a pretty calm, cool, and collected person that tends not to make mountains out of mole hills. Due to the good fortune of never having a whole lot of serious health problems, my anxiety around doctors is pretty low, i'm not scared of needles, i believe in science and most of western medicine. I do experience some anxiety when waiting for test results, especially for serious things HIV, Hepatitis, Ect. I feel annoyance sometimes at having to wait so long in the waiting rooms, and do get a bit nervous about actually contracting diseases or sicknesses from waiting rooms and hospital lobbies. 
0.142900	I don't feel worried about the doctor because I feel the worst is over now ill get some medicine to feel better
0.476200	Its just embarassing. I am a modest person, so having ANYONE see me naked or half dressed is stressful
0.428600	SOMETIMES I WORRY THAT I'VE WAITED TOO LONG TO GO SEE THE DOCTOR ABOUT AN ISSUE AND THUS I CREATED AN INSTANCE WHERE MY TREATMENT WILL LAST LONGER THAN IT NEEDED TO OR THAT MY TREATMENT WILL COST MORE THAN IT WOULD HAVE HAD I GONE TO THE DOCTOR EARLIER.
0.571400	I don't like anything to change my schedule.  When I go to the doctor I feel anxious and worried.  But, the doc is friendly enough I relax.  I just want to get everything done.
0.642900	I am always anxious or worried about receiving bad news. I never want to end up leaving their offices knowing that I could have done something differently, but now that I did not, I will suffer in some way.
0.285700	Nothing, really.  There's the 1% chance that I might get blindsided by bad news, but that is very unlikely.  The only somewhat realistic concern I might have is if I was diagnosed with a condition that runs in my family, especially ones I'm actively trying to avoid.
0.857100	I have panic attacks,which I control with medication.  But, when I go to the doctor, I get very scared about them taking my blood pressure.  One time it was very high and they were concerned, but it was because I was having a panic attack in the office.  Now I always worry that my blood pressure will be high, and consquently my blood pressure is high!
0.142900	I usually don't feel nervous or worried when I go to the doctor's office.  The things that make me a little nervous are waiting in the waiting room and wondering which medications I might need if I'm sick.
0.642900	Not knowing what the outcome of what i am there for. Telling me things that i am probably not going to want to hear. Being told i am doing something wrong. I feel anxious not knowing the results of tests i have had taken. Prescribing pills that have side effects is nerve wracking.
0.500000	I meant to put anxious and nervous sometimes around doctors because it depends on why I am going to the doctors for. If it is something serious then I would feel nervous and anxious. 
0.833300	 Going to the doctors always has a component of dread for me. I fear my test results in particular after a period when I have let myself go physically or not watched my diet carefully. My particular fears are; cancer and signs of cognitive decline. My cholesterol is another concern as it is nearly always just outside the parameters and I am nearly always chided for that. I am diabetic but my A1c results have been consistently good for many years now. I dread going to the psychiatrist for anxiety meds because I really feat mental aging and there is nearly always a test for that involved with the visit.
0.190500	The feeling that something could be wrong that I dont know about that the doctor realizes is what makes me most anxious when visting the doctors office.
0.642900	If my doctors find something unusual if i visit them that makes me worried. Once they find out that my certain blood level is not in sync i can't just ignore them most of the time they look after their patient. Also just going to visit doctors itself is worrisome. The thought it self will make me thinking if they find out something going on with me and then i have to go through other diagnostics taste. That takes time, money and more stress for my family.
0.333300	I feel anxious mainly because I have general anxiety with my life. But it is the idea of not yet knowing what is wrong with me. And I generally think about the worst case scenario.
0.476200	what makes you feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is just general anxiety. Or general worry nothing specific
0.738100	When I go to the doctor for something that could be serious, this is when I get worried or anxious. I hate not being in control of a situation and I think for me not knowing is what worries me.
0.714300	Well I am an anxious person to begin with so just having to go to the doctor is already enough to make me anxious. Plus it makes me feel vulnerable and uncomfortable sitting there being examined, often times in that flimsy robe thing. On top of that there is the overall worry of what might be wrong with you.
0.857100	I'm most worried about what the process is going to be and how awkward it'll feel. I'm more comfortable with a woman being my doctor and I have a male doctor, so I'm slightly uncomfortable.I'm also worried about if something is going to be found wrong.
0.523800	I'm generally calm in the doctor's office, but if I'm going in with something unknown, where I'm not certain what it is, there is a general anxiousness about the severity or seriousness of what I may be told. That I'm thinking it's something minor but it's something major. I have a bit more anxiousness than others, since I've had the experience where I received unexpected news that I had a serious disease before.
0.571400	I feel anxious or worried sometimes when  visiting the doctor because I am unsure if my illness may be something worse. I also get worried that I will receive bad news about my health at some point during the visit. I never fully calm down until I have left the office with a good bill of health.
0.547600	I am worried about the diagnosis I may receive and whether or not I will be able to afford the treatment or medications I need. My main concern is the cost of treatment.
0.547600	Not knowing what to expect when meeting with a new doctor. This applies to meeting new people in general, especially those with some authority (ex.: new boss).  Meeting new people always makes me a bit nervous.
0.547600	Not knowing what my condition is like and the chances of getting some news that might make me worry. Also I worry about the length of time it might take, because often I've waited ridiculous amounts of time. 
0.595200	When I go to the doctor since I have hypothyroidism, I usually have to get lab work.  I have small veins so it can be difficult to draw labs sometimes.  I usually get anxious more about this than anything else.  There isn't usually anything the doctor did, but just don't always enjoy the tests they put you through.
0.428600	The fact that they're staring at me, listening to every word, makes me feel pressured and anxious.  I am afraid that I might accidentally forget something I need to tell them regarding symptoms or such.  I get particularly worried when I tell them my symptoms and they look at me like I'm a crazy person over-reacting.
0.976200	I have not taken good proactive care of my health- and I would be extremely anxious that I have some condition like cancer or heart disease. I feel like I would be mostly alone and struggle badly to fight any condition or disease well with the mindset and resources I have at this time.
0.928600	I feel most worried about my doctor judging me due to my health or possible mental problems I am experiencing. I do not feel I am able to be completely honest. 
0.142900	Like many other patients, I am more anxious when running my regular checkups and expecting the results from the lab. I would also be quite nervous if there would be a complication and he would need to send me to the hospital.
0.285700	I think the worst is when you go into the doctor's office and you feel bad and you are not sure what the doctor is going to say.
0.619000	mainly just being at the office knowing that i may have to get blood drawn or something, or if i have to get a pap test that makes me very anxious b/c it is painful
0.523800	I feel anxious that maybe i have not taken care of myself as much as i should and that it may have lead to some form of problem that i do not notice that needs to take care of. I have had conditions in the past that i worry may come back
0.642900	I always worry that they will diagnose with something different illness or if they will prescribe some different medicine which at the end might have some sided effects.   
0.142900	Usually it's just stepping on the scale and seeing that it has crept on up again.  That and wondering if my blood pressure will be up or down.  I have no problems with any physical exam she may give, but of course may be anxious to find out what is causing the symptoms - whether it's serious for my health or just a minor problem.
0.500000	Right now I'm uneasy because the treatment that has worked for me in the past is being denied to me, and the new treatment has caused a 50 lb weight gain (I was a perfectly healthy, trim weight before!). And when that comes up, doctors don't like to acknowledge the treatments I am on are the main culprit of the weight gain. They just blame me, which is dumb since I have ALWAYS been trim, and was looking good at 45 before all these stupid treatments. 
0.500000	In general I always get tense visits to the doctors because I always think the worst of my diagnoses and it makes me nervous to think about the results, it is a tense situation and I think it is something that all patients experience
0.523800	Usually I go to the doctorâs office for a reason â recently I had a skin cancer diagnosis â so Iâm obviously concerned about the results of a visit. Also, Iâm kind of getting tired of the hassle of healthcare. I have a growth that needs looked at â I know thatâs going to be at least four visits. The initial visit, another visit to get the growth removed, another visit to have a follow-up (either stitches removed or just a wound check for healing), and another check in a couple of months to make sure nothing is growing back. Iâm not anxious about regular check-ups very much.
0.261900	I wonder how the tests will come out. I wonder if my blood pressure is high, although its been normal for some time now. There is uncertainty. 
0.785700	They will tell me what I am doing wrong based off of what other people in my race do. A doctor told me to stop in fried chicken when that is something I rarely eat. Not all people of color eat or like fried chicken.
0.619000	A male OB/GYN threatened to impregnate me during an examination. He said he was joking, but I didn't go back to an OB/GYN for years after that because I would start to feel anxious while trying to make an appointment
0.166700	I don't really get anxious or worried at the doctor most of the time. Sometimes if I have a problem that could be potentially serious I'll feel uncomfortable, but that has only happened once or twice. I also don't really like undressing at the doctor, but I opt not to and my doctor is fine with it.
0.285700	I do not like to wait for test results to say what is going on with my overall health I like to know right away what is happening and going on .
0.309500	Sometimes when I go to the doctors office and it is something more serious my mind often goes to the worst case scenario and how my life would be impacted if something is really wrong with my health. I worry that it might be some difficult procedure needed to make me well again.  
0.309500	I usually don't get anxious.  They only times that I really am worried or anxious is if I know I am going to a dr. that doesnt listen to me or I think won't.  Or if it is for one of my children and I know something is wrong with them.
0.761900	I am not e needle person. In fact my chart lets the nurses know I have a hard time with needles. I have high blood pressure, and have to get my blood drawn every now and then, so I worry about that.
0.500000	Mainly the outcome of the visit makes me nervous. As a person that has had a few medical conditions, it always makes me a little uneasy to have a check up not knowing if something is wrong again. Having to take additional tests, such as x-ray's or bloodwork is something that always makes me nervous. While I was sick I would be anxious before every appointment because I would be afraid that the doctor may have found something cancerous or seriously life threatening. 
0.785700	I am worried that there will be something wrong with me.  I am worried that I will walk out sick or on several medications.  
0.833300	That their profits are more concerning than my health. that they would rather me be on 17 different pills , all with adverse side effects than smoke a few joints a day which has a better effect at my treatment.
0.833300	because I have so many different problems with my health I don't know what is going to be next because it seems like every time I go to the doctor something else is wrong
0.476200	I think I feel apprehensive whenever I have to reschedule an appointment or have to wait far longer than anticipated prior to seeing the doctor or when having to wait while s/he checks on a particular result.
0.547600	I feel a little anxious about doctor visits in general. The clinical setting makes me feel a little uncomfortable and it usually ends up being a source of work for myself later in order to continue my healthcare. 
0.738100	In most cases the cause of anxiety is usually the uncertainity sorounding a test whose outcome is unknown. We do not have control over outcomes of tests and however compassionate the physician is, I always get worried. I believe it's normal though.
0.523800	I feel anxious and worried that perhaps someone will make a mistake that very well could have been avoided.
0.761900	I think that doctors ask many questions. Also, they search for abnormalities. This can make me feel uneasy because I don't know what the next observation or diagnosis will be regarding my health issues. Also, I feel uneasy when I have to have my blood pressure checked. 
0.690500	Mainly I worry that my good luck has finally run out and they find a major medical issue that has to be dealt with.  Possible crippling financial costs of a discovered medical issue causes me considerable worry.
0.142900	I feel nervous when something is physically wrong with me and I have no idea what it is. I get nervous when I know it could be a costly visit as well. 
0.857100	I am always anxious and worried so it would be no different in the doctor's office. I guess I would be concerned that I would find out that I had some incurable disease or something at the doctor's office.
0.547600	When the doctor recommends that I take some medication that I am not very familiar with. I read about some possible side-effects but my doctor does not seem very affected by that. That makes me worried because I'm unsure if something may be a big deal or not.
0.404800	When I visit my Doctor I'm worried that he will find something seriously wrong with me. He is upfront about my health issues and wouldn't hold back if he found some thing wrong with me. 
0.357100	I rarely feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office. My health is reasonable and most issues are fairly common at this point. 
0.761900	Getting a new diagnoses or starting new treatment always sucks.  Waiting for them to come in with lab results is always a worrisome time too, not knowing if things are going the way we scare hoping and the anticipation is scary,
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting doctor's office. I believe and trust in god. I am going to tell my issues and the doctor might help me based on her knowledge.
0.881000	I can't really explain what makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor. I am nervous when I go there no matter what. It doesn't matter if I have a current health issue or not. Getting my blood taken amps up my anxiousness though because I am afraid of needles. I always feel like I'm going to get bad news at the doctor. I think a lot of it has to do with my father and how he ended up dying. He had cardiovascular disease and me and all of my siblings also have some form of it. I lost 3 siblings this past year from heart related issues with no warning signs. 
0.214300	Though not prone to hypochondria, there is something about waiting for information about your health when you are at the doctor's office for other than a routine checkup...
0.523800	I worry because when I go to the doctor it is usually because i have been having some symptoms and the doctor is going to tell me what is wrong, and I dont want anything to be wrong
0.881000	"I am worried about something very bad being wrong with me, and the potential that it will hurt me, my family, or cost lots of money and time.  If something very bad is wrong, all of those things I just mentioned will cause even more anxiety, every day without going away for a long time.  I am worried about how this will be perceived by my doctors. I am not this sort of people on a daily basis when I am ""fine"", I am most anxious in the doctors office because when I am there, it is because something is already potentially wrong.  Doctors generally try to prescribe anxiety or anti-depressants which I continually turn down for various reasons.  So then I an anxious about how they perceive me, and about how that they are wrong about what they are thinking about me overall."
0.523800	Well, if I'm going to the doctor's office (other than for a routine checkup) it's because I think something is wrong. If I think something is wrong, I'm worried about what that might be! Although usually they don't find anything to start with, then it's rounds of tests and exams and more uncertainty, which is stressful.
0.381000	My biggest fear is that I have something terminal and that when they examine me they will discover something terrible.  I am very anxious to get the results of tests and screenings.
0.714300	I don't like when there is something wrong with me and I don't know what it is. My fears get the best of me and I worry a lot.
0.642900	I worry that something will be wrong with me. I also have been gaining weight and get nervous when I have to get on a scale anymore. I don't want to be unhealthy.
0.738100	I have never enjoyed going to the doctor. I feel like their is a lack of privacy and sensitivity. Sometimes you are made to feel like just a body and not a person. And of course, worrying that something might be wrong with you.
0.595200	Thinking about whether I can explain my condition exactly or not is one thing that makes me anxious. Expressing condition is difficult. Also, when getting result of test, I will be anxious because there is no grantee if the result is good one. Especially after having PAP test and mammography, I become so anxious to hear the result.
0.857100	That they are always going to tell me worst case. I also fear that I will be looked down upon because I don't really understand what they are telling me. I have anxiety just thinking about my next appointment.
0.714300	When visiting the doctors off I feel scared more than anything due to the concern that anything can happen. I always feel nervous when entering the doctors office due to just the unknown of what could happen upon entering.
0.404800	will not get the information I need because we all know they spend very little time with each client
0.285700	What makes me anxious about the doctors office is more so when they make you wait and wait in the examining room to see the doctor.  It's the physical atmosphere of the sterile environment that gets to me if I have to sit in that little room too long.  I'm not anxious about actually seeing the doctor because he is familiar to me and I trust him completely.  It's the equipment and the environment I don't like.
0.476200	That I will end up with another short term solution and no clear answer. In three months I will be in the same situation and he will just do the same thing and I don't see progress.
0.428600	Just getting routine check ups makes me nervous because I have been really sick as of late. I had a tumor before and lately I have been sick along those same lines again.
0.523800	I don't know exactly why I just get a little nervous when I go to the doctor or the dentist.  I am nervous and then I am relieved when I find out I am okay.  even if there's an issue, I am still relieved.  I think that just not knowing, and uncertainty about one's health is nerve-wracking.
0.190500	Mostly just when I have to get shots or have tihngs happen that might hurt in some way. Normal things are completely fine
0.309500	If I have all of my children with me Iâm only anxious that they will behave.  Iâm sometimes anxious that if I donât agree with what the doctor says I wonât feel bold enough to question it to their face.  I feel anxious when thereâs a disconnect between what they believe about a topic and what I believe.  I donât want to appear like I know more than the doctor, like I question their authority.  I feel anxious about not being in agreement with the doctor because I want to do what is right.  I donât like feeling like I have to go research on my own to make that determination.  
0.500000	I'm usually nervous that they will find something severely wrong with me, like cancer. So I avoid going to the doctor as often as I can. I also tend to get jumbled thoughts and get extremely nervous and it's hard for me to articulate to them what I have going on or what I may need. It also doesn't help that when I do speak up, I get shot down and they just assume it's something that I don't need to be concerned about.
0.738100	The first worrying thought in my mind is always the possibility of being told some new negative information, such as my health has worsened or I have developed some entirely new health complication. I also don't like the thought of having to need some new medication since I'm already on several. Other than that, one of the main things that I'm always anxious about is the possibility of having to get a blood exam, since I am extremely terrified of needles.
0.714300	the feeling that given my age i might be diagnosed with a serious, life-threatening or costly condition. Or even worse, I condition for which I am referred to a specialist and they disagree in prognosis with the primary physician. 
0.428600	Getting weighed every single time makes me anxious. My white coat blood pressure makes me anxious... I tell the person who takes my blood pressure before the doctor comes in to wait a few minutes and ask me the standard questions and refer to my online chart BEFORE taking my blood pressure. But-they never listen to me, take it anyway and it comes out high. Then when the doctor comes in I tell him that told the assistant again to wait to take my bp(for the umpteenth time) and he takes it and it's fine.
0.642900	That they are going to find something alarming or that they are going to give me some piece of advice that will be difficult or unpleasant to take.
0.309500	I sometimes worry that something will be found that will come as a shock or a scary diagnosis.  I also worry some kind of testing will need to be done
0.642900	When a doctor tells me that they are concerned about something and we need to run tests. Then when those tests take forever to come back with the results. That is the worst feeling.
0.857100	I'm worried the doctor will tell me something bad. Being pregnant I'm worried the doctor will tell me something is wrong with the baby and I don't want that 
0.666700	That I will find out something negative or bad about my health. Not only would it be bad healthwise, but it would cost more money. And more medical bills is a nightmare in the US. 
0.619000	I think I would mostly be worried or uneasy about not knowing what is wrong with me medically, and waiting for the tests to come back, or finish the doctor's examination before I can find out what is going on. So, it's mostly just a case of uncertainty or a fear of the unknown.
0.714300	Using my recent visit, I worry about the cost of the visit itself, the work they want done, and anything else (kind of like a lawyer's fees for responding to emails, or making phone calls) that needs to be done. That is number one. Number two, is just being told there might be things wrong with you when you feel like you are pretty good. It creates a psychological tendency to worry about the issue, potentiating the extremity of the issue.
0.142900	I feel the most anxious when I'm at the doctor's office and have to have blood tests. I usually end up getting light headed and fainting. I am terrible with blood and the nurse must give me some smelling salts to get me back. It's terrible, i'm the most queazy person on earth and it is so embarrassing. I am trying to overcome my fears.
0.857100	That he or she will find something wrong with me that I did not know about. Also, that they would tell me what I am doing to stay healthy is not good enough or not working.
0.523800	I feel as if my doctor is going to tell me either something is terribly wrong with me or that i need some sort of risky procedure
0.404800	The only thing I get anxious about is when I have to get a flu shot or my blood drawn. I have needles and they freak me out otherwise I am fine.
0.785700	I tend to overthink every little situation. It's not the visit to the doctor's office that worries me or makes me anxious. It's the diagnosis that scares me. Whenever I catch something or develop a cold, my mind always seems to convince me that it's something serious. So, of course, my trips to the doctor have me feeling very anxious until I get a proper diagnosis and realize it's not that bad.
0.976200	I'm most anxious about weighing myself. I have really bad body issues and haven't been able to lose pregnancy weight. 
0.142900	I sometimes dread getting bad test results or trying a new mediciation/treatment that might give me bad side effects. I also don't enjoy needles so that gives me anxiety. 
0.857100	I am fearful of any health conditions I might be diagnosed with, nervous about the vitals, taking of blood, and of the office in general.
0.476200	Not knowing what will come out his mouth about thre test he just ran on me.  You always go in thinking hey I do this right, but still not knowing what came from these test blood work.  That has me a little worried
0.357100	The thought of the doctor finding something else wrong that I wasn't aware of or couldn't fathom. I don't like surprises like that.
0.500000	I don't like needles. I don't mind going to the doctor that much, but I know that if they are going to be drawing blood that it's going to make me uneasy. I also feel anxious about my own body weight and self conscious about it.
0.571400	School and my future makes me feel worried about my future. There is a lot of pressure I have going on in my life and it can be a little too much at times.
0.714300	I am worried when checking up on chronic conditions, wanting to make sure that I am not about to hear bad news about my health. I think a doctor's office inherently makes people nervous. 
0.738100	I just always feel like there might be something wrong that they are going to discover and that puts me on edge. 
0.404800	Just being in a random cold room makes me nervous. I am also anxious about what it is i have that made me go to the doctor in the first place. I always worry it's going to be something huge.
0.642900	I just dont like talking about personal things with other people so it makes me anxious in general, not just because they are a doctor.
0.190500	Generally, I don't feel anxiety when I go to the doctor.  I take very good care of myself and I have good sense of when something is wrong.  It is only in those moments where I don't know what is behind a mystery ache or pain that I feel anxious.  
0.285700	I really do not feel anxious or worried when I visit a doctor, other than the off chance that there might be a serious illness and not just a routine sickness going on. Although I tend to be optimistic that most things I would experience are very treatable. 
0.761900	I worry that I will be referred to yet another doctor who will then refer me to another doctor. I am also worried that I will be told that the only thing they can do is give me another pill to take. 
0.261900	i am sometimes feeling so because i don not know what he is going to say this time. one thing about doctors is that they must see what is wrong with your body. so going to them can make think ahead what to hear from them
0.333300	Its entirelt possible that my health is such that the my doctor might find a problem that will be of major concern to me. Luckily I have never left the doctors office with such worries as my doctor has always been upfront with me about my health.
0.857100	When visiting a doctor's office, I'm mainly afraid of 1) how uncomfortable the examination or procedure may be, and 2) any possible bad news I may receive as a result/following the examination.  Usually everything else (work, payment for services, etc.) is secondary.
0.761900	I might get information I don't like about a medical condition. I might have to have an awkward conversation with the doctor. The doctor may have to examine me, and an unfamiliar person doing that is not the most comfortable situation. 
0.381000	I have had a lump removed from my breast and I have to have it checked to make sure it has not returned or any others have formed. I get anxious when I know it is time to have my check up.
0.547600	No one likes getting naked and wearing a flimsy paper robe and being poked around, and having the prospect of bad news.
0.142900	I don't think I ever feel anxious or worried. I think if I did, the only reason would be if my blood work panels came back normal. My doctor always treats me with respect and I never feel apprehensive or anxious to go to the doctor. 
0.428600	I have a chronic pain disorder, so when I see a new doctor I'm always anxious that they won't believe that my pain is real. 
0.523800	I was anxious and worried that they were going to tell me that I was going to need surgery for my tonsils a few years ago because I had constant sore throats.  My PCP was able to make a great decision with me about not having surgery because it would not have helped in the situation.
0.857100	The biggest thing that I fear is finding out that I am going to have a serious medical issue.  The longer I have to wait the worse it is.
0.285700	Nothing really, He'll tell me the truth and not beat around the bush.  My philosophy is it is what it is, and we'll go from there.
0.357100	I feel most anxious, or worried, about the fact that this is the place where I could potentially learn of something negative about my health, something life threatening, debilitating, etc. I know this is the place, and the doctor is the person, that this news will come from.
0.571400	Being told that something is wrong, especially if its something i may have not yet considered.  I dont like the unknown and if i have an idea of what im dealing with i can prepare and figure out whats next, but im no dr so there is always the possi bility something will be truly wrong.
0.595200	I worry about them finding out that something is wrong. I've also had bad experiences at a hospital before so just being in the hospital or dr office makes me anxious as I relive those experiences.
0.690500	Getting a bad report.  I don't want to hear that I am not as healthy as I hoped to be. I feel there is more I could do to be healthier. 
0.547600	There is always the thought that the problem could be something worse than expected. Also I feel anxious that the problem will be something that cannot be fixed or something that will take a long time to recover from. 
0.714300	I feel anxious because I do not fully trust the physician as it is. I also feel nervous because I do not like to have a person that I do not know look at me or touch me while I am naked.
0.238100	Worried that the doctor will miss something or discover something I was unaware of.  Anxiety comes from being in the doctors office for a sickness that I want cured and having to rely on someone else to make the right choice as to what best cures that sickness. Sometimes I also get a little uneasy challenging the doctor.  For example, if I think one medication is better suited to my sickness, but the doctor is recommending something else. 
0.690500	Remember that doctors are there to help you and try to solve your health problems. It's not their purpose to hurt you as much as possible. On the contrary, they will try to achieve what needs to be done with as little pain as possible. Yet some things just hurt. No doctor can change that, unfortunately. Try to pluck up courage s much ad possible and say to yourself: we're just gonna do it. I'm not gonna get beaten by a stupid needle!!! Try it, next time. It works and you will feel proud of yourself!
0.904800	Because you never know if they may tell you that it's something wrong with you. This is the reason why many people don't go to the dr's office as much as they should. We hate and fear hearing bad news.  Even just the thought of it makes a person feel at ease almost instantly.
0.619000	"I use to feel very anxious when visiting the doctor as a child. I often had no idea what to expect and I often wondered what would happen if they couldn't figure out what was making me sick. Today the anxiety that I faced as a child has been greatly diminished. My current doctor and his office is really great about setting forth a game plan. Before any exam happens I'll be told what to expect so I'm not going into anything blind. Once the exam is over I'm given options on the course of treatments that are available. There is still some small part of me that gets worried before I'm seen because I roll through the ""what if they can't figure out what's wrong with me"" bit in my head. I've come to discover that this is unfounded which helps with future visits."

0.690500	I am a germiphobe, and I really hate even going to a doctor's office. That is probably what makes me feel the most anxious. I am always a little worried they'll find something wrong with me, too.
0.690500	Being 67 years old, I know that age brings about potential health issues.  Also being fairly healthy my whole life, the law of averages may rear its ugly head.  I know I do not always eat right and not exercise enough and I know the doctor will ask, I will be honest and he will prod me to do better.
0.714300	Just the thought that i should of come sooner. I blame myself for putting it of. Its always a bit nerve wracking getting examined  when you think something could be wrong with you.

0.666700	Sometimes i get worried when visiting a doctor due to the fear of expressing myself and also anxious of knowing my health status. 
0.500000	Whether they find something wrong as well as if my insurance will cover the visit and what i'll have to pay out of pocket
0.452400	Sometimes when I don't feel like I can quite specifically or accurately describe what's going on. When I feel like my concerns are too vague.
0.285700	Only if I am unable to see my regular doctor and the doctor I see seems preoccupied with other things and other patients. I want someone who is focused on me and my issues. 
0.619000	I am always fearful about a bad prognosis. I am also always working to avoid high blood pressure so consequently doctor visits tend to send my blood pressure up.
0.166700	My greatest concern when visiting the doctor's office is that I will be rushed and/or the doctor will not take my concerns seriously. I have a hearing loss and difficulty understanding individuals with strong accents. Therefore, this is also causes anxiety if I am meeting this doctor for the first time. 
0.666700	"I see a doctor for one of two things: an unusual symptom or condition, or an annual checkup. During the former, I sometimes wonder if my symptoms could indicate a more serious medical problem, or worry how long the condition might persist, even with treatment. In the latter, a ""wellness check"", I worry that I may have an unrecognized problem that will affect my overall health, or require extensive and/or expensive treatment. Since I am typically in very good physical condition, the thought of being ill bothers me a lot."
0.357100	Mostly that I'll forget to ask all of the questions that I have in mind or that I won't understand what the doctor is telling me and that I'll be too afraid to ask for a better explanation.
0.333300	There is no benefit to worrying.  I completely agree and fully realize that most of my worries are ridiculous, but that does not make a difference; I still worry.  I've been trying to stop worrying my entire life.  It is uncontrollable. I have booked an appointment with my doctor, though I can already feel the anxiety building, and have been trying to distract myself.  I worry that he won't believe me, or something else.  It is embarrassing, and I feel bad about it.
0.309500	The longer I wait, the more anxious I become. As I become more stressed and anxiety builds, the waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me tto become even more stressed.
0.595200	Don't like taking my clothes off. Don't like waiting for doctor. Don't like being weighed. Don't like being told to lose weight.
0.690500	I have ha enough health issues in my life to get a sense of deja vu or flashbacks - I always have a feeling that something is about to pop up. And since I'm generally healthy, when I am at the doctor, it's usually for a pretty good reason.
0.714300	Depending on the reason for the visit, the illness itself is enough to cause such extreme anxiety. Add in the process of divulging highly personal information to people you barely know and you have a recipe for tension.
0.428600	My family has a long history of heart trouble, in particular high blood pressure, so I am always anxious when I go in for a physical that now will be my time to start down the heart disease path.  I also worry about mammograms. I haven't had any diagnoses that justify my concern, but I do nonetheless.
0.809500	I usually worry about my health and having to interact and explain myself to doctors and nurses. Visiting a doctor's office is also usually a big interruption in my usual daily routine, which makes me anxious. 
0.285700	I usually don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, since I know I am in good hands.If necessary I know the doctor would refer me to someone who would be as caring  and efficient as her.
0.190500	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, but I have prayed a lot before going to one. Going to get the results back from blood tests has made me feel a little uneasy, because I wondered what my primary care physician was going to tell me about the results, but I know that I am healed by the stripes of Jesus and I knew that I was going to be alright.  I think just waiting for the results and wondering what they are can cause a little bit of uneasiness. 
0.619000	I feel a little anxious when I go to the doctor because I know she is going to tell me that for my health I need to eat better and exercise.  I don't do those things and I know she will get on to me about it.
0.285700	If is my first appointment for this event that I have never been in before and I am not sure what the doctor is going to tell me that I need to do or what the results may be so I will feel a bit nervous or worried
0.404800	I usually get bad news so I try to prepare for the worse case scenario but I never know what it is. I worry I'll have a new chronic illness.
0.428600	Not seeing my doctor is not the problem. It is the actual diagnosis of what my illness is that makes me nervous.
0.142900	I am rarely nervous or worried when I see him. Again this is because I have full confidence in him. The only time I am anxious is if they are going to take blood from me or I will be receiving a injection shot for something. 
0.142900	The only thing that would make me feel anxious or worried is if I had something that I did against the direction of my doctor. I would feel bad and not want to see my doctor.
0.238100	The only thing that makes me anxious is not knowing how much time I will have to wait to see the doctor. I usually have to wait 1-1/2 to 2 hours to see her despite having an appointment. Once, a few years ago, I missed an important meeting at work because I wrongly assumed that my doctor's visit would be over in about an hour; it ended up being 2 hours because I had to wait a long time to see her, and my actual time with her was about 15 minutes. 
0.285700	Nothing really anymore.  In the past it use to be getting on the scale, but now it does not bother me.
0.619000	Honestly for any physical exam it would be getting on the scale. It really sucks because I work really hard on my body and I have been gaining muscle so I know I am going to weigh more, but I don't want to. 
0.404800	My primary issue with having current Western medical practices applied to me is that medical schools do not address a wide enough spectrum of healing modalities. And if they do, they charge a lot for their services. Around here, MD/NDs charge far too much for me to afford. So, I'm left with the choice of visiting a doctor who is instructed in a more narrow treatment spectrum, which does not suit my approach to health. As a result, I'm worried and anxious, because I know how many doctors react if you question their advice.
0.809500	I am always anxious when it comes to an office setting. I feel like there could be anything wrong with anyone at any certain time and that is nerve wracking. I fear that I will hear the worst and have to go under surgery or something like that. 
0.428600	I do not often feel worried about visiting the physician. Sometimes, however, I would worry about a potentially serious diagnosis. I do not think this is uncommon, however, and it arises from a childhood fear I had of being diagnosed with a terminal disease like my uncle (cancer).
0.857100	Not knowing what the outcome is going to be is what makes me the most nervous. They sit their and run their tests, sometimes not talking very much, so you can only sit there and think that something is seriously wrong with you. I always fear for the worst, every single time. Be a use in most cases people usually get the worst news of their lives, from their doctors.
0.738100	I tend to feel most anxious about what the doctor may discover.  For some reason, it seems that every time I have any kind of medical test, the doctor finds something new that is wrong with me.  It makes me feel that I don't won't the doctor to run any new tests because I know they are going to find something wrong.  Based on all of my recent experiences, I am seriously considering switching to a holistic doctor.
0.904800	Doctor's, Dentist's, They all make me anxious and worried. I'm not exactly sure WHAT MAKES me feel this way. Maybe the unknown? I just have a fear of doing things like this. Makes me very nervous!
0.761900	I am worried about the what the Doctor may tell me about the conditions that are currently affecting me.  I am worried that I have not seen a doctor regularly for a long time.
0.571400	I do not really feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. If I ever have, it would have been for some symptom or pain with unknown origin that I did not know what was wrong with me and wanted to get to the bottom of it.
1.000000	That the doctor may find a tumor or tell me that I have a major health illness. Even if I do not trust what the doctor is saying, this is enough to scare me and make me feel like I'm going to die! I think the entire situation of being in a dr office is intimidating. I am not sure if this is designed on purpose but the environment makes you extra anxious.  The whole waiting period amplifies this. 
0.309500	There's always the worry that they will randomly find something serious that you did not have. I feel that everyone has this worry.
0.238100	I am worried that they will find something serious that is wrong with me. I dont think its a very rational fear because I am in very good health but it is something that always lingers in the back of my mind while i am waiting in the waiting room at the doctor's office. I usually just want to get in, get treated, and get out as quickly as possible so that I can go back home.
0.285700	The possibility of having a health complication that will affect my day to day life. It would be very unpleasant to hear that I would have to take medication for the rest of my life for a health condition.
0.714300	I am concerned that while conducting an examination he will find something seriously wrong with me. Usually I go right after getting blood work and I am always concerned that the findings will be very bad and it makes me extremely anxious
0.642900	I am most worried about the cost and pain of treatment. I also worry about how much time I might have to take off from work if something is seriously wrong. I have had a few medical treatments that cost thousands of dollars and had me out of work for a few days.
0.333300	That they will find I have a serious condition that will adversely affect my lifestyle either due to treatments or illness. 
0.476200	i hate a new doctors visit and the nurse practitioner i saw was a different one then the on i saw a few years back at the same facility 
0.381000	Most of the time myself and many people visit doctor's offices is because there is something wrong, so being examined for the problem you've been having can make you slightly anxious or worried of the outcome of the examination. While it's great to potentially get answers for medical problems, you can get informed that what you're experiencing is worse than you expected. I believe that is typically in the back of the minds of most people in a doctor's care.
0.738100	I worry about getting blood drawn, about being declared somehow more unhealthy and having to have more work done, especially procedures or accompanying meds that I can't afford.
0.666700	My biggest fear is that I will receive news contrary to what I'm hoping for.  This doesn't have to be life-threatening, it could be as simple as finding out that a treatment must go on loner than anticipated.  Second to that is anxiety about not remembering to ask the right things or explain myself and my symptoms or condition fully, and then being misdiagnosed or wasting my time and money.
0.571400	When I get my blood pressure taken. I am getting older so hypertension is a real concern. I am trying to cut down on sodium intake and exercising more to keep myself health. But my job is somewhat stressful so my blood pressure goes up and down sometimes. Waiting to hear my result makes me feel uneasy.
0.214300	It makes me feel anxious when I'm in an appointment with him and he just goes away and spends a long time outside, leaving me just waiting, just looking the ceiling and worried about what problems I may have, it's really annoying and not a good action of him.
0.619000	By the time I get to the doctor I've often thought of all the most terrible things my symptoms could be and though I know the worry is mostly unfounded, I am still anxious until I'm proven wrong.
0.857100	I always feel anxious when I go there and they have to run a lot of test on me and draw my blood.  It seems they can never find a good vein to draw from and end up sticking me in several places.  My arm s usually black and blood when they are done.
0.238100	I absolutely hate that most doctors base your general health on the BMI index, when not everyone's shape is cookie cutter, or fits the categories. I get anxious when doctor's bring up my weight, because rather than argue with them about it, I just let them talk.
0.333300	If there is something wrong I am worried of the outcome, of any possible conditions or complications. Going to the Doctors sitting there mostly naked is the most comfortable experience.
0.381000	The idea that a stranger is going to examine me and that he has the ability to diagnose me with illnesses or a clean bill of health.
0.333300	I ususally do not feel anxious. I have a pretty go with the flow personality. There have been time I have recieved negative news from doctors but that's just part of life. 
0.142900	I worry most that a disease may be found that is terminal or that I may need to have surgery. I also get nervous when tests are taken just because I hate waiting for the results
0.381000	High costs is a factor that always brings on a fair amount of worry .I haven't had any real major health issues/ I think it's a natural thing to be somewhat anxious and worried when it comes to my health.
0.690500	I just have always been anxious when going to the doctor.  It feels like an invasion of privacy, even though I know it is for the best.  
0.428600	The only thing that I worry about when I go are basically health problems that are new and I really hate going to the OBGYN because it's uncomfortable.
0.166700	I feel most anxious about physical pain and examinations that may be ackward or embarassing. I've had two babies and found the exams to be surprising in their frequency and in the way they were not properly explained to me beforehand. I know it's routine to them but it's not to me.
0.595200	I think most people feel that way.  You never know what they will find and it is an anxious feeling every time.
0.142900	When I am unsure as to what is wrong with me and I when it's a new dr. that I have never met before. Also when I am having a medical procedure done that I have never had done before.
0.690500	I'm in pretty good health, but my family genes worry me when I go in. I feel as though that coupled with my sometimes bad diet is finally going to catch up to me. That is what worries me when I go in for tests and bloodwork the most right now as I'm getting older.
0.666700	Visiting the doctor's office gets me focused on health issues I don't usually think about extensively but that just pass through my mind. It gets me thinking about what I might not be able to know about my health no matter how much I pay attention to my body and also that I might not be paying as much attention as I should.
0.381000	The most anxious part of a doctor's appointment is not knowing exactly what to expect.  As someone who is highly organized and detail oriented, I tend to get anxious when I find myself in an unfamiliar situation or surroundings and am not sure what to expect.
0.928600	I know that it will be very rushed, and that I will almost certainly not get all of my concerns addressed during the visit.
0.309500	What makes me most anxious is the unknown. It isn't the actual checkup, it's the potential that something could be wrong with me or that a symptom could be serious. I don't do well with uncertainty so I need straight answers instead of wait and watch or unknowns.
0.404800	There is a lot of anxiety simply in not knowing for sure if your specific doctor (or your doctor that day) has your best interest at heart. They could be having a bad day, and overlook a serious problem. They could not take your truthful complaints serious, and give you a false clean bill of health. There is so much uncertainty at any given moment, it is impossible to not be nervous, worried, or anxious. 
0.261900	Not too much makes me irreparably anxious when visiting the doctor's office. I don't like parts of examinations like pap smears, but I know preventative care is important and my doctor has never made me feel needlessly uncomfortable. 
0.761900	I feel the waiting is the hardest part and I always don't know what to expect and will spend some time worrying if there is something more serious than I think going on. The longer I have to wait the more time I have to worry about things I probably shouldn't be worrying about in the first place.
0.333300	Finding out something bad might be wrong with me. One time I went over back pain and found out I had herniated discs in my back that also causes sciatica now
0.809500	I fear they are going to find something terribly wrong with me. I fear that when they find something terribly wrong with me the treatment is going to be unpleasant. Even when I already know more or less what is wrong, I fear that the treatment is going to be unpleasant. I fear side effects of medication, and don't want to have to take more.
0.595200	Sometimes something will be wrong with me, and we will have to wait for lab results to help figure out what is going on.  This does scare me the most.  Also, when I had one issue, it wound up later being diagnosed as bladder cancer.  The symptoms were very scary, but she did help calm me down and had me come back every day to make sure the symptoms were getting better.  
0.785700	"I am most anxious when discussing symptoms and/or test results that do not conclusively provide a diagnosis. I have had a few experiences where my doctor at the time assumed that I was simply ""anxious"" and refused to take my concerns seriously. I was later diagnosed with a serious illness. It is my fear that I will be perceived as having a mental illness that causes my distress, or as ""drug-seeking""."
0.690500	Every time i go with some pain, i am thinking the worst case scenario. I dont like going to doctors office at all.
0.523800	What makes me anxious or worried is fear of the unknown.  What will she find?  Is there something wrong with me?  And what might the consequences be of any illness.  Basically, fear of the unknown.  I don't fear getting scolded for bad health behavior.
0.809500	The first thing that comes to mind is just having an appointment period. Time is precious to me and I am generally kept waiting much longer than my time. I understand this can be necessary but I don't appreciate it every time.  Next, the fear of getting a flu or cold just by visiting the office makes me very anxious. I do worry about how the visit  will go such as if I will get bad news or a lecture. I really dread the lectures. 
0.190500	I get anxious while visiting the doctor because I want to make sure that everything is all right and that my pressure is not up. And that I don't need any medication to function.
0.142900	I am most anxious about the cost of testing and treatment.  My copay is inexpensive, but some other areas of my insurance are not. 
0.523800	Anytime I go I am worried . Its just my nature . I am a worrier . There is a lot of family medical problems . So anytime I go I cant help but worry and think about the possibilities that I could have something major wrong with me . I am worried that the routine check up will end up with me having cancer or something horrible like that . It all makes me anxious . I am also worried that we might miss something . That I forget something that I wanted to talk to her about ,so we end up missing it . I feel like she does a good job but I worry a lot about dying young like my father . The whole thing is pretty nerve racking but so far so good . She makes me feel like everything is going to be ok .
0.357100	What makes me a little bit worried about visiting the doctors office is that he will find something wrong with me that I was unaware of.
0.381000	When I was pregnant last year i went to see my doctor very often and I was always worried about being told there was something wrong with the baby. I didn't really care about me as much as i cared about my baby
0.166700	I don't like appointments and I prefer to get them over with and move on with the rest of my day as quickly as possible.
1.000000	The fear of being told something could be seriously wrong with my health is the main thing that stresses me out. Another factor is, being a person who has struggled with eating disorders, being told the number on the scale, whether it is higher or lower than I expect, gives me so much anxiety. After hearing the number, I don't think about anything else and I usually revert to bad behavior. Anything that involves my weight puts me on edge - it's very triggering for me and, unfortunately, hearing information about it form a doctor is very important, so it is inevitable that I become nervous during a visit.
0.476200	What makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office would be finding out if i have some sort of illness that may have gone undetected.
0.571400	That I will have to get shots or blood drawn. Those both make me nervous, or that someone will say something about my physical condition that is negative like I need to lose weight or I will get diabetes or something.
0.881000	I am just always afraid I am going to be told I have some sort of cancer or disease. I grew up with a Nana who was VERY OFTEN hospitalized and spent a lot of time there visiting her. She had a myriad of health conditions and I'm just afraid I'll end up like that no matter how much I watch what I eat and take care of myself.
0.285700	If I have new or strange symptoms going on, I would feel worried. Since we have some diseases in our DNA, I am often afraid of what might occur.
0.642900	I always imagine and fear the worst. When I had my diabetes problems I was very concerned about my long term life and how it would affect my lifestyle.  
0.595200	Not knowing what he will find, and the cost of any treatment that might need to be done. My family has a history of health issues and I am afraid I might follow suit.
0.857100	Because they hold the key to knowledge i am unaware of so giving up control to random people is fearful and naked. Putting trust in a stranger for my well being is also not as controlling as I typically like and i know i am my own best fighter. The sickness that i am walking into at a doctors office is also seems like i will walk out worse than i walk in it seems counterintuitive to what im looking for.
0.547600	Sometimes I am afraid they will tell me that what I came to the doctor for is a symptom of a serious disease such as cancer.
0.357100	If I am sick, I am always anxious about what it could be and also I feel anxious that I may catch the flu or a stomach bug from someone who is there. This is something that makes me most anxious. 
0.857100	I am anxious that my blood pressure reading will be higher than normal, because I definitely have white coat syndrome. I am worried that my concerns won't be taken seriously. I am also concerned that the exam will be cursory because the physician is pressed for time and sees many people every hour. Something might be missed or overlooked.
0.714300	I am a very private person so talking to anyone about health issues usually causes me some anxiety.  Also, I am relatively healthy and only have to go to the doctor on rare occasions, so it's just not something I am used to.
0.309500	The most anxious or worried I can get when I go to the doctor is that  the doctor will say that is something wrong.  Or give me a hard time about weight or diet.
0.714300	I just worry that they're going to find something really bad, that I'm going to be sick with something deadly. 
0.547600	I feel most anxious about my weight when visit the doctor. I am always struggling with my weight and I hate to see the number on the scale, it fills me with dread. 
0.595200	I have a hard time comprehending people talking at me. I can't focus no matter how hard I try. I usually try remember key words and look up stuff later. They just get so rushed I don't want to be rude and keep interrupting. So I feel useless sometimes. And passed off that after 35 years of the pain no has an explanation.
0.857100	I always feel anxious when going to the doctor no matter if it is just for a physical and nothing serious. I always dread getting bad news.
0.738100	I have generalized anxiety disorder so doctors appts for me while necessary tend to bring stress and anxiety. I become anxious about what my weight will be, what my blood pressure will be (most likely high due to the anxiety) etc. I just tend to be a very anxious person even when there is nothing to really worry about. 
0.428600	How I will be treated by the doctor and if the doctor will give me the right diagnoses. I hate to have to deal with doctors who believe their patients are too stupid to know whats going on with them and who will not listen to the patient.
0.833300	When I am visiting the doctor's office,the things that make me feel most anxious or worried is first of all, not knowing what the actual problem is and worrying if my ailment is something that could be quite serious. I also become anxious and worried,wondering if I would be referred for additional testing,or perhaps to specialists for my ailment. Lastly, I get worried and anxious about the cost of my medical care. I am limited as to what I can afford to pay for my health care.
0.738100	That the doctor will be rude or one of the nurses will be rude. Im a little on the heavier side, and they have to weigh me every visit and its really frustrrating. I know its so they can keep me on track of weight and stuff but its really embarrassing stepping on the scale and every time i gain weight.
0.690500	I suppose I sometimes think about the potentially worst case scenario for a given situation, and that may lead to some anxiety. Even if hypothetical, some visits may reveal an unexpected diagnosis, but on the other end of the spectrum everything may be fine. I suppose this is a situation that falls under the whole idea of hope for the best but expect the worst.
0.285700	Nothing really makes me feel anxious at all when I go to the doctor suprisingly I have always had good checkups and no major health issues. 
0.214300	Getting in and out! I am disabled and for some reason the office does not have an automatic door. Once in though, I feel quite relaxed. I know my doctor is there to help me in a non-judgmental way and I feel quite safe in his hands. His staff is also very helpful and caring, which makes any visit quite stress free.
0.857100	That something is seriously wrong or that there is not going to be a clear answer to a problem or a clear resolution. 
0.309500	Getting bad news,  or being misdiagnosed. The Doctor not taking your complaints seriously. Trying to remember what you need to say in the little time you get to be face to face with the doctor.
0.857100	The comments the doctor will make about my body or lifestyle. The needle for the blood test and the results.
0.142900	When I visit the doctor's office, I have no reason to feel anxious or worried. I have been in good health my whole life and have had almost no health issues. However, if I were to feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, it may be due to the fact that I had no clue about what may be causing my symptoms.
0.500000	Usually the thought of what might be wrong. Sometimes my mind wanders to the worst medical conditions.
0.666700	What worries me the most is the doctor finding something wrong with me that I didnt know about and that it potentially could be life threating. 
0.381000	I think I feel most anxious when I think I'll get back bad news. My something change since my last checkup, that can impact me in a negative way. 
0.809500	That the doctor will tell me that I have a life threatening decease like cancer. I also don't like waiting and the doctor being late.
0.333300	The only thing that makes me nervous are physical tests. I hate injections and pap smears. Also, I am a smoker so I get a little afraid to hear bad news of abnormal result.
0.619000	I get nervous at times because you never know what could happen. You never know what conditions may exist that you don't know about.
0.142900	My doctor does his best to provide a calm and non-threatening environment.  Worries or anxiousness comes from my own uncertainty about my condition.
0.523800	I go to the doctor when I am sick. I have never been for a wellness check or a physical. So I am already in at least some discomfort. I just want the problem to go away. Being sick in a place with other sick people is not comforting at all. I just want an answer. I know that the course of drugs will take a week or longer to really start working. So it all takes so long.
0.833300	I feel uneasy if i am visiting a doctor and do not know what the test results will conclude. Also, I feel more uneasy to be examined by doctors when they perform more invasive testing (prodding/poking). If it's just a routine checkup, then i usually feel much easier/relaxed about it. 
0.738100	"Discovering something unknown. Or something that I could have prevented but did not. I just have general ""white coat hypertension"""
0.500000	Stepping on the scale makes me a little anxious.  Generally, I am most anxious about the doctor finding something that could be harmful or affect my future.  For the most part, I feel like I have a good sense about what will happen when I visit the doctor's office.
0.238100	Just waiting in the waiting room and the chances of getting sick because you are at a doctors office make me uneasy but it does not really have to do with the doctor themselves 
0.666700	I have white coat syndrome so it happens without a lot of reasons. Sometimes, I fear that they will find something wrong or that I will have something wrong that they won't catch. Cost used to be an issue but I have great insurance now. 
0.476200	I am usually not that nervous or anxious when visiting any doctor but, am not that excited or comfortable either. I dont have any particular feelings it's just neccesary.

0.571400	It's always nerve wrecking when I visit a doctor's office because I don't know if there is something wrong with me. Most of it is the wait after you are examined and waiting for the results to come to me.
0.500000	I went to the emergency room several months ago because my feet were swollen for a few weeks and it was painful for me to walk or stand. In addition to the pain and swelling there was a very aggressive rash on both feet. After sitting in the ER for hours, the doctor told me I had athlete's foot. I followed his instructions and took the medications and one weeks later the condition only got worse. I went to my physician and was then told the problem was an extension of my eczema and that he would put in a referral for me  to see a dermatologist. After a few reminders and months later, I am still waiting to see a dermatologist.
0.809500	I don't always know what the doctor is going to tell me when I am there for a visit. There is no way of telling and they can sometimes be very blunt when telling you things that can really upset you. Once again, it goes back to their insane workload and the fact that they don't really have the time to form a genuine rapport with their patients.
0.285700	I never feel worried about going to the doctors. I am going there to be healed so not anxious at all. Maybe a little worried about the price but not seeing them
0.500000	Wondering if something is much worse than I think it is is probably the biggest thing for me to make me super anxious. I dont like that because who knows what the problem is.
0.452400	The only things that makes me feel anxious or worried are the results I may receive, sometimes I personally go and google my symptoms ( which isn't always the smartest thing to do) and it usually gives me some of the worse diagnosis of what could potentially be ailing me. So when I get to the doctor's office my mind is always focused on those things I've read it could be. So I be anxious to get seen to be told what it really is and worried that it's one of the things I think it is.
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office is think if I'm going to feel any pain or any discomfort.

0.190500	I naturally become anxious when I see doctors. My blood pressure is normally on the lower side, although it is still normal. When I go to my doctor, my blood pressure rises to 120/80 which, again, is still normal, but not MY normal blood pressure when I am relaxed. Also, I am worried he will be disappointed in slow weight loss since I began losing weight in February 2017.
0.142900	I trust the doctors and I already know that they advise for the sake of every patient, and they never ought to harm intentionally anyone
0.309500	If I'm not sure what is wrong with me. I will start overthinking it, or even worse using Web-MD before I go to get an estimate of what might be wrong. Nothing the doctor does makes me anxious, I make myself nervous.

0.404800	I'm always there about something that is out of my control, and I have to trust that the person I'm seeing might be able to help with the situation.  I usually wait until problems build up, so there is also that urgency.
0.357100	Being examined is an anxiety-inducing experience. There's a lot of uncertainty about what the results could be. Going to see a doctor is also anxiety-inducing in itself.
0.928600	Being told that I'm a liar, or getting fat shamed. Being blamed for most of my issues. Getting treated like an idiot. I'm really sick of it but it happens every time.

0.142900	What causes me anxiety at a doctor's office?  A request for a blood sample, or the need to have an IV.  I really do not care for needles or for blood draws.  Not sure exactly why, but both are something that I would prefer to avoid.
0.547600	What causes me the most anxious and worried when visiting the doctor is both the chance of receiving very bad news and or receiving wrong information about my condition or lack of condition. Being misdiagnosed or not diagnosed with something i may need to be diagnosed with.
0.500000	I feel shy around strangers or people I don't know well. Additionally, I do not like needles, so the idea of getting blood drawn makes me tense.

0.785700	If I'm going in for a check-up i would fear finding out something bad (i.e. diabetes, cancer). I also worry if they may have found something or if my physical condition is more serious that what i personally think.

0.666700	I feel anxious or worried in case something is seriously wrong. Although it is not better to be blind to an issue when it is time to visit a doctor, the fear of the unknown leads to more worry than just putting it off. 
0.857100	Why not feel anxious?  I might have some sort of disease and I don't like anyone touching me period.  I hate going to the hospital it's a depressing place to be.
0.785700	I am always scared they will tell me I am overweight first off. Then just the initial exam I am afraid that I will have some sort of disease that is really bad because I am terrified of death.
0.142900	The main thing that makes me feel anxious about going to the doctor would be if I were waiting for test results to determine if something was wrong with my health and what was wrong with my health.
0.619000	My main concern is to find out that I have some really serious disease. However it is always better to know and start looking for the treatment or the setup a plan than not being aware and realizing it too late. The other thing that is very upsetting is the costs of the treatments. It is always expensive to go to the doctor and getting the necessary examinations. I do not understand how people are able to afford medical treatments. It is way to overpriced and after that you will live and work to pay back the costs of your medical treatment.
0.904800	I'm afraid i'm going to get a bad diagnosis. The anxiety and dread of not knowing the condition i'm in is the worst. Also i'm worried about what type of mood my doctor is in, or how experienced and thorough the nurse is. 
0.285700	In my primary care physician office when they are doing any examination that will not make me anxious or worried or created any fear to me because these are only good to help me.
0.690500	I think it has to do with the waiting and all the thoughts and ideas that enter my mind. The longer i am waiting the more harder it is to stay calm. Feeling anxious and wanting to get it over with.
0.714300	Not knowing what new problem may have been discovered from recent lab work. I'm always a little anxious about what my blood pressure reading will be.

0.619000	I'm afraid she will find something serious and then I will have to make decisions on what to do. I prefer not to think about such things.

0.381000	The fear of finding out that there might be something more serious about my condition:). However, this is not always the case, it is only if I am seeing a doctor about a serious illness. 
0.381000	I am not anxious all the time, I was thinking more of a particular situation. I was having blood count issues. I had to keep going back for blood draws to see what my counts were at. one of the diagnosis for what i was going though could have been cancer. I was very nervous about getting those results
0.476200	It's nothing in particular, usually. It's just a general concern that something could always be wrong that I'm not aware of. A doctor's office isn't usually a place you visit when things are going splendidly. 
0.928600	I have always been afraid of going to the doctor.  I am very fearful of pain and doctor's visits always has been related to pain in my mind. I think  I have phobia maybe.
0.547600	I don't like having people i don't know well touching me. I also have a small fear that the visit will result in the knowledge that I have a large medical problem.
0.738100	I am afraid that they will find something wrong with me that will be difficult to treat such as cancer, or that they won't look into my health needs as much as I'd like them too
0.523800	I don't like waiting for the doctor. I feel uncomfortable. I can also feel anxious about finding what is wrong with me
0.642900	When I have been examined my overall health condition, especially I have been screened for cancer, I felt most anxious and worried whether I had some symptom of cancer or uncured disease.     
0.619000	"Mostly I worry about how the doctor will perceive me and whther they judge my bad habits. I sometimes worry about getting bad news about my health but I think that is normal, and it will only increase as I get older. I worry that they will rush the appointment and not answer all of my questions as well. I have to check the time they come in for billing purposes because they will bill me for ""expanded visit"" which is supposed to be like 20 minutes but they stay for only 7-10 mins. This is unfair and I do worry about it."
0.285700	There's a variety of mild anxiety. For example, maybe there's nothing much wrong with me, and it was stupid to go to the doctor. Maybe there's something really wrong. Things like that.
0.690500	Whenever I visit a doctors office I feel most nervous that the doctor is going to tell me to do something which will not help my condition or better understand my condition but instead just prescribe whatever is most fashionable or lucrative for himself. I am concerned that my best interest will not be taken into consideration. I am concerned about harmful and poorly understood medications being prescribed to me. 
0.619000	I guess just generally I don't want to find out that I'm sick because I don't have any money. I know that hospitals do tend to lower the costs for people with extremely low income like myself, but I'm scared to have to deal with that. 
0.333300	I'm mostly anxious about getting my blood drawn or shots. Sometimes I am anxious when the waiting area is very crowded, because I'm not sure when I will be seen and hope not to be rushed. Occasionally if I have a lot of concerns I'm worried I'll forget to ask everything on my mind.
0.381000	I have to be weighed and I never lose weight.  I have to let the doctor feel me in places I would rather not have anyone touch.  I have to reveal myself to an almost complete stranger.

0.523800	Waiting for them to examine me and tell me something is wrong with me.  While waiting, my mind jumps to crazy conclusions like I am dying of some disease or I have tumors growing somewhere.  These thoughts kind of make my heart rate go up and he ends up thinking i have high blood pressure.

0.309500	I'm a little anxious about procedures that are done to me, I don't like anticipating the discomfort with some procedures.
0.714300	That he will find something wrong that is serious. I'm at the age where that could happen at any time, and I've seen it happen too many times to my friends. So I worry about it every time I go.
0.428600	I am always worried that I will not get a good bill of health.  I have some weight to lose and know that I might be confronted about that and what I should be doing.
0.142900	Nothing makes me feel anxious at the doctors office. I take any of the bad news to come with stride and try and have a positive outlook whenever I visit the doctors office. I do not fear checkups or any examinations.
0.357100	I can't explain it.  I just don't particularly enjoy then environment and I have a low level uncomfortable feeling about it all.
0.285700	Well, this doesn't really apply; see, I go to the doctor when something is bothering me or once a year for my checkup. The doctor is there to help me, is my attitude, so even if I'm worried about some condition, I don't fear going and doN't feel very anxious or worried.
0.833300	I get scared because I worry about what might be wrong. I get all worked up about it. I'm worried about having to take a new medication or if there might be something seriously wrong with me. It really freaks me out.
0.142900	The most frustrating occurrence is the never-ending rotation of doctors.  It seems every year, (interns) I have to go through my entire history again.  Including, family, life, medical, etc.  Then, a new diagnosis, new medications, and so on, and so on.
0.642900	I feel anxious or worried that the doctor might find something wrong with me.  Anxious because I might feel pain during the exam or the test given to me.

0.666700	What makes me feel anxious is being diagnosed with an incurable illness such as Cancer or MS. Also, if they are not able to diagnose what's going on with me
0.214300	That what I think is no big deal will turn out to be something a lot more serious. I also get anxious if I have to get a shot as I am not a fan of needles. I also get a little anxious being exposed to sick people.
0.333300	when they are talking about serious health problem. a words from him that might lead to a bad health issue. testing my blood for std and other lifetime problems
0.833300	I never know what they will find wrong with me.  Or if they will find a cyst and want to do more tests that cost more money. 
0.642900	I feel anxious that they are going to find something and give me bad news. No one wants bad news in their life. I know I could make better judgement as far as health goes and I am always worried that what I am doing is not enough. Especially when I was pregnant I was always afraid something would go wrong. 
0.309500	I am mainly anxious when i visit a dr because I am afraid I am going to have bad news leaving. I am terrified that I am going to be diagnosed with an illness I will not be able to treat or get proper treatment for.
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's. I have enough experience with doctors that I am comfortable that I can ask for and get what I need.
0.238100	I worry when there is a waiting time before diagnosis. I have had 3 or 4 good scares in my life, liver failure and cancer. I am not the kind of person that will freak out on possibly fatal news like that.  The other thing was needles. I used to become quite anxious when waiting. 
0.595200	Mainly because I have awful anxiety, I worry about everything so it's in my nature to worry about a million different things.  Also, I've been battling against my weight for a while.  I just never know if my doctor is going to be proud of my progress that I've made since I've last visited or if he's going to be disappointed that I'm not losing weight faster.
0.142900	i would say the wait to see if you are ok like your blood work your blood pressure your ox your heart your weight
0.142900	If I believe beforehand that there is something seriously wrong with me BEFORE I talk to the doctor, then I might feel anxious as I wait to see him and talk to him. But that is rare. I  do not usually feel anxious while I am talking to the doctor. I usually just let him examine me and listen closely  to what he tells me. But I do not tend to overreact to things. If he , on the other hand, told me Ihave some deadly disease that cannot be treated, obviously I would feel rather anxious.
0.714300	Sometimes I worry that something may be seriously wrong with me, in which case I would rather not know. But it makes me anxious not knowing, so I have to know if anything might be wrong with me.
0.285700	I donât feel nothing at all so I donât know how to answer this question... will get through whatever the outcome is 
0.547600	I am a person that gets worried every time i go to the doctor.  I'm just afraid i will hear something bad while there.  Normally, everything is just fine and once i get into the examination room i start to relax.  Maybe, its all the other people in the waiting room, the long waits, ect that make me anxious.  
0.547600	It depends on what has been going on with me lately. I know when I haven't been trying to take care of myself in terms of diet and exercise and fear what the doctor will say about the results of some of those little examinations. If I also have some kind of sickness I've never dealt with before, I can start to feel fairly anxious. 
0.452400	I feel anxious about the probable poking and prodding that will take place, and the inevitable disdain that the doctor will evoke once I start making suggestions that might contradict something they had stated. I also worry about the possible copay. 
0.738100	I am always more worried before a procedure.  A checkup doesn't really bother me, but if I have to have surgery or blood taken or something like that, then I become very anxious.  I worry about what will happen during and after the procedure and how I will feel.
0.523800	If i'm going to have a procedure done or a surgery i'm obviously going to be nervous and worried. That's always how it works for me. When going in for a routine exam i'm not usually worried, however.
0.833300	Worried that he will deliver bad news. I am at the dr to make sure everything is ok, but i worry about the discovery of something negative. 
0.666700	At age 72, and having a number of health issues, I accept the fact that time is running out for me.  I always feel tense with each medical exam as the likelihood of the onset of a potentially lethal condition would not be surprising at my age.
0.714300	It is the fear of being judged and of not knowing if they will find anything wrong with me. Perhaps they will judge my lifestyle, or perhaps they will say I am eating all the wrong things or not exercising enough.
0.666700	I have social anxiety, everyone makes me anxious. But being in a place that knows you are having difficulties makes it worse. Nurses, PA's, Doc's all rushing around coming in and going out.
0.238100	What makes me feel most anxious about visiting a doctor is a general anxiety of being in public places in general, along with the likelihood of being undressed. Also, I usually only visit a doctor is there is a problem, so there is some anxiety as to what the problem may be.
0.881000	My biggest fear is that of being told that I have an incurable disease or only have a few months to live.  I think my fear is that my mother died when I was young and my father was very sick as I was growing up.
0.547600	That the doctor will detect something that could be life threatening at the least. Even if it not life threatening if I was told that I would have to radically alter my life style such as activities or diet I would find it as a great disruption. At least at first.
1.000000	"Even though I have a ""good"" insurance plan, I am in constant fear that something unaffordable will happen at the doctor's office. If the doctor decides to send me to a lab, imaging center, or hospital, it might be out of network or there might be some other loophole that will give my insurance company an excuse not to pay. A prescription might be on some arbitrary list causing my insurance to deny it. Even the doctors fees might be mishandled by the insurance company. There is no way to comparison shop or get an estimate of fees beforehand. As a patient I am at the mercy of a healthcare system rapaciously seeking to squeeze every possible dollar of profit out of me."
0.285700	I am just generally anxious about what he will find or that he will discover I have been doing something wrong. I am not worried about his actions or thoughts but, my own and chance happenings.

0.428600	What makes me the most worried when i visit the doctor's office is the possibility of having negative results. Knowing that i take care of myself and am in good health, i should not as much but still. Things manifest in healthy people all the time.
0.642900	What makes me most anxious or worried is that they will find something unexpected or recommend an invasive procedure.
0.285700	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I am most worried when I discover a reason for which I will need to see a doctor
0.523800	Depending what the visit is for would determine how anxious or worried I would be. I think what makes me most worried would be being concerned the doctor would find something I was unaware of, or something potentially serious. This worries me sometimes.
0.381000	It's the uncertainty of it all that's nerve-wracking. You second-guess yourself and maybe something is wrong and maybe you lose sight of the truth and start to fear random things.
0.404800	I have an eating disorder, and if a doctor or nurse is new to me, I sometimes worry I'll get unwanted and unhelpful advice about diet and exercise. I don't like looking at the scale, either, for related reasons. 
0.642900	i always feel like i'm going in for a test I didn't study for. I usually have a list of questions i want to ask and in my nervousness i forget them all. 
0.619000	I'm 55 and haven't had a medical issue in decades. While I do exercise regularly and eat well; I've smoked for 20 years and drink regularly so if I had an issue I'd be concerned as I'm far from a person who you'd consider has a healthy life-style.
0.714300	I am afraid after certain tests are run, I may be diagnosed with some incurable dread disease. I would feel helpless and very upset to receive this news.

0.261900	I get anxious going to the doctor's office mainly because of any uncertainty as to what is wrong, plus the doctor's office itself makes me anxious, just the smell.
0.476200	Some doctors do not value patients' time. They never see patients at the time of the appointment and they do not offer anything to read.
0.666700	The overall institutional feel makes me feel uncomfortable. I also do not like sitting by myself in a quiet room for thirty minutes before the doctor comes in, giving me ample time to worry though every possible thing they could say. 
0.214300	The thing that probably makes me feel the most anxious is when my doctor finds something potentially wrong that I didn't know about, especially if it could potentially be a really big deal.  At one point he was worried about a mole I had on my skin being potential melanoma so he removed it and had it tested.  The test came back negative, but the roughly 1 week it took to get the results was nerve-wracking.  
0.142900	I don't usually feel upset or worried when visiting my doctor's office.  The last time I had blood work done I was a little nervous to get the results of the tests back, but they made me feel at ease and told me ways to improve my numbers and things I could do to better my health overall. 
0.214300	I feel neither anxious nor worried when visiting the doctor's office. In fact, I feel like the doctors are not going to look hard enough or listen intently enough and under- or misdiagnose me.
0.333300	I only worry about cancer, since it seems to be the hidden disease that pops up on people sometimes without warning.  This is about the only thing that worries me that one day it will show up on some sort of test.  
0.571400	I feel the most anxious when I have symptoms that I haven't been able to cure on my own and that's what's bringing me to the doctor's office in the first place. 
0.500000	I can feel anxious regarding when I have to wait for a test result as if its something that could mean there could be adverse results for long term.
0.809500	I hate visiting the doctors office because 1) I hate getting on the scale. 2) I hate getting shots or my fingers pricked. 3) The nurses are usually rude. 4) My doctor does not know much about me. I feel like he knows my name but does not care about me or does not care much about my health. 5) My doctor has not helped me get the right type of anxiety medicine that I have been wanting. All of it makes me tired and I just need something that calms me down.
0.214300	I feel anxious about any examination in general. Being checked out physically can be a little stressful for me. I don't like being poked and prodded. 
0.452400	What makes me feel anxious is not knowing rather I did good of bad when it comes time to check my diabetes and what the results will show.  I dont follow what i am supposed to be doing on a regular basis so everytime i usually get anxious about it and what my doctor will think. Also when going to the doctor sick people are in there and i dont want to catch what they have like strep, cold or even worse this years Flu. 
0.261900	The fact that they can get very intimate into my personal life, both physically and emotionally.  They also can sometimes be slightly vague with what their thinking is on my health.
0.333300	I'm always worried about finding out that something is wrong with me that I didn't know. There's always a fear that I may go to the doctor for something routine and find out something catostrophic
0.261900	I hate getting on the scale. I never want to know how much I weigh, and I always tell the nurse not to tell me. That's probably not a great idea. My blood pressure is almost always good, but I get nervous that perhaps on a particular visit, it will be high. 
0.714300	I believe it is all pyschological because most of the time when you go to the doctor something is wrong. So then when you go for a regular visit those same feelings come back. The ones you had when you were sick, injured or didn't even know what was wrong  in the first place. Some of the uncertainty is also worrying about my loved ones if something was in fact wrong with me. What also contributes to the uncertainty is not understanding medical terminology and if whether or not what you are being told is actually correct.
0.142900	nothing because I trust that my life is in good hands with my doctor so there is no use trying to worry myself and have worse nerves than i need for nothing
0.547600	i get worried about finding out something about my health that totally blindsides me, or that ended up in a poor state due to lack of action on my part.
0.833300	I feel the most anxious about feeling judged or criticized by the doctor. I'm afraid of them blaming me for my conditions or just not listening or taking me seriously. I'm afraid of feeling lectured to, disrespected, dismissed and invalidated by them. 
0.714300	I am very uncomfortable when going to any doctor. I don't like people touching me and going to the doctor it is usually a given that there is going to be someone touching me. 
0.571400	"What asinine charges are they going to bring up? Am I going to be charged because they used a gauze pad to cover a wound (should I have brought my own)? Are they going to find cause to put me through the most useless, expensive tests, because they ""feel"" there is some issue worth investigating? Are they even going to bother prescribing the correct medicines, or has some drug company paid them an exorbitant fee to prescribe their medicine above all others, even when that medication is unnecessary/not fit for the condition/better options are available?"
0.642900	I feel anxious or worried when I feel I haven't followed the doctor's instructions properly or have been lax regarded my own health. When I am disappointed in myself, I am anxious in anticipation of telling the doctor the problem, because I don't want him to be disappointed in me.
0.976200	Something about the look of doctor's offices, I also don't like them to touch me. I am afraid of pain. I was upset and scared last time I was in the hospital. 
0.309500	I don't usually have fear when visiting the doctor. I only get anxious if I have to get a shot. Those occasions are few and far between.
0.285700	I am usually nervous and anxious during my doctor's appointment. My blood pressure is almost always higher when it is being measured by the nurse. I guess I want to unconsciously be as healthy as possible and can sense judgement of some sort - or maybe it is all in my head.
0.738100	The lack of compassion. Most doctors don't care about the patient. They just want to push drugs on you and get you out of the door instead of reviewing your background and the things you have tried that was either successful or failed. We have records for a reason and no one seems to read them. I hate having to start from scratch with each doctor I see. 
0.571400	Getting injections of any kind. As well as x-rays and cat-scans. talking about cancers of any kind. i dont like how many germs and other possible parasites are  around the inside of docters office.
0.142900	I do not worry when I go to the doctor's.  I know it is necessary for my health.  I have confidence that my doctor will listen to my complaints and proscribe the necessary and correct treatments.
0.642900	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is the initial greeting and how the conversation starts off because lately I haven't been taking the best care of myself, so I'm always really nervous to find out how much worse things have gotten with either my weight or cholesterol numbers.
0.738100	I get most anxious because I don't know what the outcome of the appointment will be. I also don't know how the doctor will treat me while I am there.
0.809500	I'm not sure what I get so anxious or worried about, I just hate doctors offices. From the time I walk in (even if it's just to get a vaccine), my blood pressure elevates. I think that it stems from a time when I had a life threatening condition but I didn't know and went into the appointment thinking it was something simple, but instead I was rushed to the emergency room and spent several days in the hospital. 
0.333300	for example, a pain that I have never felt in my body, the delivery of blood tests, that the doctor who regularly treats me does not treat me, I find out that something is not right with my body.
0.333300	I ALWAYS FEEL A LITTLE ANXIOUS AND WORRIED BECAUSE OF FEAR THAT HE MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG.
0.666700	I dont like going to the doctor if I can avoid it. It makes me think maybe something is wrong. I would rather be finished and find out what is the diagnosis
0.809500	Whenever I'm in a doctor's office, hospital, or clinic setting, I just have an uneasy feeling in general.  Doctor's offices and hospitals make me nervous as I associate them with health problems and pain.  I often feel worried when waiting for results as I'm nervous to see if they have good or bad news for me regarding my health.  I usually rely on a doctor's demeanor or personality to help comfort and relax me in these types of situations.
0.452400	I have had poor past experiences with doctors that automatically makes me anxious when I go to the doctor, even though I trust my current doctor. Just being in a doctor's office setting seems to trigger the anxiety.
0.452400	I feel most anxious that they might tell me something is wrong with my condition when I thought everything had been fine. I worry about over-prescription instead of fixing the root issue, I think we medicate far too much in this society.
0.547600	I worry that I will find out there's something wrong that's more significant than I expected.  I also have had several illnesses where it took doctors a while to figure out what the problem was.  So, sometimes I worry that I won't get an answer/resolution/treatment plan.
0.500000	The feeling that they will judge me for my life choices, even if I strongly believe they are the right choices for me. I don't tend to do things willy nilly. I try and do my research and make sure I have informed opinion or choice in something I personally participate in. I don't always eat right, and even if I eat bad once a  month, I would feel like I need to justify my decisions to my doctor. I also have a general sense of anxiety, so any unknown situation will make me worries, usually for no good reason. 
0.619000	When visiting the doctors office, I am nervous about seeing my doctor because of the poor relationship we have, as well as what he might tell my mother. Im not a fan of needles either, so when getting a shot it freaks me out. The anxiety lasts for about half of the visit, once I realize that im going to be ok i level out and calm down. I should realize this before I even get into the doctors office, but it still freaks me out. Maybe thats something Ill work on.
0.785700	Having someone who I do not see often look me over concerns me. I get anxious when they check my heart rate and such which probably contributes to my heart rate going up. They sometimes try to talk while checking my heart rate which makes me more anxious as I have to participate in a conversation.
0.619000	I am always worried something else will be wrong with me than just what I am going in for...or that whatever I have is worse than what I think. Additionally, I am always worried about remembering the things I want to ask, and if I will have enough time to ask the questions I have. So it makes me really anxious and worried. 
0.714300	I worry about some of the tests that are done, such as taking blood and maybe they would have to give me a shot.
0.476200	I just always wonder if I'm in worse shape than most others seen by the doctors.  It makes me evaluate the uncomfortable aspects of my health and my body.
0.214300	I sometimes just feel generally anxious when I visit the doctor's office - I feel that I suffer from 'white coat phenomena'. I sometimes notice that my blood pressure is elevated for no particular reason when I visit the doctor's office.
0.357100	When i go to the doctors office my main worry is whether or not im going to be getting a shot. I do not like needles and really hate getting a shot or giving blood. 
0.190500	Honestly the cost thereâs not much else other than that like I feel like going to a doctor making sure Iâm OK doing my research hoping they do their research but if they make mistakes that cost more money that is what frustrates the worries 
0.714300	sitting in a waiting room full of potential sick people. that he might charge me a unreasonably high amount etc,
0.476200	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor is that he will tell me that I have a major illness or condition that will make it impossible to live my life the way I want to.
0.571400	I know that he is going to complain about my weight.  Then he is going to tell me that his wife put him on a diet and how small his plate is.  He will then tell me that his wife is blond and beautiful and that she knows what is best.  Then he will talk about his need to still lose ten pounds so that his wife will be proud of him.....every time I go see him.....same story.....
0.642900	I come from a family with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc, and I'm always anxious when I go to the doctor that they'll find out I have one of these things.
1.000000	Once I am waiting over 20min I start to panic severely because the wait alone is bad - it is exhausting, then you kind of lose your momentum and forget to tell the doctor things which makes me more anxious - then I am fearful once I tell her my symptoms that she will tell me 5 different BAD deadly things that it could be and she wants to run a bunch of blood work and tests which then make me have panic attacks until the test day and then weeks until the results are in - the waiting for everything is the most difficult
0.785700	What makes me most anxious is the thought of something being seriously wrong with me. I avoid going to the doctor as much as possible just because I really do not want to know if there is something wrong with me.
0.881000	To hear any bad news like things are getting worse or that they don't have any other medicines/options to help my symptoms.
0.666700	I think it's just the stress of being there and seeing 5 different people including the doctor, who all do different things and can't answer my questions or come and go too fast for me to ask
0.619000	That I am surprised of his decision, I want to trust my doctor, I want to know that he thinks about my case and tries to help me not thinking of his financial profit. The times are changing and humanity is so important for this profession. I worry every time how expensive will be the next prescribed medicine and what are the side effects, I try to read everything carefully and when read the long list of side effects I become more and more frustrated. Sometimes the doctor is thinking about something else and doesn't listen to me, I have to repeat what I have said, that is confusing. 
0.190500	I worry some about pain or invasive physical procedures. I worry about something serious being discovered. I worry about encountering new germs and getting sick from visiting the doctor's office!
0.333300	I feel anxious or worried because you never know what is going to come out of that visit. For one, I battle with high blood pressure. And at times my pressure would be elevated and others not. So when I go and see my doctor it always concerns me because one day Iâm taking pills and the next day I am not. Itâs nerve wracking even though I am considered healthly based off my physical exams.
0.738100	"My doctor says I have classic ""white coat syndrome"".  My blood pressure rises considerably and I am flushed when I first go in."
0.142900	That the doctor will find something in a scan or in blood work that would lead me to making life or death decisions. I don't think I would be able to handle that right now in this day in age with everything else that is going on . 
0.785700	Needles, blood and going to the doctors really stress me out. I can withstand pain, but seeing blood and needle scare me a lot. The thought of the needle piercing through my skin and drawing my blood out. I had a complete check out at one time long ago to determine the cause of my vertigo. My primary care doctor sent me to this lab. They took 4 tubes of blood from me. The worse part, they told me not to eat anything prior to the blood drawn. I almost faint. I was dizzy, and feel like vomiting. The nurse me to laid down and rest afterward. It was so crazy. 
0.333300	I think the things that make me feel anxious or worried is the doctor coming back saying something is wrong with my health. I also gets a little worried when he's going over test results and finding out I'm not doing recommended suggestions like exercise or eat righg. I worried that im gonna get fussed at by my doctor for being hard headed.
0.714300	The biggest fear when going to the doctor is that something seriously wrong might be discovered. In fact, I have health anxiety, and the fear that a small normal sensation is cancer or some other disease is quite scary. That is what makes me nervous about visiting the doctor. 
0.333300	The results of tests or blood work and knowing the possibility of something major could be going on. 
0.928600	I am self conscious about my body, so I don't particularly like having to undress or show certain parts of my body. I don't like to be touched and I am also sometimes concerned with what my diagnoses could be or other things unrelated to the reason I am there that the doctor might find. 
0.642900	Just the overall atmosphere tends to get to me. It's never set well with me, and I doubt that it ever will.
0.166700	Well I have the normal worry of hoping that I don't have a serious conditions when ever blood tests etc are done. We all want to avoid bad news and pain. I know the irony is that avoiding the doctor heightens our chance of bad news when we finally do go. I learned this first hand when I when I had the emergency, telling myself that the pain in my chest and difficulty breathing was nothing to worry about. It turned out to be more serious than I thought.
0.857100	Just the thought that they might find something wrong or give me bad news about something.  Just going to the dr in general makes me a little nervous.
0.738100	I had thyroid cancer in the past and I need people who will pay attention to what I am saying and treat me as a patient and not as a disease 
0.381000	I am always a little bit anxious that the doctor may have some bad news for me. It is also not very fun to be poked and prodded and I have a fear of needles. 
0.714300	I feel anxious because of potentially being told some bad news. I also feel anxious at potentially having more of my time wasted by the purposefully inefficient system they have.
0.381000	I'm not a worrier and I'm not overly anxious but I think anytime I go to the doctor it's for very good reason - certainly not just a cold. So when I arrive, I am expecting something somewhat serious. Not cancer or some terminal diagnosis but something requiring treatment. 
0.500000	I know I am not in the greatest health. So when I go to the doctor's office I am quite worried that she may end up giving me bad news. I also have a family history of heart trouble, so I am very scared about that. 
0.571400	Just the unknown. I tend to be a bit of a worry-wart, so knowing everything will be ok and that I don't have X, Y or Z is always a relief. As I ge older, I realize the difference between being vigilent and attentive to one's own health and being a bit paranoid.
0.642900	I'm afraid they or going to find something wrong with me. This brings me emotional and financial uncertainty. I am also afraid they will treat me,but something will go wrong which can harm me further.
0.642900	Nothing foreal just wondering if something is really wrong with you.aBut u have to find out.Because it might be to late
0.309500	I feel most anxious if I need to have test done and need to wait for the results. I feel most worried if I am called in for a follow up appointment that I was not expecting.
0.333300	I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorder so it is something I struggle with in my day to day life.  However, going to the doctor sometimes causes my anxiety to increase just because I feel shy and awkward in the situation. 
0.500000	Not being able to know if something is wrong with me even though I feel quite healthy.  There could be something internal that we don't know and after doing blood tests are the times when I feel the most anxious to get the results back.
0.166700	Because I am male and my doctor is female and I am conscious of myself. I know she is a medical professional, but I just get a bit anxious. 
0.452400	Receiving bad news about my health. Overall, I'm healthy but something could pop up. Or if I go in for a certain reason and they can't provide good news about the condition. 
0.690500	That something will be wrong, that a slight twinge or pain I've had for a long time will turn out to be something terminal. And even though I've tried to be healthier, and do right by my life, and improve...that it all will be meaningless because I suddenly have some horrible disease (cancer, illness, etc.) that will cut my life short before I can get it back on track.
0.571400	Sometimes I had white coat syndrome. This is when I went to the doctor's office my blood pressure would be fine and then she would take my blood pressure and it would be elevated.
0.976200	What makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office is wondering how I am being judged by the doctor. The doctors and nurses are human too and it is embarrassing if something happens to me that does not normally happen if someone had taken care of themselves better. Like going to the dentist for example and having bad teeth because I donât brush everyday and could be prevented if I werenât so lazy. Or getting a UTI or a yeast infection because I was holding my pee for too long when I shouldnât have or not wiping myself properly.
0.857100	One of the main reasons I don't have a primary care physician is because I never liked going to the doctor as a child. Having physicals scared me really bad and I'm probably traumatized. So I am in no hurry to go to the doctor for any reason. If I get sick I just wait it out. 
0.476200	Just wondering how things are going to go. If there's something wrong with me. I don't want to come out with bad news but most of my visits are pretty good. I stay real healthy and workout a lot.
0.333300	I generally do not feel too anxious when I visit a doctor. The only anxiety I feel, is if the problem is worse that I had imagined. But overall I do not feel worried. 
0.285700	It depends on the examination, but I am very self conscious of my body shape, and worry they will judge or laugh behind my back. 
0.309500	I am also worried and anxious that something is going to be wrong with me.  I'm just afraid for the worst care scenario.
0.857100	You never know what they are going to find. Maybe they find something bad that always makes me very nervous.
0.381000	I am anxious or worried when I google symptoms myself and work myself up over what could be. I get worried that I may be sick with something contagious, especially when I am busy at work, because I often have to be at work to get certain things done. I also do not like being contagious because I worry I will get other members of my family sick.
0.214300	It's more just a general worry of could anything be wrong or irrational things like even though I'm on birth control is it possible I'm pregnant random things like that. Not so much an actual I am worried because of my doctor or any real possibility.
0.690500	Finding out what is actually wrong with me. And just having to tell them all my business. I'm not the most social person.
0.666700	I usually have to go to the doctor for sick visits.  In that frame of mind, I am already uncomfortable.  I am usually worried that I will have a long way to recovery, or I will need to take expensive medication.
0.666700	I always feel like the doctor is going to look at me weird or find something that is wrong that I wasn't aware of.  
1.000000	When visiting the doctor's office, I feel anxious or worried about not being given a choice about anything that may be wrong. I also feel anxious about being poked and prodded as well as being told I need a needle to make me feel better instead of treating a problem, the doctor treats the symptoms.
0.904800	"I guess I am most worried that something will be seriously wrong with me, because I don't have time to be sick. Also, I am overweight--not more than 15-20 pounds--but some doctors make nasty remarks about it. I had one male doctor ask me, "" How do you expect to find a lover when you're fat?""."
0.404800	I'm most worried that they will find something very seriously wrong that I had no idea was going on with my body.  There are many stories of people finding out they have cancer or other diseases when it's too late, and they never had symptoms.
1.000000	Because of my pre existing condition I suffer extreme fatigue, yet so many of the doctors want to prescribe me meds that have fatigue as a side effect, like gabapentin. I have to explain that I won't take medication that will fatigue me because I have a small child to take care of. I can barely function as it is with my level of disability, I don't want things that make it worse. Also I have a liver issue Gilbert's syndrome, that affects how I process medication. I've had weird side effects, for example to stemetil for nausea and was told by my doctor they only saw that in children or people with compromised liver enzymes. I have had bad reactions to all types of anti depressants from tri cyclics through SSRIs, which caused me in the former to be almost comatose and dissociated to in the later case have uncontrollable muscle spasms. I feel disbelieved by doctors and dread seeing them because they always want to give me drugs that give me adverse effects. The drugs that don't bother me so much they won't prescribe. For example NSAIDs completely mess up my stomach and acetaminophen is bad for my liver, so the best drug for pain relief for me is a small amount of codeine, not tramadol, not vicodin, not percocet, all the artificial opioids make me hallucinate, but codeine does not. However physicians wont prescribe codeine to me. I have complex over lapping conditions and none of my doctors talk or communicate with each other. I see a neurologist, a gastroenterologist, a urologist, an ent doctor, a breast specialist, an ob gyn. I get overwhelmed with all the advice and the lack of effective treatments for my diseases.
0.738100	Other sick people there, the wait times are long, whether the doctor has an accurate picture of my medical history.
0.333300	I'm currently still young, so there's not much for me to be worried about. My biggest concern is that there's some rare disease that I may one day develop, or that I get a family related health illness. Apart from that, I just worry that anything at all may have occurred and that I'm not a fit human being anymore. There's no real reason for me to be worried, and I understand that, but at the same time there's still a small sense of discomfort that I have. 
0.714300	I am a generally anxious person and any interaction with a doctor makes me feel uncomfortable. I am uncomfortable with my body and with the shape I am in so that plays into it as well. Mostly, I just feel like a freak and my problems are unusual or like the doctors are judging me and the shape that I am in. 
0.714300	I am afraid that a recurrence of a disease might occur. I am also allergic to many antibiotics, so any time that I have an infection, I am afraid that I will have a reaction if I am taking a new antibiotic. It is just a relief when the doctor tells me what the problem is and that it can be easily treated. 
0.261900	I do not feel anxious or worried.  I am prepared to accept anything that comes my way.  The only way I will be able to stop giving my murderis ex 65% of my only income, SS, is to die.
0.809500	I am most worried about the wait being too long. It would be great if they used a ticket system so we do not have to wait, crowded in an area where there might be germs left by sick people.
0.857100	I'm worried that they'll find something really wrong with me or that they'll say that I'm worse off than I think I am.  I'm also not a big fan of needles, and actively try to avoid getting stuck with one.
0.881000	It's always the fear and anxiety over wondering what's wrong with me. Do I want to know? No, but I have to. It's the anxiety of wondering if it's something serious. It's the anxiety of possibly receiving bad news. It's the anxiety of worrying about possibly having surgery. It's the anxiety of being surrounded by sick people in the waiting room. All of that combined makes me very anxious when I visit the doctor. And most of all, it's simply the anxiety of getting bad news that worries me the most.
0.142900	Can't say as I'm usually worried when visiting the doctor's office.  So, nothing? I pretty much know why I'm there and what the ultimate result/plan is going to be.
0.190500	Sometimes I think I have the white coat syndrome, especially when it comes to my B/P.  I used to be on B/P medication and it was getting too low so my doctor took me off the medication.  Now my B/P is slowly creeping back up.  I do not want to go back on the medication so everytime I go to the doctor and have my B/P checked, I am anxious about what it will be.
0.142900	I am usually not worried...just the awkwardness of say, a pelvic exam, or being in one of those glamorous paper gowns. I am not anxious about my health since I am only there for routine checkups.
0.785700	I have anxiety disorder so it's mostly just that. any kind of appointment makes me anxious in general so that doesn't help. 
0.476200	I need to lose about 40 pounds, and I need to eat better.  I always have plans to do that but never get it done.  
0.547600	I worry a little about my blood pressure because it runs high in my family but then I also know that if you worry about it, it will raise the pressure. So there is a bit of a feedback loop that goes on where I worry that I am worrying and it will then raise my BP. I also get a little nervous when they do the cancer checks. I know that its very unlikely because I am young and healthy but I had several family members that died of cancer growing up and seeing them deal with that disease is very scary and I really hope that I go a different way. 
0.261900	I just don't like being in a place that has sick people around since I get sick easily. I don't get extremely worried, but the thought of getting sicks is always just sitting in the back of my mind.
0.142900	I feel no worries or nerves when I walk into the office, because I know she will take good care of me. She has never let me down, and knows exactly how to cure me and knows what she needs to do in order to get me to feel better. 
0.333300	the unkown in general. until you talk to them or test comeback there is no actual knowing.   its just wait wait wait wait. 
0.142900	My biggest worries at the doctor's office are things like my weight an blood pressure.  Doctors very rarely give me any reason to feel anxious about their care.  I do not enjoy routine blood work or shots.
0.476200	If it is not a routing check up and there is some physical problem that caused me to go there than I obviously would be concerned that the result might show something I would not be happy about.
0.666700	I think it's just generally anxiety of being in a situation that isn't common and also the worry that they may end up finding that something is wrong even though I feel fine.
0.476200	I'm always worried that the doctor will be disappointed that weight isn't where it should be. I worry about the blood test results. It's part of the unknown that worries me. 
0.452400	The thing that makes me the most anxious when visiting the doctors office is worrying that I won't be taken seriously and won't get the help I need.  I feel like that happens a lot.  Also, I don't like when I have to get undressed and put on one of those hospital gowns for an exam.  I don't think anyone does.  The worst part is when I have to get a pap smear.  The speculum and the actual procedure is pretty painful too.  Another thing that makes me nervous is fear that I'm going to look stupid when I don't understand something exactly.  Also, if the doctor orders tests, that can be no fun although I know it's necessary.
0.642900	If I have a particular symptom that could require major intervention, such as surgery, I become worried. Pain, particularly orthopedic pain, can often mean a chronic problem has developed wherein I will need surgery or will have to stop an activity. This makes me anxious. 
0.547600	I only feel anxious or worried, because I do not know what the outcome will be. I know the doctor will be a great help, but getting to the results is the anxious part. 
0.642900	Me personally, I have social anxiety disorder. So I feel uneasy just leaving my house. I feel like mine gives the most worst case scenario much of the time. I end up worrying a lot until they get the test results back. I have been told I might have cancer. False alert. I was told I have diabetes and had to stick my finger twice a day for a year. Just to have another doctor tell me I didn't have it. etc.
0.904800	I always fear the worst, that something is really wrong with me. plus, I worry I'll be able to get all I need out of the appointment. 
0.642900	What makes me the most anxious and worried is that they do not do a thorough examination.  They move patients through like they are cattle and it's frustrating. People deserve a hundred percent of the  doctors attention for a complete physical that should really include blood work after a certain age. I'm worried that the doctors are working so quickly that they will miss something serious and by the time it's caught it will be too late and I'll end up dying from something that could have been fixed had it been caught in a timely manner. It scared me to think that could happen to me. 
0.452400	I worry that the doctor will find something wrong that I didn't notice.  Or that they will make negative comments about my life choices or lifestyle. 
0.333300	I am always anxious that anything I have that is bothering me will turn out to be something serious and untreatable. I always worry that I have cancer or will develop it at some point, because both my parents died of cancer. Although all my doctor visits are basically well visits, I still worry he will find something serious.
1.000000	I am anxious that my health is already ruined. I think about death too much and I am anxious that I am going to die
0.571400	I am worried about what kind of conditions that the doctor might find that I don't know of. I am also worried about things like high blood sugar and type two diabetes. I wonder if the doctor is judging things about my body, like my weight. This is often something I think of, the doctor judging my weight... I feel like I even hold back from going to the doctor because of the feelings of being judged. 
0.666700	When you are my age 66 any DRs visit can be worrisome. Your body breaks down with age. You worry that you are suffering from some kind of health issue.
0.642900	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office if I'm really sick. I feel this way because I wonder if something is seriously wrong with me. I think there may be other things wrong with me that the doctor may find that I didn't know about before. I wonder if there is something wrong with me that the doctor will not be able to cure or fix easily. I also think about how healthy I am in general compared to other people.
0.214300	I know I am a fairly healthy person I try to watch what i eat and exercise at lest three times a week, but even with all that you never know if the doctor finds something that is alarming. I never rule out a possibility of something bad occurring, that is why I try to limit these risks by choosing to live a healthy lifestyle.  
0.381000	I do not get anxious or worried about the actual examination or medical procedure itself, but more from a general misunderstanding of what is going on. I feel that I have no idea how much everything is going to cost and if I am even visiting the right doctor for the issue. If I am sick or have a medical issue, I don't know who to go to and do not understand how my health insurance policy works. 
0.238100	I would be most anxious and worried at a doctors visit if I was being tested for some form of cancer. I would worry that I would be confirmed for having a difficult or tough cancer to beat.
0.738100	I am worried frequently that they will again tell me nothing is wrong with me, despite a variety of seemingly unrelated symptoms that have persisted. I am also anxious that I will get overwhelmed and not be able to discuss my questions or accurately answer unexpected questions. 
0.523800	I am most anxious about the discovery of an underlying or latent condition that is not showing symptoms. I feel relatively fine and try to stay in good health but you never know what may come back in your blood work or what the doctor may find during an examination. 
0.142900	THE ONLY TIME I FEEL ANXIOUS OR NERVOUS WHEN I GO TO THE DOCTORS IS IF THEY THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG OR I AM SICK AND THINK I MIGHT BE NERVOUS OF THE OUTCOME.
0.238100	I still fear needles so I feel anxious when anything with needles is required. This includes vaccines and blood tests. Even the prick finger tests make me fear.
0.666700	When visiting my doctor for a routine check-up I'm generally calm and comfortable. I feel slightly anxious concerning lab results because that's what tells the true story. Visiting the doctor due to an illness causes the most anxiety because I know something is wrong. 
0.452400	That I am not going to receive the proper care and relief to my issues. That he is going to make a mistake due to laziness or make a wrong decision due to his comfort level
0.333300	That they will find something that is a medical problem. That my a1c will be too high. That my best efforts to take care of myself aren't good enough. 
0.714300	Feeling like a doctor missed something or I didn't speak up enough. That, and finding out something else that is just really awful.
0.142900	Sometimes I fear getting vaccinations. I only fear them because I never expect it so it takes me by surprise. Plus I have a low pain tolerance so that lays a huge role.
0.857100	I never know if I'm going to get bad news. I've lost a lot of family members due to several different illnesses (walking pnuemonia, breast cancer, liver disease, etc.) so I'm always on edge that I could be next. 
0.190500	there is always an element of anxiety about any exam. doctors are people too.  are they having a good day? are they focused on me? do they have time to listen to me? do i really feel what i think i feel. will they believe me when i describe what i feel?
0.452400	I feel worried that they will find something, mainly cancer, that I have not noticed going on with my body. I worry that they will tell me that I am not healthy for my age. I worry that they will tell me that I need to make changes in my lifestyle. 
0.523800	"I always wonder what my diagnosis will be; I am a worrier and always ""WebMD"" things and blow things out of proportion. I look forward to meeting with my doctor because she helps to put things into perspective for me."
0.547600	Just going to a doctors office makes me a little anxious. I have some anxiety issues so when doing something or going somewhere new I get nervous. I would also be a little worried that any issues I have would be passed off as just anxiety symptoms.
0.476200	Concern about what they may find and what they may have to say about my weight! :-) Other than that, I find it an enjoyable experience. 
0.690500	I tend to feel rushed and looked over quickly. I am hesitant to tell my physician any issues I am having due to this. This makes me anxious as I feel I am not getting a thorough evaluation and something might be missed. This is a cause of worry for me.
0.666700	In general I get stressed when going to a doctor. There is no certain reason why I get that way but I do. I think it may go back to my childhood going to doctors worrying about getting shots, etc.
0.714300	I am a bit (at least) out of shape and I have concerns that visiting will cause me to work on too many things that I know I should.  Lame, I know but I can live with it alright for now.
0.285700	how much time it will take, I don't like to wait.  other than waiting I don't mind going to the doctor's office.
0.714300	"A general health care facility doesn't always understand that some people are intelligent and they don't like when a patient says ""I don't want that"". "
0.666700	I am a cancer patient. I am approaching my 60th birthday, and I am beginning to experience health concerns that are related to my age. It causes me anxiety to learn about changing health parameters, such as blood pressure, that are more difficult for me to cope with due to my increasing age.
0.523800	I feel anxious and worried when i feel like my doctor may give me some terrible news about my health
0.357100	I DON'T OFTEN VISIT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE FOR MYSELF.  WHEN I DO GO TO A DOCTOR IT IS BECAUSE I AM EXPERIENCING AN ACUTE ILLNESS THAT IS NOT GOING AWAY WITH SELF CARE SUCH AS THE FLU.  I FEEL ANXIOUS BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IS WRONG AND MUST USUALLY BE GUIDED INTO CONCLUSIONS.
0.595200	Visiting the doctors office will always make me anxious due to the reason of the visit, or the idea that maybe the results of an analysis of blood work or urine sample is positive. Also getting an injection or the idea of getting an operation is frightening to me. The feeling is competently normal. Even if you are just doing a routine check up . The doctor can have a lot of patients to see before you ,and the idea of waiting in line for 30 min can make me anxious. You always assume the worst even if you have a mild cold or headache. With the flu season you always feel like you are the next person to have gotten it . Or when you get a mild rash from eating something with  citrus in it. Other than that I'm very happy after seeing my physician . It is calming  to know that everything is ok.
0.142900	"Not much.  I don't like giving blood samples, so that would be the biggest ""fear"" or cause for anxiety.  The other one is the prostate exam."
0.714300	That not only will something be wrong but something that I didn't even predict would be wrong as well.
0.309500	Just that they might find something wrong with me.  Like a mole that is too big or some lump I did not notice.  Nothing major just the general anxiety that comes with going to the doctor.  You never know when something that you think is small or did not even notice could turn into something big.  You hear about it all of the time.
0.976200	the not knowing what to expect and the knowing i usually get no answers and rarely ever do i ever feel better no matter how many  times i go and then i just have to get used to living with whatever the problem may be
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor because I know everything will be okay with my doctors care.
0.238100	Being unsure as to what the doctor may tell me concerning my health. Going to the doctor does not always go the way I would like it to. I do not always get the best results. Doctors do find issues that have to be resolved.
1.000000	What makes me feel the most anxious or worried in a doctor's office would be the fact that they will be giving me news on something I don't wanna hear or they are telling me I'm going to have to give labs and give blood.
0.357100	Probably the possibility of outcomes. I'm always nervous that the problems I'm there for will be something more serious. 
0.547600	I'm overweight, I don't like getting on the scales nor hearing about it. Otherwise not much else bothers me.
0.761900	I am always worried that the doctors will not listen to my concerns and take them seriously. Most doctors I have seen just wanted to give me medicines without actually trying to find the cause of the sickness itself. I am always worried when I see doctors now that they will not listen fully to my concerns. 
0.571400	The entire time. I don't just go for anything, but when I do it is usually serious. They have a tendency to treat people like cattle, and that makes it all the worse for an anxious person.
0.309500	"I don't typically go to the doctor for checkups, I only go when there is an issue. So I am always a little hesitant and worried something serious could be wrong. I have had ""good luck"" so far, but you never know what may be happening next."
0.666700	Most of my anxiety is the result of concerns about what my diagnosis might be and whether or not my treatment is effective. One of the chronic illnesses I have can have serious, life-threatening consequences if not treated properly as can the medications I take for it. I am not anxious about the actual physical process of being examined, with the exception of paps smears and mammograms as these are sometimes a painful process. I normally choose female physicians for all of my medical procedures and this the direct result of years of interacting with male doctors, many of who did not seem to understand my efforts to communicate symptoms. It may be me or it may have been them, but the end result is that I am much less anxious in any medical situation when I am attended to by a female doctor.
0.333300	I feel most anxious about how the interaction with the doctor will go, how I will be treated as a patient, and whether we can exchange the right amount of information to make informed decisions. 
0.547600	Sometimes you just do not know what they will find. I worry that they may tell me something is wrong that I had no idea existed, so I am always a little nervous. 
0.428600	I am sometimes anxious because i do not want to get bad news, or i am worried about the pain of a type of procedure 
0.309500	I'm a very self-conscious person, so sometimes I worry that something might be wrong with me. That's really the only anxious fear I ahve.
0.738100	I am always worried and concerned that something serious has developed since my last appointment. Itâs a fear based on nothing in particular 
1.000000	I hate it when they arrive late. I'm left sitting in a filthy room, waiting for them to come in and put their cold hands on me. Once she arrives, she is busy logging on to her computer and trying to convince me that I need to go on some blood pressure medication when I've never had high blood pressure in my life. It shoots straight up when I visit the hospital in anticipation of ill treatment. 
0.547600	Only when it may result in permanent bad news. I try to stay in good shape and would be nervous to receive unexpected bad news. 
0.214300	If it is not a routine office visit, I would be anxious/worried about what the test results are or what further testing is needed.  Maybe I need to have further tests to find out if anything is wrong, that makes me worried/anxious.
0.642900	I have aches and pains, and I really don't want to stop for surgery right now.  This would be my knees.  I sometimes feel afraid of worse diagnoses.  Plus my doctor doesn't hear me when I say the diabetes test is wrong.  I am diabetic and the numbers don't get good just like that.  Whatev.
0.428600	Finding out that something may be wrong. Having a couple of scary medical situations, of course, I'd feel uneasy. 
0.857100	I really only go to the doctor when I am sick.  I am overweight and I smoke.  I dread the lectures from the doctor. I know I should lose weight and I know smoking is bad for me.  The only reason I am there is to get help with whatever issue I have.
0.881000	I get very nervous when I have to visit the doctor because I have huge phobia of needles, so I am always worried they will have to run a blood test or give me a tetanus shot or have some reason or another to poke me. I am also always slightly worried they will find something horribly wrong with me like cancer or some incurable disease that only gives me a few months to live. That is always in the back of my mind, that I may be dying or have to get a shot, those are about the only things that worry me about going to the doctor.
0.285700	Well, most of the time I have been to see the doctor is for a symptom that I am aware of and know the severity of it. Only once have I been not knowing and I was anxious but fully relieved after the diagnosis.
0.428600	What makes me most anxious when visiting a doctor's office would be them finding out I have some grave disease. I also feel worried when they overthink things like giving medications or going through procedures that are not necessary.
0.309500	If I am having a procedure that is uncomfortable (such as a pap) I am generally a little bit anxious as it is uncomfortable.  Also, as a cancer survivor I get nervous that I may have a test that sparks cancer screening
0.785700	Typically a doctor visit means that something is wrong with my health. Often the results are benign but there's always a chance that the result comes back with a major illness or other issue.
0.809500	I do not like the fact that something might be wrong with me and I can't do anything about it. I do not like receiving shots either.
0.523800	What might be found out, what could be wrong with me.  Especially when going in with a new medical problem, something I haven't really experienced before.
0.571400	I am most anxious that they will find something that is incurable and will end my life as I know it prematurally.
0.238100	Due to my anxiety, I just get worried about going out some places in general. The doctor's is one of those places because I am always worried about what is going on with my body. 
0.500000	I always feel like this I'm about to get a cancer diagnosis or something. Or they're going to tell me I tested positive for the next black plague. 
0.547600	I'm now at the age where there is a possibility of receiving terrible news.  It ins't likely but still possible.
0.238100	I am most worried that I will not be diagnosed correctly when I am visiting the doctor's office.  This is due to inconsistency with doctors and PAs that I see.
0.714300	I worry that the doctor is going to talk to me about my weight. I think that they are focused on it and even if I am just doing something simple they want to weight me.
0.523800	I'm always afraid they might find something bad.  I have chronic abdominal pain and have not been able to get a diagnosis since it began over three years ago. Also, just having to talk to doctors makes me nervous.  I don't know why. It may be because I sometimes have to speak to them for my job and they can be very rude and scary sometimes.
0.500000	The initial first visit for an issue I am having bothers me most. Without any knowledge from them yet I get very anxious. When they tell me the diagnosis I get worried. 
0.595200	I usually feel a little exposed and also uneasy about the unknown. There is always a little fear that something may be wrong with me. I am worried that the doctor may judge me for having a little extra weight or for not taking care of myself right. I am pretty self conscious so letting someone see or feel parts of my body that I wouldn't normally expose makes me anxious and uneasy. 
0.714300	"I don't like the possibility of being diagnosed with something bad. I also feel like I will have to do my ""homework"" such as individual research and seeking second opinions before agreeing with what my doctor says."
0.595200	I get worried about talking about things that make me nervous. My private body parts are private to me and even the doctor makes me feel uncomfortable. I work to try to speak about these things but just never gets easier. Also worried about hearing I have sickness or disease thats not curable. Things get rougher and rougher with age and when I get older feel like somethings just bound to go wrong with my health. 
0.523800	I am worried about getting bad news, I worry that I might have something terminal. I have medical anxiety so I avoid the doctor a lot.
0.357100	I used to get anxious and worried, but not anymore. My doctor has given me the trust and the confidence that everything is alright and that everything is going to be fine.
0.714300	I always get nervous when it comes to my weight because I've had a weight problem for a long time and it has in no way gotten better.
0.785700	Always feel me anxious when I anticipate to see doctor, not for general exam,but probably for X-ray or blood test, or heart test  etc,Because I anticipate bad news, may be a disease or condition will be found.Or scary disease
0.142900	I don't really experience any anxiety when visiting the doctor.  I treat it as a normal activity that needs to get done. 
0.285700	There always is a feeling of dread that during a physical they will find something new and unexpected. The actual physical is not a problem. Though no one enjoys the blood draw.
0.690500	I do not know what he will do or say. I also fear something being very serious and needing to have to go to the hospital. I am not a fan of hospitals. I have had one surgery, and that is enough for me. I do not want any more. Think about it: One guy knocks you out while another cuts into you with a knife. Not something to make you feel good about.
0.428600	I usually do not feel this way at all whenever i have to go to a doctors office. Again my doctor does a good job of making me feel like im at home, and not uncomfortable. The only time i may have these thoughts slip into my head is if i do not know what is wrong with me and im just acting a bit panicky and uneasy. 
0.666700	I feel anxious that there's going to be something really wrong with me, even if I'm feeling okay.  Just going to the doctor's makes me think about possible problems.
0.500000	The past experiences with my doctor. Howw she views me. Something i think u views me as more of a number than a perso n.
0.476200	Any feeling of anxiety when visiting a doctor is usually because I would be feeling particularly unwell or unsure about something, and as result am expecting there to be a real problem. 
0.285700	Usually nothing makes me feel anxious. If anything would make me feel anxious, I guess it would be that as I get older, I feel more likely to have them find something wrong with me. 
0.619000	The unknown to me is definitely the worst part. I often think of the worst thing that could happen and it's hard to think of anything else afterwords. Sitting in the waiting room also makes me feel anxious because I keep thinking about anything bad that could occur.  Finally, when the doctor starts talking too fast or talks about confusing things i get nervous that I will not understand something.
0.428600	I usually know what I am there for, or I have an idea of what my issue could be. I am able to put my trust in the doctor seeing me and I feel confident they will diagnose me with the correct issue. I'm sometimes anxious about what will happen, since I don't know ahead of time. Mostly I just want answers and relief, so I'm more than willing to let them do their job and help me.
0.690500	I feel worried that something might be wrong with me and don't want to find out the bad news. I also don't like showing my body to my doctor. It can be very awkward.
0.666700	There's not really anything specific that makes me anxious. I think I just dislike getting examined by people in general. 
0.571400	I guess the only thing that truly makes me feel anxious or worried is just stupid bs that's in my head. I feel ashamed of myself for a variety of reasons, especially when it comes to finances and lack of being able to afford insurance. My doctor has never given me a reason to feel these things though, and has actually helped aleve some of these worries and concerns.
0.666700	I feel anxious or worried when I have to remove my clothes. Also, when I am concerned that my problem may be serious.
0.857100	I am not a doctor so I don't have the knowledge or equipment to test and find factual results and when you do your own research or diagnosis it usually looks more bad than good and you don't know what's going on for sure.
0.142900	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office when I know my health is not good.  I feel the knowledge that I have about health nutrition can be worrisome when I find myself at a doctorâs office.  I do sometimes get anxious because I was either unaware of my mental condition or physical condition during my visits.  I felt that my physical health was in good standing, but then I take a visit to the doctorâs office, and I am told that I still need to fix my high blood pressure and cholesterol.  Not all visits are worrisome, its just keeping on track with what my doctorâs tells me to do until the next visit.    
0.404800	"going to see a doctor is never pleasant but i rarely experience any severe anxiety.  i certainly don't experience dread.  i think one reason for this is i'm about to turn 62.  i realize that although i'm not VERY old, most of my years are in the past and i know it's inevitable that my health, at some point, will take a negative turn and perhaps a drastic one.  i can deal with that because, as the old saying goes, ""none of us get out of here alive.""  i think i can deal with whatever i learn at any medical appointment.  the only time i'd be real anxious is if i knew i was facing a painful procedure."
0.976200	I'm worried that he is going to give me a difficult diagnosis and if I don't have someone there with me? Like a close friend or family member? I'm not sure how I would handle the situation because No one likes to be alone when bad news is delivered.
0.547600	From time to time I am guilty of thinking along the line of assuming the worst rather than keeping it simple. In those types of thinking cycles it is easy to get worked up about some tests because I can imagine the results will come back telling me I have some horrible disease or worse. The reality is usually less traumatic.
0.619000	When I visit the doctor, I don't know how long I'll end up waiting. Sometimes, I'm worried about what I might find out. I really just don't get a lot of enjoyment from visiting the doctor.
0.761900	What makes me feel most anxious is being misdiagnose with a terminal disease like cancer or HIV when i never really had it. I'm scared to get vaccinations when i'm healthy because i feel it will only make me susceptible to those diseases. I believe the only thing that gets sick is your mind and if i begin to feel helpless due to a misdiagnosis, my immune system will get weaker and the virus will be easier to take over my body & emotions.
0.952400	I worry about the doctor giving me a lecture about my weight or other lifestyle choices. I am also afraid of being told that something could be wrong with me, especially something that I could have prevented if I had taken care of myself better or come in more urgently. I also worry sometimes if I will be taken seriously when I list my concerns and symptoms, or if they will be brushed off.
0.500000	Coming out with some diagnosis that I did not expect. Also coming up with something that would be expensive to treat.
0.190500	The situation that makes me feel most uneasy is if my concerns will be brushed off and that I will be treated like I'm overreacting and that I don't know anything. 
0.142900	The only time I feel anxious at the doctor's office is when I feel like I may be receiving bad results.  Other than that I never feel anxious or worried while visiting my doctor's office. My doctor puts my worries at ease.
0.523800	The biggest concern is that a serious, non-treatable issue will be uncovered.Going hand in hand with that is that treatment for an uncovered medical issue might not be affordable.
0.309500	I have white coat syndrome. No matter how many doctors appointments I have I always get nervous! Even if it's a normal check up! My blood pressure rises, and I typically have low blood pressure. But not at the doctor's office! And I know this so then I get nervous about my blood pressure going up, which of course makes it go up more. 
0.285700	Mostly, it is the fear of the unknown. I have high blood sugar, and I am always concerned that my doctor might tell me that I am a diabetic. That would be very traumatic for me. This relates to my weight, and I worry what my doctor's scale will show for that.
0.452400	I have brain tumors. They've been controlled and benign for a few years now. I'm always fearful they will come alive again or others will develop. I get MRIs a couple times a year, and I'm always anxious waiting to hear the results of those.
0.547600	This is easy, I am always worried about cancer or some unknown thing that will kill me. I am constantly asking questions, trying to understand everything and then making sure without a doubt that I am either fine or take steps to get better.
0.761900	I am a young guy with an old guy's problem. I have a high pain tolerance and have been dealing with my ailment for at least 10 years. Most doctors don't seem to believe me when i say i am in almost unbearable pain. I feel like doctors think i'm lying about my problems to get painkillers which is not the case. I fantasize about the day when I won't need to take any medication. I get very anxious when describing my symptoms and lack of healing or improvement because I feel defensive every time i see a doctor,.
0.761900	I just have a general fear or phobia of doctors and always have had this. I don't like being there and never will
0.809500	I think about how much everything is going to cost.  If you have a sore throat they can somehow make that into about $300 in cost.  The appointment?  $160.  The strep test, another $100.  Like, what the hell man!
0.595200	I am concerned about if they find a serious condition that could be life-altering or life-threatening.  I am not concerned about them but what they might discover.
0.904800	I worry a lot about how I am going to pay for it. Then I wonder if thing are as bad as the seem ur are the trying to get more money. I get scared that they are going to tell me there is something wrong that I can't come back from.
0.357100	I just get nervous that something could be wrong with me that I am unaware of.  Also getting tests done makes me nervous of the outcome
0.714300	I worry that the doctor will find something that is wrong and needs to be treated but the cost of medical care is so expensive that I will not be able to afford treatment.
0.238100	It's the normal. Everyone is afraid of dying. I'm no different. I'm  anxious that the doctor will find something and it will be something horrible, something fatal, something no one can do anything about. My mother went to the doctor for knee and came out having found out she had a slow moving form of liver disease. It can happen. You can go in with a minor ache or pain and come out knowing what's going to kill you.
0.428600	Usually I get worried because the outcome is unknown and I am not sure what is going to happen. I think alot of this fear is due to not wanting to have some major medical issue come about such as cancer or other very prominent diseases. Also it is not somewhere you go very often and is usually associated with death, illness and pain so these places are naturally scary to someone who doesnt go often or is awaiting a bill of health. Also the cost is another concern and can cause stress in someone who visits because something simple can still be expensive. 
0.785700	I have had nurses and doctors underestimate pain, so I am constantly worried that I will not be taken seriously or believed. 
0.547600	Even if I'm perfectly healthy for some reason I get a little anxious because you can never know what will really happen. There are people younger than me that have died from cancer and horrible things, so it's always in the back of my mind.
0.714300	From the beginning, when they leave you in the room alone after taking your basic vitals is nerve wracking.

0.666700	I've always been an anxious person, I tend to think it's because my mother died when I was young.

0.238100	I sometimes get worried I'm going to get some bad news like there is something wrong that's going to cost money I didn't foresee. Also I get worried I might get some type of negative diagnosis sometimes.
0.857100	I was struggling with a condition that i did research on and found out that the symptoms matched a disease i feared greatly so when i went to my doctor and told him of my symtoms he scheduled some tests and an exam, during the exam i had all if these feelings because i feared receiving the news that i was right.
0.523800	I always think there is going to be something wrong with me, or it will be even more negative I get worried cause all of my health issues.
0.523800	I dont know if I will have good news at the end or bad news. It makes me nervous to go through something like it.I dont like the uncertainty of what the outcome might me

0.285700	I am always worried that I may get bad news in any dr office. I am nervous I may get bad news and I may get. 
0.714300	Sometimes I feel like I'm going to learn news that I cannot unhear. That I will hear that I am finally dying and that I cannot do anything more to prevent the ill fate that has been thrust upon me.
0.785700	I feel most anxious and worried in a doctor's office because I am uncomfortable in a setting where I feel vulnerable and alone. I don't like one on one settings with someone I barely know. I don't want to be uncomfortable talking about something I don't want other people to know about, or the doctor having to examine me naked.
0.785700	I feel worried or anxious when visiting the doctors because I am not used to doing so. I don't like how white and clean and empty the patient rooms are, how odd and sterile they are. I don't like having the possibility to be told that there is something seriously wrong with me either.
0.857100	Well, having been misdiagnosed and, on other occasions, groped by doctors in an inappropriate sexual way (especially by 2 ob/gyn practitioners) has resulted in my being anxious and worried whenever I visit. One misdiagnosis nearly cost me my life--thank goodness I was able to figure out what was wrong--I then marched back to the doctor's office and demanded the right course of treatment. I have also been subject to Dr. Perverts--as in two ob/gyns who sought fit to check my breasts for cysts by groping them for long periods of times. One ob/gyn even closed his eyes and smiled as he squeezed my breasts and told me afterwards how beautiful my breasts were. Suffice to say, I feel anxious, worried and very much on guard when visit the doctor's office.

I get social anxiety.  I am sometimes a bit uncertain about the results.  When I get checkups, I am generally expecting them to go well especially if I haven't had any issues prior to coming.  But you never know if some test result or exam comes back questionable and you have something serious or concerning wrong with you.  Or some expensive testing procedure that of course insurance won't cover.  Money and pricing is always a concern with doctor visits.  Sometimes I feel strange that every doctor can see all my previous digital health information which makes me uncomfortable.  Many times I feel violated for having to sign away all my rights in the paperwork.  And the office staff is usually rude and abrupt and treats you less than humanely.
0.428600	The discovery of a new ailment that would lead to new treatments and medicines with uncertain outcome.  You always want to be healthy, but sometimes as you age you are not sure whether something may pop up unexpected.  Also, as you age the number of tests and labs seem to increase. This leads to a time of worry and anxiety to get the results back.  Hopefully, the doctor can put your mind at ease if relevant that the tests are just a precaution. So you do not have to worry while waiting.  Otherwise, you can just try to lead the healthiest life possible and go in to the office confident that you are ok.
0.523800	Getting bad, difficult or negative health news, is what makes me most anxious about visiting the Doctor's.
0.142900	I worry that my diagnosis will be worse than I think and will result in a more serious disease than I initially thought
0.976200	When visiting the doctor's office I am always filled with anxiety and dread due to the environment always giving me that feeling since childhood. It probably roots back to a fear of needles and too much media, but it still affects me to this day. Today, it would instead be a fear of being diagnosed with some incurable disease or being told that I can no longer do the things I enjoy in life due to some pain or injuries. Outside of that, a routine doctor's visit is normally only filled with worry on the drive there. I usually leave feeling more ensured and happier than when I came in.
0.357100	I feel most worried about the long waiting I hate waiting I don't have much patience. It feels like it takes forever to talk to someone. I also feel worried about getting sick from someone else that's sick visiting the doctor's office. I am worried about being diagnosed correctly. Because I don't want to have to go all the way back and then have the physician try to guess again what is wrong with me. It's already a hassle getting to the doctor's office.
0.404800	No one wants to get on the scale.  Unless they've been losing weight, everyone thinks they weigh too much.  Especially me!
0.404800	When the doctor reads my sugar levels; I know he will scold me, and try to convince me to take insulin injections, instead of oral medications.

0.666700	I get most worried or anxious when I visit the doctor's office, whenever I have to take my little one to see a doctor. I get more worried because I don't take my kids to the doctor unless they are really ill and I see a lot of media talking about really dangerous, possibly deadly, flu's and other illnesses out there. I worry about these because a child can easily get these illnesses from just being at the store and someone sneezes or coughs. They can even get sick if someone coughed on an item in the store and I touch it and then hold my kids. Being a parent is already worrying but having to worry about their health whenever something like this arises, is very stressful and irritating because I tend to get really antsy and nervous while waiting for the doctor's diagnosis. I had to take my daughter to the ER a few times because she had a high fever temperature, and at the time there was a big outbreak of the flu that was nationwide and causing deaths for some young kids and the elderly. Because of this reason, I decided to take my daughter to the doctor to make sure she was alright. She ended up being fine but just the information on the news and the media and her being sick just made the whole situation nerve wrecking. 
1.000000	Money. I have no insurance so if there's something serious and I have to be rushed to the hospital, I will never be able to pay for it. I would rather they just leave me on the examination table to die than help at that point. I'm already in debt because of college loans; I literally can't afford to be in any more debt than I already am.
0.142900	I feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor if I have had some signs that something might be wrong.  Also, when I have my yearly exam I always hold my breath until my blood work comes back.  I am always afraid that something might show that something is wrong.
0.666700	There's the concern that something could be wrong. I avoid testing altogether. There's just a generalized anxiety with visiting the doctor as well as it can feel like an invasion of privacy.
0.428600	I don't generally feel anxious when visiting the doctor because I'd rather find out whether or not something is wrong with me than remain in the dark. If I have to go in to have a procedure of some sort, however, then I do feel nervous just because of the uncertainty of the outcome.
0.904800	I always worry that an incurable problem will be discovered and /or that I will find out terrible news about my health.
0.928600	I worry about needing painful procedures. Even innoculations scare me. I cannot stand the thought of a needle piercing my flesh and gouging a hole in a muscle.

0.571400	I think that the time constraints upon my doctor visit. I don't know what to discuss with them and it seems that if I bring up too much, I may be charged for an extra visit. And, when I bring up something with my primary care physician, it will probably result in one or more referrals which I prefer to avoid.
0.547600	I have anxiety to being with, and any kind of scrutiny amplifies it. When the doctor is performing a checkup, I feel like I am in the spotlight and being judged. 
0.357100	I am worried with the test result.  Worried on what if I have the non cure disease of what if I'm dying.  That's awkward but it's really what I feel.

0.547600	I am most anxious that I am going to get some bad news about a problem I have no control over and there is nothing I can do about it
0.642900	Due to the fear mongering that has gripped this fine country, I think most people worry about a serious or deadly diagnosis each time they visit their physician, even if there isn't a specific reason why these feelings should exist (i.e. the person being diagnosed is in good health, eats well, exercises regularly, etc.).

0.619000	I have a general anxiety towards all doctors and healthcare providers. My doctor I trust very well but I still feel somewhat anxious when seeing any kind of healthcare provider. This is something that I just have to deal with when seeing a doctor.
0.619000	I have a chronic condition that killed my mother. I am always worried that it will become worse. Secondly is the unknown. By that I mean what if something new has cropped up? I am a passenger in this body and I will not get a second one. There is always the uncertainty of the unknown.
0.714300	If I'm going there about something that I've noticed as a problem, I fear that it is some bigger problem that could be painful/long treatment to fix if it is even fixable.  I also know there are some issues in my family that could someday present themselves in me and I really don't want to have those problems.
0.381000	I sometimes am worried about the outcome or what I may find out. Don't want there to be something wron with me. that is waht I get most worried about.
0.142900	I think the thing that makes me feel most anxious is when I don't know what's wrong with me and don't know if the doctor will know as well. When I was diagnosed with chronic hives I was always anxious or worried when meeting with the allergist because I wasn't confident that the hives would go away and the situation would be resolved. The fear of them not knowing what to do when I have no idea what to do is what gets me worked up. 
0.761900	Anything medical sets off my anxiety. I'm always afraid they are going to find something so terrible that it can't be dealt with. Frankly, I rather not know and be happy if that is the case. 
0.428600	Hearing bad news or being told that you have a medical condition. Also if the doctor will be caring about the health of his/her patients.
0.285700	The thing(s) that make me most anxious while visiting the doctors office is the unknown. Sometimes when I am sick and do not understand why, the waiting to find out causes more anxiety than what it is worth.
0.690500	Most things make me anxious, so it is not necessarily a special occasion. I do not do well with uncertainty, so if it something beyond a checkup or the like, enter: anxiety.
0.357100	Don't really like someone proding or poking me or asking personal questions. I also don't like the idea of something going on that I may not be aware of that could have major complications on my life and my family. 
0.666700	Basically, I have a constant fear that Iâm dying. Cancer, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, brain tumors,
0.619000	If it is a routine office visit I'll likely not be anxious or worried since I don't anticipate any unpleasant surprises. If the appointment is due to a new or on-going problem I'm most worried about whether or not there is an easy solution to this particular health issue.
0.285700	I'm worried that I won't present my case or issues well, and that I'll be brushed aside. My doctor doesn't have intimate knowledge of my history, and I'm worried I'll somehow leave out information that would help them identify my problems.
0.642900	It makes me most fearful that something will be seriously wrong . Or that something might be painful. But the unknown is worse.
0.404800	I often worry I have a new medical condition or that an old condition has returned. If that happened I would have to take new medications and have longer visits with my doctors.
0.142900	I don't feel dread with most doctors. I dread getting any sort of OB-GYN exam for obvious reasons.  (It's weird, intrusive, and unpleasant.)  With new doctors, I worry about being dismissed as not knowing my own body or not being taken seriously.  
0.785700	I feel very anxious when I am sick because I don't like not being in control. I don't know that the doctors make me feel any more anxious but they don't necessarily alleviate that anxiety.
0.547600	I usually not too anxious going to the doctor but there is some there.  You always here the horror stories of healthy people going in for a routine checkup and walking out with a serious disorder.  That is scary.  
0.785700	The cold sterile setting is rather unnerving, causing my anxiety levels to skyrocket. Knowing that anything I say to the doctor could be taken out of context and cost me my License/Job/Freedom due to a simple misunderstanding. The waiting can also cause stress and worry. It seems to take forever for a doctor to even make it into the room to examine you, and even longer to come back and explain what steps are next. Finally, Even when I know what is wrong, or the reason I am there and try to explain why or what helps because I've been through it before, I'm treated like an idiot or a criminal, or a faker while they order more tests to make my bill even higher. 
0.642900	i am anxious or worried about what might be the diagnosis , scared of any new illnesses or anything that will make me have to come back for any sort of treatment
0.547600	I just don't like having to go to the doctor. The waiting around, being around other people. Feeling like I might be wasting their time. 
0.976200	I'm honestly not scared of needles, shots or anything like that. I have many tattoos and piercings so to me a shot or needle is nothing at all. I get so uneasy and worried to the point that I'm nauseous. I think it's because I overly worry that the doctor is going to find something or say I'm sick with something, I'll need further testing elsewhere, or I have only a few months to live. I know that's like the extreme, but that really terrifies me just incase. I also worry that the doctor or nurses know something I don't and they won't tell me and talk about it behind my back or something weird like that.
0.261900	Worried that the diagnosis will be negative and effect my life. If it involves a procedure I get worried about the pain and not being able to control it when I leave the doctors office. 
0.785700	First and foremost, I hate going to the doctor office simply because I do not want to be around other sick people.  I'm afraid that I might pick up some sickness from someone else and then end up feeling actually worse than I already was feeling.  Also, I hate just sitting in the doctor office because it seems like they are so slow about calling you back to actually see the doctor.
0.381000	I am always anxioius or nervous because you never know what they will find. I am also nervous about the cost and what my insurance will cover.
0.142900	I do not get nervous when visiting the doctor's office. Getting anxious accomplishes nothing so I do not waste my energy on it.
0.285700	I'm a cancer survivor, so I always worry that something seriously wrong will be found. Certain exams are more uncomfortable than others. Sometimes, I feel anxious about possible pain.
0.881000	I have social anxiety, so just getting to the doctor and actually going are tough for me. I feel so much anxiety when I need to visit my doctor, 
0.666700	I get anxious about what I want to discuss.  The things that I typically want to discuss are sensitive subjects including anxiety and depression.  Additionally, I have a tragic history with healthcare outcomes, and I'm often forced to bring it up when discussing my healthcare history.  This makes me anxious, because I don't want to cry or feel depressed in front of the doctor.  I also get anxious about getting new medications or getting blood draws.  I dislike anything painful, and I get nervous when I am about to get test results.
0.166700	I fear that something will be wrong with me, that I will be sick and I won't know it, and when they find out it will be too late.  But that is just a general feeling and doesn't really have too much to do with doctor visits, per se.
0.285700	The only thing that would make me feel anxious when visiting a doctor is if I have something that could potentially be serious. I would be worried about it being something worse than what I think it is.
0.238100	I am hoping to get the most out of my visit. I want to be able to be comfortable with my doctor for future purposes.
0.714300	It is a little unnerving having to unclothe and have a doctor prod around in private areas. I know it has to be done, but it makes me uncomfortable.  I am anxious about the exam itself more than finding out something is wrong.  Doctors try to make patients feel comfortable about this, but it's not easy. 
0.142900	I feel anxious or worried if there is a new employee .Example the person who take your blood. If he or she is new I do not know if they have enough experience.. I will not let them  stick me with a needle several times to get blood.
0.285700	I don't generally feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office. I trust the physician and I don't have any serious ailments so I don't really have reason to worry.  At worst, sometimes I forget to bring my insurance card or have to do paperwork. The paperwork is always the worst part.
0.285700	I get anxious when I don't know the doctor and do not have a rapport or have had a bad personal experience with the doctor. 
0.547600	My blood pressure always goes higher in the doctor's office. I check it at home and know what it is.  Then I get a lecture on the blood pressure and then I get a lecture on my weight.
0.642900	Finding out the worst case scenario, even though it is usually very simple treatment. For example going in for a cough and being diagnosed with cancer.
0.738100	I am often unsure of what protocol my doctor will implement. I also feel insecure abut myself and physical condition and this makes me anxious in the doctor's office.
0.690500	I am most anxious if they grab my nuts. I hate when they have to examine everywhere it's just uncomfortable and they need a new procedure. That is just wierd.
0.714300	I am most anxious when awaiting results. The unknown is always the most stressful for me, because I can't figure out how to proceed. I also don't particularly like needles, but it is more the time between seeing the needle and it actually going into my arm that is stressful. 
0.142900	Nothing at all.  I feel completely calm and collected when I visit his office.  The only issue I ever have is somebody bringing a loud obnoxious child to the office with them but that doesn't really have anything to do with the office itself.
1.000000	I worry about getting really bad news one day. I worry the doctor will find some condition or disease that has cause irreversible damage.
0.523800	What makes me anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office is them finding something that is seriously wrong with me. In some degree, everyone fears dying and living a lifestyle where they virtually have none. I do not go to see a doctor very often at all and when I do, It's usually for something pretty serious. Therefore I worry a bit because I obviously do not completely know how the outcome may be.
0.523800	The unknown variables of health tend to make me feel most anxious and worried. Especially when dealing with critical or chronic conditions, the downsides to health complications can be dire and that is something that I would rather avoid.
0.785700	I feel uncomfortable in general in a doctor's office. I feel worried about being touched by someone who is generally a stranger.
0.404800	I HAVE COMPLETE TRUST IN MY DOCTOR SO I'M USUALLY NOT ANXIOUS OR WORRIED. IT MAY COME TO THAT SOME DAY BUT SO FAR IT HASN'T. EVEN NOW WITH MY LAST CT SCAN IT SHOWS A SPOT ON MY LUNG HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT BUT I'M NOT TO WORRIED ABOUT IT YET. MAYBE IN THE FUTURE I WILL BE.
0.738100	Test results are usually the because factor because I feel like the doctors sometimes focus on the test result and no other factors. I feel like I shouldn't be the only one fighting for my health. 
0.738100	When it comes to visiting the doctor the thing that makes me the most worried is simply not knowing how things will you. I hate that there is a possibility that I can get some really bad news that would cost me financially, physically or mentally. It's very nerve racking. 
0.547600	Potentially having something life threatening wrong with me. My doctor missing something important. Having to take medicines with terrible side effects.
1.000000	What makes me feel most worried anxious is when my doctor is rushing me to see another pather...this is when he overbooks.
0.690500	I'm worried that a doctor will order a test that will result in negative results (negative meaning detrimental to my health). Sometimes it's easier not knowing that something is wrong than confirming that there is a problem.
0.595200	I have a medical condition that can get worse over time.  It could require surgery and this makes me anxious about doctor's visits.  I don't delay making an appointment likely because of my good relationship with the doctor.
0.738100	I am not good with needles, and I have had a bad experience in the past when they pricked my finger. I almost passed out, so they had to take me back into a room. I ended up having a blood blister and bruising on my finger for the next few days. 
0.142900	Nothing, I know that I am in good hands with my present doctor. Previous to him I would be anxious and scared because I knew that I was wasting my Co pay on not being treated for my issues. I o lying go to the doctors office maybe once or twice a year, when something is severe, so I am in no way shape or form a hypochondriac. 
0.142900	I have never felt anxious or worried when I go to see my doctor. The only way I would be if he found something wrong. He has never made me feel anything but trust and loyalty. I am very pleased with this man
0.142900	I think that it would be the part about receiving the worst information about your health. I think that interacting with your doctor should not make a patient anxious or worried, what worries me is receiving bad news from the doctor. Waiting for those test results is also very worrisome. 
0.381000	That I will hear bad news, or that I will be told something that will frighten me. I would not like to hear something negative regarding my health if I do not need to. I also dislike hearing possible diagnoses, when there is no reason to be worried about them. 
0.428600	exams are unpleasant,  worry about what might be found.  not fun sitting in a paper gown waiting 30 mins in a cold room for the dr to show up.   
1.000000	I have high blood pressure and it elevates in the office.  I don't want more medications as it is fine otherwise. However, my doctor just keeps adding more even though I have it taken by a nurse at the school I teach in and it is so very much lower - normal in fact. 
0.214300	My family has an extensive history of health issues and each time I go to my doctor I am concerned that he is going to find something or diagnose a condition.  Often times I am waiting on the test results to see if everything is fine or not and that makes me anxious.
0.523800	For me to show up at the doctor's office with a complaint means that I am acknowledging that I am experiencing something that is beyond my capability and that I need help with. Just there I am going to be anxious going in. And if there are concerns shown for my tale of woe and tests ordered than I am going to be a little bit worried just not knowing what the test will show.
0.761900	I am anxious that there is something wrong with me that I am unaware of. I am anxious that I have some condition that is uncurable or chronic or otherwise scary.
0.523800	Cancer is always a fear and imaging scares me in case of that. After diagnosis where medications can help, I feel better.
1.000000	I have had so many of them refuse to treat me I am scared every time I walk in. I have had to travel around states and the country finding care. I am fully aware I may not get treated and not to take it personally. I am tired of being called crazy or a liar when I am really sick and NOT feeling well.
0.452400	Sometimes I feel anxious that what I think is some pretty minor thing will end up being something major.  Or that I will be one of the cases that end up in the news of doctors doing something totally wrong for the patient (amputating the wrong leg, etc.).  I also don't care for shots...
0.476200	The thing that worries me is not so much what he is telling me as a patient, but what he is not telling me for some reason outside of my best interest. I am definitely worried that he may not be as thourough as he should be, or that his recommendationas could have a negative impact.
0.642900	I feel most anxious if I am actively having a health issue and have to wait a long time to be seen. Waiting a long time causes me to go to worst case scenario in my mind and by the time I'm in the exam room I am sometimes a bit nervous.
0.214300	What would make me feel anxious is if they were new in treating me. I would worry about whether or not we would have a good rapport. I would also worry about whether or not they were a holistic doctor or if they just wanted to push pills. I would also feel anxious if I was worried I had something bad going on. 
0.452400	It makes me nervous. I hate weighing in. I do not like that sick people germs in the office. I don't like having to take my clothes off and get in that paper gown. It usually ends up ripping and that's always uncomfortable when that happens. Noone likes to wait to hear if there's bad news. It's always uncomfortable even when I like my doctor. It could be a head game for all I know?
0.381000	Because I am getting older and am reaching the age when all of the men in my family either have died already or been diagnosed with cancer, I am anxious about that history and the likelihood that it is ineveitable that it will happen to me, and that this likelihood increases with age, and it will be a doctor visit that fisccloses that the end is coming soon.
0.142900	That I will only bring important things to discuss with him.  That I listen to what he says and follow his orders.
0.142900	doctors visits usually never make me feel ill at ease. i am in pretty good health and dont have much to worry about.
0.500000	I usually get worried about any of the tests that they decide to do and whether it is going to be painful or not. I also worry about the potential diagnosis I get, and whether it is going to be life hindering. But mostly, I worry that they don't detect the illness in time and it ends up getting to the point where they can't treat it anymore. 
0.238100	Family history of blood pressure issues. This always crosses my head as I been told that while my blood pressure is still within the normal range , it is in the higher borderline. The second this that pops to my head is that you never really know if everything is 100% fine. You may feel fine but may still be sick.
0.190500	I feel anxious when i think something major is wrong. This is what makes me very worried and stressed out and I hate that feeling. I hate knowing that a test is pending as it bothers me a bit. It really gets to me overall.
0.309500	I am afraid that they WON'T listen to me or treat me like an individual and a real person and will rush through and only give me about 8 minutes of their time and not even ask if I have any questions.

0.381000	I don't get anxious too often with doctors, they are there to help. The only part that makes me anxious is not knowing what the problem is and how costly the fix will be. More often than not it's expensive or time consuming.
0.261900	I just have a general anxiety that I'm not providing the correct information or that there is something wrong that I don't know about. I also don't like needles or pain so I get uneasy that blood tests will be ordered.
0.500000	"I'm just generally nervous when talking to people I'm not really familiar with, so going through the whole chain of interactions from front desk to nurse to doctor is a little bit stressful for me. But not the ""I'm afraid"" sort of stress. It's more of a ""where do I put my hands? Why did I say that? "" sort of stress."
0.142900	There is very little that makes me anxious.  Doctors dont make me anxious at all.  I just don't enjoy hearing possible bad news.
0.285700	That i might not get what i want done. That iâll pay a lot of money for no benefits.  I do not have anxiety about visits.
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious is not knowing if there is anything wrong with me when it seems like there is not. It is also just the unknown and maybe the doctor having to bear that bad news to tell me. There is also me having to worry what the doctor will think too. 
1.000000	I have a major fear of doctors and my health in general. I am always afraid that  I will be diagnosed with something or made to have a procedure that will cause me pain. It terrifies me that we put so much trust in doctors and that what they say could change the course of my life. I am probably overreacting though.
0.523800	White coat syndrome. Usually when I attend the doctor it's something I've decided isn't going away by itself (common cold etc) so I usually am anticipating the worst at the appointment. 
0.500000	That I might get a bad diagnos8s I fear that something might be really wrong with me I also don't like needles so I am scared I might need to take a shot
0.642900	I am often anxious that I will be judged if I speak the truth about my health care needs and concerns. I am concerned that I am sent to different doctors who ultimately don't have answers for what is going on with me. I am worried my doctor will continue to push me to take meds that I suffer side effects from. I worry that I will fail to convince my doctor that I am really having problems.
0.738100	i dislike any procedures that involve needles or injections.  plenty of general procedures really aren't very pleasurable. there are plenty of other places i'd rather visit than the doctor's office.  
0.642900	I'm always afraid that I will catch something there. I also, feel anxious that I will have a bad test result. I worry they will find something seriously wrong with me. 
0.523800	I worry whether or not I will receive bad news. The longer I go without seeing a doctor the worse this feeling becomes. Similar to the dentist.

0.833300	I fear what the doctor might tell me. I will worry from the day I make the appointment until I finish the visit. If I were dying, I don't think I would want to know. Doctors don't seem to understand this fear.
0.595200	I feel most anxious at the doctor when  I have an unexpected pain that I need looked at. I get anxious because I never know what the outcome will be. I have a huge fear of cancer, not a fear of dying from it but a fear of having to fight it.
0.833300	I think what makes me feel the most anxious and worried is that I might have a serious condition or disease. Sometimes being examined feels a bit uncomfortable as well.
0.571400	Probably being told that there are more serious issues than I though there was and having to do more treatment. 
0.357100	I'm always just a little worried something really bad will come up in the visit. I try to be completely honest about my physical condition, but I fear the doctor might discover something really serious about my health. I'm in a career field where my physical health (and lack of prescription medications) is extremely important, so I wouldn't want anything to come up that would affect my work.
0.619000	My doctor is very blunt, so when I go to him I am a little nervous. He will tell me if I gained weight and he will usually talk about it with me constantly throughout the visit.  I'm usually worried that he will tell me that there is something seriously wrong with me. Thats been my fear for awhile. I just hate sitting in the office because I feel like there are a lot of germs and I will get sick.
0.523800	Because I worry about that something is wrong with my body like perspiring too much when I exercise. She did a papsmear and did not find anything so I felt better. I worry about bad results.

0.714300	I get anxious and worried because I feel like something is going to pop up in my health records that is just going to throw my life for a loop. It seems like having a doctor officially diagnose something makes it just that much more real and scary.
0.333300	That there might be something seriously wrong with me, my heart rate or oxygen levels are down, my blood work came back bad, the pain in feeling is something bad.
0.642900	Mostly waiting a long time in general makes me nervous and it seems like waiting is longer than the actual exam from the doctor. Other than that, it's fear of having some kind of illness.
0.523800	Mostly it's the unknown. I certainly don't want to be sick, but being that I haven't kicked the smoking addiction, I know at some point I will be. 
0.595200	That they will schedule a bunch of extra test just so they can bill the insurance companies for more.
0.738100	I worry that they will overlook my symptoms because they do not understand the complexities of my illness or that they do not take my condition seriously enough to educate themselves on it. 
0.714300	I have an innate fear of going to the doctor. For no apparent reason either. It is the fear of what the doctor would say, and finding something wrong with me. There is also the aspect where I would have to do things that are uncomfortable to myself, such as things that should stay private. On top of that, it is seeing the bill afterwards and paying it. 
0.357100	I'm worried to get bad news and I don't particulary enjoy needles. I try to, however, be mature and remain realistic. Whether we're perfectly healthy or struggling with a medical condition, we just have to do our best to achieve the best quality of life and health as possible.  
0.690500	Visiting the doctor can be worrying if you think she might find something bad or you don't know what's wrong. It can also be a relief if you know you're going to get better from something that's bothering you.
0.285700	I tend to consider worst case scenarios when I head to the doctor's office; if I have some kind of pain or ailment, I tend to assume it is something awful and imagine the worst possible results. By the time I get to the doctor, I feel like he is close to confirming my worst fears, even if I'm actually fine.
0.309500	The worst issue when visiting a doctor's office the the unknown factors.  The problem may be something simple or complex, the solution may be expensive and troublesome or it may be inexpensive and simple and the overall experience may feel good or bad, but the unknown factors involved make the experience worse.
0.571400	I would normally be anxious about my weight, my blood pressure, and my other health indicators. If the numbers are not good I might get scolded by the doctor, or worse, they might indicate I am not healthy. I would also feel anticipation to hear the results because I would be hoping for good numbers instead of bad ones. I would feel worry that I might get health news that I do not like.
0.619000	With everything all over social media and the news sometimes it makes it hard not to think about what ifs.  Everything is bad for you now so with every appointment it makes me wonder what could they find, is this the visit.  I question every choice I have made since my last appointment.  Also I am very hard on myself, so I always worry what the doctors or nurses think of me.
0.595200	The only thing that could make me anxious is the feeling of uncertainty, when things aren't plain and sure I feel uneasy. Usually the results good or bad donât scare me but the lack of feedback and information does. Sure as a normal human you should be worried if your health isn't looking good but I usually keep things under control so as far as I can control my health is in a good standard which is why uncertainty would make me anxious, as for 'bad' results all you can do is follow the protocol and recover as best as possible.
0.595200	I feel anxious when I know that he is checking for new problems to an existing condition.  So far everything has turned out okay, but I still tend to get anxious and a little bit worried.
0.619000	"I'm pretty typical in the fear of ""something being wrong"". I also have history of anxiety including previous family members."
1.000000	"The eyes they give me and the most thing I worry about and makes me feel uneasy is whether they will drop something bad on me such as ""there's nothing we can do""."
0.595200	I worry that I will get a positive test result for a chronic condition. For example, recently my tests showed that I have high cholesterol. 
0.595200	When I need specific medication my doctor is very judgemental and when I ask for specific stuff i read about online he totally hates on the ideas and takes a very holier than though attitude with me and says no to any sort of request I make so he makes me nervous
0.738100	Because I only get to see a doctor when there is something wrong, I am always waiting for the bad news.  I need to see a specialist or I need to go on a new medication which I probably won't be able to pay for.  So, that just puts more stress in my life and makes me anxious at the doctor's office.  In many ways, it's just less stressful to live with whatever problem I have and not go see a doctor who will just tell me about the problem that I can't do anything about because I can't afford the co-pay.
0.261900	Being in a position of vulnerability makes me most nervous in a doctor's office, specifically if I'm an exposed or unknowledgeable. I feel somewhat at the mercy of the doctor.
0.142900	Sometimes I am anxious to see the doctor out of fear of receiving bad news.  My largest concern would be hearing that I have a terminal illness or that something else is wrong with my health.  I would just prefer to positive news when it comes to my health.
0.357100	At the doctors, I feel most worried if when I do not feel listened too.  I have faith in my doctors to monitor my symptoms and take appropriate treatment.  However, when I feel that they are rushed or thinking about other things - it makes me feel uneasy.  Sometimes, I think that doctors are overworked and take on too many patients.  Their offices are revolving doors.  I wonder if all needs are being met or if they are rushing through one patient to get to the next.  Additionally, I wonder what they would perscribe or treat if they did not have to worry about insurance.
0.619000	I am worried that I wont be heard or listened to. I have had experiences where I have been told that the issue I have will go away with time and sometimes it hasn't. I try to ask questions, only to be passed off to someone else and I have to explain things all over again.
0.833300	I normally only go to the doctor's office when I know something is wrong. Finding out what is wrong makes me very anxious. I often go to the doctor's office alone, so it makes me nervous to have to deal with that.
0.595200	I'm worried if I am expecting bad news or know that I haven't been taking good care of myself. I get anxious interacting with certain people who do not seem friendly.
0.166700	There is a little healthy anxiousness that I fear each time I go to the doctor because of the unknown of what could be found.
0.595200	I hate going to a doctor's office when it's not my choice to do so. But my birth control medication is needed for my continued well being on a daily basis and my doctor will not give me more of them unless I submit to an examination every so often, despite said examination is very painful and unpleasant and totally unnecessary in my situation. 
0.285700	If I am going to worry about attending a doctors visit, the thing that would make me the most nervous is not meeting or following through with their instructions.   Then having to face them, and explain why I didn't meet their goal or follow their advice.
0.642900	Because he doesn't have a good bedside manner. I've only been seeing him for 2 years when my other doctor retired. I was hoping this doctor would recommend me seeing a nutritionist, but I didn't speak up about it this time. I don't really want to start searching for a new doctor, either. Guess I have to live with it.
0.714300	I have a reoccurring hernia and I am afraid she will see it and tell me I need to have surgery again. Also I am afraid when my blood pressure goes up or my cholesterol. 
0.285700	What I feel most anxious or worried about when visiting the doctor's office is probably the wait of the actual appointment. I could not get into the doctor for a month with a condition that had me worried it was something serious. Unfortunately, the doctor was booked up and then when the appointment came, the doctor was with another patient for a little longer than scheduled so I appreciate her being with someone else and helping them but the waiting game was making me anxious.
0.857100	The amount of germs in the buildings are enough to make your skin crawl never mind the waiting games and lack of compassion for it at times
1.000000	They have a definite lack of communications skills, and bedside manner, forget it. They either talk down to you or not much at all.

0.714300	I might have forgotten to do something or take a medicine she suggested. I might forget what I want to say. Maybe some medical problem will interfere with my career.
0.238100	Generally, I'm not really a worrier, but if I were to worry about anything, I would worry most about learning that there is something wrong with me that is not easy to fix.
0.476200	I get worried about wasting my money over nothing. Like it's all in my head. or I worry there is something very wrong with me that I won't be able to afford. 
0.571400	I think the routine yearly visits do not make me anxious or stressed out. I think if I have to go for something other than a routine visit there is some stress. The stress or anxiety comes from not knowing if there is an issue or what the issue may be. With the diseases in today's society, such as cancer, when you have an unknown health issue there is usually anxiety that comes with it.
0.642900	I just have anxiety in general. I get anxious sitting in the exam room waiting. I also get anxious because I worry I won't be able to explain what is going on with me in a way that makes sense to the doctor. I sometimes get anxious because I have quite a few health problems they might think that I am weak or wanting attention. 
0.333300	When I visit a doctor, I feel slightly anxious sometimes because of the slight chance that the doctor will find an illness based on the standard medical tests give. Also the experience of sitting in a doctors office waiting for long periods of time just waiting for the doctor to visit you.
0.166700	I get anxious about an appointment if it has anything to do with my children or labs pertaining to certain diseases that have a high tendency to run in my family. I'm always worried that one day I'll walk into the clinic and be told my heart is going to give out or I have severe diabetes or thyroid issues. I don't like medications and don't want to be placed on anything that I would have to take daily.
0.738100	I get anxious about possibly hearing bad news about my health. I also get embarrassed about getting undressed. The results of my lab work makes me apprenhensive.
0.642900	Sometimes I worry I may get bad news about my health. I feel generally healthy but I know that cancer is something that can effect anyone at any level of health. The older I get the more I worry I may not be as healthy as I think I am.
0.261900	I guess the one thing that most patients feel, including myself, is concern about the unknown. I think it is just human nature and conditioning that make me a little anxious. I have noticed that there have been times when my blood pressure would be slightly elevated upon my arrival at my physician's office, but my blood pressure returns to normal before I leave his office. 
0.285700	"When visiting a doctor's office, the thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried is the wait between the time that I check in and the time the doctor actually can see me and uncertainty regarding how much the visit is going to cost financially. Primarily the anxiety I feel is induced by whatever ailment I am experiencing and it typically turns into both anxiety and relief....anxiety over what the doctor might diagnose (for instance, it could be the worst case scenario...though likely not) and relief knowing that someone will be able to give his/her professional opinion and action can be taken. However, for the most part, going to the doctor's office isn't anxiety inducing....just whatever symptoms I am experiencing and the possible cost to ""fix"" it. On a side note, I typically don't go to the doctor unless I am extremely concerned about whatever is ailing my body. "
0.619000	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I perceive that something during the appointment will cause me physical pain.
0.642900	What make me most anxious is the results that I have to find out. I think everyone that goes to the doctor's office always worry about if anything is serious or not. At least that is how I feel when I go there.

0.500000	I have a few health problems and I get a little anxious when I know that I have not followed the Doctors as I should have. 
0.142900	The main thing I'm fearful of is contracting something else considering my weak immune system.  If my health isn't good or if I've dropped weight I feel anxious because I know we'll have to talk about it.  I work as hard to keep on weight as other people do to lose weight.
0.142900	The only thing I would feel anxious about are needles.  Outside of that, I trust my doctor and the advice he's given me has helped me to be very healthy.  I feel no need to be anxious when seeing my doctor.  
0.738100	That they will try and find something wrong so they can charge you for tests that you don't need. That they will misdiagnose something and cause me stress.
0.666700	I am always worried that we will have to do a painful test. I really dont like getting shots or blood drawn. I always worry that they will find something really wrong. Also i dont like when they say i have to take off my clothes. I have a gyno for that.
0.214300	I always worry before my annual PCP visit that maybe my health might be taking a downturn, because every visit prior he tells me I have perfect labwork and everything else. I just want to have A+ health every time.
0.666700	When they act like they don't know what to do , or taking so much time one procedure to complete, waiting forever for results. 
0.881000	Visiting the doctor makes me feel anxious, and this is obvious when my blood pressure is much higher than normal when taken by health professionals.  My doctor works with me on this matter, and trusts me to report my self-test blood pressure readings. I think there are always unknowns when going to the doctor. You may think you are fine, but the doctor might find something to prove otherwise. I dread getting blood drawn because it is painful. You never know how experienced the person taking your blood is going to be (i.e. they might miss the vein a few times and poke you).
0.142900	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is his eagerness to prescribed drugs as a solution to most problems.  Drugs can become expensive especially if you have to take more than one everyday.  Other than that there's not many things that makes me anxious  about visiting the doctor.
0.285700	I just get nervous of hospital and Dr. settings and general I get pretty anxious sometimes I just donât want to go for fear of the unknown so that usually makes me nervous but other than that I have complete confidence
0.142900	If I ever have anxiety visiting my physician, it is purely because I have concerns that my health is extremely poor and I may have a serious illness. I find reassurance in going to an appointment at my clinic, as I know if something is wrong, they will find it and help me in the next step in treatment.
0.523800	I feel most anxious or worried when I have a symptom that could possibly be something serious. I am somewhat anxious when having a physical checkup because of not knowing what he is going to do, or possibly because I know what he is going to do. It makes me a little anxious when he or the nurse takes my blood pressure, for fear that it will be too high. I suppose one of the things that makes me most anxious is when a doctor asks me to describe my condition in detail, and I have trouble putting it into words or saying how frequently something occurs.

0.381000	I always want to be in perfect health, so since I see my doctor maybe once a year for a physical and lab testing, i get anxious that something may have come up in the previous 12 months that she will tell me needs to be addressed.
0.785700	I always worry that I am not going to be able to clearly  express the health issues I may have, or that I will sound like someone who has nothing better to do than look up health conditions online and adapt those as my own issues. I also worry that the doctor is not going to believe what I tell him.
0.142900	I very rarely experience any anxiety while at the doctor The only time was when I was dealing with new health issues and they kept telling they didn't know what was going on. That bothered me as having an answer would give me peace of mind regarding the seriousness of the issue.

Those are usually signs of things that either already are problems or have a good likelihood to become problems."

0.547619	I don't want to be diagnosed with something serious. I fear becoming ill and leaving my family. That is scary for me.

0.714286	During my last pregnancy, OBs would have me stay overnight in the hospital for non-stress testing, simply because they wanted to spend time with their families and didn't want to wait around for the hour it would have taken to observe me. Also, the nurses would tell me to drink water so they wouldn't order an IV, but the doctors always forced me to have an IV, even when I was in the hospital for a short time, drinking water the entire time. Once, the nurse tried to put in an IV three times, permanently damaging my left arm. When she gave up on my left, and starting stabbing my right arm, I was scared I wouldn't be able to use either of my hands the next day. Anyway, all of that was unnecessary and when someone is pregnant in particular, in the US, the doctors only care for the fetus, not the mother.

0.309524	But doctors can make a different kind of mistake. What I found strange when I first started running the health anxiety clinics was how many patients had been told they had a fatal disease when they did not!  Rather than making the mistake that everyone worries a doctor might make, namely missing the diagnosis of a deadly disease, their doctors worried them unnecessarily by diagnosing deadly diseases that were not present. That happened to me once. I had a swollen leg. Being a health worrier myself at that time, I had already made sure by repeatedly testing myself that I did not have the fatal kidney disease the doctor, when I finally got around to visiting him, informed me blithely that I had. I was able to dismiss his opinion out of hand.  But I have had patients who forever after worried about the disease they were told they had.

1.000000	Because they are always in a rush and don't listen to what I have to say, this always makes me feel anxious and discouraged about going to see a doctor. My last visit was awful. They sent me to the ER because I was having a hypertensive crisis, and the staff at the ER took blood and sent me home. I didn't even see a doctor. My doctor said she phoned ahead to the ER, but nobody seemed concerned about me when I got there, just sent me to the lab....didn't even do vitals. Doctors suck

I just want to go home to my own software bed with a cup of hot tea.

Thanks be to God, it has recently been decided (and the doc concurs) that, absent specific symptoms, those my age and older can skip ""routine"" colonoscopy due to cost-benefit evaluation and in light of the difficult/increasing physical burden posed on the aging by rigorous draining preparation.

0.857143	I am scared because at any moment, they could diagnose me with something that is bad and it could make me get scared.  I don't want to die and they could say I have a condition that will kill me.
0.571429	my blood pressure is high and my weight is higher.if i feel anxious and how to handle it.if i have to do some other tests
0.285714	I don't often enjoy the hospital environment and the aura and smell of sickness. Fortunately, the facility I visit is very clean and open and there is none of those feelings. I feel very comfortable going there and seeing my Doctor. 
0.142857	When I go to the doctor I feel somewhat anxious because I am afraid of what I will tell the doctor before entering the office or what reflects my studies
0.333333	I just don't like that you set an appointment and are on time but your time is a lot less valuable then the doctor's.  I understand things run longer or sometimes something comes up .. but the wait times are just ridiculous.
0.142857	I don't feel animus,nervous or worried. My doctor puts me completely at ease and we proceed with the exam/visit in steps.  He lets me know when things will happen and why they need to happen.  There is no fear with him.
0.666667	Giving blood. I have thin veins so if I don't get a good nurse that can find a vein the first time, it takes a long time and I'm bruises up and I get dizzy.
1.000000	I am never anxious or worried about visiting my physician. She is awesome and makes me feel comfortable.
0.714286	Afraid of the result because my family has many health issue. So when I visit I am always worried I am next to be diagnosed with something bad
0.142857	If feeling bad and don't know why. When I really don't know what expect from my vist. Also  he looks worried before he tells me whats wrong.
0.666667	I   guess  ,   for   me ,  it  is   kinda   anticipation  on   what   the  doctor  will   be   telling   me,   with   hope   everything  will  be   ok ,  and   nothing   new   to   panic   about
0.523810	I am most anxious when I am waiting for my doctor to tell me the results of my annual test - whether I am maintaining my efforts to stay healthy.
0.166667	I used to be overweight a couple of years ago and my parents would overreact when my doctor talked to me about how much I weighed and my height and generalities such as that. Other than that no problem
0.142857	When I have a serious condition & I do not know what he will say about my condition so I get anxious & worry a little about what he will say to me & what he will tell me to do to get better.
0.690476	My doctoe rushes me through and out. I don't quite feel taken seriously. He's just now sending me to specialists I've needed to see and been asking to see for the year that I've been seeing him. And he doesn't prescribe medications for anything. 
0.142857	the unknown, or how bad something is really going to be. or if it wont be anything at all. I try to know get myself worked up before I know what is really going on. 
0.238095	I am getting to an age when physical problems seem to crop up out of nowhere and show up unexpectedly.  I am always a bit anxious that the doctor will find a problem even if I am feeling good.
1.000000	Might be something wrong with me that is serious.  I really believe that God put all cures here on earth and you must follow what he intended.  I think a lot of doctors should not be doctors but went into medicine for the money.  Very disturbing.  I think most medications do more harm than good.  I believe in prayer and natural medicine.  Western medicine is so overrated and people should really research alternatives.
0.142857	My own worst fears - finding out I had something I never knew I had that was chronic or fatal. It's really about my own neurosis.
0.690476	That he will misdiagnose and/or mismedicate me or, worse yet, give me bad news I would not want to hear.  I have little faith in the healthcare system in general.
0.309524	afraid that he will find something dramatically wrong with me - afraid he might be upset with my smoking and weight
0.595238	I dont like to wait that long and the doctor be doin stuff that makes me worry sometimes. Like coughing inmy face or his breath stinks.
0.547619	That they'll be lazy and just guess what's wrong with me instead of actually figuring it out. Then prescribing me something I don't need.
0.214286	My doctor is so calm with me i dont feel anxious or worriedmy doctor is the best i need no one elsemy doctor is the best need no other
0.690476	the sick will be very painful if the doctor told you that make you worried and afraid from Diagnosing like disaster understand and process these emotions often falls in the hands of parents, who by their own admission often feel painfully concerned, overwhelmed and unprepared to deal with these kinds 
0.285714	Again, I do not have any medical issues.  If I need a doctor or medical help I will go to the local urgent care office.  Most issues I have had in the past can be taken care at the urgent care.
0.642857	if the doctor will find something seriously wrong; what are my options; how will I handle it; how will I manage it and what do I do financially to handle it?
0.476190	I have taken his convictions and applying them to myself.when we talk he makes me at ease so we can have a true conversation.he fusses at me when I'm doing something that I shouldn't
0.857143	Just the fear of finding out something is wrong. I don't want to be or a some incurable  disease I have a family I want and need to be here for
0.190476	I don't normally feel worried or anxious when visiting my doctor, the only thing that concerns me is when I go in to get my blood work results!
0.642857	 Not thorough. Others were invited in the room and I weren't asked if they were permitted. Ill advised
0.666667	I don't know why I am always anxious or worried but a lot going on with my future that gets me worried so I am trying to be the best I can.
0.547619	i'm afraid they will find something seriously wrong with since we all have to die sometime. i'm 54 now and in good health but you never know.
0.333333	Just sitting at the office itself knowing it's gonna be awhile nothing to do with dr or staff in general!
0.380952	I dread the thought of a diagnosis that might require surgery or some dramatic treatment with terrible side effects.
0.714286	Again, there are some of my doctors that I would definitely ask for a second opinion before accepting what he or she says as completely xorrect
0.190476	I had to have a colonoscopy and I did worry because they found a polyp and that it would take 2 weeks to get the results. Everything turned out okay!!!
0.404762	That the doctor may find out something wrong that I need to deal with.  Being a RN we tend to ignore some symptoms and I worry that I let them go to far.  
0.333333	I sometimes feel anxious and worried when I go for an exanination. I'm afraid something might really be wrong and I have overlooked it.
0.952381	I worry about my health issues and what the doctors may have to say about them. It makes me very anxious. 
0.142857	Really nothing, I go, check in, see the MD, he reviews my test results and gives me a copy of them, and discusses anything pertinent. He is very respectful. 
0.642857	I am most anxious when I don't see eye to eye with my doctor. I will always advocate for myself and sometimes that is mistaken for aggression from a physician. It makes me feel uneasy to have to question a doctor. 
0.738095	Taking medication  don't know  about . It worst case for me. I don't like dr not honest at all. They wrong information 
0.238095	IT SEEMS THAT I GET THE SAME ANSWER ALL THE TIME AND THAT NOTHING IS BEING DONE.  I KNOW WHAT MY HEALTH NEEDS ARE AND THE DOCTORS ALWAYS SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
0.309524	Because my dad died of cancer at a relatively young age, I always have in the back of my mind that the same thing could happen to me, and am relieved when I have a positive outcome.
0.500000	Wondering if we'll have the time to really talk and get me help.  I don't push enough sometimes, but don't like to be ignore either
0.547619	they don't have a clue as to what bedside manner or proper inter personal skills are and dont want to learn how to deal with patients on a personal level. 
0.738095	I worry a lot. I worry that something big will be wrong with me. I often worry that I will get very sick
0.285714	I do not feel  worried or anxious I feel like I in a place I belong and know I will get the best care I can get 
0.285714	probably the thing that makes me the most anxious if having to wait a long time past my appointment time.
0.142857	I never get upset or feel anxious, although I had to see a female doctor twice when I was younger and both times when the nurse first had to check my sore I got an erection. She blushed and so did I. The doctor was more stoic.
0.571429	finding out that something is wrong with my body.  I make sure to tell my doctor everything that is going on.
0.738095	Never know what to expect and I do not like strangers touching me.  I find the whole process invasive.
0.309524	When I have to give blood for my A1C. Still need to get it lower and it can be frustrating and depressing when I'm told it isn't lower.
0.571429	When I do not know what will happen. If I need a shot or need to give blood. Just not my favorite thing to do.
0.880952	I mostly feel anxious when my doctor has provided me with previous bad news, like a high blood pressure result 
0.642857	"That the numbers for my a1c is not going to show improvement for my diabetes.Also, just the uncertainty of any test that he performs on me. I'm a ""worry wart"" for most anything."
0.642857	My Dr. now does not make me feel these ways but others haveYou get  tired of same old bad Doctors & wish they cared more
0.166667	Just because one thinks he/she feels good does not necessarily mean that there is not an underlying health issue to be dealt with.
0.619048	Usually the doctor makes a comment about my weight.  I also worry if my blood pressure is high since it usually seems like that's the case when I go into an office.  At home it's almost always at a good level.
0.642857	Maybe I have gained weight, or my blood pressure or cholesterol is too high. Afraid there might me something wrong that I don't know about.  If I am having a worrisome symptom, I am afraid it might be something serious.
0.571429	I have social anxiety so I am not comfortable with talking to people  that I don't know. When it comes to my daughter and taking her to the doctor I am okay with speaking with her pediatrician 
0.690476	I only feel anxious if I'm showing new symptoms I'm not used to having or have to get testing done and I'm worried about the results.
0.285714	I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit my doctors office. My doctor makes me feel relaxed. I do not worry because my doctor is very knowledgeable.
0.690476	Im afraid that my current ailments will be found to be a lot worsebthan the last time i was at the doctors office
0.857143	"I have always had ""white coat syndrome"" I just get nervous because I don't know what is going to happen or what treatment I am going to get and if it is going to be unpleasant"
0.523810	I stress about the scales. I hate seeing my weight. I hate needles so I stress with getting blood drawn. 
0.404762	I take cholesterol lowering medication so I always hope that it is doing the job keeping my bad low and my good high. I also am taking blood pressure medication and it's always a concern that it might not be keeping it low enough. So far, so good on both counts.
0.738095	That they will find something wrong, that my lab numbers won't be as good as they should be, that I will have gained weight, etc. 
0.357143	Just get somewhat nervous when I am in the Dr's office. Especially if it is the area down below. I just feel it is a nerve racking time.
0.476190	I am worried that I will receive some bad news or that my doctor will ask me to undergo more testing or strange therapies.
0.142857	Nothing makes me anxious or worried when I am visiting my doctor's office. I have a positive attitude in regards to my doctor visits.
0.761905	I do not like visiting doctors office, I have always had a fear of doctors and needles. I feel exposed when visiting a doctors office.
0.523810	I am concerned that I will ne mis-diagnosed, or that I will go to the doctor, and they won't be able to do anything to help me.
0.238095	i may wonder about the tests i have to take. or about the results. some of the tests bother me.  i am usually very comfortable.
0.571429	some times i am in pain and hope she can help find the cause  all worried my tests results are not good
0.857143	I feel that they try to rush and find easy solutions and not find out what the problems actually are.  I feel that they don't listen to patient concerns or problems.  I feel that doctors see patients as money and not actual people.
0.142857	that to find out that my health has gotten worse like lung cancer that i had last year the right lung which i was not using because of my COPD and now my left lung has a spot on it
0.738095	I don't like being examined by anyone, worry about what they are going to find and having to fight with them to get the prescription drug I need, because they are not listening to me or brushing me off. 
0.357143	I'm always afraid he might find something wrong with me. You neveer know. I don't want to find something wrong with me.
0.571429	Nothing usually unless they find something wrong then sometimes I worry but for the most part in pretty healthy
0.142857	There isn't anything that make me feel anxious or worried when I go to my doctors office, it is always a pleasant visit.
0.928571	I dont feel comfortable with male drs nor do i like it when they touch me in places i dont like. Which is basically anywhere. But have become close to 2 very good male drs  and i dont fear them.
0.142857	I do not get really worried attending a doctor visit . I am comfortable with my doctor and trust in his decisions about my health. 
0.309524	just that I might find out that my health isn't as good as I think it is and that it might incur further pain or discomfort
0.500000	I never know what they are going to say, I get scared I'm going to get bad news or something. it just is unneeded stress
0.595238	Anxiety is one of my diagnoses. I get quite anxious before I get there. Long wait times to see the doctor don't help. The doctors that rush, specifically my pain management physician, and don't seem interested in listening to me leave me feeling misunderstood. I have to fill out the same 3 forms every time I go, but I'm pretty sure that they aren't looked over. So, when I see her, I feel anxious the whole time I'm there. I don't like changing doctors, so I continue to go there. I need her services if I want to have some quality of life.
0.333333	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office is not applicable because when I visit the doctors office I'm neither worried or anxious because I have unwavering faith and belief. That's just my honest outlook and approach to the whole medical thing, as should be everyone else's as well.
0.642857	How doctors decide to take care of uses and problems people have! Along with side effects from medicine and treatment  
0.142857	maybe my car gets stolen while I am waiting for the doctor who is way late in his or her schedule.  that is pretty much the only anxiety or worry I might have 
0.595238	because i think people in general are somewhat fearful of the unknown, i would be afraid that maybe my doctor will tell me something negative in regards to my health
0.500000	I worry that something might be wrong with me that would be a long term sickeness and I also don't like my weight
0.357143	The only I feel that way is if I am having a medical problem that I myself cannot figure out what it is,
0.619048	I don't trust most doctors especially because I have the cheapest insurance out there. I also don't think most doctors care.
0.523810	That the tests will show the development of some serious illness.  And a worry that the person taking my blood will have difficulty drawing the necessary samples (this has happened several times -- and it is a blasted nuisance).
0.619048	I'm afraid he may discover a life threatening illness and I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to handle the illness.
0.523810	I am anxious waiting for the doctor, I am anxious when he asks me questions and I am anxious awaiting his thoughts or feelings as to what is going on.
0.333333	When I have to wait a long time in the waiting and in the exam room. If the front desk is unpleasant and not approachable. Or when the Dr. Leaves the exam room and takes a long time to come back.
0.309524	Since I was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years ago, there is always some trepidation when going to the doctor: Am I all right? Has the cancer come back?  I regard these as legitimate concerns.
0.547619	I get anxious I don't have enough time for all my questions/concerns and usually blurt them out to quickly even though I have written them down.
0.333333	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when a doctor examines me because I have no reason to worry.
0.285714	For the most part I am not anxious or worried when I visits the doctor.  If I am very sick or notice something unusual, I might be a bit worried, but so far I have been lucky.
0.333333	Sometimes I am anxious when I have a long wait in the office but most of the time my primary care physician does not over schedule and the waiting is minimal.
0.523810	I worry most about my blood test results, how to deal with my multiple conditions, and now much time I will be given to discuss my problems and questions.
0.761905	i only go to the doctor when absolutely necessary, and i am always nervous about what they are going to tell me. i am uninsured, so i don't have the money to go in the first place, much less pay for any tests or follow-ups they may want. at times i feel as though it would be better to not do anything and die because then, at least my family will not be stuck with outrageous bills they cannot afford
0.261905	i either forget my list of questions or suggestions, so i worry about that, like i am going to have to wait another 3 months to ask her. what kind of mood she is going to be in. i worry that i get a little afraid to talk to her or ask a question or tell her what new is going on or not going on and he just blows it off
0.976190	I don't want to hear any awful news and find out that something is terribly wrong with me. I feel scared that something might sneak up on me health-wise and it can be catastrophic.
0.380952	MY BIGGEST FEAR IS MY WEIGHT. I ALWAYS SAY I WILL LOSE BEFORE MY NEXT APPOINTMENT, BUT I SELDOM DO. I KNOW THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO HER, SO IT BECOMES A WORRY TO ME ALSO. I HAVE ANXIETY SO I ALWAYS WORRY MY APPOINTMENT WILL BE DELAYED, BUT SHE IS USUALLY ON TIME WHICH I APPRECIIATE
0.619048	Will I actually get something resolved that I am being seen for or will I need to be seen multiple times.
0.476190	I just don't like to go. I think nurses are worse about it. I dread it because I've been so sick and it brings back  bad memories.
0.500000	That when I tell them something that they will not believe me and not take me serious or do what I ask them or think that I am just asking for drugs when I am not I am asking for something to help with the pain
0.333333	Anticipation of bad news makes me feel anxious or worried even when there is absolutely nothing to worry about
0.571429	Given the wrong diagnosis a few times. I have had 5 new PC in he past 7 years. That is very discouraging.
0.261905	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor unless I fear that I have a serious problem, which means that I would be more worried about whatever the problem was (or could be). If I have any idea what I'm there for there is no worry.
0.714286	I am always afraid that they are going to find something very serious or something that needs a lot of medical attention and I have no health insurance.
0.214286	The only thing I dread is the feeling of not being heard, AGAIN, and so I only go to the doctor when required for ongoing check-ups to refill life long prescriptions.
0.214286	The cost because I am not insured. That is my biggest concern. Other than that I feel that I am seeing a doctor for a reason.
0.142857	i would only feel anxious or worried if i went to an appointment with a pain or illness and was unsure about it
0.285714	nothing makes me anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, I feel safe because i know I'm with someone that will work towards my well being 
0.214286	That I might catch an illness from someone else that is there at the time. Or that I may end up needing to get tests or blood work performed.
0.142857	I can't answer this question because I do not get anxious when I visit my doctor. If I had to give an answer it would be the wait to see the doctor
0.547619	if there for test results the unknowing can be worrisome until you find out normal results..so it can be concerning.
0.571429	I never do, I have lots of confidence in her ! The only thing I worry about if something's wrong with me !!! 
0.642857	I only go to the doctor when I can't get better on my own so by the time I go I'm afraid it's something more than it really ends up being 
0.619048	I know you lying. The only one of the day of the day of school and college. I was just aBout to text you. You can be used to be a good girl . She said she was going through the process of getting numbers of the day of the time
0.500000	what the answer to my illness will be and how I would have to deal with  taking care of the issue and if there are any long term issues
0.333333	That they might find something wrong that I didn't expect. That they would prescribe a drug for me that I didn't want to take.
0.166667	I really don't have any minor or major medical problems, so I never really feel anxious or worried at all.  I'm 43 and rather healthy, so really not worrying about anything quite yet.
0.333333	That he spends so much time looking for things wrong with me and after so much work to show something might be wrong, then I find out everything is fine, so I worried for nothing.
0.523810	I feel most anxious about the cost of the procedures that my doctor may prescribe. Sometimes my doctor wants tests run that I can't afford 
0.571429	That the doctor might find something wrong that is serious and might take me away from my regular life.
0.309524	That something will be found that I hadn't expected.  You never know what blood work may find.  I also hate needles, i.e flu shot.
0.738095	Thinking that the doctor's going to do things that make my life difficult, and he'll bully me if I try to stick up for myself. I've had doctors tease me, tell me that I should purchase life insurance (I was in college at the time and NOT a fan of risky behavior), the works. 
0.214286	Because i am not used to doing health esams very often, among other things of minor importance..........
0.404762	I am often afraid that a doctor will not take me seriously. I have had experiences where doctors ignore my input and disregard my feelings.
0.357143	I suffer from an anxiety disorder, as well as depression.  I dread appointments with my doctor because they make me fell anxious.  In addition, I have social anxiety.  
0.452381	The news i may get of something not being normal after was collected for further testing i think would be worry some 
0.571429	I don't care for doctors or emergency rooms that's what makes me anxious.  I waste my time.  The reason why I get anxious and worried is because of my experience with a majority of doctors, urgent care, and emergency rooms.  I had surgery for a hystertomy, got staph, had 4 doctors visits including urgent care, and ER, went in shock and no one would believe me until a nurse at the ER had tested me after I left the ER.  My GYN said it was pop, my primary doctor completely ignored me after I told her don't look at the paper results look at me, the Urgent care said to take an extra high blood pressure bill, and the ER doctor had me touching my nose with my finger and diagnosed with urinary infection i had no symptoms for.  I suffer to this day and yes I still get hairbrained answers like to go check my eyes for the brain fog.  So that is why I get anxious.  Finally I did get a good learning urologist who performed the other half of my surgery for a urinary band who saw how sick I was and she saved my life from the staph infection after weeks of begging someone to listen that I felt like death.
0.571429	getting on the scale, I hate to gain any weight  then next is my blood draw, I don't have very good veins
0.142857	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit my doctor for any reason, be it acute or chronic care.                                           
0.142857	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office. But I may be come nervous when I go to the Dentist.
0.690476	I GET IN MY FEELINGS BECAUSE HE JUST DOESN'T ACT LIKE HE CARES. I AM JUST $ IN HIS EYES. HE DOESN'T FULLY EXAMINE ME OR TALK ABOUT BLOOD RESULTS OR ANYTHING. I DON'T ENJOY GOING AT ALL !
0.190476	I don't know what my test results will be when I get a check up at the doctor's office. I feel uneasy about this.
0.404762	I JUST FUCKING TOLD YOU THAT I DO NOT FEEL ANXIOUS THIS SURVEY IS FUCKING JOKE ASD FAGH JKLQWERTYUI OP
0.523810	To know about how my health by asking is the medications working how long do i have to take my medications i learned i have liver disease and i might need a transplant seeing a specialist and getting the test i need to help me through this 
0.857143	The unknown is what makes me worried whenever I have to visit the doctor. I never know if I am going to get good or bad news so that is what usually concerns me. 
0.619048	Mostly what procedures are going to be done.  Not knowing what to expect in the examination and if it is just a look over and if the doctor sends you somewhere else..
0.142857	I rarely feel worried when at the doctors mostly just nervous from being out of comfort zone mostly just a not liking being in a hospital or dentist office or doctor office. 
0.595238	In the doctors office something that makes me nervous is when my doctor tells me I have to get a shot or whenever she recommends I get a shot 
0.428571	you never know what could be found. You might feel fine but test can indicate otherwise.  I usually expect that all is well but one small thing can lead to a bigger problem.  I most worry about how the doctor will react to my questions.  I hate being prodded or poked.  The starkness of the room does not help either.  The wait for the doctor can be unnerving also.  I just want to get in and out quickly.  The cost can also be a factor in how much i might be concerned.
0.619048	Just the thought of having a whole exam and what they could mean. The unknown of if anything could be wrong. 
0.142857	Nothing has ever made me feel anxious or worried when meeting with my family doctor. He is always outgoing friendly and tells you the straight truth of what is going on.
0.357143	I have some health issues so each time I go to the doctor I worry what could be wrong this time or what tests are necessary AND how much it will cost me.
0.142857	There is nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried about seeing my family physician. It might be different if I was diagnosed with a very serious illness. Then I might feel some of the negative emotions you were asking about in the previous question.
0.142857	I do not worried or get anxious when I go to the doctor office.  I turn everything over to the Lord.  He the one that can handled any problems.  He is key to life.
0.666667	diagnosing me with problems i don't have. giving me the wrong drugs to take. having really bad side effects from the pill im taking
0.309524	because I just am an anxious person in general - so this just how I feel sometimes during the day.  Since I am getting older and things are just breaking down, I want to be sure that over all I am still as healthy as I can be.

0.761905	It depends on why I am there. If I have gone for my quarterly check-up I am generally fine. However if I am there because of unexplained illness and/or pain I tend to worry until I am told what the problem is and what is needed to do to correct it.

Concerned I didn't loose enough weight to meet their ideals between visits, even though most times my GP doesn't push too hard about it, and often I have lost, especially this year.  If the doctor's office calls me in my mind naturally goes to the bad news side of thinking.
0.285714	I don't like visiting the doctor on general principles but my condition has been fairly stable the last couple of years.  If she suddenly suggested more surgery I would be very upset and nervous.  I had 2 open heart surgeries in less than a year and I don't want to go through that again.

0.571429	Finally finding out why and what makes me hurt so badly, just like i did a few weeks ago. Take it from someone who has lived mainly with no health insurance ( just got into Waterman clinic) it's a scary place sitting on a chair after decades of pain about to get answers. I am scared and grateful all at once.

0.238095	Try to give all the appropriate information (answer the doctors questions) that allows the doctor to make the right diagnosis
0.142857	Anxiety or worriness is not really an issue. But being realistic if a person may require needle shots or blood draw, sometimes its difficult to get used to receiving those treatments, but you know you have to do it if it is required.
0.142857	I NEVER FEEL ANXIOUS OR WORRIED. I HAVE WORKED MANAGING MY HEALTH WITH MY DOCTOR FOR YEARS, I GET REGULAR CHECK-UPS AND TESTING, I EAT RIGHT AND I EXERCISE REGULARY, SO IF SOMETHING DID OR IN THE FUTURE DOES COME UP ON AN EXAM, I KNOW THAT I WOULD BE CATCHING IT EARLY.
0.714286	I'm just worried something will be wrong with me or that my doctor will say that I appear to be unhealthy. 
0.642857	Worried they'll miss diagnosed me .and think I'm faking cause in fl half the people fake pain to seek pain meds so it makes it bad for real patient
0.666667	Sometimes I would rather put my head in the sand. No news is good news i suppose. This isnt a responsible way of dealing with bad news

0.238095	I understand the complexity and do get concerned about what type of allergy like reaction I will have. Any issues I have are because of the general uncertainty of this crazy disease. But that is life. God is there with me.
0.238095	because they always want to give you more pills to tale all the time.i guess they think just keep pop pills.

0.214286	I have never felt anxious when I see any doctor.  I am very pro-active in taking care of myself and believe strongly in preventative care.  I may sometimes be worried about something I may be experiencing at the time, but I am always one to not let any health issue go without seeing a doctor.
0.476190	having to wait for results to come back. to find out what kind of problem i have and how she can fix it
0.166667	I can't really say because it all depends on what I am going to the doctor for. I'm the type of person that doesn't worry much and I'm not very emotional so I don't usually get anxious to begin with. unless its the Emergency room, then its the bill they send.
0.595238	I do not go to the doctor's office very often - only when there is something I am concerned about.  Therefore, I am anxious or worried that something is truly wrong with me.

0.952381	that she won't address my concerns or my questions in a manner that completely answers them in a way that isn't rushed or taken everything into account.

0.642857	Sometimes I get embarrassed and that's why I feel that way. I'm not always willing you share my problems
1.000000	I have so many illnesses that I know it's always going to be bad news. The fact that I have out off my FNA biopsy for over a year says that. No one wants to know they have cancer. Especially at 26.
0.619048	That they may find something of greater concern than the reason for my visit, which may lead to more medication, more visits, and more side affects.
0.333333	Only when there's a new test result is the time I get worried. Also, when more testing is needed would be another I get anxious or worried.

0.571429	even though i know there's nothing to worry about with my health, i still think that my doctor will diagnose me with something bad
0.738095	I only have one chance to talk to him/her and then I have to wait 2 or 3 months so I have to write a list of all the things I need to discuss and hope I didn't forget anything
0.261905	In general I don't feel anxious or worried unless I have a disturbing symptom.  The disturbing factor is my health, not visiting the doctor.
0.833333	That they could prescribe me with a random drug that could end up causing me to die later on.  This is bad. 
0.571429	it depends of the issue I have, if I have a strange pain and the doctor ask to do blood test or deep exam, at that time I will be a little be afraid 
0.571429	I feelanxious that my doctor will tell me theres something physically wrong with me like an illness or something

0.952381	My doctor is a foreigner and I can't understand her English.  I have to  ask her to repeat everything and I find this embarassing.  She talks down to me and that is degrading and humiliating.
0.142857	To get them to understand what is wrong for the last year. I can' get them to understand. They give you false information.
0.714286	I think it is the thought they they might find something seriously wrong and this is something that everyone wants to avoid.
0.809524	Always wondering if something may be wrong just nervous to hear bad news. Plus you never know why they may be taking blood or whatever

1.000000	Not knowing if I'll be given the best advice or options for my condition. Not believing that that doctor cares enough about to better advice my on what to do. It makes me scared, worried and anxious going to a doctor's office just to leave feeling disappointed that I didn't get the answers I was looking for or the care that I need. 
0.309524	Generally I am not anxious or worried when visiting my doctor because I usually know what to expect.

0.142857	telling me bad news that I don't want to hear such as cancer, diabetes, or some type of sexual disease. 
0.619048	Not knowing if I'm going to get the proper care or treatment, and by me not having a good insurance provider you have to deal with it.
0.619048	It has more to do with how my health is going than the doctor herself. I think every time I go I have more and more wrong with me because of my age.
