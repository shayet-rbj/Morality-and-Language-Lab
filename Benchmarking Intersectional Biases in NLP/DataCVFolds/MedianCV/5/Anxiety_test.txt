-1	Im always afraid there going to find something thats not good, and it will change my life. So far the docter has been right on the whole time I've been with him
-1	Im not anxious when I go. I dont have a problem with going because i dont self diagnosis. I dont think the worse, I always think the best case scenario. 
1	Generally, when you enter a doctor's office, it's either to receive treatment or advice regarding an existing issue or concern.  The best case scerio when going is that nothing is wrong, or it is not as serious as suspected.  The anxiousness or worry stems from the altertive scerio, that the issue is more serious, the issue requires additiol treatment, and the issue may not only affect my future health, but could include significant out of pocket costs.
-1	I feel more anxious about the wait time.  It is like you get there early because they tell you to be there about 15 minutes early.  Only to wait like at least 30 before they call you back.  When they call you back you wait 30 more minutes to see the doctor depending on time of day could be longer wait.  After you see doctor your wait 30-45 more minutes to be released.  The most anxiety I receive from going to the doctor, I would have to say is that waist of time waiting to see the doctor.
-1	I worry that something is seriously wrong and by the time my Dr. finally decides to take me serious it will be too late
-1	When I see my doctor, I don't worry about my  check up they give me, because I know I am doing everything, I can to talk good care, of my self.
1	Because he doesn't have a good bedside manner. I've only been seeing him for 2 years when my other doctor retired. I was hoping this doctor would recommend me seeing a nutritionist, but I didn't speak up about it this time. I don't really want to start searching for a new doctor, either. Guess I have to live with it.
-1	My health is what worries me. Not knowing if something is seriously wrong. New doctors also make me a little anxious.
-1	I always get slightly nervous, if I get a shot, or anything that might hurt. I think it is more so a feeling from childhood, where I was afraid of doctors. 
1	"I would feel the most anxious or worried if the doctor found something wrong or is requesting extra tests or if they specifically say that there is something wrong or something that i need to ""keep an eye on"" or ""monitor"". Those are usually signs of things that either already are problems or have a good likelihood to become problems."
-1	It makes me feel most anxious or worried when the doctor wants to do numerous tests without explaining why those tests are necessary.
1	It is a little unnerving having to unclothe and have a doctor prod around in private areas. I know it has to be done, but it makes me uncomfortable.  I am anxious about the exam itself more than finding out something is wrong.  Doctors try to make patients feel comfortable about this, but it's not easy. 
1	Now we cannot see the Dr.'s we trust. We have to see Dr.'s that are assigned to us. Usually, I am rushed through or disrespected. I don't go for this reason. I'll just die in my home. 
1	That they'll look down on me and brand me a drug seeker, or not believe what I'm telling them.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried. I know I can rely on my doctor to be truthful and honest with me. He is always there for me and will never point me in the wrong direction.
1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when he checks my weight. The latest visits have been about trying to reduce my weight, and checks regularly on my cholestral levels.
-1	I do not always feel comfortable in the atmosphere of a doctor's office even though I feel my doctor is doing a good job 
-1	I don't want to hear any bad news, so it is a little worrisome to have an examition by a doctor. However, if it is a problem which is rather simple like a cold or the flu, then I'm not too worried about those situations.
-1	turally worrying whether or not all is well. I also think the enviornment of the doctors waiting room and the doctors room can be intimidating. 
1	Since I'm getting into my late 30's and I used to party a lot when I was younger, I'm always a little worried that it will filly catch up to me.  I worry about it a lot when I'm at the doctor's office.
-1	Most time when I go to The Doc's it is for a Routine and yearly checkup.  The only thing I feel is boredom.
1	Whether or not they will find something wrong how long tests take make u nervous or certain procedures
1	Always feel me anxious when I anticipate to see doctor, not for general exam,but probably for X-ray or blood test, or heart test  etc,Because I anticipate bad news, may be a disease or condition will be found.Or scary disease
-1	Many refuses to hear that they have a medical issue so of course I will become a bit worried;  not completely worried, but just a tad bit.  Anxiety the least but worried just a little. No one wants to hear bad news.
-1	I am most anxious that my blood pressure will be high, or they'll find something I wasn't aware of having.
-1	I don't like to wait, I get dread when they do tests. It's never easy waiting and trying a guessing game or knowing test results.  
1	The waiting and the waiting room makes me feel the most anxious and or worried when I visit the doctors office.
-1	to see what my blood pressure goes to.  I do not like going to the doctor have white coat sydrome but its ususally ends up ok.
-1	Hearing bad results, waiting to hear about blood pressure readings and blood testing, diagnostic readings 
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I am most worried when I discover a reason for which I will need to see a doctor
1	 think something is very wrong with me or have I life changing scare or have cancer infested lung or heart problems
1	If I have a particular symptom that could require major intervention, such as surgery, I become worried. Pain, particularly orthopedic pain, can often mean a chronic problem has developed wherein I will need surgery or will have to stop an activity. This makes me anxious. 
-1	If the physician is non communicative and doesnt make me feel comfortable during exams and procedures
-1	I am not anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I like that I have a woman doctor because I feel I can talk to her about anything, included issues only women have. I feel comfortable if I need to be physically examined because she and I are women. I feel she better understands women's issues because she probably had/ has them two.
-1	If there is something wrong and I am waiting on a diagnosis, I might feel anxious or nervous waiting for the results.
-1	I am not anxious about any health concerns.  I am more upset about time waiting to see the doctor.  He is constantly seeing pharmaceutical reps. during office hours, which pushes back all his appointment times.
-1	I dont like getting blood tests. That is truly my only fear. Overall, i would say that I have no fear of the doctor. I am in generally decent health overall, so i dont have much to fear. 
1	i worry that they are going to have bad news for me. i also worry that they are simply judging me. i also worry that things will arise that cost a lot of money. 
-1	I do not like hospitals. I know too many people who have died so I just don't like to be in the atmosphere. It makes me really nervous sometimes. But my doctor is really nice and professional so everything turns out ok. 
-1	I am mostly worried that my weight or blood pressure or something may not be normal and there will be further testing to be done.
-1	I get anxious about my blood work results. I work so hard to take care of myself, but I have an autoimmune disease, which makes it even harder to do so. 
1	I think I'm afarid of the what if? What if they think I have something wrong that I do not and then they mess me up for life with meds or surgery I do not need, I have seen to make people abdicated to pills to need to be that way. Plus the cost and hassle makes me out of sorts.  
-1	i never feel anxious or scared when i am in a doctors office. the only thing i would ever get nervous about is forgetting any questions i planned on asking
1	The idea that I might find out something bad about my health. Especially if I've already been worried that something bad is wrong and I've been researching health issues online that might apply to my situation.
-1	the uncertainty of something potentially being wrong.
1	I dislike Blood tests and worry about their outcomes. I also worry about whether procedures will hurt.
1	Being forced to make a decision in a short amount of time about something that can affect my life long term. I also have to shell out a lot of money for a service that has a high chance of not helping me.
-1	Whenever anyone goes to the doctors, we are going at our most vulnerable state. We think there's something wrong with us. We always await the worse news. But as I've gotten older, I've realized it's not as scary as I thought.
-1	I feel anxious because I want to be better but most times I have something new that arises and adds to my disease debt. I try to remain optimistic but until they give you a positive result it is hard to do that so most times I am waiting on them to say something negative. I also just don't like waiting long lengths of time for the doctor to arrive. More times than not the doctor visit will require a needle for blood work so that makes me anxious as well. I am presented with multiple people before seeing the doctor which makes me feel like I have a huge problem that many people have to deal with. I just don't like having bad news.
-1	The only thing that worries me sometimes is my fluctuating of my weight.. there set times when my weight goes up which makes me happy and the next time it's down which makes me sad! I have a small problem worth weight gain always have 
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when im visiting the doctors office is when i feel sick for more than 1 week
-1	When I am going in with something that I dont know about and how it will turn out. I mostly go for my annual physicals. I never have ailments. So if I ever had an ailment and had to go in I would be very anxious.
1	Finding out about certain tests that are performed at the clinic that I guessed correctly the outcome.
-1	I get anxious about my possible condition or illness. Sometimes I think I'm worse off than I actually am.
1	I feel worry because  you never  know what disease  you have when they examine you some doctors are good when talking  to you about your problem  they are very calm
-1	The fear of finding out about some unexpected illness or problem that may effect my health and well being.  
-1	I'm worried the doctor will see something that I didnt know was a problem.  Or that something that is bothering me is more serious that it initially seems.  
1	I am not worried when I visit the doctor's office. I rarely visit the doctor's office because I am so young. It's a yearly event, not weekly or monthly etc. 
-1	That my doctor will find a new problem with me. That I have a new bacteria or that I have a big problem;
-1	Stepping on the scale makes me a little anxious.  Generally, I am most anxious about the doctor finding something that could be harmful or affect my future.  For the most part, I feel like I have a good sense about what will happen when I visit the doctor's office.
1	It scares me that there might be something wrong with me or sometimes I'm worried that I'm going to get embarrassed because the doctor will point out that I'm practicing poor health habits or something.
-1	There was not a good check on my health instead I was asked a few questions and let go. I would have liked to be checked more.
1	I feel anxious when visiting a doctor's office because I am so ready to get the appointment over with. I often worry because i wonder if the doctor would find anything wrong with me.
1	some times i am in pain and hope she can help find the cause  all worried my tests results are not good
-1	always worry about going to the doctor. some tests can show somthing is wrong even when you have no symptoms so that always gives me a little anxiety until i know what is going on fully
1	I am always most anxious to see if my Doctor is in a bad mood or not. I see my doctor every 4 weeks and we have a tough relationship. I am kind and calm but I am not afraid to advocate for myself. I also become anxious when I am sick and would like to know the my outcome of illness.
1	well once you know you know and often that means forcing a life change or dealing with the consequences and that's not a choice people want to have to make
1	I think it's just the stress of being there and seeing 5 different people including the doctor, who all do different things and can't answer my questions or come and go too fast for me to ask
1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because of health problems that I have had in the past.  Being a breast cancer survivor, I get nervous on a yearly basis when having my mammogram done.  I get very anxious and nervous when I'm having blood drawn due to my fear of needles.  Most of all, I'm very worried when I'm waiting for the results of medical tests.
-1	I do not enjoy having someone exam my genital area. Otherwise, it is par for the course.
-1	That there will be a long wait . I don't like getting there on time and then having to wait a long time to be seen . 15 mintutes late is extcable an thing else I feel is just to long .
-1	I don't have a good track record with caring, thoughtful doctors. Most tend to disregard what I say or think about whatever's happening to me. In addition, I have a poorly understood chronic disease (CFS/ME) that many doctors refuse to even admit exist, despite overwhelming new information that it is a biological illness.
-1	the medical results of the test of the reports in how long they are taking. Also the wait time for the doctor and how they people taking a long time
1	them tell me something bad 
1	Mostly I'm worried about my doctor finding something that I'm concerned about or don't expect to have which might lead to bigger problems.
1	I have a touch of health anxiety, so I tend to expect the worst. Even if my symptoms are fairly benign, my imagition gets the best of me.

1	I always have a latent worry spring to life when entering a doctor's office that he or she will find something very wrong with me and the condition will affect my loved ones.
-1	having him tell me that I am sick and that it is not good.  worried that he is going to tell me that I have cancer and  that I am going to die
-1	The only thing that makes me anxious is sitting for a long time in the waiting room and waiting to be seen and also worried that there might be something really wrong
1	I worry about being judged or put down again. I worry that there will be something terribly wrong with me and the dr will miss it or dismiss me based on my appearance.
-1	The time I have to wait in the office waiting to be seen and waiting on blood work to come back and waiting for them to come into room for my exam. 
-1	The process of making sure there is noting wrong with me makes me the most scared when visiting a doctor.
1	I just get worried that my glucose numbers are not good enough for my doctor. I'm also worried that they will find something new that's wrong with me.

-1	my weight and my blood work . about my a1c is what i worry about the most. even though i watch everything very careful
-1	What worries me is the possibility of the doctor finding something seriously wrong, like cancer. Other than that I don't really worry about doctor appointments.
-1	
1	That a problem will be discovered
1	I am always a bit anxious with doctor appointments. I think that there is just that factor of the unknown that makes people worry. 
-1	The lobbies and the wait time, It takes way too long and people usually have their kids running around being obnoxious.
-1	The doctor does not make me nervous it's just learning something new as I age that may be affecting me
1	I'm most anxious about weighing myself. I have really bad body issues and haven't been able to lose pregnancy weight. 
-1	I feel anxious about telling things to the doctor because I always feel like the doctors don't believe me or think my concerns are not important. I also feel anxious if I have to be undressed for an exam.
1	What makes me feel anxious is not knowing the unknown. Anything can affect you now a days even the air you breathe. So going to the doctor is a bit nerve racking when basically anthing can harm you now a days. Theres basically no way to protect your self. 
-1	how easily my condition can be treated
1	I always worry that I am not going to be able to clearly  express the health issues I may have, or that I will sound like someone who has nothing better to do than look up health conditions online and adapt those as my own issues. I also worry that the doctor is not going to believe what I tell him.
1	I am often unsure of what protocol my doctor will implement. I also feel insecure abut myself and physical condition and this makes me anxious in the doctor's office.
1	new meds i can't afford or tests that may be unconforatable having to pay when don't have the money 
-1	When visiting a doctor I am worried that they may find out something that is wrong with me that I never thought of or had concerns over. The other things that makes me feel anxious is have a female exam. Even with a female physician this makes me feel anxious.
-1	That I will be embarrassed, and also I worry about the result they will give me.
1	I feel worried when I get news that might be bad or if the doctor and myself don't see eye to eye on my treatment then I feel like I have to find someone else who I can depend on
-1	When I visit the doctor's office, I have no reason to feel anxious or worried. I have been in good health my whole life and have had almost no health issues. However, if I were to feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, it may be due to the fact that I had no clue about what may be causing my symptoms.
1	Well this a easy one.. I had cancer almost 5 years ago come this x-mas.. and Im always worried and concerned that it could ever come back.. as it gets closer to the 5 years.. I get were i feel alittle more rest assured.. but theres always that thought in my mind if something like that will ever happen again.
1	That I will receive bad news but mostly because of my social anxiety as soon as I come in I'm terrified. 
1	My mother having to be up my rear end when it comes to my medical information. And the fact that the doctors allow her to be here while I am an adult is really uncalled for. 
-1	I am just generally anxious about what he will find or that he will discover I have been doing something wrong. I am not worried about his actions or thoughts but, my own and chance happenings.
1	Doesn't everyone hate to go to the doctor? I know that being weighed is necessary for medicine doses and determining overall health, but I'd go a lot more if they didn't weigh me every time. If I'm a couple pounds over my last visit weight, I'll do everything I can to lose it before going to the doctor, or just not go. I suspect this is very common.
1	Being overweight, you are always on edge. There is a voice inside you that begs to not get diagnosed because of your size. Some doctors cannot see past your physical appearance.
1	I just dont like talking about personal things with other people so it makes me anxious in general, not just because they are a doctor.
-1	Because at home my blood pressure is good but as soon as the doctor comes in to take it, it goes up
-1	Simply not knowing the outcome is what would bother me.  Most of the time it is nothing, but the fact that it could be something serious makes me a little anxious from time to time.
-1	That im gonna be yelled at for not losing weight or not getting my blood sugar levels down. Or that I will have to go on insulin
-1	The thing I dread the most is waiting on lab results or bloodwork to come back. Even when I'm perfectly ok, the not knowing is hard to deal with sometimes
1	I don't know what to expect.  The doctor can find a health problem that I wasn't aware of.  Also the potential cost can be worrying.
1	That the doctor might find something wrong that is serious and might take me away from my regular life.
1	I get most worried or anxious when I visit the doctor's office, whenever I have to take my little one to see a doctor. I get more worried because I don't take my kids to the doctor unless they are really ill and I see a lot of media talking about really dangerous, possibly deadly, flu's and other illnesses out there. I worry about these because a child can easily get these illnesses from just being at the store and someone sneezes or coughs. They can even get sick if someone coughed on an item in the store and I touch it and then hold my kids. Being a parent is already worrying but having to worry about their health whenever something like this arises, is very stressful and irritating because I tend to get really antsy and nervous while waiting for the doctor's diagnosis. I had to take my daughter to the ER a few times because she had a high fever temperature, and at the time there was a big outbreak of the flu that was nationwide and causing deaths for some young kids and the elderly. Because of this reason, I decided to take my daughter to the doctor to make sure she was alright. She ended up being fine but just the information on the news and the media and her being sick just made the whole situation nerve wrecking. 
1	When the doctor is concerned about particular health issues I may have, I get a little anxious and worried but he has been the calm one in this relationship. He makes me feel better by explaining the whole process of care very clearly.
-1	That I won't be able to adequately explain whatever issue I am seeing the doctor for: that I will come away no closer to resolving it.
-1	My doctor does his best to provide a calm and non-threatening environment.  Worries or anxiousness comes from my own uncertainty about my condition.
-1	I only really feel anxious if my daughter is very sick. I want to make sure that she gets the best treatment possible. I have a hard time when she is sick because I worry about her. Sometimes I am worried that she won't get the right treatment plan. Usually my anxiety is relieved when I actually talk to the doctor.
1	I guess, obviously, the thing that makes me most worried is the potential for finding something wrong. The second most worrying thing for me is being in that close proximity (prodded, touched) by someone. I also worry about catching something from all the sick people in the building.
1	I don't want to be diagnosed with something serious. I fear becoming ill and leaving my family. That is scary for me.
-1	because I do not know what to expect from the doctor if she going to do anything or just send me to another doctor 
-1	That I won't really get a solution.  He defers me to specialists.  He talks more about politics than about my health.
-1	I get slightly anxious when talking about my pre-existing condition (sleep apnea). Another thing that might make me a little bit anxious is getting a physical (for obvious reasons).  Getting weighed also makes me slightly nervous.
-1	I get worried to visit the doctor's office because I don't know what to expect from the doctor trastment
-1	A dreadful diagnosis such as a terminal disease, cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's, or organ failure. Anything that makes me worry about dying is worrisome.
1	Well I feel this way when I put all my trust in certain doctors for their attitude towards my situation especially when it's what they've done all their life. Then I worry about some doctors that make you come back again and again when it could have been taken care of the last visit 
-1	i feel anxious or worried what the outcome of the visit may be and if there will be anything serious to consider, the length of time to take care of it and the cost.
-1	Just wondering what could be wrong or what my examition outcome might be.
-1	I often worry I have a new medical condition or that an old condition has returned. If that happened I would have to take new medications and have longer visits with my doctors.
1	I have a reoccurring hernia and I am afraid she will see it and tell me I need to have surgery again. Also I am afraid when my blood pressure goes up or my cholesterol. 
-1	I have anxiety so I am always anxious and nervous when going out to places not only the doctors office but in general
-1	What makes me most anxious is not knowing what kind of results I will receive about my health. I worry that I may have something unhealthy or otherwise bad lurking in my body. I worry that I may have some disorder that may negatively affect my life unless I act fast. It's the uncertainty of my own health that makes me anxious.
-1	The most anxious I feel is the wait for the Doctor. I understand that they are busy, but when I sit around waiting long past appointment times I feel like they do not value my time in the same sense that I value theirs by being on time.
-1	The cost associated with going to the doctor would be the only thing I worry about.
-1	If I feel that I could possibly have a serious problem that will require a lot of treatments as well as money, and cause me to be out of work for a long period of time. I may also get anxious if I feel that the doctor doesn't have my best interests in mind.
1	It's just that you never know what's going to happen, I'm always afraid that although I feel fine he is going to find something horribly wrong with me.
-1	I fear that he is going to find something wrong and then I will have to take medicine or have more test ran. I also fear that he will tell me some devastating news.
1	WHEN THEY TAKE FOREVER TO GET BACK WITH YOU REGARDING YOUR RESULTS, OR WHEN THEY CALL YOU BACK TO THE OFFICE FOR MORE TEST
-1	That she is not going to support my wishes, both in type of medicine that works best for me, and my requested dosages of medicines I have had previous experience with.
1	Having to wait a long period of time and feeling the doctor might rush through patients.the doctor having to give me multiple shots because they make an error.
1	I am always worried when I go to the doctor. As I get older anything could be going on with me. I don't go to the doctor enough to be ahead of a problem so by going in when there is a problem I am always concerned. When I go in I'm concerned about my response to my health and also the bill I may receive. Healthcare is expensive now days and I'm sure it keeps others besides myself from going in regularly as they should.
-1	I do not know what he might find and that leaves me uneasy. I feel like doctors sometimes always find something wrong or slightly wrong with patients so that makes me anxious at times.
1	Because you never know what to expect. Especially if you have prior health problems/conditions that have already been battling.
1	I am always worried that something will be found with my health that is not very good and it always has me worried and anxious
-1	I am worried that if I go to the doctor for something minor, something else will be found that is more serious. I live a healthy life but somethings you can't prevent. 
-1	If something is wrong and I don' t know what it is and doctor is not sure either. If tests I did not expect are ordered I have some anxiety while waiting for results
-1	I am most anxious or worried about that  there is something unexpected that I  didn't think could be a concern.  I would be worried that there would be many tests investigate further.
1	it depends of the issue I have, if I have a strange pain and the doctor ask to do blood test or deep exam, at that time I will be a little be afraid 
1	I always feel anxious and worried about what may be the outcome of whatever is going on.
-1	I am not anxious when visiting my doctor. If anything I am very relax when i go to visit my doctor. I look forward to seeing him because I feel he is just as much my friend as he is my doctor.
-1	Just never knowing if something could end up finding out something bad or just the doctor being in a bad mood
-1	I am always worried that they will tell me something is wrong.  Going to the doctor gives me general anxiety.
-1	I am not usually those things unless there is a really big issue. 
-1	White coat syndrome. Usually when I attend the doctor it's something I've decided isn't going away by itself (common cold etc) so I usually am anticipating the worst at the appointment. 
1	That their profits are more concerning than my health. that they would rather me be on 17 different pills , all with adverse side effects than smoke a few joints a day which has a better effect at my treatment.
-1	I fear he will find something radically wrong with my health and that makes me a bit anxious and worried.
-1	That my lab works will all show positive results.Just sitting in his examination room for the doctor to show up.
-1	the unknown, or how bad something is really going to be. or if it wont be anything at all. I try to know get myself worked up before I know what is really going on. 
-1	When I visit the doctor's office I am most concerned about my weight and blood pressure.  My family has a history of heart problems and I want to stay ahead of the pack and avoid those issues.  I'm doing pretty well so far.
1	I think the waiting process in doctor's offices make me the most nervous, or anxious. For example, waiting in the lobby for an appointment, or waiting for shots or a lab result. The feeling of not knowing what to expect, or what the staff is going to tell you can be nerve-wracking.
-1	Not much, since I go there once every few months. It's gets very, very annoying-- what else can I do? 
-1	Some of the things that make me anxious is the time it takes for a appointment. What worries me sometimes is that I don't know if I'm going to find out something good or bad.
1	I worry about what my diagnosis would be and I also worry about whether any conditions have been diagnosed before they become worse.
1	I get concerned that maybe the doctor will find something that could be serious. I try to do everything he advises me to do but sometimes I slip.
1	Sometime I get worried that something will be wrong. I have two beautiful daughters and I always want to be healthy for them. I also have a long family history of breast and ovarian cancer. As well as heart problems, high blood pressure and diabetes. I always worry that I maybe suseptable to one of these conditions and it worries me.  I ear that one day I will be checked or tested and Iâll end up with a condition that a family member of mine had. 
-1	i dont want to find out any new medical conditions that i may have gotten. i feel like any news would be bad news
-1	Bad report to my doctor. Sugar been high a bunch of days. Blood pressure been high a bunch of days. Cholesterol been good.
-1	Very little. I can't really think of anything for this space. I don't have anything to say here. I have no negative feelings at a doctor's office. I go with the flow and don't worry.
1	Not knowing what the results will be from the visit.  It could be a life changer or nothing what so ever.
1	At my age, there is never good news from a doctor.  It is just a question of how bad news will be!   My health is generally good for my age, but I have no place to go but down.
-1	Maybe I did not have a diet Maybe I did not have a diet And I worry that this causes weight gain or some very high values ââthat could harm my health
1	I suppose that it's fear of the unknown.  As I get older I hear about all of the various health issues the others have experienced and I worry that something serious will happen to me. 
1	I tend to get anxious about having to go to the doctor's because of the unfamiliar environment and what the possible outcome is during my visit.

-1	What is most worrisome to me is when I know something is wrong and I am not sure what it is from the symptoms that I have.  I worry when there is a possibility  of something cancerous.

-1	Typically, its a situation when I know something is wrong with me, but I'm also aware that the costs may be too expensive to do anything about. I had a tonsil infection, and I was unable to eat comfortably for days. I didn't know how much the medicine would cost and I had to pay out of pocket. It cost me $300 at the urgent care to get treated and to be able to eat again. It's always an affordability issue.
1	That I will not get the proper care I require. I have had multiple instances where I paid for an Urgent Care visit, waited for hours to be seen, and was sent home with nothing but instructions to rest and take an OTC pill, only to end up admitted to the hospital the following day. Such instances include: heat stroke, kidney stones, broken ankle, severely infected sebacious cyst, etc. None of these instances were taken seriously by doctors in the urgent care center.

1	I have a neuro condition and there are a lot of uncertainties around it. So when I have to be seen for it, it can be a long experience full of many questions. With uncertainties, it causes me anxiety because I don't have a game plan set it stone. If i have a reason why things happen, or a plan, i can deal with it, but when I don't have answers, it makes me nervous.
1	firstly i don't like being poked and looked over. secondly the fear of having a serious disease is always in the back of my mind when visiting the doctor. lastly it's also just the fear of not having control of the situation. 
1	What makes me most worried when visiting the doctor is learning that I have an illness or other negative condition that was preventable. Next is learning about an illness or condition that is neither treatable nor preventable.

1	I get extremely nervous and upset with every doctors visit that I have. Iâm always worried that something worse is gonna be found out or even just something new that could potentially be bad. I hate all the tests and blood work and just initially everything about it. I canât wait to get it over and done with and get back out of the office. Iâve always been this way and I suppose itâll never change. Even if it is just a simple checkup or something like that my heart still races and I get very anxious and nervous.
-1	"When visiting a doctor's office, the thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried is the wait between the time that I check in and the time the doctor actually can see me and uncertainty regarding how much the visit is going to cost financially. Primarily the anxiety I feel is induced by whatever ailment I am experiencing and it typically turns into both anxiety and relief....anxiety over what the doctor might diagnose (for instance, it could be the worst case scenario...though likely not) and relief knowing that someone will be able to give his/her professional opinion and action can be taken. However, for the most part, going to the doctor's office isn't anxiety inducing....just whatever symptoms I am experiencing and the possible cost to ""fix"" it. On a side note, I typically don't go to the doctor unless I am extremely concerned about whatever is ailing my body. "

-1	that I am responding positively to medications and show no additional medical issues and getting weighed
1	"The underlying thought ""what if they find something""! It's a universal fear and it is what puts off most people. The worry starts when the nurse and doctor start with the small talk and only abates when it's over and they say you are fine."
1	Being weighed, being judged, not wanting to divulge information that may make me look bad.

1	Getting injections of any kind. As well as x-rays and cat-scans. talking about cancers of any kind. i dont like how many germs and other possible parasites are  around the inside of docters office.
1	im an anxious person by nature.  but I know im over weight I know ive had issues and I know im getting older which only means the worse will come.

1	I just don't like having to go to the doctor. The waiting around, being around other people. Feeling like I might be wasting their time. 
1	"Everything. The sights, sounds, smells... The possibility of learning something terrible about my health... The vulnerability of having to undress in front of people I don't know well... The humiliation of having issues blamed on my weight... I had a terrible pediatrician as a kid who berated and terrified me and snuck up on me with vaccitions, and I've had a lot of medical anxiety ever since. My ""white coat syndrome"" in regard to my blood pressure when I see a doctor is HORRIBLE."
-1	Nothingg at the moment.  I'm mostly healthy expect for my weight from drinking habits.  I started having random pain that was constant and moderate to serve I would worry about what the diagnosis is at that point.
-1	I really do not feel anxious or worried whenever I visit the doctor's office.  It is a routine visit/annual check-up.  
1	That they will notice something that I have no awareness of at all. That they can immediately tell - by testing, feeling, listening, that something is wrong.
1	The thing that makes me feel anxious or worried is basically getting the results or news. You don't know whether it will be good or bad. 
1	The unknowing of how they will treat my condition. I have gone through a lot of medications and it can be tough on me.
1	What makes me feel more anxious and worried is just hearing the worse. And once I've heard the worse I need a little bit of time to make the best decision for my health. Most doctors just give you one option and expect you to make a decision based off the one option. After I had my first child I was experiencing a lot of things with my body and had trouble understanding what was going on. The doctor ordered a blood test and I had the results explained to me thoroughly. I appreciated that doctors efforts in doing so i.e.  In giving me a thorough explanation of my condition. I just needed a bit more time to further discuss my options of how I can handle my condition while going through that process at the time 
1	I feel nervous I am waiting to be seen that when I am at the doctor's office that I will be given bad news regarding my health.
-1	I think what makes me feel the most nervous is learning that there might be something wrong with me that I did not know about before even going to the doctor in the first place.
1	I'll answer with another question.  How does one feel when they take their car to the mechanic.  its a similar type of anxiety to me.
-1	Most anxious when getting blood drawn or taking blood pressure reading or getting pap smear examination.
-1	I worry that my doctor might find something wrong and the exam itself is a bit uncomfortable. A visit to the doctor is never really something I look forward to.
1	I be worried about receiving bad news because i know that i am overweight and i get scared going to the doctors office. but i plan on bettering myself. but yeah i get anxious because of bad news 
-1	
1	Well I personally do not like s*** want to hear bad news about anything I have to stay healthy but just like anyone it can be Dreadful to the doctor
-1	Sometime doctor make patient do what they don't feel comfortable about it even though they want to make sure there patient is fine that is why I get worried or anxious sometime when I go to see my doctor
-1	When i go to the doctors office my main worry is whether or not im going to be getting a shot. I do not like needles and really hate getting a shot or giving blood. 
-1	I have social anxiety so that always plays into my anxiousness. I also will sometimes worry that I will get diagnosed with something bad or that there will be a major problem when I go. Though it's usually in the back of my mind. 
1	When I go to get my yearly Pap smear, I am always nervous because I don't feel comfortable having someone near that region unless it's for sexual intercourse  
1	Worried that I get diagnosed with a serious illness.
-1	Nothing really. I am usually at ease. I guess if I had to choose one thing it would be waiting in that small room all by myself.
1	I am anxious because I know I am overweight, and I dread being weighed and measured. I am anxious about my blood-pressure reading and blood sugar readings, as high blood pressure and diabetes run in my family. 
1	I am concerned that while conducting an examination he will find something seriously wrong with me. Usually I go right after getting blood work and I am always concerned that the findings will be very bad and it makes me extremely anxious
-1	I feel anxious when I have been waiting for a long time and I have a symptom that is bothering me, such as pain. I just want to stop feeling the pain, but I'm dwelling on it because of the long wait in the waiting room.
1	In general, I would feel anxious because I would not be sure what the diagnosis would be.  Also, I'm always worried about having to buy medicine or take time off of work.  So I always feel apprehensive until I find out what the problem and treatment is.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. She makes the visit as comfortable as possible.
-1	I usually only go to the Dr. when something bad is going on or for a physical, so when my level of worry is already heightened by the stress of what ever is ailing me and compelling me to go. 
-1	perhaps if I felt I had something really seriously wrong, I'd be anxious to know what it was, but ordinarily, I take good care of myself and don't fret over routine office visits.
1	I have just always been uncomfortable about letting someone  look me over.  I know that it is sometimes necessary, but it kind of feels like an invasion.  That's just how I feel.
1	I always worried they will find something is wrong
1	The things that make me feel most anxious is interacting with the doctor and feeling like a may be scolded. The other thing I don't like is just going to the doctor tends to make me feel a general unease. It triggers my social anxiety.
-1	somethiong is wrong with me
-1	I'm worried he will find something that requires painful or expensive treatment.  Other than that, I am not nervous during exams. 
1	getting bad results or not being told what is actually going on with my health which can be fatal or cause long term effects.
-1	My blood sugar levels and A1C just aren't where they should be...and nothing seems to be working. Know it's what I'm eating--but have got to eat.
-1	When I have a health issue and do not know what is wrong with me - when it is out of my control. When I am going in for a regular physical, I do not feel anxious at all.
-1	The doctor is not totally alert. Wrong diagnosis. Visiting a doctor for the first time.
-1	The only thing that typically makes me nervous is the doctor finding something that concerns him that I had not recognized in myself.  The fear of being diagnosed with a serious illness, even though i'm not having any symptoms, is really what makes me anxious.
-1	I get anxious about what they will say.  Since I have anxiety I worry my blood pressure will be higher then normal because of how I'm feeling and not how it normally is.
1	It's just a part of my persolity. I am an anxious person. I sometimes feel worried that there will be something wrong with me.
1	getting scared that there will be something wrong
1	"A little fearful of what they might find.  Anxious over what procedures or tests they might recommend and my being in opposition to these recommendations. Worried that new medication may be introduced just to ""try out"" said new medication when old medication is working fine."
1	Mostly what procedures are going to be done.  Not knowing what to expect in the examination and if it is just a look over and if the doctor sends you somewhere else..
-1	I feel in many cases that the answers I get are just stock answers. No thinking out of the box. I would have zero issues if my doctor asked me to exercise or eat better for 2 weeks and then come back as a suggestion. Instead, it feels like receiving a pill is what I usually get. That is when I feel anxious of what just happened and worried that I won't get better. 
1	I feel anxious because there is always the possibility of something serious being diagnosed. My health isn't the best, so I tend to worry.
1	I'm worried that the doctor will find something that is detrimental to my health. I also don't like people touching me. I'm nervous to find out my weight.
-1	I am worried that my blood pressure will be high or my weight will be high because i haven't done what she told me to do and I haven't been following the diet that I agreed to follow. I am also worried about finding something else wrong with me. 
1	Going to the doctors office is just an activity that makes me unsettled. Generally you go to the doctor to fix a problem, but if not then there is a good chance you may get sick after you leave since there are several other sick people there usually. If you have a specific problem you are struggling with (nerve pain, for example), it seems that they know more than the average person about causes and possible medications to help, but really they are just guessing about what might work and what not and it's just process of elimition. It's frustrating.
1	I feel that going to the doctor is unpredictable. You never know if you're going to get good or bad news. There's really no way to prepare yourself for what type of news your doctor has for you until he or she tells you. 
-1	I don't like getting my blood drawn. I hate needles.
-1	There always rush of people
1	That I'm going to go in for one thing and have something else come up
1	My blood pressure always goes higher in the doctor's office. I check it at home and know what it is.  Then I get a lecture on the blood pressure and then I get a lecture on my weight.
1	Having insurance issues that make payment difficult is one of my biggest anxiety factors. I also have a hypochondriac streak and expect terrible news about my health.
-1	I had a major illness when I was younger, and it took the doctors a long time to find out what was wrong.  I had to have blood drawn on a daily basis for over a month.  To this day I still hate having blood drawn.  I always look away, and just hate when I have people who aren't that competent drawing blood.  I also worry about what hereditary conditions I may have.
1	Sometimes when I take a test for any thing I be anxious, and worried about the test coming back, and hoping every thing comes back ok.
1	I always worry that the doctor will find that something is wrong with me and I wouldn't even suspect.
1	I stress about the scales. I hate seeing my weight. I hate needles so I stress with getting blood drawn. 
-1	What makes me feel most anxious/worried about when I visit a doctor's office is finding out if something could possibly be wrong with me.
-1	The most anxious or worried I can get when I go to the doctor is that  the doctor will say that is something wrong.  Or give me a hard time about weight or diet.
-1	Often I feel nothing is being done for my diagnosis. Sometimes new medicine is introduced. Yet the medicine rarely helps. 
1	I worry that something about my health will be wrong. I'm afraid that I will have a terrible health issue, or even something minor but inconvenient. I think about how I'm a bit overweight and that is going to eventually cause health issues. I wonder if this appointment will be the one where I find out that my weight has caused some issues.
-1	The only thing that makes me feel anxious when visiting the doctor's office is the possibility is bad news or if the doctor is unable to come up with a diagnosis.
1	Don't know. No comnent, I am someone that doesn't go to the doctor unless there is something that is really bothering me and I can't get over ut
-1	not sure whats going to happen, not knowing what the doctor will say. I believe  in equality. I beleive that everyone is nervous sometimes.
-1	Sometimes after a pap smear especially after abnormal results.  Another issue that may make me worried is if I found a lump in my breast and have to go see a doctor that specializes in Cancer.
1	I always feel like I may be getting judged and also wondering about the outcome. 
-1	Usually not concerned because I feel the Dr is going to fix what is wrong. The unknown can be unnerving but I trust my Dr to fix what ails me!
1	Their responses or how they respond to certain questions. I hate when they seem unsure and try to throw many possibilities without further testing. 
-1	Nothing beyond whatever I'm there for.
1	Not knowing results or cause of illness is the most worrying part of doctors visit. The anticipation of knowing answers makes me anxious.
-1	When I am not sure what to expect or am not quite sure what is wrong with me, then I get a little anxious or concerned.
1	Worried the doctor may give me bad news or tell me my health issue sounds series. I may tend not to ask certain question or seek medical information as much.
1	What they might find makes me feel most anxious. You might feel good but when you go to the doctor, you might discover that you have something wrong with you whether it's a disease or low vitamin levels. Also, the process of examination such as taking my blood and checking me makes me nervous. I don't like needles and I don't like a stranger touching me. 
-1	They may find something wrong. Because I rarely go, I am worried they will find something I haven't noticed or overlooked. 
-1	I don't feel anxious when I visit a doctor's office.  I am calm and looking ahead at what I will learn about the doctor and my health.
-1	The only thing I dread is the feeling of not being heard, AGAIN, and so I only go to the doctor when required for ongoing check-ups to refill life long prescriptions.
1	Knowing that I was unable to ascertain the cause or treatment necessary to overcome whatever the ailment happens to be. Knowing that my literal life is in another person's hands. It is an opportunity for life or death, the gravity of it gets to me.
-1	"Really, the only thing that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the potential for unknowns. While my health may not be the best, I have never encountered anything ""serious"" when seeing my doctor. I am always somewhat concerned that he may one day find something that requires serious medical attention, and that worries me."
-1	I feel worried about my possible diagnosis. I worry that I might get sick more than I really am. I know my doctor will help me, but if I catch something bad, there's only so much she can do.
1	I am always a little worried that they are going to find something seriously wrong with me. The only doctors I have been to in the past few years are baby doctors and they are typically very good at relieving those worries.
-1	Usually I get worried because the outcome is unknown and I am not sure what is going to happen. I think alot of this fear is due to not wanting to have some major medical issue come about such as cancer or other very prominent diseases. Also it is not somewhere you go very often and is usually associated with death, illness and pain so these places are naturally scary to someone who doesnt go often or is awaiting a bill of health. Also the cost is another concern and can cause stress in someone who visits because something simple can still be expensive. 
1	I am worried about what they'll find and that they'll say. I rarely see the doctor so when I go, they always find something new that's wrong with me.
-1	Sometimes doctors offices make me anxious for no reason. Even if I know it is just a routine check up and I don't have any problems. Any anxious feelings that I may have go away just as quickly as they came. 
-1	When visiting the doctors office I am usually not anxious or worried because I am a calm person. So there is nothing I have to do but listen to what they say.
1	I have a tendency to think the worst. I am a pessimist. I think something much worse is wrong with me than ever is. 
-1	afraid that there will be something that is seriously wrong with me that will significantly impact my life.  not knowing what the cost of any treatment for any condition that is discovered will be.
-1	Nothing really makes me anxious about the visit. Potential future health problems may worry me a little.
1	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the unknown. Just because I was fine the last time I came doesnt mean it will be the same this time. I don't really know how my body is. I do t know if there's something internally wrong with me or not. The unknown is the scariest thing.

1	i honestly cant really explain it, its just something i feel. I am a heavy person so i guess it makes me nervous to hear about my weight and what could happen if I don't lose it. That's about the only reason why i get nervous
1	If there would be something in the results that was unexpected and it would create some anxiety
1	I hate going at the doctor, maybe it's that sense of uncertainty that kills me.. I fear the physical pain but I can bear it well enough.
1	i am only worried if i dont know whats wrong with me but most of the time i do know i know my body very well
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when I visit a doctor's office.  I guess I hope they don't tell me I have cancer or something.
-1	I have no fear when I visit a doctor.  The only thing I can think of is maybe I don't want to have to take medication.
1	It is possible that unexpected results could cause 'anxious or worried' emotions or feelings at certain times.
1	That they wont really take the time to listen to exactly what i'm trying to explain without interrupting me and giving me their opinion before I've even explained why I'm there in the first place.
1	I am always afraid he is going to find something wrong with me even though I have no symptoms.  I also had needles and I know he will always take a blood test.
-1	The thought of maybe them finding something wrong. 
-1	What worries me most is the progression of the medical maladies I suffer from now. Everytime I see her, I'm worried that it's gotten worse or is spreading to other vital organs. 
-1	I guess just telling the doctor about my problems and it is a natural reaction. I don't have anything else to say.
-1	I am mostly anxious or worried because I have little faith in their ability to diagnose my problem. Or show concern by getting to the underlying cause of my problem. Medical costs keep going up and up and yet is seems as if medical care has been drastically declining.
1	I once got diagnosed with diabetes and they wanted me to go on Medforin and I refused instead I relied on altertive therapy and next time I visited the Doctor they had NO evidence of this diagnosis.
-1	Them finding something out that could be really wrong with me. I want everything to be okay and get a good report.
-1	I worry about getting a seriously negative diagnosis for a medical problem. I am anxious about general tests in the office -- blood pressure, breathing exam and test. Heart rate and ekg tests.
1	I feel anxious that there's going to be something really wrong with me, even if I'm feeling okay.  Just going to the doctor's makes me think about possible problems.
1	I don't really feel anxious when I visit my main doctor (as described previously), but I've had a certain amount of doctor phobia as long as I can remember/since I was a small child.  I'm really irratiolly afraid of needles and especially injections.  I am capable of having blood drawn if I lay down, but I have a feeling there's part of me that always expects at a GP's place or something that they're going to want to give me a shot or something...  I know that won't happen at the endocrinologist's office, ha
1	You could possibly come in contact with other people who are contagious. Also worried about what may be wrong with me. 
-1	Sometimes I go into a doctor fearing the worst when I go into see him. There have been times in the past with previous doctors that their first diagnoses wasn't always the correct one. For that reason alone I'm weary sometimes.
-1	I feel that I have a pretty good bead on what is wrong with me medically.  I am never really expecting anything groundbreaking or life changing to happen or be told to me.  A doctors office visit for me is more of a chore then anything else.
-1	
1	I am afraid after certain tests are run, I may be diagnosed with some incurable dread disease. I would feel helpless and very upset to receive this news.
-1	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is the fear of the unknown. They older we get, the more chances for something to go wrong.
-1	being on time  i am nortoriusly  late no matter how early i start.  fortunately the office staff is aware of my failing and will move someone else ahead of me so i don't waste the staffs time
-1	Doctors make me nervous because sometimes I don't say things correctly and I have a severe anxiety condition 
1	Pain is the thing I worry about the most and second would be if the person knows how to do their job correctly and has an all right attitude.
1	It makes me worried when I get anxious because I don't wanna be sick when I get tests done it freaks me out 
-1	"I am worried that he will say something like ""this is rare"" or ""I have never seen this before"".  I want something routine that is easily eased."
-1	If I am worried about what I'm there for, then I'm worried.  For example, I had a lump that needed to be examined. My doctor was not concerned, but because of my level of concern, had no problem referring me for further diagnostics to help ease my mind.  Waiting for the results was the anxious part, but because my doctor was not concerned at all, it helped ease the anxiety.
-1	Because you don't know what that are going to say and what they going to do. But they are helpful and are knowledgeable
-1	I generally feel anxious or worried.  I feel uncomfortable and cold in the doctor's office.  I am usually stressed because I've had to drive in traffic from a distance.  I get social anxiety.  I am sometimes a bit uncertain about the results.  When I get checkups, I am generally expecting them to go well especially if I haven't had any issues prior to coming.  But you never know if some test result or exam comes back questionable and you have something serious or concerning wrong with you.  Or some expensive testing procedure that of course insurance won't cover.  Money and pricing is always a concern with doctor visits.  Sometimes I feel strange that every doctor can see all my previous digital health information which makes me uncomfortable.  Many times I feel violated for having to sign away all my rights in the paperwork.  And the office staff is usually rude and abrupt and treats you less than humanely.
1	Getting test results back. Or finding out being pregnant or not. Its just a scary thought that will cross my mind often
-1	Getting bad news,  or being misdiagnosed. The Doctor not taking your complaints seriously. Trying to remember what you need to say in the little time you get to be face to face with the doctor.
-1	Find something that could effect my family or myself in any way
-1	I'm not anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's for an exam. I don't really like waiting and I dread the expense, but nothing about the appointment itself gets my very worried
1	Waiting time and also waiting to be seen by a doctor and what they are going to say during everything and if there is anything wrong with you
-1	That I might have something wrong with me. I will need to seek medical attention immediately for my health reasons. 
-1	At times I feel worried about getting the results of my blood work. I feel relieved once I find out that there is nothing abnormal and I am in good health. 
-1	I just don't like going to the doctors office. I am a very healthy person, but the process of being in the doctors office does generate a very small amount of anxiety. Mostly the long waits. After I meet with the doctor, all is good.
1	my doctor is a good doctor he caress alot about me and my health my son sees him too the whole office is nice to us
1	School and my future makes me feel worried about my future. There is a lot of pressure I have going on in my life and it can be a little too much at times.
-1	I usually do not feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor. 
-1	If  I have been doing research on something that I think that I have symptoms.  It usually turns out to be nothing.  He tells me right away if something has gone wrong.  I have learned to take better care of myself so  I am not too nervous.
1	I never know what to expect. I don't know if they will say my pressure is so high that I need to stay in the hospital.
1	Doctors are often times in it for the money.  You have to be careful and find a good doctor.
-1	I always feel anxious at the doctors office because I'm scared of catching someone elses sickness, or getting bad news.
-1	I only feel anxious or worried if I suspect something's wrong with me. Otherwise I'm always pretty relaxed in the doctor's office, and pretty comfortable with the nurses and staff in general.
-1	if I am diagnosed with a serious illness or injury I get anxious and worried that i'll be able to handle it.
-1	Im sure anyone visiting a doctor understands that there is the possibility of hearing bad news. Lab results and other testing can change between visits and sometimes you just dont know what may turn up
1	Waiting, for test results makes me worried if everything is normal. Also, the waiting for the DR. before your exam and not knowing what will be done.
1	I just do not like the a doctor's office  so much they are  so boring sitting  and waiting for  the doctor 
-1	I anxious to find out how my health is if it is still holding or if it is getting worse than before.
1	I have a fear of needles so I feel uneasy or worried about whether or not they will need bloodwork. I always get worried too that they won't find anything to help me with my condition.
-1	I get most anxious about the bill I receive after the visit. 
-1	My doctor is so calm with me i dont feel anxious or worriedmy doctor is the best i need no one elsemy doctor is the best need no other
1	I just am an anxious person.  I don't like the doctor's office and try to avoid it when possible.  I go when needed though and usually good comes of it.  I just get so nervous that something might be wrong or that they're judging me.
-1	exams are unpleasant,  worry about what might be found.  not fun sitting in a paper gown waiting 30 mins in a cold room for the dr to show up.   
-1	The thought of the unknown is what I worry about most. I hate going to the doctor so I put it off until I really need to go
-1	The only thing that makes me anxious or worried is if I have a new issue or concern and I don't know what's going on. Also if I'm taking a new medication that is not working and we are discussing a new treatment plan, I might become anxious or worried
1	What makes me feel most anxious in a doctor's office is the uncertainty of it. I don't like feeling bad and not knowing what is wrong, and wondering about the diagnosis can be nervewracking.
1	I always assume the worst. I usually think that something is going to come back worse then what I initially went to the doctor for.
-1	I am most worried about going to the doctor when there is nothing really wrong.  I am most anxious to go to the doctor and be told that there is nothing wrong and it's all in my head.
-1	If I have taken a particular test/exam that could have serious ramifications, just waiting for the answer/results to this can be of great concern, can make me feel anxious or worried.
-1	The cost because I am not insured. That is my biggest concern. Other than that I feel that I am seeing a doctor for a reason.
1	Given the wrong diagnosis a few times. I have had 5 new PC in he past 7 years. That is very discouraging.
1	It not always a lot of fun going to the doctor depending on why you are going, and sometimes it makes me a bit anxious or nervous. It just is not a fun place to be
-1	Uncertainty as to whether or not lab results might reflect a deteriorating situation in my health.  This has increased as I've aged.
1	I think I'm a generally healthy person, but I get worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me. 
-1	
-1	It makes me feel sad makes me feel just very worried of set tired exhausted very very and I believe that I don't want to be worried anymore
1	Worried that he will deliver bad news. I am at the dr to make sure everything is ok, but i worry about the discovery of something negative. 
-1	Well, in a sense, i would feel anxious if there is doubt inside the doctor's heart. Most doctors can have some type of uncertainty. But as long as that doubt doesn't cloud their minds. As well as spread it towards others. It's dangerous to spread doubt to others, and could lead to potential disasters. So i would advise that he/she can be careful.
1	Everything get a good result is all I want to hear because it's scary when you get the results in the club in the pillows
-1	I have lost faith in my current doctor and his ability to properly diagnose me. I also feel that he is trying to see the largest number of patients in the least amount of time.
-1	I always feel they may think I'm over exaggerating my symptoms or want to treat something with over the counter medications I've already tried.
-1	I feel anxious at the doctors office when I have to wait a long time to be seen. I trust the process but I don't like to be late going back to work. 
1	I feel like the doctor will tell me something bad, something that will effect my life or the way I lead my life. I am fearful of all possible outcomes. I worry about these things that may hurt my family if I am sick.
1	I am a private person with personal space issues. I do not like the examination process but deal with it.
1	Mostly my fears are actually going to the hospital and getting sick. I also don't do well with waiting in long lines. I need to be able to get in and out. I also hate not having my records available online. 
1	I feel most anxious if I am actively having a health issue and have to wait a long time to be seen. Waiting a long time causes me to go to worst case scenario in my mind and by the time I'm in the exam room I am sometimes a bit nervous.
1	Sometimes I had white coat syndrome. This is when I went to the doctor's office my blood pressure would be fine and then she would take my blood pressure and it would be elevated.
-1	That they will find something serious that is wrong with me or I will owe more money than I first thought I would owe them.
1	That something will be wrong, that a slight twinge or pain I've had for a long time will turn out to be something terminal. And even though I've tried to be healthier, and do right by my life, and improve...that it all will be meaningless because I suddenly have some horrible disease (cancer, illness, etc.) that will cut my life short before I can get it back on track.
1	diagnosing me with problems i don't have. giving me the wrong drugs to take. having really bad side effects from the pill im taking
-1	My family has an extensive history of health issues and each time I go to my doctor I am concerned that he is going to find something or diagnose a condition.  Often times I am waiting on the test results to see if everything is fine or not and that makes me anxious.

1	Feeling like a doctor missed something or I didn't speak up enough. That, and finding out something else that is just really awful.
1	If I have an unexpected pain or problem, then i feel worried. I feel that although they can help at times, its up to God to heal.
1	I am worried that they will find something that is not truly there, like an auto mechanic. Also, if I do have a problem, that they will want to take the least holistic approach, further compromising my health. 
-1	Just the thought of being in hospitals makes it seem like something is gonna be wrong with you when you go there
1	Learning the results of tests that I've had taken. I usually get scheduled for tests like cat scans to check my lungs. Waiting til my next appointment to learn the results of those tests makes me anxious to the point of almost being sick to my stomach.
1	Hoping the doctor gives me a good bill of health. I always feel I might catch something from someone in the waiting room  I have a physical every year. Having my mammograms make me feel anxious 
1	In sometimes afraid that it could be something that could affect your lifestyle out even your life and that can scare people
-1	I really don't feel worried when I'm there. I think that if I am worried about something, its definitely more around whats wrong with me than anything the doctor is doing at the time. 
-1	I don't usually feel nervous, but I might if I know there's something wrong with me
1	"I have always had ""white coat syndrome"" I just get nervous because I don't know what is going to happen or what treatment I am going to get and if it is going to be unpleasant"
1	I feel like there will be no good or help from the visit. The doctors moods tends to change from each visit and when things are not accomplished, it's hard to think positive and feel better when they do not want to put forth the effort to help.
-1	Because it just the point of worry of what might be said from the doctor about your aelf so stay alert and woke
-1	I already answered a question just like this. I do not like repeating myself. My only worry is that my doctor doesn't listen to me and doesn't take the time to really get to know me. I am just another face in her practice.
1	I am most anxious or worried at the doctor's when they take my weight and blood pressure. I'm worried that my blood pressure will be high and that my weight keeps going up.
1	Mostly, I'm worried about whatever situation made me visit the doctor. I don't visit the doctor unless I feel I have a serious problem that won't go away on its own and it will need some medical treatment. This is a very rare occurrance though.
1	The environment. Alk the people and all the germs. I always feel like im being watched and judged. So I prefer not gounf to the doctors so I can avoid this
1	I'm not sure what to do with the same time and effort to get the best way of getting a new job and I will be able to get the latest 
-1	If I am having an issue that I am not sure about or pains that I do not have all the time.  i do worry about terminal diseases and things of that nature.  If you are experiencing things that you donât know anything about it can be a highly tense situation.
-1	Usually it's the unfounded fear that the doctor is going to find something this visit that will drastically change my life.
-1	If my blood pressure it too high, or my weight is too high.  I work out every day and I've been a healthy eater my whole life, so when my weight goes up, I get pretty upset because I feel like there's no reason for it.
-1	I think that imagining the doctor telling me that I have something terribly wrong with me creates anxiety.
1	I'm in my fifties and they say the older you get problems can arise.  I think they may find something wrong.
-1	the only thing i worry about is when i have to get a shot. i hate needles.
1	I just feel anxious having like ten minutes to get my questions/concerns answered. And I don't have a good relationship with any of the doctor's I've had. 
-1	The reason I am  so comfortable  with a medical  exam is I had regular exams over the years. So as issues come up I get the right medication in a timely manner to hopefully keep me from having emergency surgeries. I've been treated for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. So these conditions are under control. I work hard to take my medications and go to my exams to make sure that everything is on track and stays that way. 
-1	I tend to consider worst case scenarios when I head to the doctor's office; if I have some kind of pain or ailment, I tend to assume it is something awful and imagine the worst possible results. By the time I get to the doctor, I feel like he is close to confirming my worst fears, even if I'm actually fine.
-1	On occasion I may fee anxious about what he may find upon examining me. Sometimes if I have to wait for a test result, I may may feel even more anious.
1	I'm worried that my problems will turn out to be far worse or more serious than I initially thought.
1	When I'm there, I'm worried if he's had a bad day. I feel like that could affect his examition and/or dealings with me. Sometimes I wonder whether or not I'm going to have trouble with my insurance. There are times when I'm worried about how much time I'm spending there, and if my kids are okay where they are. 
-1	I'm anxious and worried all day, regardless of where I am. Going to the doctor just adds a veneer of annoyance.
-1	Really nothing, I go, check in, see the MD, he reviews my test results and gives me a copy of them, and discusses anything pertinent. He is very respectful. 
-1	Poor communication makes me wonder about the doctor.
1	That they won't hear me. Or that I'll get some dreadful diagnosis and then be faced with decisions that I don't want to make.
-1	Blood test results, because I've gotten back results in the past that have shown high cholesterol and anemia, so I'm always concerned something is going to come back higher or lower than it should
-1	Worried because just in case doctor told me something bad about my health condition.
1	When visiting the doctors office the most anxious I get is when I have to be treated or diagnosed with any medical conditions and don't know what is going on or why it happened.

-1	
-1	He's going to recommend I do something I'd rather not, like quit drinking or doing more exercise or adding a prescription that I don't feel good about taking.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious is the unknown of what the doctor may find; especially if I'm dealing with a known illness.
1	I am scared that the doctor will find something seriously wrong or that I may be reffered to another specialists
1	I never visit the doctor for a good reason, i'e either sick or injured so worrying about the worst case is human nature. Plus the whole thing is uncomfortable, with the doctor feeling up your member, them taking your pee, the waiting room, and paying for it all.  
1	What all could go wrong. How expensive the appointment as well as any follow up treatment may be. If there is a serious matter I've inadvertently ignoring 
-1	I feel anxious or worried if there is a new employee .Example the person who take your blood. If he or she is new I do not know if they have enough experience.. I will not let them  stick me with a needle several times to get blood.
1	"I've had a bout with thyroid cancer so every doctor visit I think ""what's next?"" and how much will each referral and testing diagnostic cost. It worries me emotiolly and fincially."
1	I think it is the thought they they might find something seriously wrong and this is something that everyone wants to avoid.
-1	I'm worried that they might find something wrong with me. It also makes me anxious being poked and prodded. It is a little uncomfortable. It's quite personal and not at all private.
1	I feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office because I never go to the doctor for good things. I sometimes worry that the doctor is not going to know what is wrong with me or I worry that my assumptions are right about why i had to come to the doctor. I feel anxious sometimes when they take my blood pressure because it is normally high and it is hard for me to control it at times. It makes me feel like I didn't do all I was suppose to. 
1	If I am going to hear that my progress is still the same. Or that my medication isn't working like it used to. 
-1	I rarely get anxious at the doctors office.  If I go to the doctor when I feel like something may be wrong, then I may be anxious until I know that it is not something serious.

-1	
-1	Just the wait times. Usually takes longer to wait than for the appt. It's not the appt itself that bothers me. 
1	Being sick and assuming it's the worst possible thing. I'm worried about getting sicker in the waiting room with other sick people around. I'm worried about procedures that might hurt or feel embarrassing, such as bloodwork or bad side effects or something, and embarrassing as far as potentially showing body parts I don't normally show and talking about bodily functions
1	Im always worried about the trip and what could happen to me cause u never know what would happen or what they could say to u
-1	Usually I get a little worried because I am ill and I don't know what's wrong. The diagnosis hasn't been made
1	Im afraid that the doctor lacks the basic knowledge to access the condition and prescribe appropriate treatment.I worry that the individual may be more concerned about fincial gains rather than offering sound judgement.
1	Finding out something is wrong with me.Also the possible pain associated with the procedure and the stress.
-1	Having to weigh myself in the beginning. 
1	I may receive life-altering information. Or, to treat something, I may start heading down the wrong path when it comes to treatment. The cost is also a concern.

-1	if I am very sick and don't know why. I would feel anxious to find out what is wrong. once I know I can take care of it.
-1	I have never liked going to the doctor. I guess the thing that makes me feel most anxious and worried is when the doctor makes a big deal about something i felt was minor.
-1	just that I might find out that my health isn't as good as I think it is and that it might incur further pain or discomfort
1	I think I am just allergic to doctor's offices!  I am one of those people whose  blood pressure goes up when tested in the doc's office.  I look at the trays of sharp instruments lying in wait on the counters and I am uneasy!  I have a vivid imagination.  I am anxious about any invasive tests, about possible pain, about possible bad news, esp. as I get older and older.  I have learned to trust my doctor, and as I have reached the age just this year when my yearly physical exam does not have to include a gyn exam, I am much more relaxed.  
-1	The outcome or what areas of my body might be in bad shape and the treatments that I would have to take.
-1	I am always worried that I will not get a good bill of health.  I have some weight to lose and know that I might be confronted about that and what I should be doing.

-1	having to wait for results to come back. to find out what kind of problem i have and how she can fix it

-1	I'm always there about something that is out of my control, and I have to trust that the person I'm seeing might be able to help with the situation.  I usually wait until problems build up, so there is also that urgency.
1	that theyre going to come throgh the door with some scary results.
1	When the doctor recommends that I take some medication that I am not very familiar with. I read about some possible side-effects but my doctor does not seem very affected by that. That makes me worried because I'm unsure if something may be a big deal or not.
-1	The possibility that they could find something wrong with me.
-1	I am most anxious about the discovery of an underlying or latent condition that is not showing symptoms. I feel relatively fine and try to stay in good health but you never know what may come back in your blood work or what the doctor may find during an examination. 
-1	My issue is I'm worried that my doctor will judge my health personally and make it seem like I'm a bad person because of my health issue. I'm coming to them for help and I don't want to feel like I'm being scolded for a health problem.
-1	nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried when going to the doctor i am just turally that way. it isnt being there that is causing the feelings its just life in general
-1	I really do not worry about going to the doctor and I always pray. So far everything has been alright no serious conditions to where I am dying 
-1	I'm always afraid they might find something bad.  I have chronic abdominal pain and have not been able to get a diagnosis since it began over three years ago. Also, just having to talk to doctors makes me nervous.  I don't know why. It may be because I sometimes have to speak to them for my job and they can be very rude and scary sometimes.
-1	There have been times when a test or exam turned up something questionable that needed to be explored with further tests. I have had a few cancer scares. Those times were anxious for me, because I knew there was a possibility I would have cancer. Thankfully, I never did.
-1	I don't feel anxious when visiting the doctor
1	I don't like visiting the doctor because after the blood test I have to view me talk about my results with him. I am sometimes worried that my readings won't be good and the doctor will give me more pills or get mad at me for not following his directions in the first place.
1	That I could potentially find something wrong with my body or something that's out of sync, whether it be blood pressure or even my weight. I feel like if something could go wrong, even a small chance, it's something that I'll think about.
1	I am rushed into the doctors office like cattle.  he never reads my files or listens to my complaints.
-1	Nothing, really.  There's the 1% chance that I might get blindsided by bad news, but that is very unlikely.  The only somewhat realistic concern I might have is if I was diagnosed with a condition that runs in my family, especially ones I'm actively trying to avoid.
1	I always worry that an incurable problem will be discovered and /or that I will find out terrible news about my health.
1	i always feel like i'm going in for a test I didn't study for. I usually have a list of questions i want to ask and in my nervousness i forget them all. 
-1	When visiting my doctor the only thing that makes me feel anxious is the anticipation of the visit itself... 
1	I worry about some of the tests that are done, such as taking blood and maybe they would have to give me a shot.
-1	When I know I haven't been taking the best care of myself I get worried about the results my test will give and what my doctor will have to say about my results. 
-1	Being unsure as to what the doctor may tell me concerning my health. Going to the doctor does not always go the way I would like it to. I do not always get the best results. Doctors do find issues that have to be resolved.
1	for me; because of my diabetes; i am always worried that there is some kind of complication that goes wrong for my body as a result of this disease.
-1	I worry whether or not I will receive bad news. The longer I go without seeing a doctor the worse this feeling becomes. Similar to the dentist.
1	I am always nervous about what they are going to say about my health or my conditions.  I generally never really get anything to positive, so I always try to prepare myself for what is to come.  If I get a good report, then I'd rather be pleasantly surprised, then be hopeful and become disappointed.  
-1	What makes me most anxious when visiting a doctor's office would be them finding out I have some grave disease. I also feel worried when they overthink things like giving medications or going through procedures that are not necessary.
1	he may find something of concern that may be life threatening or would require me to change my lifestyle drastically.
-1	I'm more anxious to see if the thoughts I have on what the issue are line up to his. If they do then I already kind of know the course of treatment so there is no mystery.
1	That the physician will give you a negative report/diagnosis. Doctors don't have a positive bone in their bodies. It is ALWAYS doom and gloom with them. They just  approach a patient with how the odds of getting well are so low. Their game plan is to give you a lot of medicines or advice a sometimes unnecessary surgery. Again, to make money for hospitals and drug companies.
1	afraid of what he has to tell me whether it be good or bad but got to take it  an I know what he is going to tell me will help me 
1	If they will find anything wrong 
1	I always worry that they will diagnose with something different illness or if they will prescribe some different medicine which at the end might have some sided effects.   
1	Just having to go. It's uncomfortable and not something I look forward to. You see this person on rare occasions so it's not that comfortable. 
-1	That I will end up with another short term solution and no clear answer. In three months I will be in the same situation and he will just do the same thing and I don't see progress.
1	Not being able to afford the cost of the visit. I worry about being harassed about payment in the future.
-1	nothing makes me anxious or worried most of the time i am pretty calm person and not worry too much about things
-1	I feel anxious because after the exam you don't know if the Dr. is going to tell you that something is wrong.
1	if i was really sick or in pain and i didnt know why then i would be fearful, other than that im usually very calm
1	"The smell of a hospital/doctors office immediately gets me anxious. Moreso however, I almost expect them to say something is wrong (whether or not I have reason to think there is), and either ready injections or prescribe medications. It's primarily the thought of ""what if something is wrong"" and the outcome of it."
-1	during an exam, you do not know what could be found, so that is nerve wracking
-1	On regular check ups you just don't know if they will find something. After the check up it goes away but there is always the fear that something might have changed since your last exam.
-1	I feel anxious just because I want to be sure I am doing everything in my life to help change my current health status. Anxiety is something I feel like I could have the power to stop if I was in the right mind set and in a better place in my life. I'm very hard on myself and that tends to get to me as well.
1	I am always worried that something will be very wrong and I don't like being touched by strangers. I also worry that I will need to get my blood drawn and needles scare me
-1	The number one thing would be the discovery of something that is asymptomatic. I'm sixty years of age and feel pretty good. So I guess any anxiety I might feel would be tied into discovering an issue that I had not planned on.
-1	I feel most worried that the doctor will find something, maybe it's cancer, or some other neurological disease. But even though logically, I shouldn't worry, it just becomes automatic. 
1	When I go to the doctor for something that could be serious, this is when I get worried or anxious. I hate not being in control of a situation and I think for me not knowing is what worries me.
-1	if there is a serious issue that I am unsure about I feel concerned about what the doctor is going to say that is the problem. I know that my doctors don't care and that I am wasting my time even going in for a checkup
-1	if my test results show that there is something wrong and i need further testing to rule out other possibilities. or when my iron is really low and need a transfusion which i dislike having.
1	I just don't know what kind of news I will recieve. I wonder it it will be okay.I just don't know what kind of news I will recieve. I wonder it it will be okay.I just don't know what kind of news I will recieve. I wonder it it will be okay.
-1	I am getting older. I don't have any of their difficulties, but pretty much all the males on my dad's side had high pressure, diabetes, and potential for heart disease.
1	I HAVE AN INTENSE FEAR OF DOCTORS, HOSPITALS ETC. THIS COMES FROM HAVING HAD POLIO WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD. I SPENT FOUR MONTHS IN HOSPITAL AND  
1	I get nervous at times because you never know what could happen. You never know what conditions may exist that you don't know about.
-1	Naturally, I am a worrier. I feel that I can do better in taking care of my self and my health and so in the back of my mind I am always a little concerned
-1	if I go in and have no clue what's going on. A completely new thing never experienced before and cant ID it well
-1	If he seems distracted or not really about getting my input about my situation. I don't have this issue with my regular doctor but occasionally I might have to see someone else.
1	If I am going for a regular exam, I worry if everything is going to be ok. I always expect or think the worst instead of just letting things happen. 
1	"I always think there's some random disease they will tell me i have. Im not sure why. I guess its the whole ""not knowing"" thing. "
-1	Getting weighed every single time makes me anxious. My white coat blood pressure makes me anxious... I tell the person who takes my blood pressure before the doctor comes in to wait a few minutes and ask me the standard questions and refer to my online chart BEFORE taking my blood pressure. But-they never listen to me, take it anyway and it comes out high. Then when the doctor comes in I tell him that told the assistant again to wait to take my bp(for the umpteenth time) and he takes it and it's fine.
1	I have those feelings because of normal feelings.I also often worry about what may be found in an exam. Sometimes I experience some discomfort when examined.
1	I feel most anxious if a doctor is not open to my full explanation of what my body is doing. Most doctors are too close minded regarding nutritional therapy and so I tend to be skeptical of a doctors quick diagnosis. I know my body the best so I trust my insight more than them.
1	I think that I'll be diagnosed with the worst condition and will need surgery. I have white coat syndrome so my worries are numerous and most of them are silly but I'm working on meditating to control my anxiety.

-1	For me to show up at the doctor's office with a complaint means that I am acknowledging that I am experiencing something that is beyond my capability and that I need help with.

1	When I do a series of tests and I have the consultation so that the doctor gives me the diagnosis, and also when I have a lot of pain in my body

1	I'm honestly not scared of needles, shots or anything like that. I have many tattoos and piercings so to me a shot or needle is nothing at all. I get so uneasy and worried to the point that I'm nauseous. I think it's because I overly worry that the doctor is going to find something or say I'm sick with something, I'll need further testing elsewhere, or I have only a few months to live.

For me it's basically a choice between two evils-- the disease or the doctor.

I'm already in debt because of college loans; I literally can't afford to be in any more debt than I already am.

-1	I have not had to go to the doctor's office the last few years so I do not recall, I guess it would be when I see needles, though the nice nurses tend to make the anxiety go away
-1	I think the most obvious answer is that nobody wants to hear something is wrong with them.  I have an unnatural fear of death anyways.  I do not have a regular physician because I am almost never sick.  So on occasion, when I have been sick or something has been wrong that I felt that I needed to go the doctor, I have worried that I would hear bad news.  The mind tends to go to worse case scenario.  I go to get a yearly mammogram and a yearly pap smear-neither of which is a pleasant experience just for the fact that it leaves me exposed. So that is enough to cause anxiety but add to that the possibility that they will find something wrong is always enough to cause worry.
1	That they will try and find something wrong so they can charge you for tests that you don't need. That they will misdiagnose something and cause me stress.
1	I always fear I might have a genetic illness as many of them run in my family and are hereditary. I fear I might be diagnosed with one such as breast cancer, heart disease, kidney disease , or even diabetes.
-1	Nothing in particular. As I said, I've been going to the same place for years, so I'm very comfortable there. I get a bit anxious when I'm sitting there waiting, simply because I hate waiting for anything.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office. But I may be come nervous when I go to the Dentist.
-1	That they will misdiagnose or miss something completely, or not even pay attention to what I'm saying.
1	My Dr. now does not make me feel these ways but others haveYou get  tired of same old bad Doctors & wish they cared more
1	I don't feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office. I usually feel relieved that something that is going on is going to get taken care of here. I don't like to go to the doctor but I feel better once I know what is going on with my health than not knowing. 
1	"Mostly I worry about how the doctor will perceive me and whther they judge my bad habits. I sometimes worry about getting bad news about my health but I think that is normal, and it will only increase as I get older. I worry that they will rush the appointment and not answer all of my questions as well. I have to check the time they come in for billing purposes because they will bill me for ""expanded visit"" which is supposed to be like 20 minutes but they stay for only 7-10 mins. This is unfair and I do worry about it."
-1	I'm am always nervous about anyone besides my husband touching me, esp being naked or exposed to them. Sometimes, even sharing intimate or personal information with new doctor makes me a little uneasy. 
-1	What makes me the most worried when i visit the doctor's office is the possibility of having negative results. Knowing that i take care of myself and am in good health, i should not as much but still. Things manifest in healthy people all the time.
-1	The cost of the office visit is the most painful part of the visit if you dont have any insurance. Dont no what else to add
-1	
1	I know that my specific concerns will likely not be addressed
-1	Try to give all the appropriate information (answer the doctors questions) that allows the doctor to make the right diagnosis
-1	I have no this filling when visiting the doctor's office. I'm confident in my doctor.
-1	Just the visit itself.  I can't really put my finger on what exactly it is.  I just don't like being there.  I don't like when they come in and talk to you like you;re friends.  We;re not, lets just get this medical stuff over with.
-1	I'm sometimes a little anxious about being physically examined by someone I don't know well. I'm sometimes a little worried that there might be something seriously wrong. And crowded waiting rooms and long wait times are stressful, so I don't look forward to that.
-1	Well since you are not in the medical field  you have to rely on the doctor for some answers , you can not be to sure
-1	If I am going to worry about attending a doctors visit, the thing that would make me the most nervous is not meeting or following through with their instructions.   Then having to face them, and explain why I didn't meet their goal or follow their advice.
1	Sometimes I'm afraid there might be something wrong with me that I don't know about yet. 
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office is not applicable because when I visit the doctors office I'm neither worried or anxious because I have unwavering faith and belief. That's just my honest outlook and approach to the whole medical thing, as should be everyone else's as well.
1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctors office.  This is not something that applies to me.
-1	I feel anxious that they'll find something else wrong with me. I hope that I'm doing the right things and that I don't walk away with unexplained tests or something else that I need to watch out for. 
-1	
1	That they'll not take me seriously, or they won't listen to my concerns and dismiss my fears.  When I tell them how I'm feeling they'll just brush it off as if it's nothing.  Then I'll walk out feeling as awful as when I walked in with no light at the end of the tunnel.
-1	I have an eating disorder, and if a doctor or nurse is new to me, I sometimes worry I'll get unwanted and unhelpful advice about diet and exercise. I don't like looking at the scale, either, for related reasons. 
1	I am most worried that the treatment I'm currently undergoing will no longer work, and that I'll have to try something new. I worry that I'll have questions I'll forget to ask my doctor until I get home, and won't be able to ask them at a later time.
1	I feel anxious when the doctor takes a long time to tell me whats wrong. I feel worried when I dont know what my problem is.
1	The only thing i fear is the doctor telling me some bad news and that i'm not heathly. I only worry about getting bad news.
1	not understanding the outcome, and whether or not the prescribed solution will create worse problems
-1	I am always a little hesitant when I go to the doctor because I very rarely go (other than annual exams). If I am there then it is for a valid reason. Perhaps that why I am usually a little hesitant and worried. I am worried about what they will tell me. I always have my children on my mind and worry about not being well enough to care for them. 
-1	I feel a little anxious to know if I have good news or bad news. Obviously I am hoping for some good news, but it doesn't always turn out that way.
-1	I'm not worried as much about the examition as I am about finding that there is something wrong with me. I always worry that I will have a bad disease or contract something that could be bad, even fatal for me.
1	I dont like talking about my problems with doctors because i feel like they are judging me even if theyre not. Im nervous that i wont be able to get what im hoping for
1	you don't want to get a new that you don't want to hear: therefore, a doctor's visit a always nerve rocking and anxious.
-1	Not too much makes me irreparably anxious when visiting the doctor's office. I don't like parts of examinations like pap smears, but I know preventative care is important and my doctor has never made me feel needlessly uncomfortable. 
1	I always fear the worst when I have a symptom or pattern of symptoms. As such, I am not so much anxious about the doctor in particular, but about learning about conditions I may have.
1	I am always worried that the doctor will find something bad.  Even though I know there is nothing I can do about it I am almost convinced every time I go in for a visit I will leave in a worse case scerio 
1	My biggest fear is getting blood taken, so I'm always petrified I'm going to have to have it done. It causes me a great amount of stress. Sometimes I'm worried I might be diagnosed with something I had no idea I had.
-1	A doctor who says nothing and you are trying to read their body language to gauge if you have a serious health problem.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor is finding out if there is something serious going on with my body, as well as not always knowing my exact medical health and finding out something terrible.
1	I just don't really like doctor's offices or hospitals in general. I worry that I will get some bad news though things are usually fine, but I worry a lot in general.
-1	There is nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I am very confident that I am healthy.
-1	
1	I worry that something could be very wrong.  I could potentially be diagnosed with a terrible disease like cancer.  To me, it's just the fact that my day could have been going very well, and that could be changed with a few sentences.  I get concerned that something could have been wrong with me for a while, and that it might be too late to be reversed.
-1	I feel nervous when something is physically wrong with me and I have no idea what it is. I get nervous when I know it could be a costly visit as well. 
-1	i would like to know what problems that linger because of my age and history and when i worry i don't like it because i fear it is more dangerouse than what it really is
-1	I feel most anxious when I'm going to have to have blood drawn. I have a thyroid disorder, so it's fairly often so they can check my TSH. I don't like needles and I am a lot better than I used to be, but I always get a little nervous about the stick.
1	I hate going to the doctor, I always have. I don't trust them. I'm afraid of what they might say or do, or if they might make me do something I don't want them to do. 
-1	That they are going to find some serious health issue.  I have not done enough to stay in goodhealth, i.e.,diet, exercise, lifestyle
-1	Its just the waiting time,bored earsdroppingand have to say what other people sayi listen to what other problems other people have
1	I never look forward to seeing what it says on the scale, to start. Then the pressure I feel about the decisions I make about my own health seem to come under scrutiny and that makes me extremely uncomfortable. I can't wait to be done with the appointment.
-1	There's a lot that I don't know when I go into a doctor's office, and I'm often concerned that I'm forgetting to say something that is relevant to my health. I don't know what is and isn't necessary to know, and the whole experience makes me aware of my own frailty and mortality in a way I usually am not.
-1	Cancer is always a fear and imaging scares me in case of that. After diagnosis where medications can help, I feel better.
-1	I feel the most anxious when I'm at the doctor's office and have to have blood tests. I usually end up getting light headed and fainting. I am terrible with blood and the nurse must give me some smelling salts to get me back. It's terrible, i'm the most queazy person on earth and it is so embarrassing. I am trying to overcome my fears.
-1	I do not feel anxious at all when visiting a doctors office for normal reasons. They tend to be good at diagnosing and treating conventional illnesses. I just do not trust them with anything beyond that really. The only other reason I may be anxious is if it is flu season. The last two times I have had the flu, I caught it at the doctors office seeking treatment for something else. 
-1	The only thing that really makes me feel anxious is when I'm awaiting test results.  I generally feel pretty calm.
-1	I feel anxious if I have to have blood drawn, or a shot. I don't like needles. Otherwise, I am rarely nervous.
-1	My tests will show something is wrong.  I will have a relapse or my levels will come back showing something is off or not right
-1	I don't usually feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. Leave my mind clear to be able to understand the conversation I will have with my medical provider. 
-1	I feel anxious or worries when I have to wait a long time. I worry when I have to take additional tests or when I am asked a lot of questions about things that may appear unrelated. 
-1	When I visit my doctor's office, I'm rarely anxious though the blood pressure thing is a bit of a challenge.  I have learned that the cuff can be too small and if I'm running late, I can be a bit anxious which can change the results.  I never worry about, well anything now.  I worried about one thing in my life once upon a time.  I fixed that so now, I worry about nothing!
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when at my doctor but when it is a doctor I don't know I do feel worried .I also feel worried when they perform a test and I need to wait for the results
1	I get anxious because I do not want to find out that i have something, like cancer or something. That is why.
1	My body not being healthy and knowing it might not be but that why I go to the drs is to find out what's wrong with me
-1	I am usually not anxious or worried about visiting the Dr.  I have had many procedures that would probably worry most people but I tend to take it in stride.
1	The uncertainty of results when visiting the doctor, unsure of the procedure. Worried that you may not receive the best news.
1	The unknown or un-noticed on my part that the doctor notices. Worried about getting bad news...or having something that is not so simple to deal with. 
-1	I do not like having blood work done. I hate needles and it makes me uncomfortable.  I also dislike going to my gynecologist. 
-1	If I have something wrong with me and I can't pinpoint exactly what it is I get a little bit worried, since it might be something serious.  I always get restless when I'm waiting to hear the information that the doctor will tell me. 
-1	I am most anxious that I will forget to mention something- or what most people probably feel- that they will receive some bad news. In general I keep healthy habits and have not received any bad news. I am 39 so generally I do not expect to hear bad news about my health as I have not so far.
-1	I really don't think like there's anything, since her and her office folks make me feel completely at ease. Possibly what my blood pressure is going to be.
-1	Not really much does.   I am a level headed person.  The only thing that would make me anxious is if I felt something was wrong, not with the care I actually receive.
1	I am concerned that I will ne mis-diagnosed, or that I will go to the doctor, and they won't be able to do anything to help me.
1	Not knowing what my conditions is and the long wait to see the doctor just for 3-4 minutes and they way overcharge you, health costs have got to come down, many americans cant afford regular doctor visits.
1	getting my child sick in case there is an illness that i pick up in the waiting room or something. or just getting my child to sit still to wait for the doctor. 
-1	The news I am going to get back if I'm having an issue, getting blood drawn or getting stuck with needles, plus being around sick people
1	From the beginning, when they leave you in the room alone after taking your basic vitals is nerve wracking. It's you alone in a room and you don't know if they've forgotten you and you constantly run through all the possible worst-case-scenarios in your mind. Being alone is the scary part. 
-1	The length of time I have to wait for my scheduled appointment time. Billing seems to be an issue a lot. I get frustrated with the lack of respect of my time.
-1	Nothing really does, unless I am there in pain or concerned about my health for some reason, that usually is not the case though.
1	I feel the most anxious when I have symptoms that I haven't been able to cure on my own and that's what's bringing me to the doctor's office in the first place. 
1	I worry that I won't be properly treated because of my race and the fact that I'm not good at explaining my symptoms because I get nervous around strangers.
-1	usually have no reason to be worried or anxious when visiting doctors office  my doctor always explain and expect me to have question for him
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, but I have prayed a lot before going to one. Going to get the results back from blood tests has made me feel a little uneasy, because I wondered what my primary care physician was going to tell me about the results, but I know that I am healed by the stripes of Jesus and I knew that I was going to be alright.  I think just waiting for the results and wondering what they are can cause a little bit of uneasiness. 
1	When visiting the doctor's office, I am afraid that I may get some news that could be very bad. I am also afraid that I may have not been following the doctor's orders as I should and he may be upset with me. I am also afraid of the costs that may be incurred.  I am also afraid of needles so the thought of a shot is upsetting. 
1	it makes me worried when i don't go as often as i should. So i know there is a possibility of being deficient in something that i could have prevented had i went like i was supposed to.
1	Not knowing what is going to happen. Worrying that there is something wrong with me. Not trusting the doctors.
1	Everything about going to the doctor gives me anxiety. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, so it can not really be helped. I am concerned that I will only hear bad news, or that the doctor will be cold and judgemental, or any other number of things that could be negative about the experience. 
-1	Unsure of what will happen. 
-1	telling me bad news that I don't want to hear such as cancer, diabetes, or some type of sexual disease. 
-1	The waiting in a close small space, although I am not claustrophobic.  
1	Because I feel like he doesn't really care if there is anything wrong with me he's just there to make money
-1	
-1	
1	It's really only certain types of exams that make me feel nervous and dreading the appointment. These are procedures that I find extremely uncomfortable, so I put them off. Often, I don't get them done. 
1	I worry that somehow she will find something wrong with me that could be serious. I also get nervous when explaining symptoms to my doctor and then to get overly anxious and sometimes cry. 
1	I am worried that I will have a more serious condition.  I know that I need to lose weight, which I have been working on since last summer, and have lost roughly 20 pounds since then.
1	As I get older, I feel that I'll start having more problems. It's always in the back of my mind and am a little uneasy until the tests/blood work comes back.
-1	Nothing really makes me all that anxious. Sometimes I dont like talking about my mental health issues like anxiety or depression because that just sucks. 
-1	I don't really mind going to the doctor it doesn't affect me usually. Unless I'm worried about something, but just going in for a checkup I'm usually fine
1	I guess it would be the waiting game. Waiting to get the test, then waiting for the results, waiting for the call that everything is fine, you hope and pray. 
1	I am always concerned that something will be wrong with me. I have and still do drink heavily. I am scared that one day something concerning those risks taken will be serious. 
1	I am sometimes anxious when I visit my doctor as I worry that something really bad could be wrong. I think most people probably feel the same way unless they are going in for something minor
-1	There is no benefit to worrying.  I completely agree and fully realize that most of my worries are ridiculous, but that does not make a difference; I still worry.  I've been trying to stop worrying my entire life.  It is uncontrollable. I have booked an appointment with my doctor, though I can already feel the anxiety building, and have been trying to distract myself.  I worry that he won't believe me, or something else.  It is embarrassing, and I feel bad about it.
-1	I just afraid of what they will say about my visit due to past hiccups. Most of the time it is all good.
-1	I worry about the test results.  I worry she will tell me something I don't want to hear.  But i trust she will give me all available options.
1	Always wonder if maybe he has some bad news after giving his examinations. Also going to a doctor is rare so i'm a bit nervous just interacting with him. If i go to the doctor it is generally because of some problem so i worry about that too.
1	Basically I go when I have problems . So not knowing the issues makes it worse. I feel threatened because of how uncertain everything is.  
1	Just to know what I'm entitled to or that I can receive there services and that I won't be turned down for any reason
-1	waiting for my appointment is a very stressful situation. The longer i wait, the more anxious i become. As i become more stressed and anxiety builds, the waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me to become even more stressed.
1	Sometimes i just dont want to be at the doctors or even hear what a doctor has to say sometimes i just put off going to the doctor
1	I feel anxious or worried in case something is seriously wrong. Although it is not better to be blind to an issue when it is time to visit a doctor, the fear of the unknown leads to more worry than just putting it off. 
1	I'm afraid of receiving bad news about my health
1	No real reason other than that I am diabetic and am always afraid my A1C will be too high and I will need more serious treatment.
1	Needles, blood and going to the doctors really stress me out. I can withstand pain, but seeing blood and needle scare me a lot. The thought of the needle piercing through my skin and drawing my blood out. I had a complete check out at one time long ago to determine the cause of my vertigo. My primary care doctor sent me to this lab. They took 4 tubes of blood from me. The worse part, they told me not to eat anything prior to the blood drawn. I almost faint. I was dizzy, and feel like vomiting. The nurse me to laid down and rest afterward. It was so crazy. 
1	when they do see you its in and out . they don't really evaulate you like they should. and sometimes they get pretty mean and rude with me as well and i don't like it when they are like that
-1	"Sometimes, you never know what to expect. Especially, when you have already ""self-diagnosed"" yourself, it is scary. "
1	I feel anxious sometimes the not knowing what the results of the test could be and if there is any change from the last time
1	have a great deal of worry over my weight; dental problems; and financial issues, which are all ongoing.
1	i am an anxious nervous sort of person. no matter what it is. grocery shopping. walking down the street, appointments. im always scared and on guard. 
-1	That a symptom is more than I thought it was. That they're going to judge me for something and give me worse care. That they'll do something that my insurance doesn't cover and I won't realize it until I get a huge bill.
1	I'm a deeply anxious person! I'm anxious when I do anything. I worry the doctor will tell me something bad.
-1	What makes me anxious or worried is fear of the unknown.  What will she find?  Is there something wrong with me?  And what might the consequences be of any illness.  Basically, fear of the unknown.  I don't fear getting scolded for bad health behavior.
1	This is easy, I am always worried about cancer or some unknown thing that will kill me. I am constantly asking questions, trying to understand everything and then making sure without a doubt that I am either fine or take steps to get better.
1	The alone time in the doctor's office is what makes me the most nervous. Usually when you show up you wait in that room for 30+ minutes alone. It is very cold in there, and usually the rooms are a plain white color. I become especially worried after a blood test/physical/etc when the doctor says they will return shortly and I am left alone again.
1	Cause I am always scared they are going to find more wrong with me than what i came in to visit the doctor for
-1	I don't usually feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. The only thing that might worry me would be the discovery of a negative health condition or disease.
1	My doctor is very blunt, so when I go to him I am a little nervous. He will tell me if I gained weight and he will usually talk about it with me constantly throughout the visit.  I'm usually worried that he will tell me that there is something seriously wrong with me. Thats been my fear for awhile. I just hate sitting in the office because I feel like there are a lot of germs and I will get sick.
-1	ONE THING THAT MAKES ME ANGRY OR WORRIED IS ABOUT THE HEALTH TIPS WHENEVER THEY PROVIDE ME , BUT I FOLLOW THEM RARELY WITH THAT WHILE I GO FOR A CHECKUP I AM SACRED ONLY FOR THAT PURPOSE .
-1	i dont. i am healthy and i have a healthy lifestyle
-1	I dont feel either one of those about doctor visits honestly. I am usually calm and collected. There is no reason to be anxious or worried.
1	I sometimes worry extremely too much about my health because I'm overweight and depressed. I don't want to hurt my body anymore than I already do. I get nervous because I think my doctor will give me negative news about my condition. To be honest, I usually get positive news and I have worried for nothing.
1	I do not like being naked in front of anyone other than my husband, so there are negative feelings around that. Also, there is always the possibility of bad news.
1	No reason. I just get nervous about everything. There isnt a specific reason. I get nervous about every single thing they do. 
1	If I am at the doctor's office for a routine checkup I usually feel fine. If I am there for a problem, I sometimes worry about what the diagnosis will be, such as what is the exact problem, cause, and how long it will last. I tend to worry a lot about physical pain when I have an injury, and worry that it might not heal properly, or that I might be in pain for a long time.
-1	I DON'T OFTEN VISIT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE FOR MYSELF.  WHEN I DO GO TO A DOCTOR IT IS BECAUSE I AM EXPERIENCING AN ACUTE ILLNESS THAT IS NOT GOING AWAY WITH SELF CARE SUCH AS THE FLU.  I FEEL ANXIOUS BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IS WRONG AND MUST USUALLY BE GUIDED INTO CONCLUSIONS.
-1	  Whenever, i go to the doctor, i know that, i am going to be diagnosed so the situation is a very uncomfortable for me because, i'm scared of the results of the test.
1	I have white coat syndrome. Going to the doctor's no matter what it is for makes me anxious or worried. I feel my blood pressure raising. There could be nothing wrong, but a cold and I still get all worked up.
1	The possibility that I will have a serious health problem. Also there is the possibility of embarrassment.
1	I'm very overweight, and I worry about disappointing my doctor because I haven't lost any.
1	I always get worried when i get lab results from my doctor. I become anxious when provided a blood sample.
-1	I think I'm always just worried about what they are going to find out next. After all is said and done I feel all the anxiety is gone.
-1	The past experiences with my doctor. Howw she views me. Something i think u views me as more of a number than a perso n.
-1	I am afraid they will find something wrong with me.  I don't want to find out a have an expensive or deadly issue.
1	Only when I have unexplained symptoms am I anxious. If I have been unable to treat something I tend to over react.
1	I get anxious and worried every time I visit the doctor. I'm not quite sure what it is to be exact of the reason that I'm so afraid, but I think that it has a lot to do with me being afraid that something is going to go wrong. When I'm worried, my blood pressure usually shoots up from me worrying a lot. I feel so much dread when going to the doctor. 
1	These issues were not a result of my current doctor, but one in the past.  He made me feel very unsafe and vulnerable by his predatory behavior.  He asked inappropriate questions, and I did not know how to get away from him, however, I did refuse to see him again, and I told them why.
-1	Only if I have not been feeling well  and I am not sure what the doctor might find. There is a lot of Cancer and Heart problems in my family.
1	What makes me feel really anxious or worried about going to the doctor's office is the thought of being poked with needles, along with having to receive a bad report on a diagnosis of having to perform surgery on me or the possibility of some terminal disease that they just can't cure. And after it's  all done, then there's having to pay a rather sizable hospital bill that I'm concerned about not being able to pay on time. Which could result in my reluctance to get examined the next time I'm scheduled for an appointment.
1	I have  no fears  when I  go to my doctor  for  any  appointment    procedures. I have  complete  confidence in my  family  doctor
1	when the doctor recommend and prescribes a drug that has interactions with other drugs that i am taking and his nurse warns him and he says give it to him anyway
-1	I go to the doctor when I am sick. I have never been for a wellness check or a physical. So I am already in at least some discomfort. I just want the problem to go away. Being sick in a place with other sick people is not comforting at all. I just want an answer. I know that the course of drugs will take a week or longer to really start working. So it all takes so long.
-1	I just don't enjoy people poking and prodding me. Even worse is that you're paying to be poked and prodded. They usually don't seem very confident in what they are doing or why they are doing it, It feels very impersonal almost like you're a car at a mechanics shop and not a living breathing human with thoughts and emotions.
1	That the tests will show the development of some serious illness.  And a worry that the person taking my blood will have difficulty drawing the necessary samples (this has happened several times -- and it is a blasted nuisance).
1	The only thing that would make me feel worried was if I was really sick or though that a really bad diagnosis was on it's way.   Not knowing what is wrong is the main worry that I would have.
1	"Discovering something unknown. Or something that I could have prevented but did not. I just have general ""white coat hypertension"""
-1	Just the out-of-routine occurance. A visit to the doctor is not a normal daily occurance for me.
-1	Nothing really anymore.  In the past it use to be getting on the scale, but now it does not bother me.
-1	I get anxious when I speak with my doctor about problems and she asks me for further details because it's hard for me to explain things.
1	to find out what is wrong with me and sometimes I don't want to hear the truth because it will have me overthinking about it
-1	Hoping their will be nothing wrong. Praying not to have to wait to long to see the doctor. Confident the nurse will have a smile and show concern.
1	They might found something wrong and it might not be curable I would like a female doctor I am shy of anyone looking at my body
1	That they are going to tell me something I already know and not prescribe me what I really need. Or I really get nervous when blood work has to be done because I'm scared of needles.
1	when my brainscans come back and I'm finding out the results
-1	again its not really about being worried when I go to the doctor.its about just not really trusting anyone to really know my body are health condition to really know whats going on with me.most of the time I try to just hope for the best and donmt worry
1	I always hope they do not find anything wrong with me.  I also do not like having my weight checked because I know I need to work on it.
1	I'm never anxious or worried when I go to visit the doctor. Its never really nothing bad when I go. I believe I will always walking out of the doctors office with somewhat good news.
1	Just the uncertainty of it all. Not knowing if what's wrong with me is serious or mind running away with it all. Thankfully almost every time I thought there was something serious wrong with me it turned out to be nothing. But I have bad anxiety and a panic disorder so it's the worry and not knowing that makes it hard for me to deal with. Once I leave there though I usually feel fine and relieved.
1	I have a really bad anxiety disorder that makes it hard to cope with that situation. Also, if a new nurse is involved who doesn't know me well, it is hard to cope with. 
-1	If I'm just going for a regular check-up, I'm not worried at all. However, if something is bothering me, I tend to think the worst, so I do get anxious. It usually turns out to be nothing, and I've worried my self for no reason, but that's my personality. I'm always worried that whatever I'm dealing with is something bad. It can never be simple.
-1	What I worry about the most when I visit the doctors office is that when I go there that the doctor might say that there is something wrong with my health condition.
-1	"I don't typically go to the doctor for checkups, I only go when there is an issue. So I am always a little hesitant and worried something serious could be wrong. I have had ""good luck"" so far, but you never know what may be happening next."
-1	Due to my anxiety, I just get worried about going out some places in general. The doctor's is one of those places because I am always worried about what is going on with my body. 
-1	If I have something that I know has been bothering me for a while that could potentially be major then I worry a little more about it.  If it's just a routine ache then I don't let it get to me at all.  However, if it is something that is deeper say in the chest or stomach area that could be serious then I'm more likely to worry.
-1	Family history of blood pressure issues. This always crosses my head as I been told that while my blood pressure is still within the normal range , it is in the higher borderline. The second this that pops to my head is that you never really know if everything is 100% fine. You may feel fine but may still be sick.
-1	Nothing, I visit the doctor's office with they hope that they can resolve my issue, not worried that they'll make it worse.
1	Being scolded for my weight. I know the doctor is looking out for my own good. Really need to get over these issues.
1	Of course, I worry that I may have a serious disease. I feel I might forget some of the questions I have. I am not sure the doctor can help me with some problems.
-1	I am anxious over  the fact of trusting this person or not. Today's doctors care more about what pill they can prescribe over actually doing some work.
-1	I don't feel worried most of the time it the waiting that I hate just sitting waiting for your turn. Most of my visits are well visits
-1	just the wait always makes me anxious. 
-1	
-1	I always concerned that I will be diagnosed with a new medical condition and more medicine I will be required to take
1	There is always a feeling of unknown when visiting the doctor's office. Even if I feel healthy, there's always a little doubt that something could be wrong. That's where the anxiety and worry comes from.
1	I am always worried about what the doctor will say.  I was diagnosed with MS while on a family vacation and now trips to the doctor's office are a bit more scary and uncertain.
-1	My biggest worries at the doctor's office are things like my weight an blood pressure.  Doctors very rarely give me any reason to feel anxious about their care.  I do not enjoy routine blood work or shots.
-1	i feel most anxious when they call you for follow up if something went wrong. im worried about found a medical condition that can kill you. 
1	Doctors make me a little nervous. It can be a little scary, but usually not too bad. I am just relieved when I am done.
-1	I'm usually in the doctor's office when I'm not feeling well. The thought of having something life threatening or harmful to other puts me on edge. Thus making me anxious and worried about the outcome.
-1	Well , I know I need to lose weight and exercise and I know doctors will lecture that all I have. Nothing else  I can say
1	I am always worry if i will come down with some dreaded disease or the doctor will find something wrong with me
-1	Results from tests or exam. Reaction from test results, being negative or something unexpected. Constant emphasis on things like stop smoking. 
-1	"Until recently it was the worry that I would be frog-marched through another hideous colonoscopy ordeal.  Thanks be to God, it has recently been decided (and the doc concurs) that, absent specific symptoms, those my age and older can skip ""routine"" colonoscopy due to cost-benefit evaluation and in light of the difficult/increasing physical burden posed on the aging by rigorous draining preparation.  Having fainted (alone) last time around, still poorly prepped and getting a clean bill of colon health, the specialist'd already told me this but my primary care doctor was going strictly by the number of years since the last such ordeal."
1	When I go to the doctor, I often think if I happen to have something that is not yet discovered in me as those silent diseases that makes me feel anxious
-1	There is nothing at all that worries me. My Dr., is a great gal. she is a gem , and I trust her completely. What a doll baby
1	the sick will be very painful if the doctor told you that make you worried and afraid from Diagnosing like disaster understand and process these emotions often falls in the hands of parents, who by their own admission often feel painfully concerned, overwhelmed and unprepared to deal with these kinds 
1	I am usually worried that something will hurt. I also donât like that Iâm usually in some form of undress. It makes me uncomfortable. 
-1	I just pray that my cancer does not come back. I try to exercise (walk the stairs) when I am able or dance when I'm at my part time work as an usher to get my body moving. I also eat as healthy as I should by juicing every morning. Sometimes that is not enough so I get anxious.
-1	Because my dad died of cancer at a relatively young age, I always have in the back of my mind that the same thing could happen to me, and am relieved when I have a positive outcome.
-1	Being in hospitals. The sounds, the smell, the sights. I guess it goes back to when I was young, every time I went to the doctor as a kid something was wrong. I guess some of that anxiety cared over to my adult years. 
1	I am anxious and worried that something more serious may be wrong with me than I think. I am embarrassed to talk about certain things with my doctor. I just want to get the exam over and done with because I don't like to be looked at and touched. 
1	What makes me most anxious is the fear or thought that there may be something seriously wrong with me and that it will be deadly.
1	The entire time. I don't just go for anything, but when I do it is usually serious. They have a tendency to treat people like cattle, and that makes it all the worse for an anxious person.
1	I am most worried about examinations which may be physically painful or uncomfortable, as this has necessarily been a common occurrence for me lately. I am also a reserved person, and therefore may feel physically or even emotionally vulnerable in these moments. This is particularly true if my condition is a source of embarrassment to me, such as a urinary tract infection. I may also be anxious about forgetting to ask a clarifying question in the moment, or otherwise missing the opportunity to inform myself or give the doctor helpful information which can lead to more effective treatment.
1	Needles, having something wrong with me, having a doctor do something rude or inappropriate to me.......
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried is going in there paying my co-pay and them not listen to me.  I do not go to the doctors if there really is not a problem.  I do not like going to the doctors.  So I get worried every time I go there because it is more than likely them not listening to my problems again.
-1	As I am over 40 now the chance for things to pop up have increased. I feel anxious if the doctor wants to do blood tests to rule out whatever. 
-1	Generally, I don't feel anxiety when I go to the doctor.  I take very good care of myself and I have good sense of when something is wrong.  It is only in those moments where I don't know what is behind a mystery ache or pain that I feel anxious.  
-1	I am most anxious that i will get bad new at the doctor such as high blood pressure or something else going wrong. I usually do not have any issues once i am there but the lead up to going to the doctor makes me very anxious and worried. 
1	look this is suppose to be a survey not a essay contest enough with the writing questions my doctor is just fine no problems, ok
-1	I hate social interaction the most. I don't care about the results, because I know that I'm in good shape and doing everything correctly.
1	WHAT ILLNESS I MY HAVE WHAT MY BP WILL BE  CHOLESRAL LEVELS UP OR NIGHT FINDING SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
1	Sometimes when going into the Dr's office with symptoms that seem like they maybe severe I become anxious while waiting for the exam and tests to determine my issue.  I also get anxious because it seems like the dr always wants to discuss worst possible issues first.
-1	What makes me anxious is when they may find something I knew nothing about because it showed no symptoms but most of the time im really just comfortable
-1	The reason I feel anxious or worried while visiting the doctors is because I generally only go if I am having problems so I'm turn I usually am thinking the worst diagnosis possible. 
-1	Just that I would rather be somewhere else.  I am usually OK, but there is always that thought that they might find something.  But then again, that is a good thing because then we can treat it.
1	When I have to get a cancer screening or something of that nature done. I really get worried when my kids or loved ones visit the doctor to be honest.
-1	Sometimes when I don't feel like I can quite specifically or accurately describe what's going on. When I feel like my concerns are too vague.
1	That they will find something wrong with me that is very serious, or that I won't be able to afford to take care of, or that the something won't be covered by insurance.  I think the latter 2 reasons are somewhat unlikely.
1	If it is a routine office visit I'll likely not be anxious or worried since I don't anticipate any unpleasant surprises. If the appointment is due to a new or on-going problem I'm most worried about whether or not there is an easy solution to this particular health issue.
1	The vaccine debate always gets me a bit nervous. Also, when trying to explain what is going on with me I do not always feel as if they are willing to help me find the proper treatment.
1	That something will be seriously wrong
-1	I am always anxious that anything I have that is bothering me will turn out to be something serious and untreatable. I always worry that I have cancer or will develop it at some point, because both my parents died of cancer. Although all my doctor visits are basically well visits, I still worry he will find something serious.
1	I'm most anxious when waiting around. If there are test results in limbo, etc. My general experience is relief when I take care of whatever issues are at play.
-1	The thing that I'm the most worried about is having to get extra things done like labs where they take blood or running tests because my insurance doesn't cover squat so I have to pay for everything out of pocket.
-1	The only thing that makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is when my blood pressure is high.
-1	I dont like when people touch me.. and even though i know him, i dont know him on a personal level like that. plus the germs at the doctor really bother me. 
-1	How much the cost is going to be, and what my blood pressure is - although that seems to get me worked up and drive it up more, ha.
-1	I worry about the cost of things sometimes and if things will be more expensive than what i am expecting
-1	I don't feel worried when going to the doctor I feel safe that she will take great care of me and respect my privacy
-1	The only thing that I worry about when I go are basically health problems that are new and I really hate going to the OBGYN because it's uncomfortable.
-1	Just the fact that I could come up with a medical condition that is dangerous and I don't like hearing that kind of news about myself
-1	While I am in generally good health, I am overweight and that leads me to wonder if there is something in my health status that might be a problem.  I try to eat right and exercise regularly and, generally, only go to the doctor if I have symptoms that I have not experienced before or are something I can't handle myself.  If I am at the doctor, something is wrong and that makes me a bit anxious.
1	I believe what can make me feel anxious or worried about the doctor's office visit is the doctor saying or seeing something that might be off or being diagnosed with something that you did not see coming.
1	Getting my blood pressure taken is what makes me feel the most anxious. I get anxious that my blood pressure will be high, which then leads to my blood pressure being high.  
-1	That something will be found that I hadn't expected.  You never know what blood work may find.  I also hate needles, i.e flu shot.
1	I'm anxious because of the news I will get. I'm worried about the amount of time it will take and how long before I'm seen
1	When I am examined for anything the thing that makes me the most anxious is the possible results, regardless of the likelihood of a poor outcome.
1	I am always afraid now that the Doctor will mess up and diagnose wrong and cost me or my family our lives. 
-1	Pain, I have several chronic conditions and by the time she is donevwith me I have a lot of pain from the exam
1	That the doctor is going to find or determine that I have an issue or condition I was uware of or not expecting.
-1	
-1	I never feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. Even if the appointment is to discuss test results. I am confident if that there is a health issue of concern, my doctor has researched the best possible demerits to present to me.
-1	I'm worried that I may have a terrible medical condition that I didn't know about. I worry especially worry about my mental health. It's a subjective area and I don't want to be given medication that will worsen the depression. 
1	Most people are afraid of being told something is wrong, by their doctor. It's human nature to avoid this.
-1	I don't feel anxious or nervous 
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious. I go there with complete faith and trust in God.I have no concerns. I am there to prevent things that may cause anxiety
-1	Generally, I'm not really a worrier, but if I were to worry about anything, I would worry most about learning that there is something wrong with me that is not easy to fix.
-1	I worry sometimes that the doctor will find something that is wrong with me and need to do other procedures to help me get better.
1	I worry about getting really bad news one day. I worry the doctor will find some condition or disease that has cause irreversible damage.
-1	The main thing I don't like going through is a breast exam and/or a pelvic exam. I would imagine both of those are slightly uncomfortable for almost all women. I know they have to be done though, so I manage to get through them whenever they are needed.
-1	I never feel anxious or worried we trust our doctor completely as he is very committed to his patients 
-1	I was most anxious and worried about my own health, especially when I wasn't sure what could possible go wrong with me and before a new symptom was diagnosed and confirmed by the doctor.  
1	I often feel as if they do not have enough tomr for the patient anf it is all about the Dr amd being a person of color and a women they often trear you like your stupid.
1	 I am always worried that he is going to find a problem and I worry that my blood pressure is going to be very high as I have a lot of problems with my blood pressure
1	I'm afraid I may be sick and he may not be able to help me or I may not be able to afford the care I need and he will not help me because of these reasons
1	I feel anxious about time itll take to diagnose. Im concerned about outcome and treatment. Im concerned abput the drs day n patient care and the dr well being which may affect the care i receive. However im optimistic and have prayed prior regarding visit in terms of facility receptionist nurse tech dr instruments and most aspects of visit
1	Just whatever is going to be found. I've had a bad medical history lately and it always seems like I'm going to have some huge medical problem.
-1	I don't feel anxious when I go to the doctor because right know my health is okays so I'm good right now
-1	Not knowing sometimes i feel anxious&lt;but I try to calm down and trust God cause being in a anxious mindset is dangerous.
-1	That I may have to have a shot.
1	A lot of times my concerns and symptoms are dismissed, and I am rushed out of the office.  It feels like my doctor is only there to put out fires and deal with absolute emergencies.  With smaller issues/pains that could potentially develop into something worse, she doesn't have the energy to investigate or deal with them.  The same attitude is prevalent with other doctors I've seen.
-1	i hate needles, proceduresâ¦.it  makes me queasy just thinking about itâ¦i psych  myself up for once a year bloodworkâ¦.and i try not to act like 5 year old when i go for a check upâ¦..
-1	There is actually not much that scares me. I know I have a light heart condition and moderate CAPD. But I know also that I have quality healthcare and that this healthcare is available when I need it. I have regular check-ups and have cardiac training 3 times per week.
1	I do not like getting needles from the doctors office. Whether it be a shot or blood drawn. I am terrified of pain, so it has kept me away from the doctors office awhile.
-1	I feel most anxious while I am waiting for test results to come back. Most often they are not bad news but it is the waiting that gets to me.
-1	really the only things that bother me is how long do I have to wait in the waiting room, and how long will I be in the exam room before I see the doctor. after 45 minutes the last time I opened the door and ask a nurse if they had forgot me, she was very rude and now they treat me like I am the enemy.
1	Nothing in particular about visiting the doctor, except for the last one I visited. (I tend to be a bit high strung or anxious, anyway; I have chronic clinical depression.)
-1	The people inside the office give me that feeling of being worried.The results of my visit is also a feeling .
-1	I'm just a anxious person in general but when I got the dr I don't feel that way about their decisions.
1	I've had exams by very rude and impatient ER doctors before that made me feel less than human. 
1	How long the affair is going to take. How poor the doctor's bedside manner is going to be. How much of my problem's they'll casually write off as being about my weight and nothing more. Whether or not they'll believe me about problems I'm having.
-1	I'm mostly worried if I have no idea what the problem might already be. I usually have an idea of what the issue is before I go and the uncertainty, when I have it, is difficult.
1	Wording what could be wrong and wording how to treat this also wording about the meds and side affects 
1	What makes me feel the most anxious or worried in a doctor's office would be the fact that they will be giving me news on something I don't wanna hear or they are telling me I'm going to have to give labs and give blood.
-1	That fact that there may be something  going on with me that I do not know anything about. Also I'm scared of needles. 
-1	That there may be some serious condition with me
1	im afraid they will tell me something bad or tell me that im unhealthy because of my weight or vitals
1	Not knowing the results. That the doctor night find something wrong with me. Either cancer or something of the sort. 
1	When I have symptoms I don't understand and am not sent for tests or when tests are done don't get the results unless I call the office.  To me no news is not good news.  I always would like to hear back about new problemâs.
1	Not knowing what to expect when meeting with a new doctor. This applies to meeting new people in general, especially those with some authority (ex.: new boss).  Meeting new people always makes me a bit nervous.
1	Obviously that there is a serious condition. I rarely go to the doctor, so if I'm there I am likely in a lot of pain and in a state of worry. So while I am there I am thinking about what could possibly be wrong.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried. I am totally calm and at ease. Going to the doctor is a wonderful experience.
-1	Actually I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit my doctor.  But I guess if I didn't know him too well or was going to someone for the first time, I might not be as sure about how things would go.
1	Not knowing results of tests for extended amounts of time. Some tests such as cultures take as long as 8 weeks. 
-1	That they make a recommendation that I disagree with. Or that they can find something I did not know about
1	Most things caused me a certain degree of anxiety on a daily basis, for I possess generalized anxiety and cope with this as I best can each day.
1	I worry a lot. I worry that something big will be wrong with me. I often worry that I will get very sick
-1	Just seeing whether or not I am fully healthy.
-1	That they will catch something unusual in my exam or do not know what is wrong with me when i am feeling sick
1	because I never know what the test gonna say when they come back so that along make me feel anxious.
1	I really feel pretty calm when I'm at the doctor. Very confident . I really haven't had any kind of major issue
-1	I rarely get anxious when visiting a doctor, unless there is something I have noticed that seems abnormal and can't get a sold answer from medical journals and I make a special appointment.  If the doctor deems more tests are required, I do become anxious, because I don't want to deal with any new problems or prescribed more medications.
1	In a few sentences, I can explain and describe what makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. Getting on the weight scale and getting a pap smear makes me nervous and anxious. 
-1	I never feel worried about going to the doctors. I am going there to be healed so not anxious at all. Maybe a little worried about the price but not seeing them
-1	I worry a lot about the cost. Medical care is so expensive, even with insurance, and there's no way to know how much things cost until the EOB arrives.
-1	Just if something is wrong. I don't want to be unhealthy or discover a bad problem. 
-1	The first thing that makes me anxious is getting on the scale. I dread that more than anything, and also I get very worried about cost because I am self pay.
-1	I'm only anxious or worried because I know I haven't been taking care of myself the way I should, and so I'm anxious to hear what the doctor will say about my health.
-1	only if tests came back positive.my doctor has the ability to make me feel confident & relaxed with her.
-1	I get anxious because I am afraid that the dr. will find something wrong with me that I did not know about. 
-1	I would feel more anxious or worried if someone tried to push or force something on me.  Also, if that person was unkind or rude.
-1	I am not too anxious when going to my doctor, that is, about the physical exam. I do have social anxiety, so for the most part I am nervous around all people and social situations. So sometimes talking one on one and being physically examined makes me anxious, but it's not the doctor's fault.
1	I really don't like doctors offices, hospitals, etc because they seems cold, scary, and knowing that there are so many other sick people around me, potentially, creeps me out. 
-1	I never feel this way when I go to the doctor. I trust this doctor, so is no need to be worried. He is a great doctor.
1	I am not e needle person. In fact my chart lets the nurses know I have a hard time with needles. I have high blood pressure, and have to get my blood drawn every now and then, so I worry about that.
-1	I think the thought that something is wrong worries me the most but overall I am not concerned about seeing the doctor. 
1	 im upset as she don't know anything about lupus, I have seen her for 10 yrs and she don't even remember me
1	I feel anxious when I visit the doctors office because I don't know what response I am going to receive. 
1	The comments the doctor will make about my body or lifestyle. The needle for the blood test and the results.
-1	Uncertainty about a diagnosis that I am concerned about. It's hard not to let information on the internet cloud your judgment, which can lead to anxiety about a diagnosis.
1	What they may or may not find.  If something is truly wrong with me.  If they misdiagnose a problem.  Prescribing drugs/medication that I do not need.
-1	
-1	I am generally not too anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because of the strong relationship I have with my physician. What would make me most anxious is if I'm seeing the doctor for an ongoing illness that is severe and am dreading a diagnosis of a major disease/cancer. 
1	If I'm worried about money what my bill is going to cost me. Also it depends on the procedure that has to be done
-1	when i know they could be wasting my time on something, but i have a great family doctor and it's his referrals that are no so good
-1	What makes me worried is that I'll find out something is way worse than I think because I waited so long to actually see my primary care physician and that it'll be so late. 
-1	I am mostly anxious about the diagnosis. I also get anxious about being left in the examination room for a long period of time before getting seen. It almost becomes claustrophobic to the point that I need to get up and open the door.
1	when I go to the doctor they take a long time and I have to go buy fast food because I get out so late that's why I don't understand why I have an apportiment and get seen late
1	I guess I just do not want to hear any negative information. Being in a doctors office feels a little cold and sterile. The environment encourages you to feel nervous and a little jittery. 
-1	Very little when going to my primary care physician. I like the center that I go to. I see the staff as friends. It is never a very long wait. However, when I need to go for a blood draw, that requires fasting, I hate that. I hate fasting. I am also at an age when I should have a coloscomy (spelled wrong). I hate anything intrusive especially tubes going into any part of my body.
-1	the fear of the unknown, especially at my age, is what makes me worried.  Everyone has the fear of cancer.
1	I am a young guy with an old guy's problem. I have a high pain tolerance and have been dealing with my ailment for at least 10 years. Most doctors don't seem to believe me when i say i am in almost unbearable pain. I feel like doctors think i'm lying about my problems to get painkillers which is not the case. I fantasize about the day when I won't need to take any medication. I get very anxious when describing my symptoms and lack of healing or improvement because I feel defensive every time i see a doctor,.
1	I think doctors often seem to guess at what is going on with their patients, though it is an informed guess, they may not be making a careful assessment of their patients health and rely a little too heavily on previous experience to the extent where they may not recognize or are dismissive of other symptoms. They can often seem resigned to a bad outcome, and at the same time be uninformative about what is going on.
-1	I just know when I leave I will have paid $30 bucks for nothing.  I will be no better off than when before I went in and visited the doctor.
-1	That my doctor will find something wrong with me that can not get cured. Or that I will have a disease that would make me die in a short period of time
1	What makes me more anxious and worried is when it takes too long. And you have to wait and they not letting you know anything about whats going on about you
1	The fear that something adverse may be discovered. Also the existential feeling of a lack of control over a possible health issue.
1	I always think of worst case scenarios like cancer of some other severe conditions. I tend to think that every symptom points to cancer.
1	When it comes to visiting the doctor the thing that makes me the most worried is simply not knowing how things will you. I hate that there is a possibility that I can get some really bad news that would cost me financially, physically or mentally. It's very nerve racking. 
-1	It's mostly wondering about if I actually have a condition that is wrong with me. It doesn't have much to do with them being a shady doctor.
-1	Not a lot of things make me feel anxious or worried because I simply don't let them. I let things go by the flow and hope for the best most of the time and it lowers my stress with helps with other health benefits. Keeping positive helps the mind and body.
-1	
-1	They have to take blood by needle and I do not like any needles going into my body in any way. I usually always get a little worried that my weight might not be what it should be.
1	I worry that the doctor won't listen to my concerns or do anything to help me, or that he still won't diagnose my chronic health issues yet again.
-1	I'm overweight and struggle with body image A LOT. I'm worried they'll say something that will make me hate my body even more. 
-1	I think just being in the doctors office it seems to raise my blood pressure that doesn't rise when taken in the dental office or when I give blood donations.  
1	The fact that I would ever be in a position to where I would have to visit a doctor for anything.
1	Because I don't know if there going to tell me something bad has happened or if something went wrong. It would make anyone worried what's so great about going to a doctor's office noting
-1	I have children so I think what makes me feel so anxious about visiting the doctors office is what I could potentially find out. I tend to think the worst.
1	I am always anxious when it comes to an office setting. I feel like there could be anything wrong with anyone at any certain time and that is nerve wracking. I fear that I will hear the worst and have to go under surgery or something like that. 
1	Just the not knowing if anything unexpected may show up in some kind of test or blood work.  You just never know when some type of medical problem that is unexpected happens.
1	I think the waiting and the silence and the checking off of boxes makes me anxious for the same reason anyone evaluating me would make me anxious.
-1	Mostly just when I have to get shots or have tihngs happen that might hurt in some way. Normal things are completely fine
-1	uncertain of what my problem might turn out to be. Not being able to take the medication proscribed. My body has a hard time adjusting to some medications. So I may have to try two or three to find the one I can take. This has proved hard to do during my life. I have had some bad reactions from previous medications. 
-1	I must have read the question wrong because I do not feel any of those emotions. I just simply made a mistake when I read the question. I feel very confident with my family Doctor. I do believe I read the question properly because I do not feel any of the emotions listed So I went back to reread the question and I did read it properly. 
1	Mainly I worry that my good luck has finally run out and they find a major medical issue that has to be dealt with.  Possible crippling financial costs of a discovered medical issue causes me considerable worry.
1	The fear something is wrong and I'm not prepared for the results. I feel if the results are bad, I will not be able to mentally handle it. 
-1	Not applicable; I don't feel at all worried or anxious about visiting the doctor's office and your minimum answer lengths are not helpful either.
-1	I rarely, if ever feel negative when visiting the doctor' s office. There is no reason to feel nervous or anxious. The 
-1	Having to do an unexpected procedure that either is somewhat painful or time consuming. Having to wait to see the doctor. 
-1	I am not usually anxious, but I guess it does cross my mind occasiolly that she may find something wrong during an exam.
1	Just the overall atmosphere tends to get to me. It's never set well with me, and I doubt that it ever will.
-1	My biggest fear is that he would find something really wrong and need me to come back for further treatment. I guess that's a good thing in general, as I would be identifying a health problem... so I guess the anxiety would come from the possibility of having that problem at all.
-1	I am not anixous or worried when I go to the doctors office, because I know he's going to tell me what is the problem and how to take care of it
1	That I am going to get bad news or that what I have been doing isn't working. I am always worried that my doctor is going to be disappointed in me which discourages me even more and is a reason I like to stay away from the doctors if I can 
1	Going to the doctor is always a nerve-wracking experience. You never know what news you could get after a health examition.
1	I feel concerned and worried that I might receive bad news when I go to to the doctor. I feel this way even when I have no reason to feel this way.
1	I feel anxious and worried when I am at the doctors office because I always worry of getting some disease that cant be cured or cancer I am sick all the time with ibs and I recently had hyplori I have alot of stomach issues and bowel issues so I always think of the worst outcome possible I am very anxious
-1	In the past I had struggled with Anxiety and Depression. I do not currently struggle with these issues and they have since been resolved. Due to the ture and cultural stigma relating to mental health it was somewhat difficult for me to deliver my concerns verbally to my doctor. This made me feel very anxious and worried before my appointment, but once I filly maged to communicate my concerns I was put at ease by my doctors professiolism and demeanor regarding the issues. He helped a great deal my overcoming this medical condition and now I no longer have these issues and no longer need medication for this.
-1	The results of my lab tests, especially my A1C test results, always cause me to have some anxiety.  
-1	I feel the most anxious or worried about what the unknown could be when I visit the doctor for an illness other than a cold. I wonder what could be the cause and if it is something serious. 
1	Well the only thing that make me worried or anything is when I know and feel my pain and the doctor's just may send you to get x rays to see if anything is broken but when they find out its not they just send you to physical therapy forgetting about what you are suppose to do in the mean time. Also sometimes im scared the people that are taking blood or giving a shot dont know what they are doing.
1	I have a severe case of white coat syndrome. As soon as I walk into the office I start sweating profusely. Strange because I am a doctor...
1	The Dr. knows best. But my family dr. seems to always find something wrong maybe cholesterol or diabetes I can't afford to be sick I have a heart condition and it takes all my payroll for that
-1	I'm sorry I don't have to brush my teeth cause you don't have a yyour yyyyyyyyy and you are not going back online shopping lol lol I love her so bad lol she was just kidding lol she is 
1	I feel this way because I do not know what the doctor is going to respond with after he alyzes my condition.  I am then feeling stressed because I will ultimately have to sift through the facts and determine how I want to proceed.  I get worried because I am afraid the doctor is going to provide a misdiagnosis or find something else wrong I may not have needed to know about at the time.
-1	I feel most anxious if I need to have test done and need to wait for the results. I feel most worried if I am called in for a follow up appointment that I was not expecting.
1	Because. None want to hear any bad news and I know that you are always suppose to positive when going in there due to the fact that GOD  is always on your side. 
1	You just never know what the doctor might think or suggest or tell you. Fear of bad news. I think it's natural to feel this way.
1	"Can I just repeat the word ""everything"" ten times? My health keeps getting more and more... interesting as time passes. Nobody knows why I can't walk more than a few feet. Nobody knows why I'm nauseated all the time. Or why I trip over my own shadow on a regular basis. After a while, you get really tired of doctors saying to you, ""Wow, that's really weird."""
-1	I worry that there could be something more wrong with many than there really is.
1	Because of all the things that I have been through I just know that he will find something else I do not want to know about but should. I have had over 10 surgeries and am on blood thinners for pulmonary embolism, DVT, TIA'S, have a tulip filter that cannot be removed entered during a back surgery and am worried it will come apart. I was in surgery for 2 1/2 hours trying to have it removed but the doctor could not get it out and left it in.
-1	
1	I'm usually most worried about possibly have something negative going on with my health and getting bad news
-1	I haven't felt this way.  I guess if I knew something was seriously wrong with me I would be worried.
1	That they will tell me some stuff, and it will seem to make sense, but ultimately it won't help me with any of my problems and nothing will be resolved.
1	It's always the fear and anxiety over wondering what's wrong with me. Do I want to know? No, but I have to. It's the anxiety of wondering if it's something serious. It's the anxiety of possibly receiving bad news. It's the anxiety of worrying about possibly having surgery. It's the anxiety of being surrounded by sick people in the waiting room. All of that combined makes me very anxious when I visit the doctor. And most of all, it's simply the anxiety of getting bad news that worries me the most.
-1	I have a family history of cancer so when I have blood work done I am always a little bit worried that they are going to show something. Even if I have no other symptoms of anything being wrong and I am only in for my yearly physical for work I can't help worry about what the blood work might say. 
1	Doctor's, Dentist's, They all make me anxious and worried. I'm not exactly sure WHAT MAKES me feel this way. Maybe the unknown? I just have a fear of doing things like this. Makes me very nervous!
-1	nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the do tor's office, not sure why I should be
-1	If I have been having pain, I am anxious to find out what is causing it.  Most of my visits are routine physicals.
-1	Nothing makes me anxious or worried when I am visiting my doctor's office. I have a positive attitude in regards to my doctor visits.
-1	There is always an underlying fear that something might be wrong with you. I also have white coat syndrome and tend to get dizzy/lightheaded when at the dr.'s office.
-1	I don't like waiting around sick people.
1	when i might need to take a test for something that's might be wrong or when it's time for my yearly check and i have t have blood work i hate needles
1	I feel anxious or worried about whether my tests will come back okay. Also, I get anxious about getting blood drawn. And I'm worried that my questions will be stupid.
-1	The doctor speaks in a tone that is always uncertain and could lead to something worse. I'm usually not anxious thought 
-1	I have a history of certain medical conditions and I'm getting to an age where those conditions may be more likely to occur.
-1	The bill I will receive 
-1	Sometimes I encounter health professionals that blow of my symptoms so any worry is about getting them to investigate my symptoms instead of ignoring them.
-1	I do not get nervous when visiting the doctor's office. Getting anxious accomplishes nothing so I do not waste my energy on it.
-1	I can't explain it.  I just don't particularly enjoy then environment and I have a low level uncomfortable feeling about it all.
1	For me, it is the complete feeling of powerlessness. When I go to my doctor, I am both afraid of bad news, and no news. Bad news that will change my life, and also receiving no news at all, requiring me to repeat this same excruciating process in the near future. Good news is always the hope, but when I visit the Dr. I tend to look at things more pessimistically than I do in other aspects of my life.
1	I am usually worried I might have cancer so I'm worried they are going to find something that might indicate I have cancer
-1	Most of the time it is the wait to see the doctor.  The sitting to get back into the office then the waiting once I do get into the examining room.  I worry that something new may be needed that will cause an extra charge. So all in all I would say waiting and money.
-1	What makes me feel anxious is having my doctor be disappointed in me. Also, it makes me nervous when I am not as healthy as I should be.
1	Nothing.. I am certain my health is excellent. Consequently I would have No anxiety issues Or worry I feel very confident with the physician
-1	Just because if you're going to the doctor, something is wrong with you.  You don't know what's going on, and if it's something serious.  Nobody wants to hear that bump on their head could possibly be malignant.  It's fear of the unknown that makes me nervous, not necessarily fear of the doctor.
1	Visiting the doctor's office gets me focused on health issues I don't usually think about extensively but that just pass through my mind. It gets me thinking about what I might not be able to know about my health no matter how much I pay attention to my body and also that I might not be paying as much attention as I should.
-1	I don't want the doctor to give me any best new. I want my doctor to give me the best news.  I want the doctor to find the best way to help me stay healthy
1	They aren't careful. They're in a hurry.
-1	The waiting time and insurance processing. Having to pay sometimes causes me anxiety.  Sometimes I'm worried that my blood work might show something is wrong with me.
1	I am worried that something might be wrong with my health, but mostly if I had a bad health last time. Otherwise I like getting my checkups. I try to rarely go to the doctors though. 
1	I feel worried about whether I can get my questions answered and whether I can get the care I need. I have at times not received the treatment I feel I needed or the correct medicines when I have needed them. 
-1	
-1	I don't feel animus,nervous or worried. My doctor puts me completely at ease and we proceed with the exam/visit in steps.  He lets me know when things will happen and why they need to happen.  There is no fear with him.
-1	My blood pressure is always high when at the exam room because I'm anxious.  I know there is no reason except maybe he would find something seriously wrong at my age. 
1	As a female I'm used to the fact that a lot of doctors will tell women that whatever is wrong with them is because of hormones or stress, and so I worry that they're going to miss something important. Particularly since doctors are far more interested in a woman's privates than her heart (annual heart scans aren't in vogue, but they'll nag for a pap) when heart attacks are one of the top killers of women. The problem is, you never know if you got a good doctor or not until you've seen him/her, so I'm always anxious thinking I might be going through the embarrassment and cost of seeing this person that I might never want to go back to for my care. Then you have to start all over again with a different doctor, with the same worries. 
-1	I have issues that need to be figured out so who knows what the results will be - time will tell. Not knowing is as bad as knowing.
1	I worried about being judged about my weight and unhealthy habits..I am open to advise but don't alway follow throug on advise
1	when we visiting the doctor it would be very difficult to seem it.It would be very fair of it.Getting a treatment it would be very important of it
-1	I'm a little anxious about procedures that are done to me, I don't like anticipating the discomfort with some procedures.
1	The doctor has barely a few minutes to make a rash diagnosis. It's a hit and run encounter.  This does make me anxious since it's my wellbeing on the line. 
1	It's usually how to be either prepared for the worse of the unexpected, and where to go from there. Needing to know a definitive plan, and guidance through those steps are key to be in better health.
1	If I have an issue and I don't really know anything about what caused it or what can be done to fix the problem. I get worried thinking something really bad might happen.
1	I guess it is just a normal anxious thing for most everyone. The waiting is probably the biggest thing that makes me anxious. 
1	At one point I was having severe stomach and abdomil pain.  I went to the doctors believing that my appendix may have ruptured.  The dr did the necessary test to determine that was not the case and it was just a serve case of acid and the proper form of treatment to releave the symptoms
1	Because I never know what the conclusion is of what is wrong with my health. Plus I don't know whether the doctor will be nice or not
-1	I just worry that something will be wrong with me or go wrong in the process. Nothing has been wrong with me yet, but I did the most worrying when I was pregnant. I thought for sure something would go wrong with the baby, but everything ended up being okay. I'm just a worrier in general.
-1	I feel just a tiny bit worried when I haven't lost any weight or gained weight.  My doctor gives me a lecture about how important it is to exercise and maintain a healthy weight.  I trust him and hate to disappoint him.
-1	The unknown. They either find something you did not suspect or they missed something they should have caught before.
-1	the fact that she have to draw  my blood.  I hate needles, and I don't like having to explain in detail how I feel I'm not good at it
1	Not sure if they know what they're doing. Doctors seem to be really good at Emergency Care, and invasive procedures but a lot of the rest of the care they give is hit and miss or just plain wrong.
-1	I would only be worried if there was any chance of something serious popping up on a medical report, like cancer.
1	My high weight and my failed gastric sleeve. I dread that the most of all.  Otherwise my blood pressure and depression
-1	I always think that they are going to blame all of my health issues on my weight; like being heavy is the reason for everything that's wrong with me.
1	Waiting for news. 
-1	That something unexpected pops up and we have to make major decisions about the next course of actions.
1	that he will find something that is untreatable.

-1	I am always afraid of what they are going to tell me and I have been telling them to recheck my thyroid and they will not do it
1	I feel anxious when I think about things that may go wrong. If the doctor is unsanitary or inexperienced. I also worry about inadequate care or any negative after effects. Insurance coverage, premiums and deductibles is another concern.
1	I don't get nervous to go to the doctor because there is not really anything to be nervous about at the dogtor
-1	Nothing much really....
-1	Finding something wrong that may be life threatening or require surgery. Or disable me from working anymore. Being that I am now in my mid fifths is scary. My body has changed. 
-1	If it's a first time visit,  I may feel anxious about how the doctor will treat me and talk to me. Other than that,  there is no major concern. 
-1	That he would  not be able to diagnose my problem and I WILL be required to go to another Dr  who I don't know.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. I am completely comfortable when I go for a check up or I have my annual physical exam.
-1	Usually nothing makes me feel anxious. If anything would make me feel anxious, I guess it would be that as I get older, I feel more likely to have them find something wrong with me. 
1	I always feel like I am going to be told that my cholesterol is too high and that I need to start taking medication for it. I know this is just my doctor doing his job, but I don't like having medications pushed on me. I rather eat healthier and get more exercise.
1	There really isn't anything that makes me feel anxious or worried when I am visiting the doctor's office
-1	I hate getting on the scale. I never want to know how much I weigh, and I always tell the nurse not to tell me. That's probably not a great idea. My blood pressure is almost always good, but I get nervous that perhaps on a particular visit, it will be high. 
-1	Usually the thought of what might be wrong. Sometimes my mind wanders to the worst medical conditions.
1	Worried that they'll find something seriously wrong - or worse, they'll miss something seriously wrong. Worried that they'll suggest I change my lifestyle in ways that make me unhappy.
1	I do not visit the doctor's office often but when I do I always automatically get an un-easy feeling of nervousness. I can not explain why I feel this way.
-1

-1	If I feel He has something bad to tall me because of his office calling me to come in and it's not a regular visit.

1	I NEVER SAID I FEEL ANXIOUS, DON'T PUT WORDS INSIDE MY MOUTH. I'M NOT WORRIED WHEN I VISITH MY DOCTOR.
1	I have chair anxiety and I always have, dentists, doctors, anything like that freaks me out and I think it is a lot of my own neurosis but also the fact that doctors have had a very strange demenour with me and always made me feel like they thought I was too unintelligent to understand what they were telling me.
-1	Unless I am really ill I don't feel anxious. The one thing that worries me most is when a doctor briefly feels for breast lumps, although that's done so quickly there's not much chance of it. So the chance of having cancer of some kind makes me most worried.
-1	I'm most worried that they will find something very seriously wrong that I had no idea was going on with my body.  There are many stories of people finding out they have cancer or other diseases when it's too late, and they never had symptoms.
-1	I usually experience northing more than normal white coat syndrome and that is the only emotion I might feel at times.
-1	The fear that a serious condition could be found. It's really the noting of mortality, that something with the body could be malfunctioning.
-1	I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorder so it is something I struggle with in my day to day life.  However, going to the doctor sometimes causes my anxiety to increase just because I feel shy and awkward in the situation. 
1	The exam itself especially from a gynecologist. I hate being nude even with a Dr I really like and trust. I feel exposed.
1	Never know if when going for a checkup for one thing, some other thing could be discovered. I guess the anxious feeling is that i do not fully understand everything that could be happening in my body until a checkup
1	I always worry if they will make a mistake if its something being done. Also, I wonder if theyll find something else wrong. I worry also that I will make them uncomfortable.
-1	About finding out if I had some kind of eating disorder. Also if maybe the reason I was losing weight was that of something that could not be explained what so ever. Also, I was worried that if I had some kind of disorder, what would the woman that I love say about that?
1	Everything my mood swings around all day long from being sad mad upset worried blandishments more of mental thing maybe 
1	basically the possibility of hearing about an unknown health isue not diagnosed with in the past  and what the outcome may be
1	Generally do not know exactly what is going to be done.  The rush of an appointment is so out of proportion to home much of your day had to be arranged to be there.
-1	Waiting for test results and trying to understand the value of the tests. Also, the high cost of treatments and medications
-1	I just have a general anxiety that I'm not providing the correct information or that there is something wrong that I don't know about. I also don't like needles or pain so I get uneasy that blood tests will be ordered.

1	The unknown of what the results of a procedure will be.
1	I just have always been anxious when going to the doctor.  It feels like an invasion of privacy, even though I know it is for the best.

In an article about anxiety and going to the gynecologist, Tracee Cornforth says most ... not to beat yourself up if you are having a hard time getting to the doctor's office.
1	i might not know what actually is wrong so fear of uncertainty occurs sometimes. also the higher cost involved in doing the unforseen illness.
-1	I get anxious and worried because I'm always scared this is the appointment where he tells me something is wrong with me. I also am just a nervous persolity.
1	"i never know if he is going to find something wrong with me.  Even though besides aches and pains; I feel very healthy, I always worry that I may someday ""catch"" that dreaded ""c:."
1	I worry mainly weather or not i have money to pay for the copay and then if my insurance is going to cover the rest. Insurance companies are so weird you never know what they are going to cover and finances are always my biggest stressor. 
1	Although I try my best to keep myself healthy, I never know what a medical check-up will bring. I'm just an anxious person in general, so it's hard for me to sit still when someone else has information about me that I don't know. The anxiety comes from wanting to make certain that I'm physically and interlly OK.
-1	I do not feel anxious at all when visiting my physician because I work hard to take good care of myself.

-1	because there could always be something wrong with you that you didnt know about or that the doctor overlooked. 
1	I am in remission for Prostate Cancer. Cancer patients are always on guard for disappointing news because the fear of the disease returning is a rest-of-you're-life-reality.
-1	When I don't know if I've collected enough symptoms through tracking to be able to get a diagnosis. A diagnosis is hard to get, but once you have one, you can make a plan and do something about the problem. I hate knowing something's wrong but not being able to get help for it, and every time I go to the doctor with a problem, I'm afraid it's going to happen again.
1	I am always worried that I will be met with bad news when I visit the doctor. I am worried that I have not put my health at the top of my list of priorities. I often avoid annual check ups until I absolutely need to go to the doctor. 
-1	I only feel a little anxious because of my blood pressure.  I have been put on blood pressure medicine to control it but I am working very hard to get off of the medication.
1	When I do not know what will happen. If I need a shot or need to give blood. Just not my favorite thing to do.
1	I used to be worried about the cost most of all, but I now have stable finances and appropriate insurance so that is less of a worry.  I worry that they'll tell me something scary about my health, like needing surgery or having a chronic uncurable condition.  I've needed surgery that had me on bed rest for a week and it wasn't pleasant.
-1	Well, experience tells me that a little thing can be indicative of a big thing. How do you think I found out about a cancer that resulted in a 3 month hospitalization? A doctors visit, thats how. So, it would be rather unusual to not have trepedation when repeating the visits later. I had to abandon a cafreer because of physical pain and even the doctors that realize the source of the problem are too chicken shit to say so for disability. Seven years later and poverty is the result.
-1	I'd felt a little bit worried when I visited the doctor's office my very first time I went for my preventive screening exam because I wasn't insured and wasn't able to get any exams before now.
1	i AM ALWAYS WORRIED THAT DOCTOR SOMETIMES MAY NOT MAKE THE CORRECT MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS PERTAINING TO MY ILLNESS OR INJURY. SOMETIMES DOCTORS ARE ALWAYS IN A HURRY AND DONT REALLY EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR PATIENT
-1	Because I am getting older and am reaching the age when all of the men in my family either have died already or been diagnosed with cancer, I am anxious about that history and the likelihood that it is ineveitable that it will happen to me, and that this likelihood increases with age, and it will be a doctor visit that fisccloses that the end is coming soon.
-1	I am worried whether my weight, blood pressure, white blood cell will change for the worse. When I go for a screening whether it will show something I do not want to know I can fight.
-1	I don't have any worry when I go to the doctor's office in regards to my health. I currently do not have insurance so what would make me most anxious is I have something wrong that requires a lot of medical attention.
1	I get scared that they're going to tell me something is really wrong, even though I have no reason to think that.
1	Afraid that you'll get a bad health report. I think that's on everyone's mind. you're always fearful that something is wrong. typical of most people that go to the doctor.
1	I'm worried that I will get in trouble for something. I know how silly that sounds, but I'm not sure how else to explain it. I'm worried there's something else wrong with my health that I missed or didn't see because I put off going to the doctor for too long. 
1	I worry that I will receive random and unexpected bad news regarding an unavoidable health problem. Additionally, even though I am a healthy weight, exercise, and otherwise take care of myself, I expect without reason to be scolded for doing something wrong health-wise.
1	It's the feeling of not knowing exactly what is wrong with you and the Doctor asking a lot of questions, sometimes personal questions.  I know my Doctor must ask but it is still uncomfortable to answer.
-1	Not getting the results back quickly is what makes me anxious when going to the doctor or if she can't give me an answer right away and has to rely on lab results instead.
-1	I persolly just dislike the actual procedures. I'm not fond of the actual process as I am a very private person.
1	They could find that i have a dangerous health issue. 
1	"i get anxious or worried from the very situation of being in a doctor's office or medical setting. This is commonly referred to as ""White coat syndrome"", and I believe I suffer from it as well as a lot of the general population. "
1	about what he will tell me if something is wrong.sometimes my sugar levels are high and he gets a little upset because he is very concerned about it.
1	Show me a single person who isn't in any way anxious, nervous or worried when visiting a doctor, and I'll show you liar.
1	I always worry that they will find something wrong with me. That makes me uneasy. Or I may go in with a problem, they diagnose it and I still don't get better so I have to book another appointment. This makes me anxious. 
-1	"I feel worried when they see something of concern on my blood work and want to redo it.  Blood work is very telling so it makes me extremely nervous if something looks ""off"" to my doctor."
-1	Well I have a chronic fatal disease and often I worry about the rate in which it is causing pathology to my body.
-1	The only time I feel anxious at the Doctor's office is if I have to have a test I've never had before. 
1	I am anxious about all of the things they check regularly because these things are likely to have some result or they would not check for them in the first place. 
-1	That they don't take me seriously. I have gone multiple times with the same symptoms and each time I am given the same prescription and physical therapy recommendation. This has gone on for 3 years.
1	I just want my physical exam to come back all healthy which do but during the process of going in and getting examining then waiting for the results is kind of stressful. I have to wait for some days and while that is going on all my mind can think of is when am I am going to be getting the results and when it comes back all healthy its a great relief.
1	Just the thought of going and spending all that time in the waiting room with sick people and crying kids hate it it gives me anxiety thinking about it
1	That my doctor might find something wrong with me that I didn't know about. Or I might need something that my insurance does not cover.
-1	The most obvious thing in my eyes...that they will find something wrong that I was not aware of.   It is similar to getting your car worked on.  You always worry the mechanic will come out of the shop and say your &lt;auto part here&gt; is also broken. 
1	I simply hate being physically examined by a strange person. I also don't like being asked personal questions about my life and behavior, especially sexual behavior. I am worried that I will be considered strange or suspicious for not wanting to answer questions, so I prefer to avoid the situation.
-1	That they will find something that is a medical problem. That my a1c will be too high. That my best efforts to take care of myself aren't good enough. 
1	I don't know what to expect when I get there. They may ask me to do something that I really don't want to do
-1	I usually feel quite good so I am never nervous about my checkups.  Fortutely I am extremely healthy and always have been.  The worst problem I've had is sciatica and I went to PE for that. 
-1	I do not like needles, and just about the last three or four visits, I got a shot. I hate the wait for the nurse to stick the needle in.
-1	The most anxious part of a doctor's appointment is not knowing exactly what to expect.  As someone who is highly organized and detail oriented, I tend to get anxious when I find myself in an unfamiliar situation or surroundings and am not sure what to expect.
-1	As I'm getting older I visit my doctor more often, these days people are dying from left to right, before you know it someone has cancer, that's my biggest reason to feel anxious.
-1	I wonder if everything is alright with me. Sometimes I hate the wait before seeing the doctor on certain days.
1	having to speak with the doctor and determine what a n appropriate course of treatment may or may not be as it pertains to my health
1	I feel most anxious or worried when I am experiencing unexplained chronic pain or new/unfamilar symptoms or sensations.

-1	Sometimes they need to run some tests that are not what I would call routine, MRIs and the like.  I hate waiting on results of tests and complex exams.
1	There is always the fear of the unknown weighing on your mind, especially as I progress into my twilight years. This fear has the tendency to cause worry.
-1	i may wonder about the tests i have to take. or about the results. some of the tests bother me.  i am usually very comfortable.
-1	I am afraid they might find something that is out of the ordinary. The daunting feeling of fear is what is the most worrying. 
1	The fear of the unknown has always made me feel most anxious or worried when it comes to doctor visits. 
-1	If there is something I don't have an answer for or if i'm awaiting a result of a test that was taken, then I tend to worry.
1	Mainly that something will be wrong, when I go for the next check up, I'm getting older and I smoke and this is around the age when my mother started to have medical problems.
-1	Actually nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when I visit my primary care physician. His bedside manner is excellent and he delivers information in a nice calm voice.
1	What makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is lack of communication.  For example, if you are waiting in the waiting room or exam room and nobody (nurse or doctor) communicates that there will be a delay or explain why there's a delay.  Overall, the most anxious I feel is any lack of communication from the medical person.
-1	It's nothing in particular, usually. It's just a general concern that something could always be wrong that I'm not aware of. A doctor's office isn't usually a place you visit when things are going splendidly. 
-1	As this hardly ever occurs, well, ... hard to say. However, most times (very few), I've mostly felt more neutral, than anxious. Any anxiety would be related to waiting time.
1	I do not like the fact that something might be wrong with me and I can't do anything about it. I do not like receiving shots either.
-1	I feel anxious about telling the doctor what is wrong.  I'm afraid he won't take my symptoms seriously.
-1	Just learning something new about my health, especially if it's something negative. But haven't really experienced that so it makes me worry that one day something might come up unexpectedly.
-1	I'm wondering if he will help me at all ir just tell me I'm getting older which is no help at all. 
1	I worry that my blood pressure will be high. I worry about being diagnosed with cancer. I'm 66 and feel my mortality.
-1	I get anxious when I go see my doctor because I have no clue what good or bad news that he's going to give me when I get there.
1	I am always a little worried that something is wrong with me, and I didn't know it. I also get worried that the doctor will be judgmental of my life, like if I gained some weight or had drinks over the weekend. 
1	With an exam you never know what the doctor may find or think he finds.  When blood work is done it could show I have something I didn't know about.  He could tell me I have to take a medication that may have side effects.  Lots of things worry me about going to the doctors.
1	When i visit the doctor's office normally, It is because am having health issues or as a follow up after examination to determine the issue. Having health issue that causes discomfort and not  knowing what health issue you are experiencing sometimes makes me anxious or worried.
1	My doctor is a foreigner and I can't understand her English.  I have to  ask her to repeat everything and I find this embarassing.  She talks down to me and that is degrading and humiliating.
1	Well, I'm 38, so I just don't want any unwanted surprises. :-) 
-1	not feeling like im in control and things not going as I planned them to go and trying to figure it out 
1	Im afraid that my current ailments will be found to be a lot worsebthan the last time i was at the doctors office
1	I never do, I have lots of confidence in her ! The only thing I worry about if something's wrong with me !!! 
1	It is often times hearing a test results and going in to due to symptoms I've being experiencing. Also, some doctor's offices have long wait times that's undesirable.
-1	doctors visits usually never make me feel ill at ease. i am in pretty good health and dont have much to worry about.
1	I always get nervous as my Primary never get along, my blood pressure shoots up and I usually end up crying
1	Your health is a movable feast. One day you're fine. The next day you receive a devastating diagnosis. Every time you go to visit your doctor, you run the risk of having terrible news delivered to you. That makes those visits extremely frightening. I literally feel sick just thinking about going to the doctor!
1	I am only worried when there is pain (like when I broke my fibula) and the Dr can't say what has caused my pain. It took my hospital 4 weeks to finally figure out my fibula was broken. They took an xray the first day I went in, but the fracture didn't show. I was continuously in pain, and went back 4 times. On the 2nd visit, it was determined I had shingles and no xray was taken. I actually had shingles and a broke fibula at the same time. The stress o my leg caused the shingles.
-1	I do not feel worried about going to the doctor, because it is necessary to always visit the doctor to disperse any conditions.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office.  Needles are not my favorite thing but they do not cause me to be anxious or worry either.
1	I often feel anxious or worried about them always wanting to discuss my weight. Not my problem the reason I am there. They are always trying to blame me being overweight a little.
-1	Only the thoughts of what lies ahead. What will they discover, and what are the problems. The unknown when I see concern by the doctor.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's. I have enough experience with doctors that I am comfortable that I can ask for and get what I need.
1	I might have something they can do nothing about.  Has happened a few times.  Then you sit and wondert but go on with your life
1	When I visit my Dr office im more worried about the results of my test results and surgery being recommended.
1	I am anxious waiting for the doctor, I am anxious when he asks me questions and I am anxious awaiting his thoughts or feelings as to what is going on.
1	I'm worried if I go to the doctor for one thing and might get find out about another thing. I believe in crazy people including these doctors
1	 you never know when you go to the doctor because things can creep up on you without you knowing so i am always a little apprehensive when i go
1	I hate to sit for hours and hours just so they can tell you that your doctor is not there and you got to see a nurse practitioner that has absolutely no clue what you discussed with the doctor
-1	I am never terribly anxious or worried but at my age there is always the possibility of him finding something!
1	You never know what they are going to find. Maybe they find something bad that always makes me very nervous.
-1	There's always a bit of worry that something is wrong that I didn't notice. I just like to be fully prepared.
1	How much it's going to cost because even with insurance it's expensive and unaffordable for most normal people 
1	I usually feel a little exposed and also uneasy about the unknown. There is always a little fear that something may be wrong with me. I am worried that the doctor may judge me for having a little extra weight or for not taking care of myself right. I am pretty self conscious so letting someone see or feel parts of my body that I wouldn't normally expose makes me anxious and uneasy. 
-1	The most worrisome thought would be they're going to find out some things wrong that can't be fixed. I mean if you find out you have to take medicine or have a light surgery it's fine. You go there and they tell you that you have cancer, or heart failure all because you went there because you had a slight cough and are slightly fatigued..... I mean who expects that to happen?
1	"The bill is number one with a bullet.  Then after that I would be most worried about whatever condition I came in for being worse than it appears, or worst case scerio a big ol' shrug of the shoulders from the doctor saying ""I don't know what causes that..."" then endless testing (oh wait that goes back to cost).  Also lost time I have to take off of work because no doctor keeps a schedule that takes into account peoples working schedule."
1	I worry that my doctor would find something wrong with me. I want to go in there alive, and come out fine without any problems. I'm also not comfortable with people touching me, even if it is my doctor.
-1	I'm getting older, and I know I'm not as strict with myself about maintaining proper diet and exercise.  I know it's for my own good, but visiting my doctor means confronting my own shortcomings in this area.
1	I think what makes me anxious or worried is a sense of the unknown. I don't know what they're going to come back with. They could come back with some terrible medical problem, even though it's unlikely.
1	them not being able to tell you what is wrong with you. if a test does not show anything then they are not willing to investigate to find what is wrong. They will refer to a specialist but they are hard to find good ones
-1	Personal and private exams worry me, I am very self conscious about my body and do not want touched at all if possible
-1	how much time it will take, I don't like to wait.  other than waiting I don't mind going to the doctor's office.
-1	When I go to the doctor's office I feel nervous because I don't like to get shots, blood drawn, and talk to a doctor period.  I don't know what they are going to do or say.
-1	I am healthy so going to a doctor's office does not make me anxious though when they take my blood pressure it is usually higher then normal. So subconsciously it may bother me a bit.
1	I get anxious or worried because I'm always wondering if I'm about to find out something that could change my life. Both my grandmother and my sister went into the doctor due to what they thought was bronchitis but found out that is was cancer and we lost the both within 2 years of the diagnosis 
-1	I feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office because I'm fearful that something is wrong that I didn't know about and I'm scared how I will react
1	When I get my blood pressure taken. I am getting older so hypertension is a real concern. I am trying to cut down on sodium intake and exercising more to keep myself health. But my job is somewhat stressful so my blood pressure goes up and down sometimes. Waiting to hear my result makes me feel uneasy.
1	There is always a thought in the back of my head that something will be seriously wrong.  That I will be diagnosed with a terrible disease.  I have a fear of ever hearing that I will get bad news from a doctor.
1	Not knowing the severity of my condition and the thought of being given drugs that will have terrible side effects.
1	im scared what they are going to tell me about my condition and the  office just makes me uneasy, it is not like im going there for a good reason.
-1	Waiting for the results makes me anxious. Or waiting for a long period of time to see the doctor makes me uneasy.  It makes me really anxious just sitting there waiting 
-1	Whenever I have an issue i'm worried that it is actually bigger than I expected. The hospital setting sort of makes it worse.
-1	I get anxious about  hearing information that may not like from my primary care physician. I am also anxious when I hear news about damage to my health.
-1	Hearing bad news or being told that you have a medical condition. Also if the doctor will be caring about the health of his/her patients.
-1	You never know what they are going to tell you or the next step in progress or if something isn't right and have to change your life goals
1	That they are ligit honest and trustworthy n care. And have liscenses great reviews with better business bureau
-1	The results of lab tests and diagnostic tests and x-rays cause more anxiety than the actual visit and examination.
-1	when they are talking about serious health problem. a words from him that might lead to a bad health issue. testing my blood for std and other lifetime problems
-1	In the past I have rarely been sick, and when I was sick and needed a doctor I could always get better and resume my daily life.  Now as I am aging with Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and Scoliosis, I not only need to learn to deal with the fact that it may take longer to heal but with the fact that there are some things like Fibromyalgia that you may not recover from (i.e., there is no ready made healing potion).  
-1	There's a variety of mild anxiety. For example, maybe there's nothing much wrong with me, and it was stupid to go to the doctor. Maybe there's something really wrong. Things like that.
1	simply i always think of the worst and when i am in the doctor i think he will tell me i am about to die
-1	I only go when I think something is terribly wrong, so I am worried that I might be right and it's not some simple ailment.
1	I would feel most anxious while visiting the doctor's office because I would fear that there was something else wrong with me instead of what I was going in for.
1	It's like preparing for battle with lots of prepared questions, questions produced hostility, and then it can get nasty. So I keep smiling and sounding like Mary Poppins. 
-1	I am not at all anxious or worried about anything.  My doctor is just wonderful.  I go every six months.  I was just there, and he is a great doctor.
1	I'm usually most worried that I will receive some bad news. I've had a lot of health problems in the past and always feel like the worst possible scenario is going to come true.
1	One thing that makes me feel most anxious is the fact that there might be something wrong with me. That worries me, and I stress out about it.
1	The only thing that makes me nervous is getting shots and certain medical examinations (removing clothes), whenever I have been putting off going to the doctor and the problem is worse by then I am a little nervous as if I could have made it worse or what it could possibly be.
-1	I just feel anxious because I'm afraid something might be wrong with me. I am afraid I will be told something I don't want to hear. But I do trust my doctor.
-1	Just worrying about what might be wrong with me. I hate to be sick, but I trust my doctor.
1	I am always worried when I see the doctor because I always feel like they are going to tell me something is really wrong with me. For the longest I thought I wa healthy now every time I go they find something new about me. I donât know if it is they want more money from me or they are really trying to help me.
1	"When visiting a conventional doctor, I have what is called ""white coat syndrome"" with elevated blood pressure, and other symptoms of anxiety.  I have had it since I was a child - no known explanation for it"
-1	Nothing I am completely comfortable when I go. I trust that the doctors know what they are doing and will treat accordingly.
1	i feel anxious for work, children or new start. it is very important for me. or my family have problems
-1	I don't really feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor anymore. I'm pretty cool when I go to any of my doctors. On my first visits it was just normal gitters because you have no clue what the doctor is going to say but that soon fades. 
-1	I have actually never felt anxious when visiting the doctors office.  But I do worry a little when I'm having unexplained pain in a certain area and don't know why or what brought this pain on out of the blue
1	Fear of whether or not there's something wrong with me, and fear of how much treatment will cost. 
-1	My anxiety would come from finding out that I have something seriously wrong with me that  had not been detected through regular checkups.
1	I think that doctors ask many questions. Also, they search for abnormalities. This can make me feel uneasy because I don't know what the next observation or diagnosis will be regarding my health issues. Also, I feel uneasy when I have to have my blood pressure checked. 
-1	I feel anxious sometimes about telling them what's wrong with me, and wondering if what they can do to help me. 
-1	I think the worst is when you go into the doctor's office and you feel bad and you are not sure what the doctor is going to say.
-1	Well, most of the time I have been to see the doctor is for a symptom that I am aware of and know the severity of it. Only once have I been not knowing and I was anxious but fully relieved after the diagnosis.
1	Not being able to get encouraging results or solutions to improve my health or relieve my pain   Most of my conditions are chronic and will not improve 
1	What makes me feel mostly that why is what I'm I goin to find out about now with my medical problems and how they are goin to help me fix the pain and if they will give me the right medicine or if I would be able to get the medicine that I need would it be covered will it work 
1	 Going to the doctors always has a component of dread for me. I fear my test results in particular after a period when I have let myself go physically or not watched my diet carefully. My particular fears are; cancer and signs of cognitive decline. My cholesterol is another concern as it is nearly always just outside the parameters and I am nearly always chided for that. I am diabetic but my A1c results have been consistently good for many years now. I dread going to the psychiatrist for anxiety meds because I really feat mental aging and there is nearly always a test for that involved with the visit.
1	I worry that I will find out there's something wrong that's more significant than I expected.  I also have had several illnesses where it took doctors a while to figure out what the problem was.  So, sometimes I worry that I won't get an answer/resolution/treatment plan.
-1	I have several chronic pain and breathing issues.  I'm always concerned that one of these issues may evolve into something that may become very serious.  I don't like surgery and I don't like hospitals, and I'm always concerned that either may become necessary.
1	I really hate shots or invasive procedures (*i.e pap smears) I also hate not knowing what to expect as far what will happen during the visit. This worry always goes away as soon as the actual doctor has arrived. I think it is the waiting that gets me most nervous. 
1	Again, there are some of my doctors that I would definitely ask for a second opinion before accepting what he or she says as completely xorrect
1	The things that make me feel most anxious at the doctor's office are a) my ability to communicate clearly the symptoms I am experiencing and how often I experience them and b) describing intimate or personal issues with female nurses and doctors.  I am far more comfortable with male doctors or nurses.
1	I try to take good care of myself, but I know I don't always make the best choices. And I worry and have anxiety all the time anyways.   So it's just worse when I need to visit a doctor. I always think and worthy about the worst possible scenarios.
-1	I wonder if I am going through o find out something is wrong. I may need hospitalization or tests or surgery.
-1	Even though i am calm with my doctor,  it's always an anxious time as you never know if something could be found wrong. 
1	Waiting for the doctor to give me results. Fear of the unknown.
-1	If I am going because of symptoms and I do not know the cause, then I would tend to be worried.  The unknown is always a little worrisome. 
1	It has more to do with how my health is going than the doctor herself. I think every time I go I have more and more wrong with me because of my age.
1	I guess wondering whether or not they are going to be honest with me. If I knew they are going to try to push an antibiotic or prescription, I'd already be defensive. I don't take pharmaceuticals. 
-1	I am very comfortable in doctor's offices and in hospital surroundings. I grew up in that environment because my mom worked at a hospital, and so I was always there and the other doctors were friendly and doting toward me. So, I am never anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office unless I fear or expect something is very wrong with me.
1	I just feel like you never know what they might tell you or what unwanted testing they will want to do.
1	i dont trust that the doctor is genuinely making the best choice for me. i like when a doctor gives me options and goes over all of my choices pros and cons. instead of telling me what to do
-1	I worry the doctor will not listen appropriately.  I worry that I'll be sitting alone for a long period of time waiting with only a paper on.  I worry that I haven't told the whole truth inadvertently.  
1	I normally do not. If I were I would say discussing my lab results. Not knowing what the results will be for days can be a bit hard. 
1	What they might have to say more about my diagnosis and other unsuspecting news.  Also, all the waiting around that goes with it.
-1	That the doctor will not believe me when I describe my symptoms - or that he will argue with me about how I feel.  
-1	The most anxious that I get is making sure that I get there on time. And I always hope that there won't be anything seriously wrong with me.
1	they just scare me i know i am healthy but i am scared they are gonna find something wrong with me that i was not aware of 
-1	I just be a sometimes because doctors are not far from error because they are human as well. That is the reason why I am nervous about doctors 
-1	Fear of finding out that something could be seriously wrong like cancer or other life treating diseases.
1	I'm always afraid that I will get bad news and it worries we every time I go to the Dr's office. I have a great doctor and he always lets me know what I need to do.
-1	I usually do not feel this way at all whenever i have to go to a doctors office. Again my doctor does a good job of making me feel like im at home, and not uncomfortable. The only time i may have these thoughts slip into my head is if i do not know what is wrong with me and im just acting a bit panicky and uneasy. 
1	Me having to wait for my results make me nervous. Just sitting there or even waiting for a phone call have me on edge. 
1	I fear they are going to find something terribly wrong with me. I fear that when they find something terribly wrong with me the treatment is going to be unpleasant. Even when I already know more or less what is wrong, I fear that the treatment is going to be unpleasant. I fear side effects of medication, and don't want to have to take more.
-1	A primary concern for all of us would be the money and how much we will spend on the visit. Also thinking that there might be something terrible going on with me
1	I usually feel anxious because if I am at the doctors office there is something wrong.  Something wrong means it's going to cost a lot of money.  I don't have health insurance because I can't afford it.
-1	If you're feeling under the weather and the cause is not immediately apparent, resulting in tests - and you need to wait on test results before treatment can be decided.
-1	The possibility that I may be examined health problems.
1	When I visit the doctor, I'm most worried about them finding something wrong with my overall health, or even something specific that could really harm me.  I worry I'll need some type of invasive procedure.
1	Being able to adequately explain my concerns, anticipating the response of the doctor, being ignored or talked down to, the actual physical exam also makes me anxious because I don't like being touched.
1	Im embarassed about talking about my problem with the physician afraid he may judge me with his workers 
1	Not knowing how my future is going to come out I feel depressed because I can't really work or can't do for myself 
1	I normally have a lot of anxiety when seeing a doctor not necessarily because I am worried the doctor will not be good enough, but because I am afraid about the uncertainty caused by not knowing what is wrong with me since I am at the doctor to find out what it is. I may find out that it is something really bad so I am scared of that. I am also afraid that the tests that need to be done will cause me pain or discomfort, and I am especially scared of needles.
-1	There always is a feeling of dread that during a physical they will find something new and unexpected. The actual physical is not a problem. Though no one enjoys the blood draw.
-1	I worry that my diagnosis will be worse than I think and will result in a more serious disease than I initially thought
1	I never seem to get a answer to my concerns or problems and I'm afraid of that repeating when I go back 
-1	I just always wonder if I'm in worse shape than most others seen by the doctors.  It makes me evaluate the uncomfortable aspects of my health and my body.
1	When visiting the doctor I feel anxious or worried because I don't know what is wrong with me. I don't know if it's a death situation or not
1	I have a heart condition that while stable and not harmful right now, needs to be monitored.  Every time I see him I worry that my condition has change and I may require surgery. 
-1	That's an easy one-- what will my cost be for whatever treatments I need, and will I be able to afford it.  
-1	My primary issue with having current Western medical practices applied to me is that medical schools do not address a wide enough spectrum of healing modalities. And if they do, they charge a lot for their services. Around here, MD/NDs charge far too much for me to afford. So, I'm left with the choice of visiting a doctor who is instructed in a more narrow treatment spectrum, which does not suit my approach to health. As a result, I'm worried and anxious, because I know how many doctors react if you question their advice.
1	I just want answers, which is something I can never get. I really don't even care if the answers are not good, I just want some answers, that's all.
-1	I think the thing that makes me feel most anxious is when I don't know what's wrong with me and don't know if the doctor will know as well. When I was diagnosed with chronic hives I was always anxious or worried when meeting with the allergist because I wasn't confident that the hives would go away and the situation would be resolved. The fear of them not knowing what to do when I have no idea what to do is what gets me worked up. 
1	You never know what they are going to say.  Sometimes they can misdiagnose you just to get paid and worry you.  Its a hit or miss situation.
1	 i always feel a little apprehensive when i visit my doctor.  you never know what could be lurking in you  i am always hopeful that everything will go well
-1	What makes me most anxious when visiting a doctor is whether or not I will be able to convince them to address all of my concerns rather than just the one or two issues that they feel like addressing. Other than that I have no worries about visiting a doctor because I realize that I'm getting older and I'm not going to live forever.
-1	Mainly the outcome of the visit makes me nervous. As a person that has had a few medical conditions, it always makes me a little uneasy to have a check up not knowing if something is wrong again. Having to take additional tests, such as x-ray's or bloodwork is something that always makes me nervous. While I was sick I would be anxious before every appointment because I would be afraid that the doctor may have found something cancerous or seriously life threatening. 
1	When a doctor tries to prescribe medicine for every little thing like a cold back pain instead of healthy alternatives
1	I worry that the doctor will just brush off my concerns. I also worry because I have a history of cancer in my family.
1	I'm mostly uncomfortable having an unknown person examine my body.  This makes me anxious to be done with it as quickly as possible.
-1	The only things I've every worried about when visiting a doctor are if it's a new doctor and whether or not I'm going to like them, if I see a lot of people in the waiting room and feel like it's going to be a very long appointment that is going to take up a lot of time and ruin my day, or if I feel like they are going to tell me I have some type of more serious health issue going on. I have had some doctors make me feel anxious in the past, but my main doctor has never caused me to feel that way. 
-1	I'd say just randomly having some new infection that I didn't suspect because I usually do things that wouldn't harm myself so this would surprise me and make me wonder which activity exposed me to this and what I can do to correct it. Also, I sometimes will worry about needles if I have to get one just because I'm not a huge fan at the end of the day
1	I just never really know what to expect and I feel that it is a waste of time. There has been wrong diagnoses in the past with people, so who knows. It's like flipping a coin. I'd be more worried about what the doctors says if anything.
1	what makes me feel most anxious about visiting a doctor, is that after getting an examination or a health check i always think that their going to find something a lot more serious or even life threatening than i had expected
1	how to describe what's going on with me so that I can get real help, not just lip service.  
-1	What makes me ferl most worried about my doctor's appointment is not achieving the goal that we set or that things got worse
-1	I'm usually never nervous or anxious when visiting the doctors... I'm only nervous or anxious if I have to feel some sort of pain by medication or operations.
-1	how much the price of meds will be
-1	I am most worried about the cost. I have the very good luck to never have health insurance when I need it, and even when I do it's still a large expense. I rarely feel any kind of anxiety over my health when I'm able to see a doctor, it's when I can't that worries me.
-1	I am only anxious when i visit my Doctor if my blood pressure is to high.  I can be worried that my Doctor may find something wrong with me.
-1	The ideal of me having cysts on my ovaries or cÃ¡ncer cells is a bit nerve wrecking. Also my infertility and trying to defeat it is a bit of a pain
-1	I usually don't get anxious or worried because if something is wrong you can only trust in God to take care of it.
-1	The only time I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor is if I've had a major test and am waiting for the results or if it's about one of my children.
-1	I feel anxious because I do not care being around doctors or nurses.  I feel as thought I am a healthy person and do not need to be in a doctors office for checkups.  I simply don't care to go to the doctor for any reason.
-1	Not a lot it just that first visit when you dont know whag is wrong but afger that it is just time to go
1	That the doctor will find something wrong with me like a major health issue... Being up in age there tends to be times when your body goes through all sorts of physical changes anything from a cancerous growth of some sort or certain glands might be failing... Who knows the damage that the body has been dealt...  
-1	I really don't get anxious or worried when I visit my doctor's office.  On the other hand, if I need a prescription refilled, it can take them a while to respond to the pharmacy and that worries me wondering if I'll get the refill before I run out.
1	The cold sterile setting is rather unnerving, causing my anxiety levels to skyrocket. Knowing that anything I say to the doctor could be taken out of context and cost me my License/Job/Freedom due to a simple misunderstanding. The waiting can also cause stress and worry. It seems to take forever for a doctor to even make it into the room to examine you, and even longer to come back and explain what steps are next. Finally, Even when I know what is wrong, or the reason I am there and try to explain why or what helps because I've been through it before, I'm treated like an idiot or a criminal, or a faker while they order more tests to make my bill even higher. 
-1	I feel this way when it's time for my chest x-ray and my breathing test.  I have cut back on my smoking but haven't quit completely. When it's time for these procedures I get a little afraid of the results.
1	The outcome of a diagnosis would be what I fear most. I do not participate in many actual exams, I don not like people touching me. Not even for a shot or checking heart rates. I just get extremely anxious about seeing any DR for fear of bad news.
1	I sometimes feels alot of anxious and worried when visiting the doctors office.Because you do not know if he going to give you a needle shot, or any thing like that.
1	I mostly worry about my bills and how I can pay them. I worry about see a doctor but don't have money. I worry that my car is so old but I can't afford to buy a new one.
1	First, how long am I going to wait. I know doctors have little regard for their patients time as I tend to wait 30 minutes to two hours for them to arrive. If I am  sitting in a doctor's office, I have a health issue, so of course I'm worried that it could be serious.
-1	IM WORRIED HE IS GOING TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME EVEN IF I AM JUST THERE FOR A YEARLY PHYSICAL
-1	I don't like having blood drawn. This is the only part of my doctor visits that I don't like. 
-1	Being unsure of the Doctor's findings and never wanting to hear bad news but always willing to hear good news and guidance
-1	I am worried that the doctor will find something that is very serious wrong with me and that the treatment will be long term and expensive or that it will be something that can not be treated.
1	That they are going to tell me that I am overweight or shame me for my weight. 
-1	i like to think that i am healthy but the check ups that when they can fine something wrong so i do get a little anxious i just want to get it done and over with
1	I am always worried that the doctors will not listen to my concerns and take them seriously. Most doctors I have seen just wanted to give me medicines without actually trying to find the cause of the sickness itself. I am always worried when I see doctors now that they will not listen fully to my concerns. 
1	It's ultimately the fear of the unknown. I could be walking around unknowingly with a disease that could kill me and not find out until it's too late.  
1	None other. it is a good product or exempt. the only way I could have a good idea. the first to know about it. the other side, and I have been texting and the rest is history of this 
-1	To put it simply... fear of the unknown.  Everyone goes through this, unless they're a psychopath (I actually kind of envy them for that).  If you don't know what's wrong, and you don't know how serious it is, you're going to have that fear.  I's normal.  I'm actually wondering why this question is even necessary.  
-1	I struggle with my weight so I am always a little embarrassed and worried that I will have to take my clothes off or worried that he or the nurses will see my weight and judge me.
-1	Fear of a diagnosis of some kind.
-1	If is my first appointment for this event that I have never been in before and I am not sure what the doctor is going to tell me that I need to do or what the results may be so I will feel a bit nervous or worried
1	I'm not sure what they are really thinking and not knowing whether or not they are being truthful about my condition
-1	The high blood pressure exam worried it will be high and I will forget to ask specific questions that I have been thinking about 
1	Just the thought that i should of come sooner. I blame myself for putting it of. Its always a bit nerve wracking getting examined  when you think something could be wrong with you. 
1	I'm always afraid of receiving negative results from any lab tests, x-rays, any kind of treatment that I have.  
1	With everything all over social media and the news sometimes it makes it hard not to think about what ifs.  Everything is bad for you now so with every appointment it makes me wonder what could they find, is this the visit.  I question every choice I have made since my last appointment.  Also I am very hard on myself, so I always worry what the doctors or nurses think of me.
-1	If I think that something is wrong and I might get a not so good diagnosis or like the treatment option that the doctor is recommending, because of the negative side effects; then I have to weigh the risks of treating the problem verses not taking the treatment and possibly making the condition worst, also if there is going to be a problem with the insurance company covering the treatment or if I will have a very high out of pocket expense and then have to figure out how to pay for treatment/medication I may really need for a particular condition.
-1	I suppose the most anxious thing I have worried about is whether or not the doctor was in a rush. Sometimes they try and push you out and don't like being asked many questions.  
-1	I worry the most about the diseases that the other patients are bringing to the waiting room. I also worry about the cost and the excuses my insurance company will give me for not covering what they are supposed to cover. I worry a little bit about the quality of care and whether or not anyone in the office will take their profession seriously during my visit.
1	I am concerned that I am broken that there is something wrong with my body that is not fixable or is not responding to treatment. This anxiety resonates with me every single day, but is at its highest when I am getting an exam at the doctor's office.
1	"Money is the first of the most important concerns. The old saying ""I can not afford to get sick or go to the Dr, hospital, etc.. Applies to most of us including me. The second worry  concern is what the Dr finds out during lab work, exams, etc and the diagnosis and the ""Cost"" I am always concerned that whatever the Dr finds through an exam or test is that they advise you on a standard rule of the most expensive treatment or specialist they can give. I have had many persol experiences with this. There is no such thing as persol, affordable, think out of the box, healthcare treatments. I am treated like a robot in a robot system. I go to my family physician and if there is anything wrong I get sent all over town to specialists and have many appointments and a lot of time and out of pocket expenses and find out later that all of that was not necessary and the health problem could have been handled and treated through my family Dr. simply and a lot less expensive. "
-1	I feel most anxious or worried when it comes to work or challenging situations that I have to handle.
1	I  would be worried that the doctor was going to find something wrong with me. I do not like going to doctors for anything.
1	I feel worried each time I visit my doctor because I feel he's going to add me on more medication. He said that my blood pressure continues to increase. The medicine that I'm on already makes me feel dizzy at times. I don't want to be placed on more medication. 
1	I don't like waiting or hearing bad news in regards to health concerns. Also the anticipation of certain results of labs or test can cause anxiety 
1	I only get to die once an that is all my life can be.  Most people seem bad at accepting this let alone doing something to make it better.  I dislike the mind and the things we've done with them ever more.  Trying to believe someone is professional vested in myself getting an improved life seems beyond any idea of lies I could ever believe with any safety so I approach all medical professionals as near enemies.
-1	The unknowns make me feel the most anxious and worried. If for example I am having a very bad pain and I have no idea what it could be I feel very anxious waiting to find out because I always feel like it will be something bad. 
-1	The only thing that would make me feel anxious when visiting a doctor is if I have something that could potentially be serious. I would be worried about it being something worse than what I think it is.
-1	I fear that maybe i'll walk out with a deadly illness
-1	Nothing really makes me feel anxious about the doctor visit. I alsways believe I will be treated okay and every will be perfect.
1	A crazy person coming in and shooting the place up I don't like the anxiety off waiting for test results and lab results and needles 
1	Sometimes I feel like I'm not where I should be weight wise. I am a shy and modest person for the most part and having a physical exam makes me nervous.  I also am worried he will find something that I had no idea was an issue with my health.
1	I do not go to the doctors when I have a cut finger or a bruise.  I only go to the doctors when I am sick, and I do not need to be poked, prodded, felt up, have things inserted etc. Why so I need a stranger touching me, I do not like to be touched, that is why I do not fly.  There is some thing wrong with a stranger touching you saying this is going to hurt a bit etc. Doctors make me feel very uneasy and nervous, which makes me very unhappy.
1	If I am worried about the outcome of my visit, I may feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor
-1	I am hoping that I get a clean bill of health from my check ups. You never know what a doctor might find. It produces anxiety in me regarding possible health problems arising.
1	I feel nervous that they might find something seriously wrong with me. I like to avoid the doctor sometimes for that reason.
-1	In all honesty nothing. I'm normally very calm going to the doctor. I have lots of trusts the doctor will help take care of any medical problem 
-1	It's the normal. Everyone is afraid of dying. I'm no different. I'm  anxious that the doctor will find something and it will be something horrible, something fatal, something no one can do anything about. My mother went to the doctor for knee and came out having found out she had a slow moving form of liver disease. It can happen. You can go in with a minor ache or pain and come out knowing what's going to kill you.
-1	Nothing makes  me anxious  or worried about seeing my doctor. She always  gives me a good checkup and tells me if something is wrong and how to fix it.
1	I am worried that they are going to tell me I have some huge problem and then judge me for it. Or that they may just say I do so they can make money. Or make me feel uncomfortable about myself. I am a very private person. The best case scenario is that I go in they say I have a clean bill of health and I just paid them for that. 
1	I have had nurses and doctors underestimate pain, so I am constantly worried that I will not be taken seriously or believed. 
-1	what makes you feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is just general anxiety. Or general worry nothing specific
1	I do not go to the doctor's office very often - only when there is something I am concerned about.  Therefore, I am anxious or worried that something is truly wrong with me.  I fear the unknown the most because both of my parents have had cancer situations and my youngest sister has a rare disease.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worries. I feel my doctor is capable of giving me the care that I need and providing me with good information.
1	My family has had a lot of serious diseases and health issues.  I have had cancer.  I have learned it can certainly happen to you. Lost a lot of family at a young age.
1	Surroundings,how his or her day is going what is the doctor willing to do as a doctor his or her own health Care and home life
-1	The people around me may be sick or hurt and I don't want to catch whatever they have for example theflu
-1	I am most anxious about the doctor not knowing what the issue is.  I am anxious about anything requiring surgery.  I am fearful of debilitation.
-1	The fact that they can get very intimate into my personal life, both physically and emotionally.  They also can sometimes be slightly vague with what their thinking is on my health.
-1	When I have already pretty much surmised or at least guessed what the problem is, my ocassional fears are that medical tests or examinations will merely confirm this fear.
1	That I won't have good results and that I am trying to hard. And that I won't accmplish anything and that I would have to take more medications
1	I feel anxious or worried sometimes when  visiting the doctor because I am unsure if my illness may be something worse. I also get worried that I will receive bad news about my health at some point during the visit. I never fully calm down until I have left the office with a good bill of health.
1	My weight and how they look down on it. I get tired of that being the first thing they say to me in and every time plus I'm nervous first meeting a new doctor
1	I know that it will be very rushed, and that I will almost certainly not get all of my concerns addressed during the visit.
-1	If i have something wrong with me but i do not know the cause this causes me to be nervous or worried. My family has a history of cancer and diabetes so I worry that I will one day receive a diagnosis from my doctor as well of one of these conditions. 
-1	They usually have some difficulty finding a vein in one arm, but other people are better in other locations. I do dread my colonoscopies since the last one was painful. But not much else..so far, since I'm relatively young.
1	Tests and always being fearful of the unknown. I don't know what my tests results will show so it makes me worry about what it could be.
1	I'm at an age where my friends are dying off one by one,I am worried of the   prognosis of medicines and surgeries they went though,me it's almost impossible to get insurance with uncertainty now day 3/4 of my pay would be premiums.
1	I am always afraid that i will be worse off than i actually am. One of these days I am worried that I will be right.
-1	I usually feel anxious about my weight and blood pressure.  I worry that is something is really wrong will I e able to afford treatment and still pay the bills
-1	I feel anxious that maybe i have not taken care of myself as much as i should and that it may have lead to some form of problem that i do not notice that needs to take care of. I have had conditions in the past that i worry may come back
-1	Nothing really,Everytime I visit my doctors office I'll always feel at home. And that's all l have to tell you people 
-1	I have osteoporosis and I feel worried waiting for scan results.  The medicine I am currently taking has caused leg pain severe enought that I can't walk for several hours, and I am afraid that this pain will reoccur.
-1	I feel anxious about the probable poking and prodding that will take place, and the inevitable disdain that the doctor will evoke once I start making suggestions that might contradict something they had stated. I also worry about the possible copay. 
-1	I NEVER FEEL ANXIOUS OR WORRIED. I HAVE WORKED MANAGING MY HEALTH WITH MY DOCTOR FOR YEARS, I GET REGULAR CHECK-UPS AND TESTING, I EAT RIGHT AND I EXERCISE REGULARY, SO IF SOMETHING DID OR IN THE FUTURE DOES COME UP ON AN EXAM, I KNOW THAT I WOULD BE CATCHING IT EARLY.
1	when i am experiencing a medical problem I sometimes have anxiety about it. The unknown makes me anxious

1	I tend to always over thunk everything making situation that weren't even there cause its all in my head I'm always worring about something over thinking every situation 
-1	Contracting the flu or another airborne pathogen while waiting in the waiting room. Other than that, not much. Most of our visits are well checks where we have no urgent medical treatment needs. So, we spend most of our time making sure our hands are washed and cleaned and use both face masks for protection.
-1	Sometimes when I think about my future or something I tend to get worried but there's a lot of things that worry ne

1	When I go to the doctors it is for something serious, last year I had all over body edema so yeah I was anxious 
-1	I don't see  my doctor that often and do not like all of the optional treatments and drugs that they recommend.

I get anxious that they are going to put me on the spot and insist I need medicine that I do not.
-1	I am not anxious or worried when I visit my physician.  It's only once a year. Some of these questions should reflect the previous page's responses.
1	I don't like needles. If I have to have my blood drawn I'm anxious. I get useated by the experience.

-1	Finding out my vital signs or weight makes me the most anxious.  I know it is usdually up whenever I go to the office.
1	I am anxious  that the doctor will find a problem. I especially worry about a recurrence of cancer. I also worry about having to have invasive testing or blood work. Waiting around for the doctor to come also makes me anxious.
1	I think what make me anxious is just the whole environment of being at the doctor's office. It is not a comfortable feeling at all. It makes me feel very anxious. Further it makes me worried because I always feel like they are going to say things that are terrible. Or that the doctor is going to do tests I do not want nor like. In all the atmosphere of the doctor's office makes me anxious at best. It is not a good feeling. It just evokes bad feelings and the want to not even go. The anticipation sitting in the examination room waiting for the doctor not only creates anxiety but also worry. I have never been to the doctor's office and can say I felt at ease and calm. The whole experience of going to the doctor is just not conducive of good feelings. 
-1	
1	I feel that anxious that my doctor will find something really wrong with me.  I worry that I will have to go to the hospital or have some procedure done.  It is the fear of having a serious medical condition.

1	That we will miss something that we should be monitoring or exploring.    That he will not examine me thoroughly.   
1	Waiting for results of my blood test knowing that any changes can decide whether you need a new medication or further test is needed based you being out of the recommended score.
-1	I don't get anxious at the doctor's office. If I have something wrong with me and they run tests then I might worry about the results, but otherwise I'm pretty calm.
1	What makes me anxious is the explanation of the sickness my doctor would say. For example, if I am feeling very massive pain, and I was required to run some tests such as ultra sound, blood test, urine test, etcetera, I would be extremely worried the doctor  might tell me I have a major disease. What also makes me anxious is if I would have a surgery or incision been operated on me. That definitely worries me sometimes when I am at the docotr
-1	Not knowing what is wrong with me and hoping that it isn't the worst case scerio.
1	I'm most worried about what the process is going to be and how awkward it'll feel. I'm more comfortable with a woman being my doctor and I have a male doctor, so I'm slightly uncomfortable.I'm also worried about if something is going to be found wrong.
1	I'm always afraid they will find something terribly wrong that I wasn't aware of. Lots of issues have no warnings or so subtle you never think it's anything substantial.
1	I worry that they will not help me deal with my health issues but will send me away with no help. I feel that my health concerns are rarely taken seriously enough.

1	I feel the waiting is the hardest part and I always don't know what to expect and will spend some time worrying if there is something more serious than I think going on. The longer I have to wait the more time I have to worry about things I probably shouldn't be worrying about in the first place.
1	I worry the the doctor might find a serious issue that will negatively affect my life. I also sometimes worry that the doctor will not be able to diagnose me properly and I might have to go to another physician.
1	Wondering if they will they get frustrated. Will this be fruitless and a waste of money. Can they help me.
1	Having to pay money i dont have to go. Made ti go because i have high blood preasure and she want a examevery 6 months. 
1	that we will have a discussion of my weight or sugar levels i exercise and work out but its alway a grind
1	depending on the situation i worry about a scary diagnosis, or if it is a checkup i worry they will find something wrong with me, even if i felt fine. i worry about being shocked that i have something wrong.
-1	The most uncomfortable thing is the regular check ins. You would like to view your doctor as family or a friend, but sometimes you just never know. I guess everything is fine. It can just be uncomfortable sometimes
-1	I do not worried or get anxious when I go to the doctor office.  I turn everything over to the Lord.  He the one that can handled any problems.  He is key to life.
-1	Just the wait and time it takes to get through everything.
1	I am always more worried before a procedure.  A checkup doesn't really bother me, but if I have to have surgery or blood taken or something like that, then I become very anxious.  I worry about what will happen during and after the procedure and how I will feel.
1	I hate going in and having to wait hours to be able to see the doctor.  And then you wait another hour in the room with the nurse doing the basics. She writes everything down. Then I have to tell the whole story again to the doctor while they input the information again and again. They hardly spend any time listening to your heart or examining you at all.  It has been five years and I have not had a pap smear.  They say because of my age that they do not need to do that, but I am still sexually active.  So therefore, it should be done. My step mom had cervical cancer at 75.  So it can happen.
-1	The unknown of not knowing if your condition is really very serious or not, and how much time and expense that it might take to treat it.

-1	I AM WORRIED THEY ARE GOING TO FIND SOMETHING MAJOR THAT IS WRONG WITH ME.
1	Fear of the unknown.  I am worried about what she might find when doing an evaluation.  I am worried that she might find something wrong.
1	That they won't listen to me or assume i'm not taking my health seriously or that i'm not working towards it and so decide not to help me explore additional/alternative options.
1	Because I don't want to find out something is wrong with me. I always worry that there's some problem that I don't even know about yet.
-1	I feel dirty when I go into a doctors waiting room. And especially in the back room where you see the doctor. I think of all the sick people that are in the same area and it makes me feel very dirty. Like I need to take a shower as soon as possible or something.
-1	I have had chronic migraines for three years and when I see him, I worry that nothing will change.  If I go for other reasons, sometimes I worry because I think too much about what might be wrong.
1	Most of the times it's the uncertainty about how severe the illness is, the pain involved when getting diagnosed etc.
-1	One of my biggest concerns with visiting a doctor's office involve receiving bad news or being treated too quickly and the doctor not doing a full job. As patients we sometimes wait long periods to see the doctor, so the idea we can be pushed out fast is worrisome.
1	Feeling is the nominalization of the verb to feel.[1] The word was first used in the English language to describe the physical sensation of touch through either experience or perception. The word is also used to describe experiences other than the physical sensation of touch

1	Well i get anxious or sometimes worried because either i don't want the news that the doctor might give me or i might tense up and recieve some long paper work i hadn't anticiapated.
1	I have difficulty explaining properly where and how something will cause me pain. Knowing the right words to explaining how something is not right can be difficult for me. 
-1	I feel most anxious when the physician is new to me. If the physician is not very friendly and personable I really get beyond worried I get agitated and really mad. Some physicians don't even take the time to really look at you. They look at test results or talk to their computer as they are putting information into it for your record. I have no use for those type of physicians and will not go back but look for another one.
1	I usually worry about my health and having to interact and explain myself to doctors and nurses. Visiting a doctor's office is also usually a big interruption in my usual daily routine, which makes me anxious. 
-1	When I had cervical cancer I always had a scare in my life with abnormal cells so when I go to the Dr now I'm always on pins and needles
-1	Occasionally, I feel anxious at the doctor's office. I feel like I am in a vulnerable position and I do not know if something will be wrong with me that I did not know about before.
1	Anxious because of health concerns and my worrying that as I age I will, or may, have more health issues
1	i feel anxious with the waiting i suppose, especially if something is wrong i want to know what it is, how serious, etc. spending time in the doctor's office isn't what i would be doing out of choice
-1	if it is a follow up for something unknown
1	because I am just a little scared about my results that I may or may not be getting back. And that is my answer fot this question
1	Not knowing what to expect.  Potential for more tests.
-1	They could find that something is wrong with me.
-1	I always worry before my annual PCP visit that maybe my health might be taking a downturn, because every visit prior he tells me I have perfect labwork and everything else. I just want to have A+ health every time.
-1	When I have to get on a scale. I hate getting on a scale...period. I'm not morbidly obese or anything, but it makes me very anxious. I wish people didn't insist on weighing  people everywhere. 
-1	I always feel anxious because i think he might find something wrong that cannot be easily fixed, or that is chronic.
1	I never know what to expect. My family has a history of cancer, so I'm always afraid that routine scans or checkups will result in them finding something that shouldn't be there. I'm concerned that I won't know how to react to what they tell me, or that  they won't find something until it's too late. 
1	That after running test and getting a full physical that the doctor will find something I didn't know was there.
-1	that i am wasting my time and that they won't listen to me about what the problem truely is, they just want me out.
1	With my doctor being rude n mean, it makes me really uncomfortable seeing him. He makes my skin crawl with disgust when it comes to exam.
1	that she won't address my concerns or my questions in a manner that completely answers them in a way that isn't rushed or taken everything into account.
1	It is when I have to do extra tests and have to wait for the results. Sometimes having to change medicine at times 
1	When I need specific medication my doctor is very judgemental and when I ask for specific stuff i read about online he totally hates on the ideas and takes a very holier than though attitude with me and says no to any sort of request I make so he makes me nervous
-1	I don't really feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office. I believe the more positive you feel the better you will feel no matter what the news is it will be what it will be.

-1	I always have that lingering fear at my yearly ladies appointment that it will be discovered that I have cancer or something.  I think many women feel that way. 
1	What makes me most anxious is finding out the worst possible news in regards to the medical conditions I have had. I feel this way because I am a worse case scerio kind of person.  So I already have thoughts of what they might tell me.
-1	The doctors office has always been a place that is scary to me. It is just the thought of the unknown, because we have all heard stories about the people who just go in for a normal check up and find something terribly wrong or something of that nature, and plus I had to get a series of painful shots when I was younger, so my perception of the doctor's office and hospitals has never been very good, although it has gotten better. It is more the place itself, and the unknown factor that worries me than anything that my doctor or any other physician does.
1	Things that I have not noticed and the doctor might. And any treatment that might impact my life in a way that might be unpleasant.
1	Whenever I go in for something it seems like they find something else wrong. The reason why I went in there never gets addressed so I end up having to go back 
1	I have a chronic condition that killed my mother. I am always worried that it will become worse. Secondly is the unknown. By that I mean what if something new has cropped up? I am a passenger in this body and I will not get a second one. There is always the uncertainty of the unknown.
-1	 Not knowing what the outcome will be. Wondering if they will be able to figure out what's wrong, and give me the proper treatment. 
-1	I sometimes think it is going to be worse than it really is, that I might have something serious when it isn't 
1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious is fear of the unknown. Sometimes I worry something might be seriously wrong with me.
1	Your doctor should listen to your answers and offer you suggestions for managing your anxiety symptoms. A family doctor, however, does not specialize in mental health conditions and may not be qualified to treat you. He should provide referrals to psychiatrists or psychologists in your area that are better qualified to work with you and create a treatment plan for you.
-1	I rarely get those type of feeling I try and follow my doctor instructions she hasn't fell me yet.  For the most part she is always been fair.
1	I feel worried or anxious when visiting the doctors because I am not used to doing so. I don't like how white and clean and empty the patient rooms are, how odd and sterile they are. I don't like having the possibility to be told that there is something seriously wrong with me either.
1	Needles. I absolutely hate them due to having injections into my neck that hurt so bad I passed out. I'd rather have my appendix removed (again) than have those injections done again.
1	I am not an anxious or worrisome person, but I do often feel these emotions in a doctor's office. Sometimes I worry that my condition may be worse than I am assuming. Also, I guess as a gut feeling, I just don't like doctor's offices, which helps to invoke these emotions.
1	When I had to go in for a CT scan of my head after a surgery (I moved shortly after this surgery so this hospital was new), the doctors started freaking out because there was a significant amount of blood around my brain, which we knew about after my surgery. They however didn't and they admitted me and were contemplating doing emergency surgery even though I wasn't displaying any alarming symptoms like I should have. Long story short, that even made me terrified of going to the doctor, because being hospitalized that rapidly even though I felt fine was really disturbing, and to think that if things didn't work out for me, I could have never seen the outside world again just like that. 
1	I am most anxious that I am going to get some bad news about a problem I have no control over and there is nothing I can do about it
1	Not knowing what new problem may have been discovered from recent lab work. I'm always a little anxious about what my blood pressure reading will be.
1	The fear of being told something could be seriously wrong with my health is the main thing that stresses me out. Another factor is, being a person who has struggled with eating disorders, being told the number on the scale, whether it is higher or lower than I expect, gives me so much anxiety. After hearing the number, I don't think about anything else and I usually revert to bad behavior. Anything that involves my weight puts me on edge - it's very triggering for me and, unfortunately, hearing information about it form a doctor is very important, so it is inevitable that I become nervous during a visit.
1	I only go to the office when something is bothering me, so I am worried about my condition at the time. I am bad about thinking the worse, so I tend to dwell on that until I see the doctor.
-1	i want all the test and everything to come back normal or ok. i dont want anything to be wrong. its a little worrying being in a doctor setting
1	Even if nothing feels wrong, I'll get nervous that I've got some major health issue that I wasn't aware of. I'm in my late 30's, and although I'm in pretty good health now, I'm always afraid that issues of some sort are just around the corner for me. 
1	I get worried that I will receive bad news in regards to a a problem that I have going on and I hope it turns out for the best
-1	Again, it is not necessarily feeling these things outright and instead, just wanted to be prepared and anticipatory. Being aware increases the chances for finding the best solution. 
1	First, the paper gown is a nightmare. Who doesn't feel anxious wearing only a bit of paper? My usual appointment is for an annual exam, so there's always anxiety about having potentially cold and uncomfortable metal objects put in my girl bits. And, of course, the fear that the doctor is going to find something horrible/fatal
-1	I'm never anxious or worried when I have a doctor's visit. I always go in calm and collective and I hardly ever have any problems.
-1	I am always a little bit anxious that the doctor may have some bad news for me. It is also not very fun to be poked and prodded and I have a fear of needles. 
1	I worry about the doctor giving me a lecture about my weight or other lifestyle choices. I am also afraid of being told that something could be wrong with me, especially something that I could have prevented if I had taken care of myself better or come in more urgently. I also worry sometimes if I will be taken seriously when I list my concerns and symptoms, or if they will be brushed off.
-1	
-1	Any thought of health issues makes me anxious and give a little anxiety to anybody not just me. It does not have anything to do with my feelings of the capabilities of my doctor
1	Authority figures in general make me feel uneasy, but i hate going to the doctor. i am not sure why, I also hate getting naked in front of anyone who is not my fiance. That is a huge trigger for my anxiety. I don't like being poked and proded or touched.
-1	I'm not particularly comfortable with anyone touching me. I also worry that something is terribly wrong with me.
-1	sometimes don't know if theres really something wrong but i trust my doctors decisions most of the time                                         
-1	What makes me anxious and worried is that they do not listen to what I want or trying to do things a tural way. They just blindly follow protocol and make money for big pharma. Free healthcare is one thing but It would be so much better if we could afford decent rent and space to take care of our well being instead of expensive rent, small spaces and cheap food so that we are stressed and unhealthy. 
1	Getting wrong advice because I don't fully understand medical language.
-1	I just dont want to get any bad news
1	Not a big fan of being around people in general,but like my father am a master of illusion.      Never worried or anxious, only phobic.
1	That there might get be negative test results come back and I'm gonna pair. I get jittery. Sweaty and hate myself. I dread the doctors 
-1	If im super sick or think something may be wrong then seeing the doctor and getting that either confirmed or not is stressful
-1	when i go the doctors office the past i was over weight diabetic for about ayear and i would get an earful everytime. this last appoint was months later and my conditions had changed dramatically. i had unknowinly dropped 20 pounds in 9 weeks with a1c 10 dropping 10 points as  well. the doctor stopped his lecturing 
-1	I have never felt anxious when I see any doctor.  I am very pro-active in taking care of myself and believe strongly in preventative care.  I may sometimes be worried about something I may be experiencing at the time, but I am always one to not let any health issue go without seeing a doctor.
-1	don't like doctor's offices in general and don't particularly enjoy hearing bad news. excessive time in the waiting area is no fun either..
-1	Nothing right now.  I would be anxious if I suspected that I had a serious medical condition or other major concern. 
-1	Most times I feel anxious knowing having faith that what the doctor tells me to do will work for my problem and it always does worried because I don't know what the doctor will find out about my condition
-1	I usually have alot of visits to the doctor because of a few health issues i have. And always when i get examined i am anxious even thou i know i am okay i would always be anxious cause you never know how your body is going to change wether in a good way or bad.
1	With having MS I want to make sure to address all issues or questions I may have, so I write all of them to reduce being anxious.
1	i worry alot about doctors office visits, i dont like going to the doctors to be honest with you. i dont like to go 
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried during a doctor's appointment is serious, potentially life-threatening conditions. For cancer screening, I always become worried about what the doctor may find.
1	If I go to the doctor's office, it's because I already know that something is wrong.  I'm in tune with my body and only go to the doctor's when absolutely necessary.  So, I get anxious if I can't tell what's wrong with me and worried about the diagnosis; some people in my family died fairly young.
1	Because they wanna give me reasons why things are happening and they are wrong alot of the times. My doctor told me I had tingling in my feet because of vitamin D deficiency. Well I been taking vitamin D and the tingling is back so obviously that wasnt the reason.
-1	I just worry sometimes that they might find something that I already didn't know about.  I don't like to be surprised usually.  Especially when it comes to my own body and health.
1	You never know what the results will be.  You can go in there for a light pain and it turns into more. 
1	That the doctor may find a tumor or tell me that I have a major health illness. Even if I do not trust what the doctor is saying, this is enough to scare me and make me feel like I'm going to die! I think the entire situation of being in a dr office is intimidating. I am not sure if this is designed on purpose but the environment makes you extra anxious.  The whole waiting period amplifies this. 
1	I'm always afraid that the doctor will find something wrong.  I have always had a dread for some diseases and think that I'm destined to develop them.
-1	Right the only thing is hearing that I have major health issues going on.as with anyone everyone hates receiving bad news.
-1	The fact that something else could be wrong with me. I usually like going to the doctors. So, not too   much stress.
-1	It is not the doctor personally, it is hoping my results came out positively. Also hoping that any concerns I mentioned to my doctors, he or she find me trustworthy.
-1	When I visit my doctor after having blood tests or something like that done, I feel dread sometimes because I don't know the outcome of the tests, and of course I'm concerned that I may get bad news.
1	Sometimes I don't know what they are going to tell me once I enter their office. The doctors office can be extremely scary especially when you aren't sure what's going on with you. Sometimes the anxiety comes from looking up symptoms online and they give you multiple issues that can be what's written no with you
-1	"I often wonder if they are going to be on time with my appointment, will they make me feel ""rushed"" and uncomfortable about asking questions and wanting more answers, will my appointment get cancelled due to an emergency."
-1	Theirs always that chance that any of us humans can get bad news at the dr.s. thats why I dont like to see em.  Not even for a visit. Lol.  I should tho I kno I kno
1	I hate having to slightly disrobe for something that is no fun at all! If the doctor looked like Brad Pitt, then I would be happy to go. 
1	The thing that makes me the most anxious or worried about visiting the doctors office is something going wrong or me be diagnosed with something.
1	You never truly know what a doctor could tell you. Your body and mind can feel 100% sometimes and the inside of you could be completely destroyed. 
1	I get irratiol fears that my ear infection will somehow end up being cancer. This is the mindset I normally have when I visit the doctors so I normally have a healthy amount of anxiety when I have to go in.
1	That they will discover something that is seriously wrong with me that I did not know about or did not have any symptoms for
-1	Hearing bad news.
1	Don't like going to the Dr. and I always get a cold after going there.  They always seem to find something wrong and push medications/shots on me that I do not feel are needed.  Don't want to have to worry about my weight gain/loss every single time I go.
1	I feel that a doctor is reacting to my symptoms but rarely cares to work on discovering what is causing it. They are more inclined to just hand me a prescription and send me on my way.
1	When I go there, sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my time. Because they want to input the things they have learned by the books. Sometimes you can't go by the books, because every case is different.
-1	Don't really feel worried. Just depends if its something major would make me feel worried. 
1	"I use to feel very anxious when visiting the doctor as a child. I often had no idea what to expect and I often wondered what would happen if they couldn't figure out what was making me sick. Today the anxiety that I faced as a child has been greatly diminished. My current doctor and his office is really great about setting forth a game plan. Before any exam happens I'll be told what to expect so I'm not going into anything blind. Once the exam is over I'm given options on the course of treatments that are available. There is still some small part of me that gets worried before I'm seen because I roll through the ""what if they can't figure out what's wrong with me"" bit in my head. I've come to discover that this is unfounded which helps with future visits."
1	what makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office is if they change protocols or anything changes or is new
1	I might be diagnosed with something horrible. I may need to have further examinations. I may be billed a very high amount.
-1	What I feel most anxious or worried about when visiting the doctor's office is probably the wait of the actual appointment. I could not get into the doctor for a month with a condition that had me worried it was something serious. Unfortunately, the doctor was booked up and then when the appointment came, the doctor was with another patient for a little longer than scheduled so I appreciate her being with someone else and helping them but the waiting game was making me anxious.
-1	The sterility.
-1	The medications that the doctors give me they make me feel very on edge because you never know what side effects it has
-1	"I most worried that the doctor will simply ignore my complaints and do the ""see me again in three months"" nonsense I've been dealing with for the past several years. "
-1	I hate getting on the scales.  My doctor wants me to loose weight and I will really try and then I get on the scales at his office and I've either gained a few pounds or stayed the same.
1	What makes me anxious about my doctors appointments is sometimes I have to tell what's really going on and scared she will judge me.

1	I never know how long I'm going to be there, how I will be treated by office staff, what things the doctor may say or find.
1	I feel anxious about getting pap smears and breast exams.  I worry about what the results will be for these tests and other tests.
-1	
-1	Hearing bad news always make a person nervous and anxious. That is where doctors step in and clarify all doubts.
-1	When I go to the doctor's office for something serious - that isn't just a regular checkup - I'm more worried about what's wrong with me than what the doctor's gon do to me. I know my doctors aren't going to do anything weird, or try to make me take any weird medicine that doesn't actually work so that I'll just keep coming back to them. I feel like I can actually trust my doctors, even though I understand that not everyone feels that way with their own doctors.
-1	That they will find I have a serious condition that will adversely affect my lifestyle either due to treatments or illness. 
1	i sometimes become worried because i tend to imagine the kind of disease they will find that i am suffering from,i fear the kind of injections and medications i will go through and at the same time i fear loosing my life because of illness
1	Now that I am getting older, I worry they may find something that could be serious.
1	Usually the thing that makes me most anxious is having to sit in a waiting room surrounded by sick people who are coughing and sneezing and being afraid I will catch something from them.
-1	im a lesbian. how much will i have to explain after that. what stuopid questions they may ask about birthcontrol, or sex activity, which usually reveals they don't know meaning of word lesbian
-1	I hate waiting for my appointment time when I arrive ahead of or on time. The waiting sparks my anxiety and resulting psychological discomfort. 
-1	I don't really feel anxious about visiting the doctor's office. If anything, I might be worried about arriving late to the appointment. I wouldn't like being late.

1	I feel anxious when I know that he is checking for new problems to an existing condition.  So far everything has turned out okay, but I still tend to get anxious and a little bit worried.
1	Probably being told that there are more serious issues than I though there was and having to do more treatment. 
1	Waiting for certain tests that can impact your life, for the rest of your life. Waiting for the doctor to tell you your too old to do this or that, or acting like a physical injury will heal in my 60's just like it did when I was young. When the doctor orders surgery, and you realize there is a slight chance that you might not wake up from it. That he will prescribe medicine that you can't live without.
1	My Dr ia not the best Dr, but I still dislike going. I always feel pain yet my dr over looks it. Almost to az if i lie. I have no reason to lie about my health.

1	I have social anxiety, everyone makes me anxious. But being in a place that knows you are having difficulties makes it worse. Nurses, PA's, Doc's all rushing around coming in and going out.
