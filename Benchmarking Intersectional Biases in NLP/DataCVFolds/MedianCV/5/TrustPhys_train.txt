-1	Sometimes they are in a hurry to get to the next patient and make quick, sp judgments that do not apply.  Sometimes they are much more interested in what insurance plan you have than your well being.
-1	I feel that my primary care physician is adequate. He does listen and try to help with my medical issues. However he also refuses to try new procedures and treatments that might help me.
1	It's their job to be honest and to give me all of the information available
1	I trust my doctor completely. He has never wronged me and he is always willing to listen to my most intimate problems and give objective advice on what to do to treat any ailments I have.
1	My primary care physician was able to correctly diagnose a rare inner ear condition that I have.
-1	I'm still alive!  He must be doing something right.
-1	I primarily trust my doctor. She seems to be interested in what's best for me, not necessarily what's fastest or most convenient.
-1	I think my doctor is generally trustworthy.  I wonder sometimes with the things he says if he is pushing me to get on drugs because he wants to write RX for those types of drugs.
1	He has been our family physician forever, I trust him to make decisions that positively affect our family. 
1	They're busy and tired, but they have guidelines and responsibilities to give me the best care for me. They didn't waste all that time in school and during their career to give me poor treatment. I trust them.
-1	I don't really have an opinion of most doctors. Some are good and some are shitty.
1	They have given me the proper care I have needed up until this point.
-1	I trust my family doctor greatly. I've been using him since I was a teenager. I never had a problem with him.
-1	I do trust Docs but they also are human and can be moody, high strung and sometimes jackasses
-1	I'm usually a pretty healthy individual, so I only ever go see him for my regular annual physicals. I really have no reason to doubt what he tells me, since I'm a very low-maintenance person health wise.
-1	I distrust my primary physician because all you here these days are how people are being prescribed things that they don't need 
-1	My dr. won't let me ask a lot of questions. Like my diabetes medicine. I tried asking about getting something else but he told me no. I wish there was a way that I could learn more
-1	My doctor tends to diagnose most problems as the same thing so I don't always agree with all he says.
-1	Just started seeing this doctor and they harp on and on about needing to lose weight.  I get the feeling that they would blame any issue I'm having on my weight and not want to investigate further.
-1	I trust my primary care physician when we talk about what could be wrong, and early treatments.  However I always go online and take a look about what I can find and see what other options are.  I know that the health system is not perfect, and I try to minimize doing anything unnecessary.
-1	I do not know my physician well enough because I do not visit him very frequently. I also do not trust people too much to begin with.
-1	I've only seen my doctor once for a physical and she seemed a little dismissive of my concerns. I was told by a different doctor I may have a condition that requires a simple blood test but she stated that it was unnecessary and ignored my symptoms. 
-1	I trust my physician to a point. The only thing I don't like is getting my blood pressure taken, and then I don't get told immediately what it is. I need to have this information.
1	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him
1	I have been going to the same doctor for 40 years.  I completely think he understands me and has my best interests in mind.
-1	They have gotten prominent degrees and I have good reason to trust them.
1	I trust my PCP because she paid attention to the fact that I had a goiter, when no one else would, and she's treating my hypothyroidism, when no one else took it seriously.
-1	I trust my doctor because it seems he always has my best interests in mind. He doesn't lie to me as far as I know. He also doesn't just push medication on me, he tries to understand what I actually need.
1	I trust my doctor because I have a long relationship with her, she has shown me that she is capable. She has helped me many times.
-1	I haven't had a lot of experience with my new doctor that would allow me to build a proper relationship.
-1	I view them more of a guide than an expert on everything. For more common occurrences, I believe he has his way of doing things, which isn't necessarily the only way or even the best way. 
-1	it depends on the person. not all doctors are good
1	I picked my physician based on ratings and reviews and when I met with her I realized and I could trust her.
1	In general, my primary care physician has been a very good fit for me.  He does work in a very busy practice, so I can imagine that he might overlook something in my care, but I have not seen him do so in my dealings with him.
1	The first time I went to see my primary care physician he spent a lot of time with me getting to know about my problems. He sat down, looked concerned, and wanted to know more information so that he could help me. He also listens to me when I have a different medication request and he is very easy to work with.
-1	I don't really trust or distrust him, I am kind of ambivalent about him.  He seems perfectly nice but he's usually in quite a rush and makes me feel like I'm a hassle just for being there sometimes.  I don't like that he doesn't remember or check information in my chart, especially since it's a small practice and I've been there for years.  If I'm in for strep throat or something, he always tries to prescribe a medicine I'm allergic to and his nurse has to stop him.
-1	I usually trust my doctor. Sometimes when he is rushed he doesn't give me the attention I ask for. For example, I had concerns over side effects from medication and he was in a hurry so shrugged it off. 
-1	I feel my doctor is knowledgeable and genially concerned with my health and well being. He is a caring person and isn't worried about how much money he can make.
-1	I have gone to him for several years.   he takes time to listen and gives useful feedback.   
-1	I trust my doctor's motives; I don't think his knowledge is always complete.  I live in a relatively small town and use a primary-care physician simply to order things like routine cholesterol screenings, and perhaps as a first source of information about things I can't figure out myself. If I had a significant medical problem, I would try to drive somewhere else and see a specialist.
-1	They work for a business just like anyone else. You can't trust them more than you trust any salesman.
1	I have seen my same doctor for a long time. He always has my best interest in mind. I have always been able to rely on his judgement. 
1	I go to him because I do not understand enough about what is wrong to make a decision. If I didn't trust my doctor, I wouldn't have gone
-1	I really want to trust my doctor but I think we have gotten away from the family physician model and now we just see anyone.  And each doctor is different so you basically always start over at square one each visit
-1	I don't trust doctors in general because most of them don't take their own advice on eating/exercise. Most of them also just flat out laugh in your face when you decide to take control over what happens to your body and just don't follow their instructions blindly. Doctors that I have been to in the past have been pushy for me to get certain shots or things that I have researched and decided I don't want. 
-1	"Doctors are only out to make as much money as possible. There should never be a time when you make an appointment at a doctors and have to wait a month to see them or be told to go to the ER ""if"" it's an emergency. Doctors should have patient CAPS and all doctors should be required to take all insurances. Also a doctor should never have so many appointments that you see their nurses aid instead of them."
-1	They tend to go for the easiest and quickest solution possible so they can see as many patients a day as possible. They are not after helping people, they are after making money.
1	My doctor will always lay out several options if I have a problem and she will go over all of them with me and tell me the pluses and minuses to each one and then she will help me to make the best choice for what I need and if she disagrees with something I have chosen she will tell me why and then say what she thinks would be a better choice
-1	I trust my PCP to an extent, but my full confidence and faith does not rely on man--but on my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
1	I know him personally so I know he'd tell the truth
-1	I think for the most part my doctors are honest. However, I still factor in my own opinions. 
-1	I don't trust them anymore. I will go to the Emergency room if I have to but the doctors where I live are all foreign. The nurses in the hospital are all from Haiti. I live near 33460 and we have tons of illegals and foreign people here. They don't seem to care as much about quality of care, like I had growing up in Alabama.
1	My PCP is very thorough in every appointment and takes the time to not only discuss options, but also make sure that there is no pressure to pick a particular option since it is my treatment. 
-1	It's all about the money, not the patients... they are just a sick-people mill.
1	She has never lied or led me in the wrong direction.
1	I feel my doctor explains his decisions fully and gives me the opportunity to take part in the process. I feel he is intelligent and I have no reason not to trust him.
-1	I believe he's a good guy I generally trust him. Gut reaction
1	I trust my doctor because the information he has provided has been accurate and in line with any additional testing I have had done. 
-1	Trust by verify. I am smart enough to know not to trust my internet/google searches when it comes to my health, but I'm also smart enough to know that 99 times out of 100 my minor ailments and annual checkups are best handled by my PCP and I can rely on his expertise
-1	They have always been open and honest and answer all my questions throuhgly
1	I have a good relationship with my doctor. She has always been very helpful. She is always willing to listen to my thoughts and concerns and is never forceful in her suggestions.
1	I really like my primary care physician. He is never in a rush with even though he may be busy with patients. I ask a lot of questions and he always answers them. He gives me his thoughts but allows for me to make my decision on my own
-1	I don't know if I trust doctor's in general, I feel that they may be only looking out for themselves, but I can't pinpoint why. It's probably just distrust for that type in general.
-1	I distrust because Dr's are human too.
-1	I trust my PCP because a previous Dr had misdiagnosed me, so I went to my current Dr. for a second opinion.  He immediately sent me to the ER and it ultimately saved my life.
-1	I have a tumor in my jaw and there are treatments out there for it, but it seems like the surgeons try to persuade me to have surgery without being open to other options. Only one has told me about other options.
-1	I think alot of the time they make alot of money off people having disease that they over diagnose and over medicate
-1	I trust them to do their job. They have the knowledge and hopefully the honesty to do it correctly
-1	At times, non-traditiol treatment options may be overlooked or undervalued depending on a doctor's experience and history, when altertive options paired with modern medicine can find a useful balance.
-1	I have not had any problems with my doctor. The only thing i don't trust or have a problem with is when i think something needs to be checked or im worried about someone it is brushed off and not taken seriously.
-1	I trust her because I have know her for years and she is very approachable and friendly. She is willing to be honest and frank with me, even if the truth hurts.
-1	I have been seeing the same primary for years, since I was a teeger. He delivered my oldest daughter and he has always been forthcoming.  He is also the primary for most of the women in my family and has always been wonderful to all of us.
-1	I find that often doctors just do whatever is needed for them to get from patient to patient (take as little time as needed) and sometimes just don't listen to what their patient is saying to them.  I can understand their busy schedule but sometimes the care doesn't seem persol, just rushed.
-1	Most doctors really want to help. Though there might be some out there that don't want to help. Those are the kind that are in it for the money. But most doctors can be trusted
-1	He's fine.  I generally trust him or I wouldn't go to him. He's honest but that doesn't mean he knows everything or is up to date on the latest treatments.  He's not afraid to refer me to a specialist, which I appreciate.
-1	"I just sometimes feel that my doctor and doctors in general are in a rush. They do what they always do to treat certain problems. If their treatment doesn't work, then ""oh well."" I've had several medical issues that I've gone to doctors for over and over and I just don't get any real concern or any improvement. No persol care, so I just don't have a high level of trust."
1	I have been seeing the same primary care doctor since I was a child. I have complete faith in my doctor and will always take his suggestions and recommendations to heart.
-1	she's been the only doctor that has found an antidepressant that didn't give me side effects
1	Basically if I or my family have complaint about our health we will go to our family doctor. We trust our family doctor, if he ask us to see specialist we will do.
1	My doctor can relate to me and anybody else for that matter. She listens to me and my concerns and make sure that I have little to no worries. 
1	I have had a long-term relationship and we communicate well. I have never had any issues with this doctor.
-1	I trust them for the most part but they do seem to make sp judgements and not to go in depth as i would like
1	My physician has helped me every time I had a problem. She has given me the right treatments and made me feel better. I have no reason not to trust her at this point.
1	I trust my doctors because every time I had a problem with my health she steered me in the right direction 
1	She is knowledgeable and up to date on the latest research. She is caring and attentive as well. 
1	This doctor is a colleague and friend of the family. He was once my pediatrician and pediatrician to my younger sister that is now 25. He is also the pediatrician to my children as well. I can always go to him for a second opinion if needed. 
-1	I would suspect that a doctor that is engaging in activities that would lead to people questioning their legitimacy in their decisions wouldn't still be able to be a physician. All my physicians that I've ever had seemed to genuinely care about wanting to treat patients to the best of their abilities.
1	I feel that my doctor and I have a good relationship and that we can trust each other to work through any problems that might arise. I feel that my doctor knows that I want to know how my health is going and what I need to change in my life.
-1	Sometimes it feels as if they just want to get through with you and onto the next patient.
-1	Recently I was diagnosed with Lung Cancer. I've been telling my Dr. I had problems but he kept saying it was bronchitis. He got it wrong.
1	Because he saved my life. He was very good indiagnosing my illness.
1	They've never given me a reason to not trust them.
-1	I have been seeing them for many years.
1	I trust my doctor because he knows a lot more than me. He has vast experience, I have none.
-1	They are in it for the money. They do not actually care.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has a good education and asks me plenty of questions. I have never had a problem with him.
-1	Doctors are human, Some are qualified/competent, some are incompetent. Some put patient care over money, some put money over care, etc. I wouldn't blindly trust anyone for anything without doing some reasearch on my own, getting a second opinion if necessary, and considering the facts myself. 
-1	My physician has helped me in positive ways thus far, but I never like to put my complete trust in anyone because you just never know. 
-1	I don't really trust my primary care physician because he doesn't tend to remember information from visit to visit and he seems quick to throw a medication at any complaint without considering other options.
-1	I feel about average about these things. I think there are goo physicians but I also think some don't take things seriously. 
-1	I don't really trust doctors because in the United States, where I live, healthcare is a for-profit industry. Doctors are basically no different than salesman, and, selling products myself, I know what goes into trying to get people to buy a product. It's not honest; it's not about care; it's about money. I also think many doctors are not realistic about the way people live their lives.
1	I'm not an expert. I defer to my doctor because they are far more qualified to tell me about my health than I am. 
1	He took an oath to make sure his patients are cared for to the best of his ability. He went to school for years to get to where he is, and that means it's persol for him.
-1	i do trust him for the most part. in the past there were instances where me and some others have doubted him but as he grows older he seems to have more of a better understanding of things now.
-1	I distrust my primary care physician because she is always in a rush and in a hurry and basically often ignores what I am concerned about by brushing it off as no big deal. She often pushes medications as well when I make it clear that I do not want to use medicine as a first resort.
-1	My primary PCP is awesome. She answers all my questions, takes time with me and knows me and my family. I trust them. 
1	I believe that doctors enter the profession because they want to help people. It would be unethical for them to mislead their patients. 
-1	I've had the same primary care doctor my whole life, he's never done anything to make me feel like he isn't trustworthy or qualified.  He knows me very well (and my family) and I feel like I can trust him to do what's best for me.
-1	Overall, I do have some base trust in doctors. I recognize their position, and what it would take for them to make it there. Obviously, they've gone through extensive schooling and are well experienced. Thus, I should at minimum, respect their opinions and strongly consider them.
-1	While I do think that they can sometimes be thorough and careful, I do believe that sometimes it's only to fit their hypotheses. I don't firmly stand by that, but I do believe some just want to get patients in and out without so much as a second appointment or a scheduling more exams. 
-1	My doctor wants to give his all, but the time crunch between patients can make it difficult for him.  
1	I really like my current doctor.  He's younger than me, which is a little weird, but he is very open minded, more so than me.  He always gives me different  altertives  on how to treat myself 
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part. There are a few occasions when I do more research because I feel like the doctor is not telling me everything or that he doesn't have my best interest. When it comes down to it, I trust him more than often.
1	I trust my primary physician because they always walk me through all of my options with any issue I may be having. I never feel pushed into taking medicine or doing something I am not comfortable with. They answer all my questions and make me feel secure and knowledgeable in my health choices.
1	Always honest with me, asks me questions to really know what's going on and to also ensure I understand
-1	I HAVE NO REASON TO TRUST MY DOCTOR. HE IS ONLY INTERESTED IN HIS BOTTOM LINE. I NEED TO CHANGE DOCTORS
1	My doctor has always given me a real prognosis and I appreciate that. My clinical doctor has always checked my neck and given me through physicals to make me feel at ease. Any bumps or pains are always checked, and he makes me feel comfortable. 
1	Doctors care about people, thats why they do what they do. They are properly trained and can generally be trusted.
-1	Primary care physicians literally couldn't care less about what you have to say or the symptoms you have. They only care about the blood work. They want you in and out as fast as possible. Primary care physicians live to get off at 5. 
-1	I have been seeing my primary doctor for several years, and she is well known and thought of in our small community. I know her outside of the office as well. I fully trust her to help me solve any medical issues, or to at least help direct to any specialist I may need.
-1	My doctor is relatively new, and I had not been in a few years. I was very nervous, because I have never liked going to the doctor, hospital, etc. She was so easy mannered, understanding and really listened to my concerns. I liked that, and have been going back ever since for regular check-ups/ins.
-1	I trust my current PCP very much! I had very negative experience with a previous PCP who didn't want to take on my complicated medical history, but I am currently very lucky.
1	I've been going to my primary care doctor for years and she hasn't given me any reason to not trust her.  To the contrary, she lets me know that she is going to do what she thinks should be done, regardless if I like it or not.
-1	My doctor has never tried to push any medications on me. He is more likely to send me home and tell me to give it a few days than he is to prescribe a treatment. He's a no nonsense kind of guy.
-1	Because medical knowledge is still limited but doctors seem to think they have fil solutions, when in fact a lot of medicine is still trial and error. 
-1	Sometimes I fear that the pharmaceutical industry makes the decision what pills I get, rather than my persol doctor. I trust my doctor in terms of surgeries and maybe pain magement but outside of that, I wouldn't take any pills they recommend. 
-1	I wouldn't have complete trust in anyone over decisions regarding my health.  I think it's important to verify things and get second opinions to make sure I have as much information as possible.
1	I trust my doctor because he cares about what's good for me. He would not knowingly do something that would violate my trust in him.
-1	He seems capable, but not particularly out of the box or persol.  He seems a little confused and passive when I talk to him, but mostly that's because he's giving me basic info and agreeing with me.  There's also nothing particularly wrong with me, I just go for checkups, so it's not like I've really strained his abilities.
1	I just do? He gives me good vibes, he knows what he's talking about. I feel at ease and comfortable with the care that I get.
-1	I don't trust them because they have god complex.  I don't trust them because they think better of themselves.
1	He has been my family doctor for over 15 years now, he has made me feel very at ease as a teeger and young woman and I felt like I could really trust him with all my issues. He is always very interested and patient and doesn't make it look like he has better things to move on to.
-1	I trust doctors in general because they have a deeper understanding of the things I don't know about my body.  For example, I have chronic heartburn and I trust that my doctor can share information about which treatment is best for me.
-1	I trust her because she never seems in a rush and always has time for my questions or concerns.  She does not just shove a drug at me and send me on my way.
-1	I trust them because I have to and I can read and do my own research when it's necessary to question them. But they work for large companies and i'm not always convinced they have MY best interest rather than the company or even their own intentions for a specific outcome.
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I know that insurance plays into this. Some things just don't get approved so they have to tell me different stuff. Also their persol beliefs play in so I know they  may not be honest with me at times.
1	He's always taken the time to explain things about my care thoroughly to me and without complaining. He seems to genuinely care about my health.
-1	I went to them and told them I believe I had something, they brushed me off and said I was fine. Four visits and hundreds of dollars later I was diagnosed with that very thing and then was given a treatment that did not work.
-1	They know a lot more about the medical field than me. They wen to medical school, studied and learned more things than I know. Its usually better to trust an experts opinion on things like this. 
-1	My primary care doctor usually seems rushed and annoyed. I can tell she wants to do her job but perhaps doesn't like the scheduling or the company that mages her. Overall I don't really trust her to make educated decisions for me, and had to beg for a cholesterol test. It had been six years, at least, since my prior one. 
-1	i trust them, the reasons why are because of there positions 
1	He works in a small town and is well-known in the community. He has a high reputation to uphold. 
-1	I just started with a new doctor, and she is young and persoble. She listens intently, asks me about my choices, and offers a variety of possible treatment plans. I greatly appreciate that after my previous doctor, who was nice but more interested in pushing supplements she had a fincial interest in.
-1	Its not that I don't trust in what they're saying to me, I just have to realize that they may not always be right, and with a serious diagnosis I would definitly seek a second opinion and move from there
1	I have been going to the same doctor for years now in a great clinic my kids and wife go to as well.  We really like it there and it eels like a whole team of care rather then one doctor.  
-1	I am forced to go to a clinic by my house that rarely lets me see an actual doctor. Many times when I go for specific reasons or health issues they ignore those and don't do anything for it. I am always forced to see a nurse practitioner who always has to look up stuff in books to treat me.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she took the time to get to know me and listen to my concerns. She regularly asks questions about things we've discussed previously.
1	My newest doctor is very good.  He takes the time with me to sit in the office after my physical and address any concerns.  This is the first time I have had a doctor that takes enough time with me.  I really do trust him and he explains things to me thoroughly
-1	I don't completely trust Western medicine and only seek it out when it is absolutely necessary.  I don't always trust the doctor's information especially when they just want to prescribe a pill to mask symptoms and not really deal with the core of the problem.  I take everything my doctors say with a grain of salt.
-1	I trust my doctor because despite his hurried overall attitude he has done nothing but provide me with proper medical care and make the best choices for my health.
1	I trust them for the most part. I feel that he doesn't have all the expertise I need for my different conditions though.
1	I have a very good Doctor. I have no reason not to trust him. 
-1	I think that sometimes the doctor is not listening to my concerns and is just giving me text book or generic answers.
-1	My doctor has always been honest with me, even if it means telling me something I don't want to hear. She gives me a variety of treatment options when they are available, and that helps build trust. 
1	My doctor always spends a good amount of time talking to me when I go for a visit and answers all my questions thoroughly.
1	m\My primary care doctor has been seeing my family for many years. he always makes time to call and check in if one of us is very ill and makes us feel like he is doing his best to put our health first 
-1	I trust my doctor because she was someone my mom trusted. My mom had her for years and later recommended her to me. She was instrumental in referring my mom to a doctor who diagnosed her as BRCA1+. So we ended up trusting her. My mom has since passed from BRCA1+-related cancer, but this doctor even called her after my mom was termil, just to say hello and see how she was doing.
1	My doctor is one of the first who has taken the time to really get to know me and has been the best doctor I've ever had.
1	I have been going to my primary care physician for a long time now, so I understand his methods and we have a relationship. He knows my habits and health concerns, and he never hesitates to tell me the good and the bad. He let me see the reports and exam results so I can see for myself what is happening, and he'll answer any questions I have. 
-1	my doctor sees so many patients they usually diagnos you with what everyone else has. they only spend like 5 minutes with you.
1	I have been going to this Doctor since I was a young boy and he has taken amazingly good care of me and my family.  He is also a member of my church and we know his family.  He has fully earned my trust and respect.
-1	Doctors seem to often be in a hurry to move on to the next patient. I feel like they don't ask me enough questions. I feel like they don't take the time to fully and accurately diagnose me.
-1	I mostly trust my PCP, but I do feel like she's a little old.  I think it's worth getting a second opinion when anything serious comes up. However, for general run of the mill problems, I think she's fine. 
-1	i distruct my primary care physcian because i see a different person each time. I never have someone who knows me. I'm always explaining things. It's like im a car and the mechanic is different each time.
-1	Everyone is different. Some are better than others.
-1	I have been to my doctor, been waiting in the waiting room and seen him talking to a friend. When my doctor notices that he has patient's waiting he gets angry and tells them they could look for other doctors.  I also don't trust him as he does not do thorough exams.  He simply refills my prescription every year without checking anything.
1	I trust my doctor because they went to school for years to study medicine. They have a wealth of knowledge behind them I could never grasp
1	I trust my primary care physician as I have been going to him for a few years now.
1	I have been going to my PCP for over 10 years.  She is always happy to see me, and takes all the time that I need.  Every decision she makes has been the right one.  She has so much experience and makes me feel well cared for. 
-1	I trust my physician.  They are licensed and educated
1	My doctor seems straightforward and trustworthy. I feel no reason to doubt him.
-1	I trust her because she is the one who is looking over my health. I myself have to as well, but she knows the ins and outs of hte human body and what is good and not good.
-1	I have been seeing my dr for a long time and she knows me pretty well.
1	I trust doctors in general because of my experiences in the past. There are good and bad doctors, but I believe that overall they are trustworthy. 
-1	I don't think I have seen my primary care physician enough to establish more trust.  I have only seen her once, so most of my answers are based off experiences that I have had with doctors in general, mostly OBs.
-1	I know they have the knowledge, but they also deal with so many patients on a daily basis, that I feel like they can get careless and annoyed easier because of that. I worry they don't care as much as they should.
-1	I trust my PC because she listens to me and what I am trying to accomplish. She hears me and allows me to have a say in if I want to take medicine, approach things a certain way. She cares. 
1	She is laid back and doesn't get worked up about stuff that isn't important.  She let's me know to relax and not worry. 
1	My doctor is a straight-forward guy.  I believe that he tells me like it is.  I know that he's very good at his job.  I have confidence in him.
-1	The last time I visited my primary care physician, I felt they were a bit distant and basically told me to put ice on a foot injury, then walked away. Was kinda weird. Seemed like they wanted to leave.
1	I trust my primary care provider because they take the time to talk things over with me. They also listen to me and any problems that I bring up. I can also rely on them to treat me and talk about treatments with me whenever I have a problem that needs to be taken care of. 
1	I have been going to my primary care doctor for many years so I have built trust in him. He encourages questions and is great at asking what I think because he says I know my body better than he ever could. His confidence in me and listening skills are what really make me trust him. 
-1	I trust my physician. He knows me well enough and has always acted in my best interest. He is always willing to listen to my concerns.
-1	i trust that he has the experience and knowledge to handle basic issues but is always in a hurry which makes me think he doesn't want me to ask too many questions
1	My doctors have always been the type of people to relay a sense of trust. Not only in their ability to explain what is happening to me, but in their demeanor.
-1	 I have wonderful doctors at always put my needs first if I have a question or problem they're happy to answer it or get me information to make a better choice 
1	It features an open communication system. He listens. I listen. Discussions are thought-provoking. He is a valuable resource to not just myself, but my family.
1	I've never had her judge me and she's very thorough in explaining why she things this medicine or htis procedure should be done and won't do anything unless I absolutely understand what is going on.
1	He is someone who is honest. When I have a question, I dont hesitate to ask and he is clear with his answers. 
-1	I think that my doctor and doctors in general face a number of pressure outside of being an advocate for best outcomes for me. Furthermore I do not trust the expertise of only one person in any situation. This means that if I feel something is serious I look for a different opinions and research the issue myself. I also feel that doctors are often unwilling to address my concerns to satisfaction due to time constraints, so this makes me feel that I ought not to trust them compeletly. 
-1	My primary care physician has known me for majority of my life and is very thorough about what needs to be done about my medical needs.
-1	DOCTORS ARE LIKE GOD
-1	I trust him because I have been with him for so long. I know he is looking for my best interest.
1	He is good and addresses any issue or concern that I have. 
-1	My doctor just seems to be in a rush to get from one patient to the next and doesn't spend much time with any one patient.
-1	I just switched to a new PCP after a move. I have a very pleasant visit with my new doctor and I felt he was honest, listened to my concerns and friendly. 
-1	My doctor is highly trained and highly regarded in the community.  I am comfortable with him and my treatment plans and therefore trust him.  He is highly rated.
1	My doctor seems very knowledgeable in his field. He takes time and doesn't rush. Not glued to his laptop. So far he has been right with any diagnosis.
1	We have an understanding and friendship and know that we can trust each other.
-1	I believe that they generally have the best interest of other people in mind, and do not want people to suffer. 
-1	Well, I just met my new doctor not too long ago, and I believe he's wrong on some points, but I don't believe it's out of trying to hide things from me.  I think he just believes every last thing that he was taught, and does not alter from that reality.
-1	She is easily distracted by other things it seems.
-1	I mostly trust my current health care provider, a nurse practitioner. She listens and took some of my recent experiences and behavior seriously. For example, I recently took someone else's pain pills because I was in serious pain. She saw that as a need for my pain to be addressed, not me overreacting.
-1	I feel like my primary care physician and most in general just want to constantly put people on medication to fix everything. I don't want to be on a bunch of medication with negative side effects and that's all they try to push in order to fix problems. The lack of options causes my distrust in my doctor.
-1	I trust them to an extent but I don't have a very strong relationship with them and in general I'm a little suspicious of medical professiols.  I think they withhold some information from patients.  Plus I've had them tell me the wrong things before, things I knew were not true because I had found research conflicting it, so I sometimes just don't trust them.
1	My PCP has been very open and honest about changes I've needed to make in my life to get and stay healthy. I never felt as though they were doing anything to persolly convenience herself, and I've trusted the advice given to me. 
1	I have been with the same primary care physician for 15 years now. We have an excellent relationship where she is honest with me about what changes I need to make for better health, and I am honest with her about what my health goals are and the treatment I am or am not willing to undergo. She never tries to pressure me into making a healthcare choice that goes against what I want to do.
1	Three generations of my family use my doctor as their primary care physician, and we all feel very comfortable with her. She has, on multiple occasions, found something of concern to her and sent us for testing which resulted in medical procedures needing to be performed. She prescribes medicine when we're sick, takes the time to fully explain what's going on, and responds quickly to emails/voicemails that we leave her.
-1	I have been with my family doctor for many years. She takes the time to explain things to me that I don't understand and doesn't ever do any unnecessary testing on me. She and I have a good doctor/patient relationship. 
1	Because I have experience the medical field and I like his approach. I've had second opinions from colleagues on his diagnosis and treatment recommendations and they usually are consistent with what my colleagues suggest. 
-1	I think that these days that doctors are trying to push more and more drugs that half the time you dont need. That is pretty scary to think about. Also treatment varies greatly from doc to doc even on simple things like a infection. So there are times i cant trust the doc 100%
-1	You choose to trust them based on if they deserve it.
-1	I have not found a regular doctor that I feel comfortable with.
-1	They have many years of training, and I do not. That's the long and short of it, really. I trust them.
-1	"I don't ask a whole lot of good questions, so I'm just like ""I guess you have the degree and experience, so whatever you say."" Maybe this is trusting enough but maybe this doesn't allow me the best control of my health."
1	I fully trust my PCP. He is always verbose in his explations and open to any and all questions. He has fostered a great trusting relationship.
1	I feel they know a lot more than I do and I can trust their opinions. They are not out to just make money but also to help people and part of being helpful is doing the right thing as far as diagnosis and subjestions on health.
1	I trust my PCP because he seems to care about my health.  He takes time to understand my questions and give me advise.
-1	I trust them because i know them and they know me well. I dont really have any distrust for him and overall i dont see why i would with anyone else.
1	I've been seeing my primary care physician for a couple of years now. She takes the time to listen to my questions and makes sure I understand the answers. 
1	I get along very well with my doctor. I feel she genuinely cares about my well being, both physically and mentally. She is very sweet and kind.
1	My primary care physician has taken care of my family for years and is pretty trustworthy. She's also very open about how her decision process works. So I'm fairly confident in her.
1	I don't have any specific reasons, I think I am just inclined to believe what my doctor is saying is accurate. I almost never doubt my doctor, or any doctors I have seen.
-1	My PCP seems rushed when I see her. She also seems tired and overworked. She seems like she cares a little, but she explains things to me but doesn't try to be super thorough. I probably wouldn't keep seeing her if I had actual health problems.
-1	"I have a new PCP so I don't totally trust her yet. She seemed to just gloss over any ""problems"" that I addressed with her during our first encounter. "
-1	"I think my doctor is very, ""typical"", in that they tell you what is on the paperwork with little regard as to your persol situation. While they are obviously competent, they are not exactly empathetic."
-1	He's always been a straight shooter. He gives me the information that I need and tells me what I need to do going forward.
-1	I'm pretty neutral on this one. I feel that most doctors DO want to help you, but they also want to drag it out as long as possible for profit reasons. The end goal is a cure/help, but it's going to be VERY expensive.
-1	I would trust him. Unless your instincts say otherwise
-1	Every single PCP I have had the displeasure of dealing with has been arrogant and rude to me. They don't seem to take anything I say seriously, and seem to just want to get the visitation over with. It's a one-size-fits-all approach for these guys.
-1	I don't always feel they are devoting enough time and attention to my problems. Initial courses of treatment don't always work, then they ask more questions. They jump to easy conclusions.
-1	PCPs can be shadowed by other influences such as medical companies to push their products for kickbacks.  This is not true for every PCP but it is known.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician but I on the few occasions that I go to the dr, I trust what they tell me.
-1	I think in general most Doctors, the ones I've seen have your best interest at heart, I don't always agree with everything they say, I believe most doctors are paid to prescribe medications. This makes it hard to completely trust at times.
1	He listenes and talks with you about things, always explains well.
-1	I trust her to do what is right for me but I'm not afraid to ask for a second opinion if I need to (thankfully I've never had to do that). She hasn't let me down yet so I have trust in her. 
1	I trust my doctor because they're always helpful and open with me, they take the time to answer any questions. My doctor has also returned emails and chats in my medical portal, so I have more trust in them.
1	I generally trust physicians. They have a lot of education and training by ture of the profession. Also, a doctor isn't likely to give poor care for too long, because it would likely be noticed. Doctors have a responsibility to be trustworthy, and I think that's the general cultural expectation.
1	I trust my doctor because of the wonderful service that she provides me with. She always answers my questions and provides feedback for me regarding my questions.
-1	typically it is best to trust your instincts. if the doc seems good trust him
1	For the most part I think I trust my doctor. She always takes her time and really listens to what I have to say before making any sort of rash decision. If I have any questions she's more than willing to answer and we talk what would be best for me. She's very kind and I find it easy to discuss things with her. Overall I think  I trust her decisions and think that she has my best interests at heart.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician due to the relationship that we have developed. Over the several years that I have visited their office I have come to know and trust the opinion of my doctor and feel that he is looking out for what is the best for me. 
1	She always gives it to me straight and never tells me any bull. She tells me what she thinks is wrong and tries to help me understand what is going on with my body. 
-1	My doctor is a professiol and uses their best judgement in dealings with my health. They also explain things to me and answer questions I have. This is why I trust my doctor. 
1	MY primary care physician is always thorough with me and gives me good advice in regards to my treatment. I have always gotten better by doing what he says so I have a lot of faith in his judgements
-1	I believe he is looking out on my behalf.  He is very down to earth and honest.  He gives me the facts and I do my best to understand anything he tells me.  I do believe him, I do not think he tries to give me any false information.
-1	I think that it would depend on what they need in their life. That will affect what they tell me.
-1	Doctors are just like everyone else. Some you can trust, and others you cannot.
-1	I feel like I listen to what they say but then wait to form my own opinion on it. I haven't always had doctors give me accurate diagnoses. Sometimes I have to do my own research and tell them what I have before they can tell me themselves.
-1	I think that the doctor is good at her job, but she is young and seems a little inexperienced. I am not sure if that's a good or bad thing though, as generatiol differences can cloud judgement and can cause physicians to not keep up with the times or to not realize the correct standards of care.
1	I trust my primary care physician because they have not given me any reason to not trust them.  I believe in the basic trust of professiols that I interact with.  If I didn't trust them I wouldn't go to them for treatment.
-1	My insurance recently changed, so I go to a local clinic and never see the same doctor more than once, so I never have a chance at building trust or a relationship with them. Usually, where I go, appointments are only a few moments, regardless of the severity of the reason you go, so I find it hard to believe they're really devoting enough time and energy to treating me in the best possible way.
1	I just started seeing a new doctor so I suppose I don't know enough to completely trust her yet, but she's already much better than my previous doctor. She's very friendly and treats me more like an equal than like a patient she has authority over. She's easy to talk to and joke around with, and seems like she wants what's best for me even if she has to go out of her way to do it.
-1	My primary care physician has dismissed my worries and problems before. She misdiagnosed one of my family members and that family member ended up in the hospital because of it.
1	I have no reason not to trust my primary physician . He has always seemed concerned and knowledgeable, always making sure my needs have been taken care of.  
-1	I feel that doctors now a days are under so much pressure to see so many patients that things are rushed and missed.  
1	I trust my primary care physician. I've known my doctor for years and haven't had a bad experience dealing with the doctor or doctor's office in general. The information I've been given thus far has been correct and helpful. Therefore, until I have a bad experience, my trust is secure.
1	I believe that doctors have my best interest in mind when treating me.
-1	I honestly don't trust anyone. I believe what they say is helpful but holistic approaches are good too. 
1	If I have an issue my physician doesn't perform one test and then stop, like other physicians have. She's also very friendly and makes sure I understand everything she says. 
-1	It really depends on the situation, some doctors I feel like they don't have enough time to talk about a medical condition or they seem like they're too busy to really go into any type of detail. But I do have a doctor I normally see that does take the time out to explain what he thinks the root of a problem may be.
-1	He doesn't spend much time with me and it seems like he is just trying to get me out of the door as fast as he can.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she takes the time to ask my opinion on which way I would prefer to go for certain treatments of issues I've had. She will give me information and her opinion and statistics but she ultimately will let me decide which route I would prefer to take.
-1	I don't trust many doctors because alot prove to be more after money than helping the patients
-1	My primary care doctor knows both of my parents and is a very blunt person in general. I do not shirk from getting the information I want so I am not scared too ask questions.
-1	I trust my doctor because they are more knowledgeable than I am but I do not give them complete trust until I read and understand the options myself and am able to agree or disagree with them. 
-1	I trust my physician because I believe he is very knowledgeable and he considers different possibilities- he doesn't jump to conclusions. 
-1	Regarding doctors in general, I have trust in them because I have no other choice. I have to trust that my doctor has my interest in mind. However, I am also aware that many doctors are often sponsored my drug companies, or they could just be wrong about certain medical opinions. Therefore, it is necessary to get a second opinion. 
-1	I trust him because he is just doing his job. He has no reason to hide treatment options unless he honestly doesn't think they are worth mentioning.
-1	I've had the same primary for nearly my whole adult life. He also has had my parents as patients for many years. 
-1	I will trust my doctor because he can find the minor issue that other doctor may not be found.
1	They seem trustworthy.  It is the insurance company I do not trust.
-1	I feel with their busy schedules, as much as they like to dwell on a patient, unless you're going to ask lots of questions.  They will give you a primary brief overview and description of your issue and then move on to the next.  Doctors are forced to see so many patients in a day and in between squeeze a break in.  With that limitation there is only so much persol care they can have.
-1	Doctors can be wrong, I have been in scerios where I have gotten multiple diagnoses from  multiple doctors upon getting a second, and third opinion.
-1	I don't really have a primary care physician, I have been uninsured for many years. I try to put my trust in any doctor that is willing to see me on a self-pay, emergency basis. That is reality, and those are my choices in that reality.
-1	I distrust physicians because the way the medical system is set up isn't about quality of care. The way the medical system is set up is to push as many patients through as quickly as possible. Once we start incentivizing quality care; then my trust in physicians will rise.
-1	It depends on the situation.  If the doctor is trying to push a new drug that is quite expensive then I would wonder if he is getting something out of the deal.  If I were to think that he may be wrong on a diagnosis then I would likely look for another opinion.  At the end of the day the doctor is a human and no human is perfect, so unless they give a reason to not believe them then I probably would lean towards trusting them unless I felt they were wrong in some way.  
-1	I assume they have the relevant information, training, and experience to make the recommendations they do, and follow from there.
-1	I barely trust mainstream doctors at all. A lot of their diagnoses are just guesses, but they act as if they KNOW what they're talking about and the patient doesn't. I use doctors mainly when I want a particular test done or think I need a prescription.
1	Dr. Dixon is comforting for the most part and I have been a patient of hers for a long time so that helps me trust her. But sometimes I get confused.
1	I have been going to my primary physician for almost 4 years now and never once have I felt that I was not important to her. She has been supportive and attentive always.
1	I trust my doctor because i've built a relationship with them over a number of years. We have open communication regarding any health issues i may have. We talk about those issues openly and at length. I never feel like i'm being rushed out the door. I never wait for a long period of time in the waiting room. I'm given ample resources in order to understand and educate myself. 
-1	He's been honest but one doctor is not an end-all game when it comes to my health, I should consult multiple doctors if a problem arises. Therefore, I don't have full unwavering trust in one doctor.
1	I've had the same doctor since I was a kid and in fact, he is my family's doctor. So my mother and even grandmother have a great deal of experience with him. He's willing to talk, answer questions and usually does well. Plus he hasn't killed any of us yet, so that's a great bonus.
1	I trust my doctor because I think he has my best interest at stake. He takes time to listen to my concerns and actually tries to help me. 
-1	I have great trust in my current position because I have seen my physician long enough that I trust what she will say and I trust that she understands what treatment is necessary. At this point I have established A rapport to give her complete trust. 
1	He seems to have a good understanding of what goes on. He lets me know whatis likely and will order a test if I'm worried even if it's unlikely. Seems nice and caring
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been in practice for a long time.  He is extremely experienced.
1	I trust my doctor but have also disagreed with them over things that I knew were the current recommendations. So we had a discussion and he looked up the new information I gave him and thanked me for making him aware of it. Doctors are incredibly smart but things are constantly changing so I feel it is important to listen to them but, also advocate for yourself.
-1	Although I don't doubt that my primary care physician cares about me, I also believe that they are not my best friend. I try my best to listen to what they tell me but I also research the information I'm given on my own and find out what the best course of action is.
1	I trust him because he's never given me a reason not to. Every time I've gone to him he gives me the correct medication or suggestions to alleviate what's going on and they've worked every time
-1	I do not really like my doctor but it is hard to change to a new one. I live in a small town. I trust many doctors though because they have a lot to lose so they tend to try very hard to do their best.
1	I trust my doctor because she has been my doctor for 24 years.
-1	As with most things/people, a medical professiol can have an agenda they are pushing and most of the time it's for monetary reasons. I don't believe in taking unneccessary medicine and sometimes I don't trust the dr when they tell me I need to take a medicine when I think there is a better treatment option available.
1	I trust my doctor because she is always honest with me and I have never had a reason to not trust her. She is good at her job and a very nice person, so it is easy to trust her and her opinion
-1	Well, on the one hand, I trust my doctor because he is a trained professiol and I assume is there because he wants to help people as most doctors probably do.  On the other hand, medicine today is still very much a business.  Money.  And as we all know, when money is involved, there is an inherent conflict of interest at times and we must find very moral doctors who will rise above this conflict and do what is right.  Not all do.
-1	I do trust our physician, but feel that we are often hurried in and out of his office. It would be nice if they got to know us a little more and asked more questions. 
-1	Most doctors choose to do what's right because if they get caught doing otherwise, they could lose their license. That is why I trust them in general.
1	I trust doctors because i believe that they have my best interests at heart
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for quite a few years now. She knows me well, and I trust that she will do what is best for my health. She is also available to talk to outside of office hours which is really great.
1	My physician is highly regarded and always takes the appropriate amount of time to see me. He doesn't rush me out of his office for other patients, and I feel that he gives me his full attention.
1	I've known my doctor for 25 years and I see us more as friends than a doctor-patient relationship.
1	I have a very nice woman as my primary doctor. I can trust anything she tells me to do or take.
-1	I do not trust completely in my doctor or any doctor for that matter. In 2010, I kept having chest pains and the doctor said that it was nothing. I had them for about a week and then one day I almost passed out in the parking of my electric company and I was taken to the ER. Come to find out I had a blood clot in my lung. I do not trust doctors. If I have a illness I will try and fix it myself.
-1	I don't really trust my doctor very much because i feel that sometimes they are too caught up in all the drug company's ideas that certain medicines work for thing they don't or are trying to perscribe medicines due to kick backs from companys
-1	For the most part, I trust in doctors, but I've run into situations where they are giving the minimal amount of treatment so they can be done with me and move on to the next patient.
-1	She is there for me when I need her. She does not rush through appointments with me. She explains everything and makes sure that I understand. She is knowledgeable about current trends in health care.
-1	My primary care doctor is mostly considerate and kind but often gives me the impression that he is overworked. He has had the tendency to forget certain things about me to the point where I have needed to remind him of things in visits (ie: medication allergy). He has never directly put me in danger with any of his decisions but I would trust him more if he was less rushed and willing to spend more time getting familiar with me and my health.
1	I have been with the same doctor for 11 years and he has never given me any reason to not trust him - he is very thorough and concise in his diagnoses and gives me the best overall advice and information that I could ever hope for with any doctor. 
-1	In my experience they just want you in and out so they can make their quick money. I had gall bladder pains for a year, and they kept telling me I was just constipated. I filly got someone that did an ultrasound and I had to have immediate surgery, and I was jaundiced. A YEAR of incompetence! 
1	I chose my doctor out of a few that I've visited over the years. She's always eager to answer questions and is professiol, all the while still having a kind demeanor.
1	I've had my PCP for a while and he is probably the most down to earth doctor that I've come across. Always explains things throughly, always gives options.
-1	My doctor just seems so busy. It's hard to tell if he really pays attention to me and my health because I am only seen for a few minutes. 
1	I believe he is smart and thorough. I don't usually need him for many things but he has always had good advice when I do have a problem.
1	She has always been very thorough in her explations and care. She has also always made my options very clear to me.
1	I have known my PCP since I was 13 and friends with his daughter. I am usually very healthy and don't go to the doctor very often, but I do trust him as my doctor. 
1	i have had him for 11 years and never once has he not taken my questions or worries with seriousness.
1	When I had Kaiser, I didn't trust them at all. They prescribed Codine for every little thing that I had. Now I have a private doctor through PPO and they are spot on, I'm always feeling better, I never feel like I get the run around. This difference can make my answers fill mixed. But if you were to ask me how I felt between HMO and PPO health care, it would be a landslide of an opinion.
1	I have been with my primary physician for years and we have built up a rapport. He has never given me a diagnosis that I felt was wrong to real degree. Even if I did not have my own trusted doctor, I believe that it is in a doctor's best interest to provide the best care possible, so it is easy for me to trust a doctor.
-1	I hate doctors.  I feel bad saying that but I find them to be judgy and hypocritical.  Doctors seem to think they know more than they actually do and that can be very problematic...
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been doing this a long time. Also, he went to medical school, not me!
1	I have done a lot of research and tried several different doctors in the the surrounding cities until I landed with one who I trust greatly. 
-1	I often feel as if they are already thinking of the next patient. It is usually a hurried experience.
-1	I usually trust doctors. I think it's pretty risky for them to be deceitful. In my experience, doctors are honest and kind and smart.
1	Most of the doctors I have been in contact with recently seemed to have my best care in mind. I recently hurt my shoulder and needed to go to the Orthopedic Surgeon for car. While I had not been to this Ortho before, he was very thorough and explained the cost/benefits of the treatment plan he had set for me. However, I find that interacting with other medical staff, such as psychiatrists, RNs, LPNs, that they are much more business-oriented, in and out. For those types of specialists/general staff I do not have as much trust as I do my PCP or Ortho.
1	I know my primary care physician outside of the office, and I know what kind of person he is. I trust his judgments for my medical care because I know he is a good person who truly cares about other people and wants what is best for them. I know his family, and how he treats and cares for them. It puts me at ease when I am dealing with him in a professiol capacity.
1	I trust my doctor because he has yet to give me any false or misleading information. He spends time talking to me and doesn't rush me out of the door. Listens to my concerns/questions and answers them well
1	I trust my doctor as I have been seeing her for many years now.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has proven trustworthy.  He listens to what I have to say and develops treatment plans based on what he believes the issue is.  He treats the problem and not the symptoms.
-1	I have switched doctors until I have found one I trust.  Prior to that I truly felt as though the Drs wanted to make money on procedures and medications.  I felt as though they pushed the same things and it was for a monetary reason.  Currently my Drs really listen and I am involved with my health care choices.
-1	I trust them somewhat. They do want the best for their patients. They are also in the pockets of medical industry. They at there to make money too. They may not have the best information and think they are experts because of their education. 
-1	I have gotten a new primary care physician in the past year and she has been more thorough and careful than any doctor I've had previously.  My past PCP rushed through appointments and gave me prescriptions without much concern.  My new PCP is careful to suggest medications and tries to find if altertive therapies may work better and to ensure that I am really getting something I need.  
1	She goes out of her way to make sure I feel comfortable and to see if anything else is wrong. She tells me things about herself if she has similar problems to make me feel better about my issues. 
-1	She seems like a good doctor. I don't have any complaints. If she thought something was wrong I'm sure she'd tell me.
-1	My primary care physician keeps leaving and I haven't met the new one, but I think they are fine. I worry that I don't know what a patient is supposed to do.
1	My doctor makes sure to spend an adequate amount of time with me to ensure i can have all the questions i have answered. They don't rush me and even if they feel a test doesn't need to be done, they will do it anyways just to make sure.
-1	My doctor is very candid. She always lets me know the possible effects and she has no problem telling me what she thinks. However, she just rushes too much and seems like she has better things to be doing.
-1	I have seen my primary care doctor for almost thirty years and have complete faith in him for my medical health. He know me extremely well and is well regarded in the community for his thorough manner.
1	I trust my doctor because I have never been led astray. I have never had a negative experience with my doctor. I have no reason to doubt my doctor's competence or motives and have had good outcomes.
-1	He is usually in a hurry when I go to see him. I imagine that is because he sees so many patients. Since I see him rarely, I imagine there isn't enough of a connection for him to really care outside a professiol capacity.
-1	There have been times where my doctor has been wrong. But I do have two specialists that often go the extra mile for me and I feel I can trust. 
-1	I think they just come up with explations to get you out faster
-1	I generally trust my doctor. He always goes above and beyond to make sure my needs are met and keeps me up to date regarding my health.
1	I have never had a medical issue where I didn't know what was wrong before going in to see him. I usually show up for an appt and explain what's going on and know exactly how he's going to treat me.
-1	I have been seeing this doctor for some time for a serious illness. So far they have maged it quite well so I trust their judgement
1	My doctor explains most things clearly to me. He genuinely shows he cares and checks up on me outside of the office. Quick to answer my concerns as well.
-1	I dont think I've ever trusted a doctor completely. When I see them taking meetings with pharm reps and so many patients they only have about 5-10 minutes with each, I dont feel very confident about everything they say and do. They seem to go on vacation a lot too.
-1	My doctor is a seasoned professiol. He has really good persol qualities. That makes me feel will do no harm when it comes to his medical advice.
-1	I think they are too much influenced by money, corruption and big pharma. 
1	I've been going to the same doctor for years. He is very kind and shows that he actually cares about my wellbeing. He is never in a hurry and explains everything to me in a way that I can understand.
-1	Because I feel like they should know what is best for you and if they explain all the options and consequences then they are more trustworthy.
-1	I don't trust him because a few years ago he prescribed medication for high blood pressure that almost killed me. The side-affects were so bad I had to go into the er room.
-1	I trust the GYN I have, she takes her time and sits to answer my questions and chat. I never feel rushed or neglected by her. I have been to doctors in the past though that spend minimal time with you and it doesn't feel like they actually care about you.
1	My doctor tells me all of the options I have, even if they don't benefit him.
-1	I distrust my doctor because I go to the VA for my healthcare and they really don't seem to hire or keep the best of medical providers there. They are always in a rush and don't seem to really care to give the time of day to your problems they are all very low quality providers. So, that is why I do not trust my physician. 
-1	Sometimes my doctors can be in such a rush I simply get a nod and they would try and attend me as quick as possible to get even more patients in. Half the time I end up having to go back because he didn't feel like listening to my problem so it wasn't tended to and I end up getting worse.
-1	I usually trust my primary care physician because I know he cares about my health. He usually takes the time to explain things thoroughly if he feels like I don't understand them.
-1	I trust my physician because he has always been right about what treatments I need over the years, and he has been my doctor for a long time. Since he has never been wrong, I feel that I can trust him. 
-1	My doctor seems to care about me when I visit. She does not contact me often, but when I need help she is helpful.
-1	They try to rush during a visit and get to the next patient as soon as possible.
-1	I trust doctors to be careful and thorough, but a good bit of skepticism is healthy, and getting a second opinion is wise. It is difficult to put complete trust in someone I don't really know.
-1	it is neutural, because sometimes where I am from they just want a quick fix  and try to just take care of the issue as quick as they can
-1	Because I know him very well. And he is a very knowledgeable person also.
1	My physician is always honest without being judgmental.  She tells me steps I can take, but understands when these steps are difficult to fit into my life.  She also is happy if changes are made as small steps or trying to complete one healthy change at a time, rather than expect me to completely alter my lifestyle.
-1	I trust my doctor because she has shown me, over the years, that she has my best interest at heart. She listens to me and my concerns and together we come up with a plan to take care of whatever problem I am experiencing at that time.
1	I've been going to him for quite some time now. We've developed a good relationship. He's frank and honest and that's exactly what I expect.
-1	
-1	There is no real motivation for a doctor not to do what is best for you. He or she will get paid the same regardless of the outcome of your medical situation so there is no reason for the doctor to screw you over. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been super honest and up front with me. He has always taken the time to explain everything that needs to be explained and he has never hidden anything from me when it comes to my medical conditions or illnesses. 
1	I trust my doctor because she knows that sometimes treatment options work differently for different people and she lets me know that I might not get the results I want but she has always been willing to work with me when I need to change a treatment option without hesitation. 
1	He lets me be a part of the plan of treatment and always asks what I think aand if I agree or disagree. He always takes the time to listen and is very willing to see me whenever i need him too. He explains everything to me in a way that I understand and is very patient, kind and gentle. is office always calls to see how I am doing.
-1	She takes the time to explain things and answer any questions I might have.
1	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him. He is looking out for my best interests. He takes his time to listen to me. He is never rushed - or at least doesn't show it. He is friendly and helpful and I trust him.
1	Recently finished medical training.  Listens.
-1	I am not completely happy with my current physician. He tends to rush patients in and out of the office, spending very little time. I always feel rushed and try to obtain the most important information first. I feel like my physician always looks for the quick and easy answer instead of spending time looking into something more seriously.
1	I trust my doctor since i feel like they are just looking for what is best for me
-1	Their willingness to explain my medical diagnosis thoroughly, but in understanding terms makes me trust my pcp. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I trust the profession. I appreciate that he explains things alytically, which is consistent with the way I process information.
-1	I have just started with her, but she seems to be communicative, alytical, takes time to explain, moderately to highly intelligent, sympathetic, and experienced.
1	"My doctor always suggests tural remedies first if the condition is not serious. She is not a ""pill pusher"" like most. My mother used to work with her also. She is also my mother's doctor now that she no longer works with her."
1	love my doctor. Explains everything really well and understands me. 
-1	I have trust in his ability as a doctor and his medical doctor, but he is a very busy doctor in a poor neighborhood, so it can be hard to keep his attention on something that doesn't seem very bad from an outside perspective. 
1	I have generally had positive experiences and never had a bad experience with a doctor. I have always received proper care.
1	My physician seems like they are well educated and seem to communicate well with other people. Their ability to portray information to me is critical in deserving my trust, and I have had no problems at all regarding this. I feel that most doctors are so well educated that they have a good idea what is going on and how to treat it, and they can get more information readily if necessary, so overall I trust them due to their education and ability to communicate.
-1	I don't have a PCP, but do feel that most doctors are looking out for their patients' best interests and can be trusted.
-1	i feel that i just depends on how you feel in the moment with the doctor. 
1	My doctor is very paiteint with me and other paitients. She takes the time to explain things and answers all questions I have. I never feel that I am inconveniencing her when I visit with a problem.
-1	I think doctors are always pushing big pharma agendas of the latest most expensive drugs in return for kickbacks.
1	I find that my pcp takes her time when examining and listens to what I am saying. She is stern about certain things but does not push unnecessary treatments or procedures. 
-1	I know that doctors aren't perfect, but they go through one of the most rigorous schooling systems of any profession. If they don't know the answer then nobody does.
-1	It's always wise to get a second opinion or look for more information. Doctors are not perfect and cannot know every single bit of medical information in the world. There may be newer treatments or updated diagnoses. Also, some doctors are kind of in bed with the pharmaceutical industry and might recommend a drug just to increase sales. This is not necessarily common, but not unheard of either.
1	I trust her because she has always told me the exactly how she felt about any situation. She answers all questions the way she sees fit and now just because it would be what I want to hear. She is straight forward with anything she tells me. She also has never told me wrong and has helped me a lot.
-1	I trust they'll do just enough to keep me alive long enough to bleed my pockets
-1	I've been seeing him for several years now, and have always followed his recommendations, which have been very useful. I expect this relationship to continue going forward. 
-1	I have great trust in doctors because it takes a lot to become one. Lots of school lots of practice and lots of experience make for great helpers.
-1	usually he gives me good advice.But sometimes they put you on meds with to many's side effects.
-1	I feel as if my concerns are not addressed by my doctor.  I feel he is too busy with too many patients and will tell me one thing in one phone call and a week later will forget his direction to me or forget what we discussed or what my initial concern was about in the first place.  He isn't a problem solver for me but rather he dismisses my concerns and makes me feel unimportant.
1	I trust my doctor because he has never  done anything that has made me question his ability of motives. Everything that is done or tested for me has a specific reason that he explains to me. 
-1	I like my doctor.  She took me on as a patient even though she was not accepting new patients.  She helped me through a very difficult time.  She listens to what I have to say and especially how I feel.
-1	I completely trust this doctor because two years ago I had a knot in my neck, and right away I went to see my Primary Care Doctor. After examining the knot, and telling him my other symptoms, he did not beat around the bush, he sent me directly to a specialist who then biopsied the knot, and it turned out to be cancer. This doctor does not waste my time or his, and cares deeply about his patients.
-1	My doctor is really smart and does care, so I trust that they're not going to offer me something I don't need. At the same time, they're pretty dismissive and patronizing, so that's a little discouraging.
-1	i don't know them well and they're a conventiol doctor who wants to deal with symptoms rather than root causes, which isn't something i agree with. i do my own research and speak with a relative who is a doctor as well.
1	He has saved my life on one occasion and my daughter's life in another. He is very thorough and helpful. I have been seeing him for over 25 years. He knows me. 
-1	Doctors seem very disinterested and distant. They don't seem to fully take my complaints into account and they always seem in a rush to get me out as fast as possible. I hate being treated that way. 
-1	I believe that the doctor does know better than me about medical treatment. However, I also know that there are incentives in providing certain options over others, and cultural biases that pervade the doctors perceptions (as well as my own).
-1	I trust my doctor. He's been thorough in diagnosing issues. He's open communication and will try different things in order to assist me
1	I trust my doctor because whenever I have questions that need to be answered he is always willing to answer them honestly and right away and he always gives me all the info I need when I go to him.
1	They have gone to school to learn what they are doing and I have been going to them for a while and learned to trust what they have to say.  I have a good comfort level with them, and if you can't trust your doctor, you should change them.
1	I trust my physician because I have been working with him for a long time now. I almost see him as a friend. I can get persol with him and not have to worry because I trust him. In addition, he is very soft spoken and experienced. Overall, I would rate my doctor a 4/5.
1	My doctor takes her time to listen to my concerns and is not in a rush to get me out the door.
-1	I mostly trust my doctor. Though, he is a person just like others with flaws.
-1	I have had experiences with Workers Comps doctors who only care about workers comp and not my well being.
1	I've had her for 2 years and she'll always take the time to explain things to me and seems genuinely concerned. Since I'm on medicare not all doctors seem to think I'm not worth their time. That hasn't happened too much though. 
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because they take the take and answer all my questions. They let me know what I'm doing wrong about anything and lead me in the right path about my health. 
-1	My doctor seems always pressed for time everytime I go there. He rushes me in/out without really talking in depth. But he seems to know what he's doing, so I sort of trust him. I will speak up next time it bothers me.
1	I trust my physician because he has always been good to me and given me accuracy and professiolism.
-1	Although doctors have to function in quick way due to overwhelming amounts of daily patients, it is unlikely that they have any bad intentions in mind. In my persol experience my doctor has always been honest and upfront with treatments and diagnosis.
-1	It's not that I think he's intentiolly deceiving me for some insidious purpose. I'm just read and heard about doctors getting bonuses for the amount of patients they can get on certain drugs (they get kick backs) weather this is true or not, we shouldn't ever just blindly follow someone because they went to school for awhile. Would if the school was corrupt? Would if Big Pharma changes the medical doc-turn so that the doctors believe its right, but it's actually wrong. 
-1	My doctor is very knowledgeable but he sees many patients each day. I feel that he can make mistakes from time to time.
-1	I trust him because he is persoble and lets me tell him what I am comfortable with and not. He isn't pushy, but will always do what is best for his patients.
-1	I trust my doctor, but I understand that she has pressures and influences that may not lead to the best care for me. I believe a patient must take an active part in their own care if possible.
-1	I do believe my doctor is honest, thorough, and careful for the most part. I think sometimes time constrictions can force her to be a little less thorough, especially when it comes to explaining why she is choosing a certain treatment. At times, I have trouble trusting doctors because I don't understand how they know the treatment they have chosen will work.
1	There's no reason for me not to trust my doctor. I haven't had any ill experiences, and she always seems willing to answer any questions that I may have in regards to procedures or medications.
-1	I don't go to the doctor often, but they are more knowledgeable than me so I believe them
-1	Dr's work and are obligated to the pharma business. That is their main goal, patients are secondary.
-1	I've had a few doctors and most i feel cared about me, but sometimes i did feel like they weren't putting their full thoughts into correct treatments.  Sometimes they'll let a problem sit and see if it fixes itself, or sometimes they'll try to do whatever would be easier for them if it does require prescribing something.
-1	I feel like a doctor's office is a business like any other.  They are looking to help people but with a way that will also maximize their profits.
-1	He seems to know what he is talking about most of the time, but he doesn't explain things in detail that I can understand. I have trouble keeping up at times so sometimes I don't think he wants to see me anymore. I trust that he knows what he is talking about, but it all just flies over my head. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because so far he hasn't done anything to erode my trust for him. I am wary of my physician when he tells me treatment methods. This is more so because I am a cautious person.
-1	I am not sure about those decisions since I only go to my doctor for annual check these years
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she as highly rated in my state, she has cared for 5 other of my family members, knows my entire medical family history better than I do, and she is very comforting and kind. She always explains everything I need to know, is very thorough and makes me feel comfortable with asking any questions.
1	I trust my doctor, but not completely. I do not, as a rule, trust Doctors in general. They all seem to start out good people, but most of them become greedy, and want to fix everything with pills. There is more to fixing someone than just pills.There is a job to do, most Doctors are not doing it properly.
-1	She is competent and very thorough, but I feel she relies on prescription drugs too heavily as a course of treatment. I would like to know about altertive treatments and therapies.
1	I feel those called to such a high involvement with the human condition deserve our respect and ultimately admiration. The rigors of their study and training predispose them to being credible.
1	I have been seeing my PCP for many years. Since I am in good health, we rarely have issues requiring lots of medical direction or intervention. However, in the conversations we have had, I trust his judgment and expertise. He has always been straightforward with me about illnesses and treatment.
1	I trust him because he seems to know what he's doing. So far he's been right.So I trust him.
-1	My dr. explains my options and asks me which I want to do. She will offer her opinion on what she thinks is the best option for me but ultimately it is my decision. However, she and I disagree on the usefulness of supplements. I think it's helpful to take the ones that I do and she disagrees. I don't completely trust her because of this.
-1	my dr is easy going but very honest. he tell you what you need to do to get better . he doesn't seem snobby like some drs.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been honest with me and has always given me clear direction. He has never pushed any drugs or treatments on me that would be unnecessary. He is very thorough and complete when I go in to visit. He makes me feel very comfortable when I am with him, and I never leave his office feeling confused. 
1	Most of the time I feel like I can trust my doctor. He obviously knows more about health than I do. I don't think he would steer my care in the wrong direction, and it never seems like he is trying to push some unneeded treatment on me for something silly (i.e. restless leg syndrome or something like that) that would make me think he is being paid a commission by pharmaceuticals.
1	I have always been completely satisfied with my Doctor. Always thorough gives me the goods and the bads and tells me it straight forward not holding back 
-1	I can't put all of my trust in what a doctor says until I meet them.  If they take their time treating me and looking for a solution then I can trust in what they are saying.  If they are late and then come in the room, in a rush, then I have difficulty trusting them.  They typically tend to rush through looking over me and seeking a solution to what is wrong.
1	They have gone above and beyond to check in with me after appointments and procedures. They seem genuinely concerned about any issues I am having. I feel like the believe me when I have pain and are not dismissive of any condition. 
-1	My primary care physician is very kind and listens to my problems, so I have high confidence and trust in him.
-1	I have been seeing my Pcp my entire life. He has always been honest and helpful. I have gained a lot of trust over the years
-1	I have always had good experiences with doctors so there is no reason for me not to trust them.  I also believe that doctors are trained well and that they know what is best for me 
-1	I have a new primary care doctor, but she is kind and well-respected. I trust her based on others' experiences and honest reviews, in addition to persol experience. 
1	I do trust my primary care physician because they are a person who I've been seeing for several years now, and whenever any health problems arise, the solutions provided by said physician are very effective in solving these problems.
1	I do not go to the doctor often, and when I do, it's usually a different doctor, so I don't really build trust. That being said, I've had largely very positive experiences with my doctors-- especially psychiatrists. They seem to have my best interests at heart.
1	I trust my doctor to evaluate me and to be honest with me. He is very good at referring me to other good doctors and I trust him to do this.
-1	I do trust my doctor, she seems very informed, and she never takes a guess unless she is sure. I appreciate how organized and detail-oriented she is. My reservations mostly come from my hesitation to fully trust in another person. While medicine has been revolutionized, it is still not an exact science, and things can go wrong at any moment, so while I do trust my doctor, I am not sure I would ever 100% accept everything they told me without some reservations about their correct diagnosis. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for years.  If it were a new doctor I might be a little more hesitant in my trust of them especially if I may not agree with their thoughts or approach.
1	She has been my doctor for the last 11 years, and as soon as I met her I trusted her.  She was warm and caring and took time to listen to me.  She is extremely thorough and such a great doctor. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he is very experienced. He is very sincere and honest with me. He is very down to earth and tells me like it is, regardless of how I feel.
-1	My doctor always seems like he's in a rush and doesn't seem like he is always concerned about answering all my questions. I think he is more concerned about getting done with each patient quickly. 
-1	I trust doctors because I think they genuinely care about treating their patients. They have high reputations and they don't want to risk diagnosing something wrong. 
-1	You can't always believe everything the doctor says in terms of options sometimes they are just looking for the money
-1	I don't think I receive adequate care, attention, or consideration.  I often feel hurried along and my doctor doesn't explain things in much detail, so I'm really under the impression that my doctor just sees each patient as something to cross off a to-do list.
-1	I had a 3 month cough, I was told it would get better on its own.
-1	My doctor is always pleasant and seems to be treating me fairly. We have not had any issues. I came from a primary care doctor that I did not have any trust for, so this seems like a huge improvement to me. 
-1	I go to a primary care physician at a school health center and I think that he is on a tight schedule, and has a lot of patients each day that limits his time to spend diagnosing my problems. 
1	I mostly trust my doctor, however, I will never 100% rely on their word or advice without looking into myself or seeking other opinions.
1	My doctor is awesome. He's smart and funny but he is also serious when he needs to be. He has always been honest with me and given me many options on what to do next and how to proceed. In almost every single case of him suggesting something, that has been the right suggestion, whether I took his advice or didn't. 
1	I have had the same doctor for a long time and we have come to know each other. I feel she has an exceptiol persolity as well as the skills and knowledge to care for my body.
-1	I trust my doctor because he does not judge me when I bring health issues to him. He is always very thorough in suggesting treatments. He does a good job explaining WHY I am having the symptoms  I am. 
-1	I have a good doctor, it's his sense of humor. He is like a comedy central roast comedian, it fun but it make think more about my health 
1	I trust my doctor because he has shown me that he can be trusted. I have been going to him for many years now and he has helped me a lot over that time.
1	My doctor is new to the family due to the fact the old doctor had to retire. So far from meeting him, he's great. He seems to really want to help and make sure you are taken care of.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my doctor for a long time now. I've experienced good results and up till now I only have positive reviews. 
1	I recently changed physicians to a female doctor and feel that she understands me better than the male doctor. I feel I can trust what she says and like her communication style. 
-1	I trust doctors because I know that they care for me. I know that they only want the best for me.
-1	I trust doctors like I trust policemen: i was brought up to trust them
1	I am able to easily talk to my doctor about issues I may have. She is very thorough and takes the time to answers my questions in a way I understand. I appreciate this.
-1	I think sometimes they care more about money than actually helping people.
-1	Sometimes he seems rushed and he might get benefits from recommending certain treatment to me, so I try to assess things objectively.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor. I have had good experiences with her so far. On the other hand I have only seen her a couple of times.
-1	I trust that the Dr believes he is being thorough. The PCP gives basic care and refers you to specialists who I believe try to help.  I don't trust any Dr.  I have been to so many for a chronic condition that I don't have total faith in any of them.
1	He listens very well and addresses all my concerns. He knows me and what I'm like, so he can tell when something is wrong. He really cares about his patients and takes the time to listen.
-1	I just started with a new PCP and have only seen him once, but I didn't like him and probably won't go back. He was dismissive of all of my health concerns. I've been taking blood pressure meds for years and going off of one blood pressure reading he declared that I didn't need them anymore. I was complaining of aneurysm-like pain in an extremely small spot of my head and he ignored that completely.
-1	I have been to my primary care physician twice in two years. The first time they refused to give me the full battery of STD tests I wanted. I had no reason to believe I contracted anything, but because I am non-monogamous I wanted to be responsible, and because I have a phobia of needles and needed a blood draw I figured I'd get all the blood drawing out of the way at once. I had to fight with my doctor and two secretaries for the paperwork, and then when I got my results 3 months later (great processing time - NOT) they STILL hadn't tested for anything! Planned Parenthood handles this sort of thing SO much better than a fricking Catholic Healthcare system. 
-1	I am pretty neutral with doctors - it is their job to tell me what is wrong, but most of the time, I already know what is wrong with myself. Ideally, I'd like to just get a solution to the problem from what I tell the doctors, instead of having to go through the process of them telling me what I already know. 
-1	He tries to help me. He also gets met the only prescription that I need full time. He is pretty helpful.
-1	My primary care physician has never given me any reason to doubt her practices. She has always shown both compassion and knowledge. 
-1	Sometimes I think they may do what makes them the most money. They may not send you to a Specialist because it takes money away from them. They may also not listen to your idea because they feel they are always right.
-1	I would hope for the most part, they are honest with me and I can trust them, but you hear of so many things that happen, and they are so pressed for time usually, that I am always afraid they don't tell you everything in the limited amount of time you are there. My husband recently had to get something done, and they convenient left out some of the adverse side effects.
-1	The physician I see has years of experience along with a degree in subjects I have never even thought about taking. They are more knowledgable in what they are doing then i would never be, in return i would believe what they say. 
1	I've been going to the same doctor for 12 years and I completely trust her opinion. She takes her time with me and listens to everything I say. Since I had my children, she also cares for them and does a great job with them.
1	I trust my doctor. She is very thorough and follows up on any concerns I may have. If she is not familiar with something, she researches it so that she can better help me.
-1	"My current doctor is better than doctors I've had in the past, and he has been able to help me more; he listens to me more. Unfortutely he has some attitudes about certain newer medical conditions--one of which I almost certainly have--that makes it hard us to really ""connect."" He does discuss treatment plans with me on the things he CAN help me with, though."
-1	I find my doctor to be very trustworthy. He is open and honest with me and make things easy to understand.
-1	He did not provided all the answers I needed. It took him less than 5 minutes to see me and guess what's wrong with me. I felt like I visited a quack. I spent 100 dollars in which I can diagnose myself online for free.
-1	My doctor is very well intentioned, but he will opt for conventiol medicine without turning to lifestyle choices first. For example, he would immediately prescribe a statin rather than addressing food choices first. He would prescribe a thyroid drug without first asking if one is eating a lot of sea vegetables or other high-iodine foods. He recommends mammograms despite the evidence that they really don't save lives (in the aggregate), they simply make more people patients.
-1	I do not know.  I have not gone to a primary care physician in 17 years.
-1	I trust my doctor because she hasn't ever given me a reason not to trust her.
-1	I had a doctor I could trust but when we moved to a new state several years ago, I haven't found one I could trust here. I've found larger medical practices where the doctors are in a hurry and you usually end up seeing someone different every time you go.
-1	Doctors are human just like I am.  Some are good, some are bad.  It is up to me to question what I'm told and help find solutions.  If they won't work with me I'll find someone else.
1	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. I have always had a good experience with them. They are thoughtful and clear and always make sure I have my questions answered.
-1	I just feel like he doesn't listen to my concerns sometimes. He also seems distracted a lot. And he doesn't spend very much time with me, either. 
1	My doctor always seems to explain and talk about everything that i have any questions over and it's always quick and to the point but they are also somewhat hurried.
1	I trust my doctor. He really seems to care and treats me like family.
1	My PCP is a very reliable man. He listens to me when I report symptoms and places an importance on my physical and mental health, my overall well-being. He has expressed concern for my health and has instructed me to follow necessary steps to becoming healthier in my everyday life. I appreciate and respect his feedback, and I know that he is looking out for my best interest.
-1	Doctors are only people. While highly trained and educated, it is important to make decisions based on what is best for me, the patient. 
1	my doctor has really been great for me in the past. Him and his office have treated me spectacularly through a number of different situations that have arose. I haven't ever felt rushed or uncared for after seeing him.
1	My doctor listens to my concerns and explains things thoroughly. If I have a concern, my doctor makes other options available and reassures me.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She is thorough and always asks me the right questions. She takes the time with me that expect and answers all my questions and handles all of my concerns. She has a great reputation.
1	My doctor is very experienced.  I can tell much about my doctor by his mannerisms.
1	Perhaps it's because I haven't had a severe condition that has caused me to question my doctor's judgment, but I have had only positive interactions with my PCP and have received appropriate treatments. I am always given the chance to talk about my problems and able to ask questions. I never feel as though I'm being rushed out the door on an assembly line to make room for another patient, but that I am being treated by someone who is interested in getting to the root of my health problem.
1	I've known this doctor for a long time. He's very trustworthy and kind. I believe in him.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for a while.  She is very thorough.  If there is a question about treatment or diagnosis, she will refer you elsewhere.
-1	I trust doctors because they have a lot of medical knowledge. Their assessments and recommendations usually work for me. I've never had a serious problem with a doctor that would make me lose faith in them.
-1	sometimes i feel like i am told i need things i don't really need to milk money out of me. i do not think they would harm me but just trivial things that aren't needed are made to sound like bigger deals then they actually are.
1	I just like him and he is knowledgeable.  I can always research on the internet.  He answers my questions and is patient and kind.
-1	i dont have other choice, im not a doctor
1	I have had the same doctor for over ten years and she has always gotten the diagnosis right the first time. I have complete trust in her and we can talk about anything. She always spends time with me and answers my questions.
1	I just made a appointment with my primary I had never seen him or any primary but I thought of my gynecologist who I've seen for years. I trust her because she has kept me healthy and is very polite. She is easy to talk to.
-1	I trust my doctor because he gives me good advise and when I am having an issue , he is always helpful . He explains to me what to do and what are my best options to feeling better. 
-1	He is honest and caring.  However, he is not entirely well versed in health issues outside his specialty.  He has made mistakes before and shown that he does not  know how to do certain procedures.  He is good at interl medicine but not at neurology .
-1	I don't trust my doctor, or any doctor wholly because I do feel as though they are all about the money in most cases. 
1	"I have known him my entire life, and he is a second father to me - very, very close family friends who helped raise me. He is calm, ratiol, compassiote, and works with patients by listening to what they know is going on in their own bodies, what's ""normal"" for them, etc, instead of railroading them. Pharma reps have 0 influence on him - he is above reproach morally. He's going to retire soon and I don't know what I'm going to do!"
1	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him.  He has also gone above and beyond in taking care of the rest of my family, including handling a couple of emergency situations wonderfully.
-1	sometimes I think my doctor tries to make money off of the medicine he prescribes for me. I've been recommended some medication that could help but wasn't quite necessary. Persol fincial gain is a problem I find with some doctors.
1	I trust my primary care doctor.  I have a very open relationship with him.  He will tell me the good things as well as the bad things.  I think that he is focused on recommending the best things for me as a patient.  I believe that his recommendations change based on the patients that he is dealing with.
-1	We all are human with all possible mistakes. I like to have second or even third opinion almost always.
1	I feel I get many explations throughout any of my appointments that educate me on what is happening and why at all times.  It is very helpful to be able to feel educated. 
1	My physician always takes the time out to answer my questions and explain things. She is very honest and blunt.
-1	My doctor is persoble and down to earth and makes going to the doctor easy. She is also very up front about different options and treatments and doesn't give her own opinion of the product but what might work best for the individual.
-1	"In past experiences, visits to my primary physician have resulted in absolutely nothing. ""Take this medication"" is pretty much the only advice I receive. "
-1	"I trust my PCP to a certain extent, not because I feel that she has negative motives, but more because I know she is human and prone to make mistakes just like everyone else. I know she may have a bad day and may not be at her best. So while I trust her medical knowledge, I don""t put 100% faith in everything she says or does."
1	Generally I always trust people. My doctor cares for me. So I always trust him.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing them since I was young. My whole family goes to the same practice and we have had a lot of positive experiences and received good health care.
-1	I know he receives samples from pharm reps. I also know that is what I'll be walking out of his office with. 
1	I trust my doctor because she takes her time when she is seeing me, she is knowledgeable, smart, kind, caring, wants to help me whenever I am sick or need to discuss something with her. She always has my best interest and in mind when she is tending to my health needs.
1	My doctor doesn't seem like a bad guy. He doesn't push any medicines or products on me, so it doesn't seem like he's benefitting in any way that would make him disregard my care.
1	He's been my doctor for years. Whenever something is wrong, we can general figure out a fix. If there's ever problem we can't work through together, he sends me to a specialist.
-1	I believe that they have my best interest in mind. They want to do the best for me that they can.
1	My primary care physician is kind and answers any questions that I may have. He is also very careful and mostly remembers when I last visit him. I think he cares a lot about his patients.
-1	I dont have a strong persol relationship with my doctor so I can't really say that they have my best interest in mind. I'm sure they dont want to actively harm me but I don't know if they really care that much. 
1	I think my trust comes mainly from the time my dr. is willing to spend with me. She takes the time to talk and get to know me and what my life looks like. She integrates any options into what works in my situation. 
1	I've been with my doctor for about 5 years now and she has always taken the time to answer my questions and address any concerns that I have, even taking extra time to figure issues out.
1	I have had the same physician since I was very young and he has always taken my concerns seriously. I have never had any issues with him. He always addresses my concerns and has been proactive about addressing any health problems I may have. He is always patient in answering questions or concerns.
1	I trust my Dr because he takes the time to explain things to me and answer any questions I may have.
1	I generally had positive experiences with health care providers. I trust that these people took their education and their training seriously and that they value their job enough to make correct recommendations. I have yet to have any reason to distrust medical professiols.
-1	I do trust my PCP.
-1	I don't believe I have any serious medical conditions.  My physician doesn't seem too concerned about me.  Some mistakes have been made when I visited him.
-1	From my last couple experiences with my doctor I feel that they have my best interests in mind and that they are trying to help me, but I feel they are overworked and sometimes don't have enough time to get to know me.
1	My primary care physician is very friendly and likable. She always makes sure that I feel comfortable and I understand all of my options.
-1	Sometimes my doctor doesn't listen to my main concern and instead changes the subject and discusses other things that I didn't come in to discuss that day. 
-1	Most physicians are time constrained, they do not believe in altertive medicine nor ways to treat problems, they want to prescribe a pill and have you out the door so they can make more money by seeing more patients. 
1	My Primary care physician is very thorough and can recognize the problem very quickly. I have seen her for anything from a serious illness to a fall and she has known what the problem was so soon as I explained to her how I feel and she saw the injury. She has always been correct in her diagnosis and has sent me to great specialists when the need arises.
1	I trust my current doctor since he seems pretty honest. He is friendly and has told me that he's interested in my well-being directly at least once. He wants to hear what I have to say, and if I ask a question about something, he does his best to answer it to my satisfaction. I haven't experienced anything that makes me feel I should distrust him thus far, though I won't say I completely trust him 100%, since I know he's not infallible.
-1	It's not a question of trust, but I know what's best for me. A doctor is an adviser, not the end-all be - all. I trust my docs, but as they say, I trust my mother, but I still cut the cards
-1	Sometimes the doctor will tell me what i need to do or take, instead of giving me options. I know that he isnt always right all the time, so that makes me question him.
-1	I feel like I trust physicians in general, however, if I was about to make a serious decision regarding my health, I would not hesitate to get a second opinion if I felt uncomfortable. 
1	He is honest and upfront. He listens to my needs and answers any questions I may have without making me feel rushed
-1	My primary care physician hasn't given me any reason to think he has ulterior motives. He has been pretty spot on every time I have seen him so I will continue to trust his judgement.
1	I have had the same primary care doctor for quite a number of years and she has always taken the time with me to figure out any problems and treatments available. She helps me come to a decision with treatment plans, taking my day to day life into account. If she doesn't know an answer, she will tell me, and refer me to a specialist she trusts to help me.
-1	She listens to what I say, she remembers or has notes about my concerns from previous visits (such as disdain for taking drugs).  Sometimes I wish she was a bit more firm with me about things like my weight, etc.
-1	I trust him for the most part. But, even he can have gaps in knowledge and is perhaps more wanting to do the expedient thing than the most thorough. 
1	I trust my PCP because she always tells me the truth, even if it is not what i want to hear. She has never lead me wrong. She takes the time to listen and do a full assessment. 
-1	I don't know, I haven't been to a regular doctor for four years. I went to the gynecologist like two years ago, and that went pretty well. I've known that doctor since I was a little kid (~3-4 years old), so I do tend to trust her. I think that most doctors are probably pretty trustworthy, because they really have to work hard to become doctors in the first place, so they probably wouldn't be bad people after all of that hard work.
1	She is intelligent and asks thorough questions.  She is good at following up.
-1	I do not have complete trust in any doctor. You have to be your own advocate. Doctors struggle with the amount of time spent with patients versus the number of people that need to be seen each day. Any time I am given a medication or advice from a doctor, I do my own research before trusting it completely.
1	I trust my primary care physician because in the past he has never gave me any reason to doubt him. Every time I've came in with a question or concern, he's spent the time to sit down with me and address all of my concerns. He's never tried to rush me me out or just disregard me. I am very comfortable around him, and would go to him about any medical concern I had.
1	Because I have been able to talk to him like a person - without it feeling like a judgment.
1	If I didn't completely trust her, she wouldn't be my PCP.  Health care is too important to leave in the hands of someone I don't trust and/or cannot communicate with.
-1	I have only gone to my primary care physician for about a year now and hadn't had one before that for 20 years. So far he has given me no reason to distrust him and has been open to conversations about various problems. I don't have enough data to have a strong opinion on how trustworthy he is but I am assuming he is.
1	He has dedicated his life to helping people with their life. I don't believe he would lie to me. I believe he always has my best interests in mind and gives me the truth.
1	I have been going to my doctor since I was little and he knows me and my family well. I trust in what he says and does to treat my ailments.
1	My doctor is a great doctor.  He tells you straight about medical information.  I have researched him and he does not participate in pharmaceutical company kickbacks.
-1	I have a rare disease. It took 4 years and several doctors before I filly got a diagnosis and effective treatment. Along the way, I had doctors who were well-meaning but unhelpful, doctors that accused me of lying, doctors that ignored me and forced me to go to a patient advocate to get them to follow through. I've learned that it isn't in my best interests to assume that any doctor can be completely trusted.
1	I trust mines because I have not experience anything that went wrong as of yet.
-1	She takes the time to listen to my concerns. She fully explains all test results to me and answers all my questions without hesitation.
-1	I wouldn't trust a doctor 100%, I would seek a 2nd opinion if there was ever a serious matter. 
-1	I trust my doctor because they seem trustworthy and have had more experience than me.
-1	I don't trust any doctors anymore. I have seen so many that are not involved in my care as I feel they should be. I like my doctor now but I don't trust him.
-1	My doctor usually gives me the news straight and goes over treatment plans.  I have seen my health improve in the last 2 years since going to this doctor so I trust future advise he gives me. 
-1	If I'm asked about symptoms, I can barely finish a sentence before he just blurts out some answer. After that he's very dismissive of questions. I might get a printout with s cursory explation of what's going on.
-1	I don't care for my primary car physician. I feel like I am just a number as she quickly would complete my visit and rarely answer questions. When I truly had a need she didn't have any advice for me and didn't offer to converse with her colleagues to find out.She also didn't listen to me and caused me several scares during my first pregncy. I haven't seen my PCP in 6 years because of it. 
-1	I feel like most doctors will try their best, but I have experience with some who have clearly not known what they are doing. So while I generally trust them, I am always skeptical.
-1	I believe my doctor is looking out for my best interest, that being said he is only human and is prone to making mistakes like everyone else. But deep down I do think he cares about my well-being.
1	I trust a doctor to know more about what is wrong when it is an infection or severe injury. Mild injuries including soreness and stitches have had moderately incorrect diagnoses. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I've never been given a reason not to. They are the medical professiols with years of training and education and I should defer to their recommendations unless they give me a reason not to trust them.
-1	They seem to worry about other issues when I go to see them. I went for a sore throat and end up getting a test for something else.
1	I have had the same primary care doctor for over 10 years. She is very thorough and explains her reasoning for any medication that she prescribes. She listens and pays attention to what I have to say.
-1	He may not have the best bedside manner but he's always utd on all new and current medical information and I feel I get great care just too faced paced if that makes sense
-1	My dr has helped me with several things over the last couple if years. She has even let me try a couple of meds that i had wanted to. I seem to do well under her care.
1	I feel that my doctor-patient relationship is well established and she feels comfortable telling me things even if I won't agree with them. She is aware I will ask questions and I will always be respectful even if I disagree with her recommendation. 
1	My PCP has been very open about her reasoning and thought processes and gone out of her way to set me up with the next steps for me to pursue. She listens to my concerns and thoughts as well.
-1	
1	My primary physician hasn't failed me yet. The other week I went in because I had an horrible cough and headache. He took a look into my ears and prescribed antibiotics, one week later I am feeling better.
-1	I trust my physician because I know he graduated from a really good medical school. He also is very kind and takes him time to explain everything so you can understand it.
-1	I do trust my primary care physician or else I would be choosing another physician.  I am also aware that physicians are busy and that sometimes things can get missed in a busy office so it is my responsibility to keep myself well-informed regarding tests, results and treatments and to ask questions if needed.  
-1	I would like to think that doctors have the patients best interest at heart. I would also think that they have seen many cases of certain illnesses and have  lots of experience in dealing with the problem. However, sometimes, I think that a doctor can have ulterior motives but most likely not.
1	I have been seeing my current doctor for nearly 2 years, but my experience with doctors in general is very consistent. Every time I have a question about my overall health or a specific condition, my doctor is able to clearly explain his thoughts on the matter. 
1	My doctor does not dance around subjects and outright tells me what is wrong and how or why I should fix things if they need medical attention. 
-1	Everyone I go in with a concern I get a few words in  then suddenly there is medicine without test..
-1	I have a new doctor and he seems fine. So far he persoble and seems knowledgeable. I hope over time he will be a good choice.
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for years now, and he is very familiar with me and my history. He has never steered me wrong, and he listens attentively to any questions I have. I have a great deal of trust in him.
-1	I believe that some doctors pay attention to you, but some do not. My current doctor i don't believe listens to me. When i first was going through menopause i felt like i was going crazy to have some much anxiety. He was a young doctor and i felt like he was looking at me like i just wanted drugs. He never explained to me all that goes along with menopause.
-1	My doctor is usually very good at explaining the mechanisms behind any diagnosis she give. But, when I got bloodwork done she completely overlooked something that has been shown to give symptoms that I was having. She immediately prescribed medication rather than trying to find out what the cause of my abnormal bloodwork was.
1	I don't feel like he pushes medication on me, which is a fear I have regarding most doctors. I don't want a doctor who is in the pocket of Big Pharma. 
1	"I trust my doctor because he is very direct and ""no-nonsense"".  He explains things very clearly and presents me with options."
1	I have total trust in my physician,  If I didn't, I would find another one in which I did trust.  I have never felt misled or lied to,  I feel as though they are looking out for my health, and helping me stay healthy. 
-1	"My GP has been great over the years. Rarely has he said ""trust me I'm a doctor"" He has a fantastic group of referral physicians and surgeons and has never steered me wrong with any medical treatment or diagnosis, unless there is little known about it then we both work on it"
1	My PCP is a former Director of the CDC and is a Board Member of the American Cancer Society.  His experience, knowledge and wisdom, associated with viral infections and Cancer, have proven to be a profound blessing.  Also, his associates and other specialists work well as a team when preparing my treatment plans, explaining all of the parameters associated with them, and carrying them out.
1	I've been with my doctor for almost a decade and she know my body inside and out! I trust her judgment because, so far, she's been correct about any issues I've had regarding my care. She is well educated and stays abreast of the latest advances in medicine, which she shares with her patients. 
-1	They have more medical training than me. I do not know anything regarding the field of medicine and that is their job. I have to depend on what they know, similar to how people depend on me for IT advise.
-1	I have had hard to diagnosis conditions in the past and because I go to a large HMO where the doctors have a huge client load, I feel that there is no way that a doctor can adequately diagnosis this type of condition. After a doctor's appointment, I often combine research that I've done online with what they say or prescribe. 
-1	They have never given me a reason not to trust them and everything they've ever done for me worked out well. I also generally agree with the treatment or advice they give me too.
1	i have had the same doctor for 10 years and know him and his decision making abilities and he has a good persoble quality and is fairly accurate
-1	As I only see a doctor once every few years, I would say I have had no reason to mistrust any of them.  In general, I feel I have been given adequate information and care.
1	I trust my primary physician based on how he has helped me in the past. He is always thorough and I went through other doctors before sticking with him. He always explains the options and when possible, we decide things together.
1	I trust my doctor because she is always honest with me about everything and explains things in terms that I can understand. 
-1	Sometimes I think she doesn't listen to all my concerns or tries to easily explain away or dismiss my concerns.  I would like for her to try to resolve each issue and not blow me off.
-1	I rarely go to the doctor, and in fact, don't really have one that I would call my primary.  When I do go, though, it is usually for a specific issue, sickness, or injury and I always have the feeling the doctor just wants to get me in and out so he or she can get on to the next one.  I rarely feel like they have my best interest at heart.
-1	While there may be those in the field who truly want to help others, the bottom line is that people will look after themselves one way or another. I don't trust anyone. Doctors are no exception.
-1	My doctor is the same doctor I had as a kid.  He is super Christian and super American.  I haven't been to see him in over 10 years because he always wants to talk to me about Jesus and democracy.
-1	Almost all drs in this country have to follow the deranged findings of the government and the funding of the drug companies. 
1	I generally trust my doctor since I switched to him after having a bad experience with a previous doctor, and my current doctor was very honest in giving me new treatment options. He is very good at communication and seems to listen very closely and with interest in what I say. 
-1	"I receive medical treatment through a public health service. These people are over worked, under paid, and emotiolly drained. They have no incentive nor energy to deal with people who are uncooperative, and thus will try to give few options that leave people with ""obvious"" choices. "
1	in order to feel comfortable and know you have the right doctor for you is to be able to completly trust him and the desicions he makes.
-1	Well, I marked neutral on all these because my PCP has only been with me 4 months. If i don't believe in my doctor or the doctor doesn't have faith in me about fixing things with a diet and exercise they get the boot. If they don't listen to me or make me feel ignored they get the boot.  So far I like him and he is  being a cheerleader for me 
-1	They have good intentions and want to help. They also have rules and regulations they have to comply with and don't have the time to get into the details about individual patient care. I trust that they are giving good advice, but it's only part of the picture. As an adult I need to research any conditions I have and find the best overall plan to treat it, including their treatment recommendations or medicines. 
-1	My primary care physician is very forward with information and makes sure I understand everything he tells me. He is very open to questions and is very considerate.
1	My doctor seems to be honest and trustworthy. She has given me good medical advice in the past and I can't see a situation, unless something changes drastically, where I wouldn't trust her. 
-1	I don't have a primary physician, but I feel that overall, doctors are more concerned about the bottom line than the patients. In the past, I have been prescribed medicine I don't need for a condition I don't have, just because the physician I was seeing was paid to do so by the pharmaceutical companies. I don't feel that doctors really listen to their patients. 
-1	I believe doctors in general want money. I think they make stuff up to scare you.
1	My family doctor has always treated us great including my two year old child with a serious heart disease and if it weren't for them we may have found out about her disease in the worst way possible which would be finding her dead. My doctor gives it to me straight and certainly does not sugarcoat anything which is good considering I am obese.
-1	In my experience, doctors tend care less about their patients if their patients have free health care. When I did, the doctor I had kept trying to convince me to get as few tests done as possible, and never told me the results of those tests. Whereas if I had been paying out of pocket or had really good insurance, they probably would have given me every test in the book whether I asked for it or not. They have also been far too dismissive. When I go to a doctor, I want to know if a problem is real or in my head. If the doctor says there's nothing physically wrong with me, then that gives me a way to understand what's going on with me. But a doctor that refuses to help is a pointless doctor to spend your time and money on.
-1	Just his general presence and how he is willing to explain everything in detail and will allow extra time in appointments to go over any concerns I may have.
1	I trust them because they committed to very many years of schooling to do what they do. They're trained in their profession and do it nearly every day which quickly builds experience. The most experience I have is Google searches so I have no choice but to put my trust in them.
-1	I trust them nbecasue they are professiols. I am going there because I value their opinions and trust them whole heartedly.
-1	There's just really no way to know how much one can trust one's doctor. Sometimes the doctor may make an honest mistake--how much do you trust the doctor then? Does it depend on the consequences of that mistake?
1	I have been seeing the same doctor since I was a young adult, he's always been kind, and comes of caring and astute. My doctor has never given me a reason to question his decisions. 
-1	Because i have family in the medical industry i have seen how cold they have become from being a caretaker. they get burned out and tired and start treating like a regular job versus a healing profession. 
1	I think that when it comes to healthcare you should trust but verify. I think that there is a common way to deal with problems, but it is not always what is best for your undiviual needs. I like to learn what my doctor recommends but also look for other options and tural treatments as well. I think my doctor is awesome, but she is just human, and therefore it is important to have other ways of obtaining other opionons. 
-1	I don't fully trust doctors in general because I've had bad experiences with them in the past. I feel like the process to become a doctor 1lpeople who actually care from completing it, and a lot of doctors I've met are self centered and see patients as puzzles instead of real people.
1	She listens to my concerns and offers options. I have learned that I need to write down my symptoms over time and let her know what I've been feeling and for how long. She is then quite willing to listen and explore options
-1	I believe after being in a practice for a long time, everything is routine. I don't feel like they give as much thought into my complaints as they should. I don't go into the doctor for any old little thing, if I go, I am severely concerned. Their concern never matches my concern.
-1	When I delivered my baby it was near dinner time at the close of the business day and the doctor wanted to be done. He was frustrated that I had a birth plan that I asked him to follow when there was no medical indication not to and he injured me by speeding up the delivery in yanking out my baby. Following that there have been instances where I have sought help for a condition I have and the doctor has only told me he doesn't want me to continue the treatment I have been using without an explation as to why and he was pushing me to use a contraceptive rather than the altertive treatment that has been effectively working. 
-1	I recently encounter a medical situation in which most of the problem was created by doctors non-expertise in that area. 
-1	I trust my doctor because they are medical professiols. Since I am not knowledgeable in the field it is in my best interest not to doubt my doctor unless proven otherwise. I not denying that there aren't incompetent doctors out there, but I will give them the benefit of doubt unless evidence contradicts.
1	My doctor is the first one to listen to me when I told him my antidepressants were making my feet and legs stay swollen and also it was causing me to shake a lot when I got hungry.  He took me off the immediately and then gave me the option of trying to survive without them or going on another type.  We worked together to get me off of both of them.  He also listened to my issue about sleep apnea and got me tested and approved for a corrective surgery.
-1	While i trust that doctors are often doing their best and have reasons for why the do or do not recommend certain treatments, I do think they fall into patterns and often disregard complimentary medicines. They can be quick to prescribe medication or surgery with holistic remedies or simple dietary changes can help. Doctors are people and they are flawed and I believe that just like many other people, provide better care to patients they feel connected with. I feel like i have a responsibility as a patient to do my own research and ask questions. 
-1	I've been with my doctor for many years now and have had no issues with her. She is very nice and I do trust her very much. That said on a big medical decision I may get a second opinion.
1	I trust my doctor because I have yet to receive bad advice from them. They have also been a doctor for a long time, so they have valuable experience that help my trust
-1	Doctors are only interested in what your insurance can cover-period! It's very difficult to find a decent doctor who will consider what is best for the patient and sometimes their treatment is worst than the decease itself!
-1	My PCP usually addresses all of my concerns, and will triage them accordingly. He's also cared for me during some more recent, complicated health issues, so I trust he knows my health concerns just as well as I do.
-1	My primary care physician did not build a good rapport with me. I felt like, if I had to bring my child to an appointment, she cared more about holding my baby than caring for me
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have gone to their practice since I was a newborn and have had no problems, and have handled all of my vaccines and health issues appropriately with them. I figure that my doctor knows a lot more about health than I do and that alone is a reason to invest a lot of trust in them.
-1	I have been going to my doctor for over 20 years, I trust her. I feel as if she treats me based on my needs not as a guideline of treatment, but for individual needs. She talks to me like a person and shows respect and compassion.
1	I DO TRUST MY NEW DOCTOR.  SHE IS RIGHT TO THE POINT ABOUT THINGS.  SHE TELLS YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND TELLS YOU HOW SHE FEELS WHEN YOU DON'T DO IT.  SHE HOLDS NOTHING BACK.  SHE HASN'T LET ME DOWN AS OF YET.  
1	If I didn't trust my PCP then I would look elsewhere (as I have done in the past). One of the most important aspects of a PCP is trust. If I can't trust him/her then the relationship is worthless to me.
-1	Hes there to make money.  He has his own agenda, and sometimes I feel like he ends up only doing the least amount to help me so I will  have to come in again so he can make more money off of me.
1	My doctor has always had my trust and has not failed me yet. So I have no reason not to trust him.
-1	I feel that with my interactions with my primary care physician he shows a good amount of concern for my well being. I trust him because he gives me all the information I need to make a decision and gives me his opinions and experience to help me.
-1	Looking for another doctor in the city
-1	
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because in the past they regularly suggest things that aren't necessary, but that are extremely expensive. They seem to have no understanding that not everyone can afford anything they want. They act like money is no object. I don't think they're looking out for my best interest.
1	If my primary care physician see that his way is not working he will send me to another doctor , he will explain every thing to me , sometimes draws pictures and shows me how something will work , he takes his time with me and make sure I know what is going to happen 
1	I have known my doctor since my first daughter was born over 13 years ago.  She has treated all of my children.  I started seeing her myself 4 years ago and she has always given me insightful options and thorough testing.
1	I've been with my primary care physician for several years, and we have a good relationship. I feel like my physician is open and forthcoming with me, and I feel like I can be as well in return.
-1	Every single person in my family has trusted their doctor and ended up worse off for it. That is, except for surgeons. I never really have a need to go to a doctor, but I've been to a few dentists, one of which was horrible. Absolutely horrible. Filling fell out within days and their work was extremely sub-par. I had to go to a different dentist to get it fixed which cost me quite a bit. I've been with my significant other when she has went to her doctor and they literally googled symptoms. Yeah, I don't have a lot of faith in GP's. 
-1	For the most part, I trust physicians but I do believe in getting a second opinion where treatment for cronic health issues are concerned. I saw both of my grandparents almost die because of a doctor who was more concerned with his bottom line than caring for what they needed. They were heavily over medicated and taking medicine they did not need. They were both in need of a pacemaker but he would not refer them to a cardiologist. The family had to take over and get them to different doctors so that they could have a healthy life instead of slowly wasting away.
-1	I have seen different doctors throughout my life for regular healthcare visits. These have typically been older physicians. I trust their experience and judgement from having practiced medicine for many years. I haven't always agreed with everything they've mentioned but I believe they recommend what they do to the best of their abilities and due to trying to err on the side of caution.
-1	After years of having pain and getting sick, I am still no closer to knowing what is wrong with me that I was 6 years ago. I never seem to get answers to why I am sick, and even after tests the doctors still don't know. I am so frustrated by this. I don't have health insurance and have to go to a clinic and never get the same health care provider twice.  There is no one to trust in my case.
-1	There are a lot of changes in medicine constantly and there are a ton of options it would probably take days  to cover the ones for each condition. Doctors tend to go with the simplest or maybe cheapest if that is the way insurance providers make you go. Sometimes the best answer is not simple or cheap.
1	She always goes above and beyond. She never stops trying until she finds whats wrong. 
1	My doctor explains everything to me and then presents options for me to choose from. This creates a relationship where I trust her. She is providing me with the opportunity to be involved in my healthcare decisions instead of being extremely paterlistic and telling me what I should and should not be doing.
-1	He's been my primary doctor for years already and his cure is always effective.
-1	i trust them. But no one is perfect so its best to do your own research as well as get a doctors opinion.
-1	I don't think MDs know all of the options for treatment and, therefore, always recommend the options that they are most familiar with or have the latest buzz in jourls or commercials or get the best meals from the local sales representative. They are human and they habits and are easily influenced.
-1	I have always had good experiences with doctors. They have all been professiol and seemed to be competent.
1	I trust them because it is their job.  I do realize that everyone has flaws and sometimes ulterior motives. However I still trust the doctor.
-1	I do not fully trust anyone completely, even a doctor. I always have a sense of questioning about what if. No one is perfect and even doctors make errors or are wrong.
1	I have known him for quite awhile.  he is well respected and has an excellent reputation.  He always takes time to talk with me and address any concerns that i might have. 
-1	He has studied medicine a lot more then I have, but the things I have researched have aligned with what he has told me.
-1	I feel like my doctor does what is easiest when it comes to my medical condition. I don't think my doctor cares much about my wellbeing. He is just doing a job that he may or may not even care about.
-1	I feel my PCP sometimes rushes through appointments. Plus they are handcuffed by what my insurance allows them to do. 
-1	I like him and have used him for years. I trust him.
-1	i trust my doctor because she knows more than i do about human bodies. i can look things up and give her my symptoms, but at the end of the day she knows a lot more than i do about how things work. I trust her.
1	I have been seeing him for years and he knows what best for me. We both do research on things to see what will work the best.
-1	I think my doctor has my interest in hand. I trust that my needs are important .
-1	I have been having a growing feeling that my doctor is not doing all he can to help me lower my blood pressure. The medication I am using now, the fourth, is not working very well at all.
-1	I trust my physician in part but there are things that I think he could miss. Also I like my doctor but he is only human.
1	I never trust anyone completely, however I truly believe that most doctors are truthful and honest or the most part when talking to the clients
1	My doctor always take the time to explain things to me.  My doctor never makes me feel rushed.
1	My primary care physician is very thorough in explaining things and likes to make sure I understand what she has told me before the visit ends. 
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part.  A doctor isn't always aware of all the side effects of a medication or its interactions with other medications.  Medicine is changing very quickly and it is hard to keep up with the latest developments.
-1	I'm in between PCPs (switched insurance based on marriage). I answered the questions based on my last one, who was a resident, fresh out of med school. She would take a lot of time to talk with me about issues, but more for herself/understanding things. She referred me to a dermatologist for an issue I still have, and I completely mistrusted the derm because he wanted me on 4 medications for something simple, even after I told him none of them worked in the past. This made me not want to trust my old PCP in her referral judgement.
-1	"I haven't had a primary care doctor for years because I'm poor and couldn't afford to go to doctors, but I did go to the emergency room a few years ago and that doctor totally ripped me off. I had a sty bleeding wound on my eyebrow. The doctor glued it back together, gave me 2 Tylenols, and a tetanus shot. All of that cost almost $2000. You can explain it to me a million ways but there's no way those actions cost $2000. It took the doctor 5 minutes and the bill said that the ""physician fee"" or whatever it was called was $800. They charged me $10 a piece for the 2 Tylenols. All some of these medical people care about is money. It may have once been a noble profession but now they're just as crassly capitalistic as any other big business in this country."
-1	My doctor is above the average but still I've had to correct him regarding important details of my medical history as I've had to to varying extents with many doctors.  I do find that he is patient and receptive, however.  I've definitely had worse but my doctor is not ideal for me.  I'm not certain that exists.
-1	I feel like the time spent with me is probably not enough to accurately diagnose and help. I think my doctor has good intentions, and is very knowledgeable, but probably too busy. 
1	I answered this about my mother's main surgeon. He removed her colon, ovaries, uterus, gallbladder, appendix and spleen. We went through four surgeon consults before I found the one we have now. I kept going back to our PCP and getting additiol referrals until I found one I liked. The first four were complete nightmares.They had neither the time or inclition to answer my questions thoroughly and were arrogant. I refuse to accept sub par medical care. I think hospitalists should get with the program and understand that their patients are CONSUMERS and while they are selling a highly specialized product, they do not have a monopoly.
-1	I believe that doctors and general can easily get caught up in the formulaic behavior of routinely prescribing prescription for patients A, B, and C, so when the next patient comes along with a similar issue it is just a wag of their pen to get them out of their office and another person into the exam room and go on with their day. 
1	I've been going to her office for a few years now and I'm always impressed by her high intelligence, her warmth, her competence and professiolism and the way she is always calm, attentive, quick and relaxed at the same time. And she is also greatly regarded in the profession - she has won many awards, which definitely inspires confidence.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I usually have a lot of questions to ask them when I come in for visits. They take the time to answer those questions and break down the technical answers into something I can understand. They also have taken care of all the other members of my family as well for years. So a long bond with our physician created that trust over many years.
1	After a visit I check everything he has told me.
-1	I trust my doctor because when I go in for a visit, she listens to me and usually has more than one option to try without immediately going to medicine. I feel like I am heard and she typically solves my problems without multiple visits of trial and error.
-1	I had a wonderful primary care doctor but he had since retired due to too much paper work involved in the practice. For the time being, I don't have a primary doctor. However, I come in contact with different doctors. Many are good, normal people. They do their best to treat patients with their specialized knowledge that they spent years to acquire. At the same time, they are just humans and could only do so much to treat patients. 
1	I trust what my Doctor tells me as I have been a patient of hers for a number of years. 
-1	"The dummy put me on birth control for headaches and then when I spiraled into panic attacks and depression, then came the zoloft and birth control. I knew there ""had"" to be some other answer because this all just came on so suddenly. They want to give you the typical ""disease"" bullshit and that you'll be on meds the rest of your life to mage. F no. I spent days and asked the universe several times to lead me to the answer, and it did. My diet was high protein, high fat, high processed vegan junk food, and ever since switching to a high fruit, mostly raw vegan lifestyle, I becoming a new person, and don't need their bullshit meds. They get handouts for prescribing meds to people and they don't fully understand the lymphatic system, in fact they completely ignore it. Unless Dr. Morse on youtube who was the ONLY one, that actually completely explained the lymphatic system, how all diseases are connected and the underlying problem of too much acid chemistry in our bodies."
1	They spent years learning their practice so I should be able to trust them.
1	I trust my physician because she is caring and honest. She is open and you can talk to her about any of your health concern and she will give her honest advice on what should or shouldn't be done. 
1	I trust doctors to know what's best for patients because they have the required knowledge and training to diagnose these problems and provide accurate information to help solve issues.
-1	I don't completely trust my pcp. It often seems that if they don't properly diagnose a condition the first time, that they want to blame the patient instead of looking further to figure out exactly what the problem is. I feel like a lot of the time, they can't be bothered to listen, because in their minds, they've already decided what the truth is. 
-1	Sometimes doctors don't have the patients best interest in mind.
1	My physician is very though and takes the time to explain things to me. And he shows patients and eager to answer all my questions. And makes sure that I completely understand before I leave his office. He always make sure we have a plan and a time when we will follow up.
-1	I trust my doctor because he does not beat around the bush. He tells me when I need to address something or if I am over reacting. He also tells me to not be afraid to get a second opinion. That he is only human and that he wants me to feel comfortable and if that means getting another doctor's opinion then so be it. 
-1	I trust my primary care provider a great deal.  He has done quite a bit to inform me of low cost options for treatment as well as flat out given me prescriptions.  He is also a big believer in preventative medicine.  The guy is a gem. 
1	I trust him b/c he has proven that he cares and wants to find out what is wrong with me no matter what.  
-1	Doctors usually just want to peddle bullcrap expensive medicines that are just overhyped painkillers most of the time. $200 for painkillers is not justified, obviously there's some third party putting pressure on doctors to peddle this crap.
1	I have complete in my doctor, Ihave been seeing her for quite sometime, She always give the best treatment , So for she have taken good care of me.
-1	I generally think he is honest and trying hard but I don't think he is a very good communicator and sometimes it feels like he is hard to read. I don't always know how urgent or serious something is.
-1	The practice I go to has SO MANY PATIENTS. The care is generally good, but I often feeling like I'm on an assembly line and their time with me is on the clock, so they might be more expedient than thorough.  
-1	I trust my doc becasue he talks to me like a person, not just throw meds at me and call next patient.
1	I trust my doctor because he is very knowledgeable in his job and knows what he is doing and what is best for me to do and take.
-1	I have been several times to my doctor and have mentioned certain pains or issues and if it is not the focus of the visit they are kinda brushed off.  This has happened several times so I don't completely trust my physician.
1	I believe my doctor take the time to give the most important information and take time to explain things to me. And will route me to additiol sources so I trust her over all.
-1	 Trust my primary care physician because not only did he go to school to be in his profession but he also has taken the time to get to know me.
-1	I usually trust my doctor if I agree with what they think is best to do and if I don't agree I question him.
1	"I don't ""completely"" trust anyone, but do I believe my doc is being honest and upfront with me?   Yes.    Not that I wouldn't get a second opinion if I had a serious illness, that's a common sense thing.  "
1	My doctor takes his time and does not rush. He gives me many options for treatment and often asks for my preferences and input.
-1	I feel that because I am not diagnosed with detrimental medical conditions my doctor has less regard over optiol treatments for a condition. I have some regard for their opinions, but am not fine with the cost of some prescriptions written for my treatment.
1	I trust my doctor because the things that he has suggested to me regarding my health have always helped me. My doctor is patient and listens to me when I have questions.
1	I trust my PCP completely as he is the one who has the credentials, knowledege and experience to give advice and treat patients, including myself.I believe my doctor is honest and  I trust his decisions completely based on his thoroughness and willingness to answer and address any questions I have.
1	Although my PCP is fairly new to me (&gt;then one year) he quickly takes action on long term conditions I explain and gets me into the correct specialist if he is uble to provide treatment.  He listens well, asks about previous experiences, explains his ratiol and appears to be transparent in his thought process.
-1	I trust her for the most part. Any distrust I have stems from the fact that shes human and can make mistakes just like the rest of us. 
-1	I am lucky to have a great Dr. In the past, I have not. She listens. She knows me. She also has chronic pain, so that helps in her understanding.
1	She listens and responds.  She is warm and friendly and seems very interested in what I have to say.  She explains things in ways that are easily understood without being condescending. She treats me like a person.  
1	They listen and are observant. They care.
-1	I distrust western medicine in general. I feel it is a business more than anything else these days. I also feel it is ignorant about the conscious ture of the universe.
1	My primary care physician is direct to the point, and makes sure you understand what is going on.
1	I completely trust my doctor to give me correct, accurate and complete information and not mislead me.  But I don't fully trust that my doctor knows which medical treatments are best for me.  I take the information they give me and I do my own research and I make my own decisions taking into consideration what my doctor has told me.  I am neutral that my doctor knows what's best for me.  
1	I trust my doctor because he is compassiote about helping others and takes the time to answer any question I might have. I've always received prompt service and have never had to wait too long to be seen on in an office visit. He also has been willing to work with me if my insurance has not covered the full price of a medicine I needed.
-1	I feel my doctor doesn't really listen to me or take my concerns into consideration. He glosses over everything and will focus on something that isn't a true problem. I also feel he likes to give me every test in the world even if it doesn't pertain to any of my complaints. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I feel he genuinely wants to help. Whenever I seek him, he would give me all sorts of reasoble suggestions to help improve my health, responds to email, etc.
1	I trust my doctor will always do whats in my best interests.  They have the expertise that I lack.  I trust that they have seen similar cases and can react accordingly.
-1	I believe doctors are mostly concerned with selling drugs to patients. Their main concern is treating symptoms, not the actual disease. Sometimes they spend just a few minutes with each patient, people get more attention at the mechanic .
1	"In the past, I did not trust doctors much due to some bad experiences with being brushed off and accused of ""looking for attention"".  I have since dealt with two very nice doctors, both of which were easy to deal with and took me seriously.  They talk to me and help me through issues, explaining everything as necessary.  "
-1	Every time I go to the doctor they seem to be in a bad mood. I don't quite know but their face is always that of a person when they are angry and do not want to be bothered. This leads me to not ask any questions about how I feel health-wise. I end up leaving without getting the input I need most of the time.
-1	The physician and doctors in general come across as rushed and that they have no desire or time to truly help.
-1	I've been going to my doctor for over 20 years.  He knows my history and persolity.  I can talk honestly with him and he'll have an engaging conversation.
-1	He seems sincerely interested in what is best for me.  He also sees others in my family and they feel the same way.  It is a feeling I have that he is trustworthy.  He has not given me any reason not to trust him.  I feel he is there to help.
-1	I do trust my doctor most of the time. But he only knows what the AMA has taught him. Medicine is centered around prescription medications and most, if not all, the time I believe there is a better tural solution. 
1	My doctor takes extra time to look for different altertives for me. She also always finds different ways to explain things to make sure I fully understand.
-1	It seems to me that more and more doctors are spread too thin in their practice having to see a maximum number of patients in as little time as possible, creating a less thorough exam or alysis of symptoms/ testing.
1	For the most part, I trust my primary care physician. I've seen doctor's before where they felt almost robotic in dealing with me. No emotion whatsoever and looked to have one foot out the door already. My current primary care physician is none of those things. It actually feels like he cares about my well being. He remembers things from my persol life in previous conversations and brings it up when I see him, like a human being. He takes the time to deal with me, which I like.
-1	I'm not a very trusting person in general which is why I answered as I did, but I trust my pcp as much as I trust as anyone. 
-1	In general, I would trust my doctor to recommend what he honestly believes is the best medical advice for me. However, I have done a fair amount of research and reading regarding certain health issues, and in general I don't trust the medical community to always have the best or most up-to-date information on some issues, particularly regarding nutrition and diet. 
1	I trust my doctor in that he has answered all my questions and has been right about everything I have asked, especially in regards to my own research about issues or topics I bring up to him.  The is a little distrust which is by my own doing in that I don't feel I can trust someone 100% without multiple opinions should something serious happen to my health.
-1	I spent time finding my primary care,  he's someone that is not overly difficult to talk to and has helped me with issues I previously was uncomfortable with other doctors.  He always gives me many options for medication with the materials to study them. 
1	I have been his patient for several years.  My entire family is a patient AND there have been instances where i have requested weight loss drugs and he has refused to prescribe to me as they had adverse effects.  I trust him and his judgement completely and really do believe that for him, patients come first.
-1	Too many doctors follow a set of rules and protocol. They are not open to altertive medicine and would sooner give you medicine than try and treat things turally. They have too much at stake with the pharmaceutical companies.  
-1	I never trust a doctor 100%. I JUST got a new doctor, and I was happy with him when I went to have a physical back in November.  I like his temperament, his openness to listen, he followed up when he promised that he would, his staff was friendly and so was he.  He looks at things from multiple views.
-1	I don't necessarily trust nor distrust the doctor.  I would assume I trust them more than distrust because she has been trained to be a doctor.
-1	It's not that I distrust my physician, it's that I distrust the medical establishment, to include govt intervention.  I trust that my physician is doing the best she can with the training provided by the medical establishment.  The reason I distrust the establishment is due to its record.   Food pyramid, dietary cholesterol, fats are bad, massive numbers of people on statins with no resulting drops in CVD related deaths.
1	My doctor seems very competent and knowledgeable. She makes sure to listen to my concerns before discussing treatments. If I have questions about the situation, she answers them thoroughly. She has many years of experience and seems to know what she is talking about.
-1	I trust my doctor with my health or else I wouldn't go to my physician. I am a person who once I find a trustworthy doctor, I will stay with them until I need to change physician or I am not able to.
-1	"I would never trust a doctor 100%.  Even if they're trying their best, they don't always know what's right.  If you have something rare wrong with you, it will usually take multiple doctors before you find one that gets it right.  Most doctors will treat you under the assumption that you have the ""most common thing"" wrong with you that has your particular set of symptoms."
1	My primary care physician is a human being. He sometimes has some mistake but I trust him
-1	I trust my doctors advice on care because I am a relatively healthy male with no preexisting conditions.  I only usually go see the doctor when I am really sick.
-1	I stay in the middle when it comes to trust.  I trust their opinion, but they are still motivated by self interests first.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been seeing him for over 15 years and every time I go there it is consistent.  I have no reason not to trust him.  I cannot speak for everybody else though, because I believe some doctors could be corrupt. 
-1	Doctors are sometimes just out to make money. They know people generally trust them blindly, and they are just giving an opinion, so they can tell you whatever they want. I don't think all doctors are like this, but some are and it's hard to know which ones are trustworthy. 
1	She never seems rushed with me, and she will always take the time to research an issue to make sure she's considered every possible solution. There was a time when I felt her treatment recommendation was too drastic, but she had no problem referring me to a specialist.
1	My doctor seems to genuinely care about her job. She seems worried and really listening when I am telling her my problems. Then I can tell she is thinking hard and trying to help me to a solution.
1	We are very direct with each other. He doesn't  beat around the bush and makes suggestions and recommendations. I make the decisions, with his input. He doesn't always agree, but hey, I pay him, he don't pay me. He is not my boss. 
1	I have had a good relationship with him in the past. I feel like he would tell me the truth about any potential diagnosis. He has given me reason to believe that he would not falsely lead me on with some diagnosis or other.
-1	i trust my doctor 
1	I trust my doctor because she feels that if I am able to get healthy without prescription drugs, that is the best route. That is respectable to me since most doctors just want to push pills.
-1	"I feel that a lot of Doctors "" Herd Sheep"" because we don't have enough Doctors out there."
-1	My physician is reserved.  I do not feel totally comfortable with him.  He is nice but not very talkative.  He is a general doctor, so I am not sure that he is up on everything that is specialized.
-1	In general, as doctors have years of training to understand medical knowledge and how to apply it, I trust their judgement.
-1	I have seen many relatives have horrible doctors who could really care less about their well being. It was like the only good they were was for the diagnosis. I have had a few like that as well. 
-1	"The doctor I was seeing was not good at discussing things of importance with me.  Apparently he had too many patients because he left to go be an ""Amway"" doc.  I lost faith in him when I was literally dying and too stupid to realize it one time.  My throat was infected and slowing closing off my air.  I called for an appt on a Monday knowing he was in the office to do paperwork.  Would he see me?  No, he wouldn't.  I didn't think he would because for some reason Monday's are sacred to him.  I saw a perfectly competent doctor who referred me to someone else, a specialist.  But I never saw my doctor and I've always resented that a bit.  I literally was very ill and he could have at least popped his head into the door.  I lost a lot of faith in him after that."
1	I have not trusted all physicians completely, but my current one has been a gem. He's been completely kind, compassiote, gives multiple options and educates me on what he's telling me (whether I ask for further explation or not) and spends time with me instead of rushing. When I had blood work done, he called me persolly to discuss my results even though they weren't all that remarkable and gave me further thoughts on how best to approach my health.
-1	I haven't been to a doctor in over a decade. In general I don't trust doctors. Many of them are so profit driven. I hope to never have to see a doctor again.
-1	The least that doctors can do is provide guidelines.
-1	I don't think I currently have a primary care physician, but I don't always necessarily trust doctors in general. My sister has had really bad luck with certain situations so that doesn't help. She's type 1 diabetic and was underweight for a while and the doctors were trying to claim my parents malnourished her when in reality she was just thin and sick from the diabetes. She has some other symptoms going on that they've been trying to find the cause of for years and still haven't. I do believe they're trying their best in this situation but they're definitely not perfect.
1	I trust my PCP because she takes her time when evaluating my symptoms or concerns and doesn't try to rush through the evaluation as fast as she can.  She also reminds me of routine tests that I forget to schedule.
1	I trust my physician because they always give me the best treatment options. I can always trust my primary care physician to select the right treatment for me. More importantly, I can trust my physician not to do the wrong things.
-1	I trust my primary care physician in general because I am intelligent enough to be able to tell if what they are saying makes sense. I always choose doctors carefully after much research and review and persol recommendations.
1	Because he answers all the questions that I ask, and gives me other altertives if needed.
1	Most of my experiences with doctors have been positive ones.  The exceptions are with two doctors I saw (one time each), who were employed by hotels I work at.  These positions are given to the lowest bidders, and both doctors were somewhat hostile and incompetent.
1	I trust my doctor because he cares about my diet. He also encourages me to exercise regularly. He is less likely to prescribe me medicines that I don't need.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is knowledgeable in his field. While I try to gain understanding through probing, I ultimately defer to his knowledge in coming to certain conclusions. Past experience has taught me that he is usually right, so that's another reason I generally trust him.
-1	I neither trust or distrust doctors. They seem to be in between when it seems like the really care about their patients or not. I don't see them too often, so I don't know alot about them.
1	I see my physician as someone who truly believes in his work and entered this profession due to a strong desire to help people.  He has never failed to help me when I have gone to him with a problem and I have been completely satisfied with the results I have gotten.
1	My doctor has been a good doctor and I believe he does his job well.
1	I trust my doctor because i've been going to him for years and years,  and after every checkup and everytime i've went to his office i've just got a good wholesome feeling from their practice. I just get the sense that he just wants what is best for me and my family.
1	My PCP has stood by me through 2 years of complicated medical issues collaborating with a team of doctors to ensure continued progress and diagnosis. He discusses all factors pros and cons with me and takes the time to ensure all factors are discussed. Time is one of the keys.
-1	My primary care physician has asked me to spell and remind her of the me of my rare condition each of the last four times I have seen her. She has often forgotten or ignored problems I was having. She seems overbooked and scattered. 
1	The doctor I see most often is actually not my primary care doctor. I trust him because he listens to me. I feel like he understands what I'm saying. We make decisions together. It's not like he's telling me what I have to do. So I guess I feel like we collaborate. I'm the one who knows about me, and he's the one who knows about treatments. 
1	I have had a wonderful primary Dr. the last 5 yrs. He looks me in the eyes when I talk and it makes me feel that he is truly hearing me. He asks my opinion on treatment when it's an option. 
-1	I distrust my primary physician because when it comes to giving out medicine these doctors don't know exactly what is in it. So I feel like I should research the stuff my doctor said when I get home and then make a decision myself and talk to my doctor about it.
-1	I have used the same doctor for years.  He has always made sure I understand his recommendations/decisions.  I have never had an issue with his performance.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has always treated me like a valued individual and explained things to me thoroughly. She is persoble and friendly but also knowledgeable and a fast talker. I really love my doctor.
1	I trust only as far as one can trust. Certainly I would not go to a doctor if I read poor reviews about him. I dont believe in intuition however if I get a very bad feel for a doctor based on how he approaches my questions or converses with me then I will find another. The only way to really trust is to have it built over time and that is the best I can do. Its never good to trust anyone 100% but you can establish a good level of trust based on past experience
1	My primary care physician demonstrates a willingness to listen to my physical and emotiol complaints and can empathize with me.  She demonstrates a level of caring for her patients that I have not seen often in a clinical environment.  She even remembers who I am and what I am dealing with without having to consult my records.
-1	"I had an experience with a doctor where he over prescribed pain medication.  I wrote an essay as a witness statement which was used in the case against the doctor by the India Attorney General.  When I was 16, I was hurting so bad and didn't know what to do so my parents took me to a pain magement clinic which would be described as a ""pill mill"".  I don't blame my parents at all.  The first thing I signed was a waiver for them to prescribe me opiates.  The first time he prescribed tramadol, ambien, vicodine, and a muscle relaxant.  He told me it would only be one month and then he would get me off all medication.  Months went by being told the same thing.  It took me 3 years to get off the medication.  I was a zombie.  Now all I need is medicil canbis, and no pills.  I feel better than ever.  This is why I don't trust any doctor and I don't  think I ever will."
-1	My PCP is always trying to push a medication that I don't necessarily need and always jumps to prescribing meds instead of looking for other solutions to a medical problem.  At times they also forget to physically examine me, just simply prescribing a medication.  There are drug information pamphlets all over the office and this puts doubt as to whether my PCP has a conflict of interest or not. 
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part, but at times I feel he rushes to get to the next patient. When I feel he is rushing, I usually wonder how thorough he has been in my case.
-1	I go to a nurse practitioner at a clinic.  I'm fairly happy with her but not completely.  I don't think they're that thorough and they've made a couple of mistakes in a fairly short time.  I'm considering changing to somewhere else.
-1	My Doctor is very young and seems to always be in a massive hurry. I just don't feel like he has enough life experience yet to really be able to diagnose to his full potential.
-1	It feels sometimes like they are extremely overbooked, and maybe get kickbacks from the insurance company for making certain recommendations. It's hard to trust doctors.
-1	In general, doctors aren't perfect, they all make mistakes or misinterpret something on occasion.  In regards to treatments, they may have motivations other than your health, like earning more income or arrangement with a pharmaceutical company to promote a certain product.
1	In the past, my doctor has been very receptive to my needs as a patient. He has taken the time to explain to me anything I did not understand.
1	I trust him because I can tell he cares and is thorough and not dismissive of me. I have previously seen doctors who I do not trust, and who dismiss my symptoms or concerns, so I know what the other end of the spectrum feels like. 
1	I trust my doctor completely to give me the best available options.  Having this doctor for many years has built a relationship of trust in him.  I would follow any of his orders without question.
1	When someone goes to a Dr, it's a serious step.  They need to trust what the Dr has to say.  It's ok to ask questions and do independent research.  A Dr should be looked at as part of the team that helps to take care of you.  Ultimately, it resides within each of us to take persol responsibility.
-1	I feel like people have flaws just like physicians do. Your doctor is not good at everything therefore could be wrong about things. It is always good to get another opinion
-1	My Primary care physician is actually pretty decent. She knows what she is talking about most of the time and is honest when she doesn't. That being said, she has been wrong about a few things, and is not as turally or holistically minded as I would like
-1	Having worked in the medical field for many years I can conclude that sometimes doctors push a certain treatment that may not be the best possible choice for the patient. I understand doctors work directly with pharmaceutical companies whose interest is making money.  
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because he is extremely thorough. During appointments with him, he often exceeds the general '15-30min' exam time, but just because he's so informative. For example, the at my last appointment with him when we were discussing medication options, he was actually showing me published articles from the New England Jourl of Medicine so I can see the data for myself and be more informed in my decision. Obviously he's far more well versed in these things than I am, but he doesn't just assume that these things are 'beyond my comprehension'. He can explain things in a thorough yet not unnecessarily complicated way so I don't feel forced to just take whatever advice he gives me.
-1	While I do trust my doctor in general, I think it's always a good idea to do your own research and educate yourself as well before coming to any fil decisions about anything. 
1	"I trust my doctor to make the right decisions for my persol health.  I have never felt that I was ""putting out"" my doctor by my needs or questions. "
1	She is a very caring doctor and has always been very persoble.  She takes time to talk to me, address any concerns or issues.  She is very thorough and attentive and I feel this is what makes her a great doctor, she likes people and helping.
1	I have known my Doctor for many years and I trust him.
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for many years, so I feel that he knows my background and my problems very well. I always feel I can ask questions if I don't understand something. I also find he is very willing to listen to my feelings about taking a medication and he seems to give them some weight in his decisions.
-1	I trust a doctor because they wouldnt have gotten here if they did not do well in medical school. 
-1	I always find that my primary care physician is too busy to give me the time I need. I have gone to appointments countless times and left feeling like I really didn't solve my issues. Sometimes, I even feel that they get annoyed if i ask too many questions and keep them in the room for too long.
-1	I trust that he means well, but I don't trust his ability to see things clearly.  And in general, I think most doctors have too many patients and not enough time to focus on them long enough to really see what might be apparent early, until it's so obvious and too late.
-1	My primary care physician doesn't really seem interested in me as a person.
-1	I believe that my doctor is competent, but I sometimes feel like he doesn't take me seriously. I have never been harmed by a doctor, but I feel as though a doctor's convenience is more important to them than my preferences. Overall, I would like to be treated with more respect and dignity.
-1	I trust my doctors advice. He would not take the chance of harming. I take his advice and do as he saya.
-1	"I have a hard time completely trusting him because sometimes it seems like he just doesn't really care. It seems like he's too willing to write off problems that I'm concerned about as ""probably nothing"". This has happened before with health issues that I ended up seeing other doctors/specialists for (even though he was very reluctant to refer me as he didn't think the issues were real/serious), only to have those specialists confirm that an actual treatable problem existed. He also misdiagnosed me once by saying I probably had bipolar disorder and sending me to a psychiatrist without doing any sort of physical exam or lab testing. I spent two years heavily medicated and miserable before a different doctor realized that the root of my problem was physical/hormol and started to treat me for it. And then all my mental symptoms went away. But he's one of the few doctors in my area who take my insurance, so I don't really have the option to have a different primary doctor. And he does know more than I do, obviously, since he went to medical school. It just seems like he's stretched way too thin and misses a lot of stuff."
1	I am not currently in the care of a particular doctor, but all of my experiences, save one horrid anesthesiologist, have been excellent, which certainly says something because, as I said I have had a good handful of this and that over the years.  
1	She listens well and I never seem rushed.  She is willing to answer questions and look up information if I ask something specific.  She is persoble and warm.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician. I trust doctors because they paid thousands and thousands of dollars to go to school and learn things about medicine that I don't know.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is the  one with the knowledge and experience when it comes to medical issues.
1	I think doctors tend to want what is best for their patients. If I ask enough questions and understand things correctly then I can get a sense of the diagnosis. 
-1	Most of the time I do trust them.  I do think sometimes they are running on autopilot.
-1	I think it is more that I do not trust the time put into me as a patient than that I do not trust my physician.  I worry that my doctor has a busy schedule and because she works for a big company she is required to keep her time with me short.  I do not believe that it is possible to come to correct, well-thought conclusions when you only have 15 to gather information, process it, and explain to the patient.
1	I trust my physician because she has known my family for a long time and I know she would never do anything to double cross us. She is very knowledgable and is always very in depth with her examition of me, which shows that she cares. She speaks to me like a person and makes me feel comfortable, instead of trying to just prove how smart she is like some doctors do.
1	He prescribed medicine that he believed to be helpful, and made sure that I get enough information to use it properly. My doctor cared enough about my condition such that simple follow-up sessions were free. He likes to listen when I ask questions, and makes sure to explain them properly. 
-1	Have been seeing the same doctor for longer than I can remember....knows my entire family
1	My old doctor is retiring and the last few times I have had the doctor that will replace her when she retires. He is young but seems competent. I haven't really seen him so often as to really build any kind of relationship with him yet. 
1	My doctor is good because he is older and experienced. He is not overly persoble or chatty, so I don't feel a closeness with him. That is okay to me, as long as he is doing a thorough job. I know he has a lot of patients, so I never feel like I am getting extremely persolized attention, but he is a pro.
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for ten years and, while I haven't always taken his recommendations, I always know why he offers them. I have implicit trust in his judgement and he never fails to take my concerns into account. 
-1	I like my primary care doctor but I don't really see him enough to have perfect trust in him. I see him for maybe 15 minutes once or twice a year. 
-1	I trust my doctor. He's certainly smarter than me and I let him know what's going on. I feel like because I'm open and honest with him he's that way with me.
-1	I mainly trust doctors, but I don't doubt that some of them aren't completely honest. At the end of the day, they are getting a paycheck from sick people.
-1	I trust my doctor very much, I am just also the type of person who likes to do my own research before proceeding with any treatment plans. 
1	i trust my doctor because she has always listened and been very helpful when i needed to discuss something. i needed to get my first mammogram last year and had been putting it off. when i saw my doctor she really encouraged me to go and get it done. she wasn't mean or stern. she was very concerned for my well being and wanted me to get the mammogram done to benefit my health. 
-1	I think doctors tend to rush and don't really go in depth to things to give you all the options. Typically they just give me whatever the most popular treatment is without listing options
1	I have always followed her advice and listened to what she prescribes for me, and I never have an issue. She is smart and very observant. She cares about how she takes care of her patients and she also cares how my other doctors (specialists) are taking care of me.
-1	I sometimes trust doctors about certain things, but overall I'm a bit suspicious of healthcare providers in general. I've got friends and family who work in the healthcare industry and they talk about all sorts of shady, crappy things that go on. In addition to the fraud I hear about in the news, and my own negative experiences with doctors, it's difficult for me to take everything they say at face value.
-1	We have recently moved so I've had to find a new primary care physician and I am having a hard time trusting him.  I have been on several of the same medications for years and years, but a couple of them he is not comfortable with, so he is wanting to change them around even though I have been the most stable on these ones for the longest period of time.  I feel like he doesn't trust what I'm saying, and it doesn't make me feel good.
1	I trust my primary care doctor mostly.  I say this because I have a hard time trusting any doctors all of the way.  I have seen many doctors and have had some pretty bad experiences (one telling me that it was all anxiety and then I filly found another doctor who believed me that something was wrong and found the right blood tests to run).  I think I trust them to some extent, but I also rely on what my gut is telling me.
-1	i live in a very small town i broke my wrist and was told it was healed after 3 months wearing a cast it was still broken no one here could properly identify the fracture i drove 3 hours to a specialist did an xray and said so yea your wrist is broken and now it's detioriated since its been so long (i walked around with a broken wrist 5 more months before going to a specialist it was hell) so yea i have no faith in medical professiols especially ones in my small secluded town
-1	I mostly trust my doctor to give me the right advice and do what is best for me rather than just what is more convenient for him. 
-1	I don't know. I just trust my doctor. I guess she hasn't given me a reason not to trust her.
1	I believe in giving my doctor all the information so as to get the best treatment options.  I trust that my doctor has my best interest at heart and feel she would not purposfully give me bad advice.
-1	My doctor and most doctors in general persistently push prescription drugs for every ailment. Any attempt at altertive care is, for the most part, overlooked or brushed off when mentioned. 
1	My doctor is very knowledgeable. On my first visit I kind of tested him by asking a few difficult questions. His answers were beyond my expectations. I have no reservations about trusting him to make wise decisions.
1	My physician is always very transparent with me. She always asks if I have any questions, and she always answers them so that I understand. She never seems in a hurry, and she is always very friendly.
1	I haven't yet run into a doctor that wasn't looking out for my benefit or gave me bad advice. I've heard stories of bad doctors out there who look out for their benefit first, but I've thankfully never ran into one of those doctors myself. Heck, I had surgery a few years back that saved one of my testicles from dying. I think I had something called testicular torsion. Doctor saw what the problem was and gave me the right advice to getting it fixed.
-1	I trust my PCP because she seems intelligent and seems to care about her patients. But I don't completely trust her since she is human and is very busy. She doesn't have time to be extremely thorough and careful.
-1	I like my primary care physician, but I have a certain amount of distrust in doctor's generally and don't trust medications at all. I always prefer to try a drug free option first, and doctor's often aren't on board with that point of view. 
-1	my doctor misdiagnosed my low sodium  
-1	I think most of them try what's best for a patient. They might not be right, but their heart's in it. I think they make mistakes, but as long as they're not too stubborn to change what they're doing.
1	I've had the same doctor for most of my adult life. Any issues I've brought up he treated or ran tests to find out what was going on. He's always taken action on anything I brought up and is great at communicating and returning phone calls. I wouldn't extend blanket trust to all doctors just because they are doctors but i would give them the benefit of the doubt
-1	The primary care doctor can't possibly know everything there is to know and keep up with all of the current research. I am also concerned about the conflict of interest between doctors and drug companies. My friend who is a nurse told me she's attended several pharmaceutical company dinners. And the FDA has approved medicines that were upproved years later for being dangerous.
-1	I see an endocrinologist every 3 months. I trust him. He is young and seems to be very knowledgeable in my particular health issue. He is not afraid to try new medications to help me and talks in plain English rather than using unfamiliar medical terminology when talking to me. I trust him and he seems to take more time than most at each appt.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have only had good experiences with them and they always seem to have my best interest in mind. The times that I have had to be given medicine they seem to do a great job of telling me all of the options possible to me and talk with me about the pros and cons of each one. They also seem to be aware of small details that show they have an interest in me. 
-1	My doctor is often in a hurry because he has many patients to see. I always trust he uses his best judgement. I think he makes honest decisions.
-1	I have been one of the healthiest people ever, it seems; thus, I do not go to the doctor often. Since I don't need to go to the doctor all that often, it's hard to answer these questions. I do go for check-ups, but haven't gone every single year. I'm now 64 and am trying to go every year or two. But just going to the doctor for something so routine is not quite enough to thoroughly judge a physician's abilities.
-1	Sometimes I feel like he does not listen or believe I have certain symptoms and instead takes the easier diagnosis. 
-1	I have been pushed around and lied to in the past by doctors. Doctors do not spend enough time getting to know you or your situation before making a diagnosis and are often wrong. Doctors in general are greedy and care more about money than helping people. 
-1	I trust him enough I suppose. He's my oncologist I still see once a year. He's a nice guy and everything but he's always busy so when I go there I do all the tests first (CT scan, blood work, etc.) Then he gets all the information before I see him and if no cancer or nothing new that's pretty much it. Usually only see him for 5 minutes or so. But all in all I'm happy with him, I still go there so he must be ok.
1	we have had a long relationship and I have never had any issues with and concerns that have come up with my health that was not resolved.
-1	I have taken pre-med courses and have a friend who is a doctor.  Sometimes I think that's why I'm not as blindly confident when it comes to healthcare in general.  Doctor's make mistakes.  It is up to me ultimately to make the decisions about my own healthcare, given a doctor's guidance.
1	I trust my doctor.  He is always very open about all my options and is willing to help me.  He always treats me like family and sometimes even calls to check up on me.  I believe he really does have my best interest at heart. 
-1	I do feel that they are usually trained to give certain responses. I wish that doctors would take a more holistic approach and give nutritiol support options along with conventiol medicine, and give the patient the option to choose both. 
1	My primary dr has been my dr for 25 years,  I trust her, I think she is great.  he never hesitates to help me
-1	I saw the results of his work and I know I can trust him in terms of whats best for my health. Not sure about what he is charging me for it...
-1	I trust doctors, if not to know what's best for me all the time, at least to have a much better shot at it than I do. But I don't necessarily trust them to have the same priorities I do. That doesn't even necessarily mean that I don't trust them to put my health as the top priority - sometimes that's not MY top priority. I'm still kind of ticked off at a doctor who ordered $1000 worth of blood tests for PCOS, which it turned out I don't even have and which was nowhere close to his specialty (he was a psychiatrist!). Yes, there was a small chance I had PCOS. Yes, if I had had it, there would have been a small chance of heart problems (all the other symptoms were things I considered either no big deal like hair, or actually beneficial, like amenorrhea and infertility). But good God, $1000! Insurance wouldn't even cover it! I could NOT convince that man that I was poor. So I no longer trust him to make decisions for me, because we don't see eye-to-eye about what's important.
1	I trust my physician because she is very caring, knowledgeable, and understanding. She works with what my medical plan covers and anything I pay out of pocket which takes a lot of stress off my mind. I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off and I'm getting the services required.
-1	I trust doctors to some extent to in most cases try to help. However I do feel they sometimes think of themselves or money they make from kickbacks 
-1	I have been given a new doctor recently who've only been to once.  Therefore, It is difficult to judge how much I can trust them.  The majority of the time spent is sitting with a nurse.
-1	Sometimes I feel my appointments with my primary care doctor are rushed. There have also been times when my doctor wasn't very informative on treatment options when I have been sick. Because of this I feel I have to do a lot of independent research when I am sick or am given a diagnosis. 
-1	Although I don't have a certain doctor that I go to, I trust most doctors in general. Of course, there are bad ones that don't do everything that they are supposed to, or that don't do their job as they are supposed to, but I do trust most doctors in general to do their jobs properly.
-1	For the most part, I trust my doctor and her looking out for my best interests. I tend to not fully trust anyone and always think there's a possibility for alterior motives, but for the most part, I trust my doctor's advice.
-1	I feel like doctors  have to ear n your trust.  My doctor has not done that as of yet.  Sometimes he speaks to me in a very condescending manner and I just don't like that.  I also feel like he doesn't ask me alot of questions, and just gives me a diagnosis without getting to the meat and potatoes.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I truly believe she has my best interests at heart. We spent a long time my last visit just taking through all my options and making sure I truly understood what was going on. 
1	I see a DO rather than an MD. I really like how current he is on  new issues in medicine. He also is knowledgeable on the body and prefers to prescribe stretches, and lifestyle changes than medication. I like that he is very thorough and really cares for our family.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is clearly very knowledgeable, and also comes across as confident and direct, which I find reassuring. She is very no-nonsense, which I really appreciate. She is thorough when it comes to tests and exams and I have no reason to believe she has ever misled me with regards to treatment options or anything else.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician. Regarding doctors in general, I don't trust them because a lot of them don't seem to care about you as a person, they only look at you as an insurance claim or a cash cow they can keep milking by adding on more tests or prescribing drugs just to get the most money they can from your insurance company or medicaid/medicare.
-1	I trust my physicians because he is generally very thorough in our exchanges. He takes the  time to listen to my concerns and will provide me valid answers and options for my treatments.
1	I've been going to my primary care physician since I was a teeger. I've had some medical issues that he's helped me to resolve over the years. He's had his practice for a long time and has never given me a reason to not trust him or his staff.
-1	My experience with doctors has always been that they tend to treat or guess rather than actually putting thought into the process of healthcare. 
1	I trust my physician or doctor because I feel safe with them. 
1	I've seen him several times and he is always candid and straightforward with his opinion, reasons and concerns. I've never had a reason to second guess anything he has told me.
-1	I like to get a second, third, and sometimes fourth opinion on things. My primary care doctor isn't God and I don't entrust my health to her. Her services are valuable, however.
-1	I have had more than one doctor.  The last one I have I get more information, but am not sure about advice.
-1	I trust my doctor most of the time. Sometimes I wish she would show a little more compassion but she is a very busy doctor so I overlook it. There are times I wish she would consider different treatments or at least give a referral. All together I do trust her opinion and judgement. 
1	I feel a general trust in doctors because hopefully they are doing their job to help people. 
-1	They have years of school and  experence  
-1	For the most part I think my doctors have been thorough and did what was best for me.  I think that many times they are over scheduled and are not able to spend enough time with each patient but I think they do what they can.
1	I've been coming to my doctor for a very long time. Over that time, there has been a lot of trust built and that's hard to come by. She always seems to be concerned about the stability of my health.
-1	My doctor has never or has rarely asked me nor my family about exercise or diet. I know for a fact that these two things are among the greatest things you can do to prevent, reverse, or cure disease. Our doctor only puts my family on drugs and wants them to have expensive surgery.
1	I can't say that I fully trust my doctors. After all, they are getting paid for what they do. I do believe if it came down to the cost of treatments they would choose they one with the highest cost for me.
1	I trust my doctor because she always makes a point to bond with me and explain her reasoning. I've also been going to the same doctor for four years now and they are completely involved in my family. 
-1	"He is generally there to ""process"" people and get his numbers. If I ask for a prescription for a given issue, he is very willing to write it and move on. Has has some misdiagnoses."
1	I trust my doctor because they are honest. If I didn't trust them I would get a doctor I do trust.  Trust in your doctor is very importan . 
1	I simply trust them because I know that they are a professiol. Usually the person I go to has been in the area for years and is well known by the community. So I assume if they had a history of doing the wrong thing then people would have said something about it. 
1	My husband and I share the same Doctor and there was a time my husband had an appointment and I did not and I went with him. I had a cold at the time and even though it was not my appointment and I didn't bring it upâ the Doctor noticed and asked me questions. Right then and there he wrote a prescription for me even though I didn't have an appointment for myself. He has always gone above and beyond in the care of my husband as well (who has Type II diabetes) and has always been there for us when we had questions and needs. I would recommend him to anyone.
1	I trust my doctor because she explains things thoroughly to me.  We have a good relationship for 15 years.  When I have something that others feel is trivial she listens to me and we discussed.  
1	My doctor has always taken the time to listen to my concerns and follow up with appropriate treatments/testing.  This has not always been the case so I can definitely see the difference in what a good doctor and bad doctor are.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has never done any harm to me and always has my best interest at heart. I have to trust that he knows what he is doing as I obviously don't have the training that he does. The only thing that does bother me about my doctor is that he is sometimes too busy for his own good and maybe doesn't take as much time as what he should with patients. I think that his office sometimes schedules too many patients in one day and that is what causes this mind set for me. 
-1	They are in it for the money, prescribing medications instead of recommending more tural vitamins, minerals, foods for diseases. 
-1	I have limited experience with my current primary care doctor but she seems to be pretty thorough and honest.
-1	It isn't so much that i distrust my Dr. the individual, but rather i distrust the system. The system seems to have been bogged down and become nothing but a business. I was diagnosed with diabetes and a couple of other conditions three years ago and my Dr's wasn't willing to discuss much with me other than wanting to throw pills at me. I refused the pills and wanted to talk about diet, exercise, carb intake, etc.  The Dr. said she couldn't discuss this and referred me to a nutritionist that wanted $1200 up front. A Dr. should know (and probably does) the very basic starting points for diabetes care.  So, this is one big reason why i don't trust the system too much. It seems there is no persol or individual care given; just a Dr. reading from a playsheet on which pill to give for which condition. She spent zero time educating me about diabetes other than a useless pamphlet. Everything i learned i did on my own. So, in summary, i don't have too much faith in the medical profession at times because they seem more geared towards business, profit and blanket treatments then taking the individual case and doing what's best for THEM. 
-1	I trust doctors in general because most of them are probably good people. I believe they chose to be doctors to take of and help people. However, there are still unethical and potentially dangerous doctors out there. So, I think it is always important to trust your gut when you get the feeling that something isn't right and seek out a second opinion.
-1	My doctor does not always tell me all options available. Sometimes this is due to his time constraints. In general I trust him and his opinions.
1	I trust my doctor because she has been my primary care physician for many years. She has never steered me wrong. I have confidence in her abilities because even though she has been with me for many years, she has been a doctor many years before that. She is very knowledgeable and she is very kind. We know each other well and I trust her completely. I feel very comfortable with her. 
1	i think my doctor is competent. i've been using his service for a long time
1	I trust my doctor because he has training and experience. I will question him if I have doubts, and do some of my own research, but I think my doctor is my best resource. 
1	I've had the same doctor for a very long time and she's always put in the time to see me and help me feel better no matter what's wrong.
-1	I have had things happen in the past-(wrong doses prescribed, not listening to serious concerns and misdiagnosis that cost me a lot of heartaches and physical consequences- as a result I am very apprehensive in trusting fully what any doctor tells me. I question everything a doctor tells me and I research my issues. 
-1	I trust the information provided by my doctor. She is very thorough and ensures I do not leave with questions. I sometimes wonder if she doesn't provide me with all the information regarding my health if she deems it irrelevant. I do find myself frustrated with waiting as that does make me seem as it's more to accommodate the doctor vs. the patient. 
-1	i do not know her very well yet
-1	I trust her.  I just want to look over anything she prescribes to me
-1	She just appears very genuine. I don't get the slightest hint of anything off about her. I've been seeing her for a few years now, and on more than one occasion, even when she's clearly running behind schedule, she shows no rush to be through with me. She feels like an ally.
-1	My primary care physician does a good job of looking at all the possible treatment options, and talking with me in detail about which option would work best for me.  I think it would be great if they incorporated a more holistic approach to my care and not just looking at the medication treatments.  
-1	I think it varies from doctor to doctor. I had one doctor whom was vary vague with me. While I liked her and trusted her, she really didn't give me any additiol info when I was diagnosed with a heart murmur. She knew I was a smoker but didn't suggest any lifestyle changes. My second doctor told me that smoking would make it worse and I should have quit a long time ago. So it's really hard to trust doctors when one will say something and another won't mention other important information that you might want to be aware of.
-1	My primary care physician has been with me for a long time and understands my health best. He seems to genuinely care about his patients which makes it easy to give my trust. 
1	I trust them because I've known them a while and they listen to me.
-1	"i just started seeing my new primary care this year. i have a reasoble amount of trust in her, though i believe most doctors are very traditiol in their methods and i like to know about ""outside the box"" treatments, such as holistic methods. i like to do my own research on the issues i face and often times doctors don't want to hear what ""dr. google"" has to say."
-1	My doctor tends to rush my appointments. She is in and out in less than five minutes, and doesn't really seem to read any of the paperwork I fill out or really take much interest in the concerns I bring to the appointment. Last time, for example, I brought in concerns about my back pain, but she seemed more concerned about my borderline high blood pressue and gave my a referral to a cardiologist.   
-1	"I definitely trust doctors, but ""completely"" is an awfully strong word. Doctors have hundreds of different patients, so don't always have the time to get to know me and my conditions as well as is necessary. While I trust their medical knowledge generally, I am ultimately in charge of my own health. "
-1	I have been with my doctor for a number of years, and he has always been able to take care of my problems. I think I could better answer this question in regards to why I don't trust him. Sometimes, I read and learn about treatment options, but when I discuss them with the doctor, he generally doesn't give them any merit- I am not talking about radical treatment options which have no backing in the scientific community. However, as I think about this now, I realize that he ought to have my full trust, as he is lettered in medicine and has never done wrong by me. I am virtually experimenting when I offer my input for treatment options. I don't have as much certainty as he does- I could say that I am just trying to see if I could find a solution on my own, sort of like a test of my ego.
-1	 they see a lot more people today and do not develop the rapport they once had
-1	I am very open with my physician so I tend to trust him with most decisions, but it's my body and I want to have the fil say. I believe that all people are inherently selfish, and so I am scared that if I let my guard down, people will take advantage of me. I'm not a trusting person, so even if I agree with my doctor on a major issue, like surgery, I would still want to go to another doctor and get a second opinion, because my health is very important to me. 
-1	DOCTORS THESE DAYS ARE OFTEN NOT SUFFICIENTLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THEY TREAT. THEY DO NOT LISTEN OR HAVE AN INTEREST IN LISTENING TO PATIENTS. THEY HAVE 15 MINUTES TO SEE YOU. LESS IF THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. IF YOU TRY TO ASK A QUESTION THEY ARE IMPATIENT AND TELL YOU THEY DO NOT HAVE TIME. THEY HAVE A SUPERIOR AND JUDGEMENTAL ATTITUDE. THEY ARE OFTEN FLAT OUT RUDE. THEY ALSO BILL FOR THINGS THEY HAVE NOT DONE AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT REASOBLE.
-1	I have faith in my doctor and trust her very much. Sometimes I feel that she is a little rushed but all in all she is honest with me and talks with me making me feel at ease.
1	I HAVE CHANGED DOCTORS RECENTLY. HOWEVER, THE PAST FEW MONTHS FOLLOWING HER ADVICE, I HAVE LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE AND FELT BETTER. ALSO, MY HUSBAND HAS LOST WEIGHT AND HIS DIABETES IS IMPROVING. SO FAR, I THINK I HAVE RECEIVED GOOD ADVICE.
-1	Although I do trust her, there are times that she is so busy, that she barely has time for me. I don't ask questions or tell everything either.
1	My doctor is open and listens to all of my questions and answers them in ways I understand
1	I trust my doctor because she tells me things I don't want to hear. She will also tell me altertive methods to getting better and not just shoving pills down my throat.
-1	I have a general mistrust with doctors in general. I always hear of many problems and mistakes that doctors make and it make me suspicious when they tell me something. I have yet to experience this but hearing other people's story makes me feel like you can never be too careful. I like to get different opinions to make sure what he is telling me is correct.
1	I trust my physician because she gives me all my options and tells me the pros and cons before we do anything.  She is available when I need her for anything and always makes room for me.
1	I do trust my Doctor, I do not think he has ill intentions, and I believe he wishes to provide me with the best care possible.
-1	Doctors don't always give the best advice and many times make the wrong diagnosis. People can fix issues on their own, such as reversing heart disease and such through diet but doctors refuse to accept that despite it being proven countless times. So for reasons such as that, I don't trust doctors in general to do what is best for someone. 
-1	I don't currently have a primary care physician at the moment, though I have had a few over the years. I've generally had good experiences, but I also take modern medicine on the whole with a grain of salt. The doctors themselves I trust and believe to be good people doing what they feel is in my best interest. But I think the profession on a whole is quicker to treat symptoms than address causes, and put figurative band-aids on things by prescribing pharmaceuticals to address most things. I've persolly solved some of my own medical issues through my own research and by simply applying that knowledge to take better care of myself through nutrition and exercise. I don't think those basic things are offered up and encouraged often enough - but that may be just as much a reflection on our quick-fix society itself who wants a fast and easy way out of a problem rather than putting work in themselves. So in that case doctors are often doing what their customers want.
-1	"I am, in fact, in the middle of changing primary care doctors due to a lack of trust and proper ""fit"" persolity wise. She was too authoritarian and didn't listen, brushing off many of my concerns. In general, I find most doctors to be caring, thoughtful individuals, though often very busy. I trust them until they give me a reason for pause, or concern."
1	Me and my wife have the same doctor now for 15 years.She is a wonderful caring and nice person.We trust her with everything.
-1	I guess I trust him because of familiarity. At first I didn't trust him 100% but after 15 visits or so I've come to rely on his advice since I've seen my health (asthma specifically) has gotten better. Although he's as stoic now as he was on my first visit. Hard man to read. 
-1	While I sometimes feel like I'm another patient being flown through the door, and husled along. My doctor usually is very thorough and will sit and discuss anything that I need to talk about.
-1	because he is our family doctor... i know him from a very long time... i know his capacity as a doctor... he is very kind and highly knowledgeable... so i completely trust him...
-1	In general I trust doctors and the science that backs their field. That being said they are human, and for any serious diagnosis I would want an independent second opinion.
-1	I have a medical condition that has been ongoing for years. The last time I went to visit the doctor, I asked her about what procedures I should do for that issue. She said to me that she hadn't seen that in my chart, went and checked, and seemed surprised that I had that condition. I have been seeing her the whole time. Then when she gave me instructions about procedures and what I should do next, she also gave me the last set of test results from the past year, and there was some disturbing results that should have been followed up on at the time. Needless to say, we followed up on them then but it could have been catastrophic for me if the results turned negative, which thankfully they didn't.
-1	I have lost over 90% of my sense of smell due to a deviated septum I was born with and has gotten continually worse. It has changed how my voice sounds, makes it difficult to breathe through my nose at times, gives me sinus headaches and makes it hard to chew. After get a cat scan I was told by my doctor it was nothing more than allergies and prescribed flowze. Lost all my trust only adding to the multiple reoccurrences of bad doctor stories I've had.
-1	I mostly trust my primary provider. I feel that she has my best interests in mind and provides good care. However, I wouldn't fully trust any single human with serious health decisions. I have a need to research things myself, and even though I know my doctor is a good one, she's human, and we all make mistakes. 
-1	My doctor is generally in a rush.  I only see him once a year for a check up so I guess that's good but then I have a year's worth of questions to ask.  I usually get one in and then he's off to the next patient.  He was effective at treating a friend of mine so I guess I should trust him on that basis but there's just not enough time.  
1	He seems to know his stuff and has never disappointed me in the past. His attitude shows that he cares and really takes care of me.
-1	Doctors these days hardly spend any time dealing with you. They tend to rush in and out without taking much time to offer up explations or reasons for what they are doing. It seems that most often it is left up the the nurses or the PA to answer your questions because the doctor has to be doing other things. I also feel like they don't want to give you altertives or other possible options in fear of being sued.
-1	While doctors are educated in their field, they are still human and are capable of making mistakes. Some of them are more interested in their wallet than in you. Some of them have varying degrees of experience. Some of them are just better at specific conditions and not so good at others. Doctors are still just people and suffer the faults of people.
-1	My doctor is set in her old ways. She insists putting me on blood pressure medicine with a diuretic is excellent, but in reality it made me sick,lethargic,dehydrated, and I fainted constantly. In fact, it made my blood pressure too low. Now once again my doctor wants to put me back on the diuretic. She doesn't care what it did to me the last time. I tried to explain to her how it made me feel the last time but she doesn't seem to listen. Also, I have hypothyroidism. It took them 4 years before they took me off synthetic thyroid and put me on NDT thyroid. I had to put my foot down to filly get her to switch me. I'm doing a lot better now I'm on NDT thyroid.
1	I HAVE HAD A LONG EXPERIENCE WITH MY CURRENT DOCTOR, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A GOOD RAPPORT. WE SPEAK EASILY, FRANKLY, AND OPENLY. I FEEL THAT I CAN TRUST HIM GIVEN OUR HISTORY AND HIS NON-JUDGMNENTAL ATTITUDE AND FRIENDLY TURE. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY REASON TO NOT TRUST HIM, AND FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH ALL OF HIS REASONS FOR DOING THINGS, HIS EXPLATIONS OF THINGS, AND CONDUCT IN GENERAL. HE NEVER PRETENDS TO KNOW MORE THAN HE DOES, ALWAYS LISTENS, AND I UNDERSTAND OUR INTERACTIONS, MOTIVES, AND COMMUNICATIONS TOTALLY.
-1	I trust my primary doctor because he have treated my diseases for a few years without any significant errors. He treated nicely and friendly. He gave me a lot advice and suggestions on my health condition.  
-1	Conveyor belt care, prescribes drugs my insurance won't cover, just does the very least.
-1	"I have little faith in the medical system as a whole simply based on what I have persolly experienced as a person with arthritis and chronic pain, and based on what people I know with other chronic conditions have experienced generally.  In the past, my condition has been ""written off"" as being caused by things I know it is not caused by (for example, the last time I went to a rheumatologist, I them I have had joint pain for most of my life, and their response was it is the insomnia I have only just recently been plagued with that is causing it when for 90% of my life I had a very healthy sleep schedule), thus preventing me from getting proper treatment and having to jump through hoops to ""disprove"" what I already know.  I generally feel doctors do not trust my own knowledge on my health, and therefore I am not totally trusting of them or their motivations.  "
1	He asks what is bothering me and makes different appointments for different medical problems that I might need to do to better my health.
1	I trust that my physician wants what is best for me, but I think they are also bound to what their organization they work for want and what insurance companies will allow. The organizations and insurance companies are only interested in making money and do not have my best interests in mind and put pressure on Drs to avoid expensive procedures - that can delay needed treatment.
-1	I don't believe my doctor would deliberately lie to me or mislead me but I do think that at times it just isn't convenient for him to answer my questions or explain things thoroughly to me - that doesn't inspire trust.
1	I generally trust doctors because it is in their interest to make people feel better, and they have the training to do that. I think it takes a lot of caring for others to be a doctor and most physicians have the patient's best interests at heart. Most of them are proud of what they do and want to do well. 
-1	I don't see my primary car physician that often, but when I do she always seems kind of rushed and mechanical. For that reason I don't completely trust that she's explored all of the options, or given me the knowledge I need to know what my options are, but what she does do for me I trust is effective and not harming me. 
-1	I have learned over the years to trust in doctor's opinions as they have never let me down in a serious way. Sometimes they tend to be hurried and most do not like to do a lot of chit chatting but the advice seems to be very good. They have the experience in these areas so I usually go with whatever they think.
-1	My doctor acts like a know it all.  It seems like they are in a rush most of the time.  They could be more thoughtful and considerate.
1	I trust my PHC because diagnosis and prescribed medicines have worked in the past.
-1	The physician I had been seeing for the last several years left the area, and I only recently saw a new doctor. I have usually had female doctors in the past, but my new doctor is male. He is also my husband's doctor, and my husband likes him, so I decided to give him a try. I've only seen him once, but we got along very well. He took his time, asked questions and patiently allowed me to ask any questions I had. I liked him but it may take time for me to trust him as much as I did my former physician.
1	I am on a persol level with my doc. She knows who I am and what I have been through in life and will get right down to the nuts and bolts of my health so we can work on things together
1	I trust him. He always runs extra tests and checks on me clearly.
1	I feel my doctor has no reason but to tell me the truth.  I feel they want the best for me.
1	I am the type of person that will trust a person until they give me a reason to not trust them.  Simply put, my physician has never given me a reason to not trust them. 
1	I completely trust my primary care doctor because I have had the same doctor for over 15 years with no negative experiences or instances.
-1	I trust my Doctor because they've had many years of experience. I trust them because I know nothing in comparison to them. They took an oath to be a Doctor and I have to rely on that for their honesty.
-1	My doctor seems to be generally caring and concerned for my well-being. This also seems to be true for her other patients. While I don't always feel like the priority, I do feel as though I am cared for in a proper manner.
1	My doctor has far more knowledge about medical conditions and treatments than I do. He seems to genuinely be interested in recommending the best solutions for my health needs. For these reasons I have to trust him.
-1	My health is more important to me than it is to him.  I have read the results of the 8 year study by Arizo University on chelation.  My physician who offers chelation has not read the results of the study.  Absolute trust would mean that a second opinion is never justified.  My wife just had a bacteria eat away some of her bone below her lower jaw tooth.  Many periodontists would still treat this using bone grafts, while a better treatment using a laser is available.  We selected a periodontist that uses the laser approach.
-1	because they have more knowledge, education, and training than I do and though I may think I know, they likely know better. They have seen more people with similar issues than I possibly could so I trust them mostly. I also think that they are influenced by things such as insurance and pharma companies and such. That is why I think sometimes they rely on what is convenient and makes them the most money.
-1	I trust my physician due to feedback from others I know who also use him. I never see a doctor I have not researched about because there are many out there that should not be practicing medicine. 
-1	My feelings are at a neutral state with my doctor. I feel this way because I believe that  physicians give you some truth but they can also throw in some lies as well. They are money-oriented so therefore they will do whatever they can to get you to spend more money.
1	i trust my physician because she does a great job of going over different options to my problems. she doesn't just say there is only one path of treatment. she looks at the whole picture.
-1	I feel that she wants the best for me however, trying different medications with no foreseeable outcome has been rough. She hears me but doesn't give me the drug in which would benefit me most. She has the best intentions in trying the safest method however it seems to be a bit stunted.
-1	I feel like a lot of the time the doctor is just more interested in getting out of the room as quickly as possible. Anytime a question is asked, there is a quick, rushed response as if the question was annoying. Sometimes I even ask for addition tests and they are disregarded as not needed even though there have been times when the additiol test would have helped healing faster and was later proven to be so.
-1	My doctor sends me for ultrasounds that I don't need. 
-1	Doctors have the training and knowledge to make good decisions about my health.  If I feel that a doctor is not thorough or knowledgeable, I'll find another doctor.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel like she really listens to me. She is thorough and willing to explore different treatments in order to find the best one for me. I never feel like she is rushing me to move on to other patients.
-1	I really trist my primary care provider first snd for most because he listens to me and respects my decisions. He is always willing to talk in depth with me about my concerns and answer questions and respectful of my medical choices even if they go against what he recommends. In the past he has gone out of his way to look into other treatment options for me and their effectiveness. He is also very respectful of my body and perspective- to elaborate he really takes into considerstion my persol reports about things where as other medical providers in the past have blown me off and insisted Im reporting symptoms wrong etc.
1	While I do trust my doctor sometimes I worry that she focuses on one aspect of my health while I'm trying to get help for something new that just came up. 
1	I generally trust doctors and believe they have my best interest at heart.
-1	From what I've seen in the past several years, their too much emphasis on time magement and payroll correlation than on what's really beneficial for the patient. Issues are only addressed if it's convenient for the doctor and his/her staff. 
-1	sure about the situation
1	I like my PCP a lot. He is patient, thoughtful, and always listens. He is also very willing to utilize care that is more holistic. If I tell him that I'm confused or uncomfortable with a potential medication or treatment, he listens and is willing to explore and consider altertives.
1	I have known my primary doctor for about a year. In this year, I feel I can trust her to want what is best for me. She is very understanding and allows me to question her and even decide (e.g.) not to take a preventative medicine she has suggested. She makes me feel I am listened to and respected.
1	Some would say that medical professiols can't be trusted most of the time because there are times that they will just neglect your opinion and ask you to follow their opinion for their own benefits.Yes, it is true in some instance.However, those behaviors depending on the person you are in contact with.People now in our society has different attitudes and point of view in life and what is important is we must be cautious.
-1	My doctor has my best interests in mind at all times. She will take the time to explain my health to me in order for me to understand and go thru many options when treatment arises. She is always patient and listens when I have questions or am worried about my health.
-1	He seems nice enough, and he tends to explain things adequately, but I never feel very comfortable with him. I've been in a few times with issues that he's diagnosed was stress or anxiety related muscle tension so I worry that he might think I'm a bit of a hypochondriac.
-1	"I have been with the same primary care doctor for over 10 years now. For me persolly, I have never had a misdiagnosis or a recommendation that required further visits (I don't feel that my doctor is out to cheat people out of their money). However, I do agree that sometimes he might ""wing it"" during my physical checkups. However, I do put trust in him because I know that if there as really something serious, he would let me know. "
-1	I do not trust it sometimes. Because, some doctors do not look at the bright side and they are upset the people. And they do not look at the all type of test results. they see just some symptoms in report and they put the me of sickness. but they are not looking other side effect that cause the sickness.
1	My doctor has never lead me wrong. My doctor has always given great advice.
-1	"I am a skeptical person in general.  I feel that for the most part I can trust my doctor, but sometimes people forget that doctors are people too.  I work in a hospital and have heard doctors and nurses talking ""off the record.""  These kind of experiences can really change the way a person views healthcare."
1	I trust my primary care physician because he always makes me feel better.  He gives me exactly what I need to feel better.  He is a nice guy.  I like him.
-1	I do trust my doctor to a large degree. While I am aware they are going to suggest drugs based on their own connections with certain companies.
1	I have had a long doctor/patient relationship with her and she always remembers the different reasons for which I have seen her and follows up. 
1	My doctor is up on medical issues and tries to explain everything in a patient-friendly way.  He always goes over all the options and helps me decide based on my needs and desires instead of ordering me to do something.  He is not tied to any particular treatment and is open to different approaches.  He is experienced and not just out of med school, which makes me feel a little more secure--he has seen a lot over the years which gives him a great perspective on what does and doesn't work.
-1	I think they probably had altruistic motives in becoming a doctor.  I think their professiolism dictates that they act properly.  I think they're probably well-educated and intelligent. 
1	My doctor is pretty good at giving me all of the options and making sure that I am doing what I want, for the most part. There are rare times when they are busy and ther just isn't time and they tell me to just do something and I trust they are doing what is best and know better than myself. 
-1	Diagnosing a health issue is not very clear cut. Doctors may give their best guess at what's wrong but may be wrong. Getting an accurate diagnosis can involve a lot of testing, trial and error, or repeat visits. Doctors may take short cuts and prescribe medication based on what is most commonly seen rather than what may be most appropriate in a situation. For example, prescribing antibiotics when presented with generic cold symptoms (which may be caused by a virus).
-1	Like all professions not all doctors are perfect.
-1	I trust her, I suppose. I was afraid that I had cancer but I really just had canker sores and she gave me a prescription to get rid of them. But she is way too expensive to see!
-1	I know my doctor is not out to harm me.  I also understand there are other exterl forces at play (insurance requirements, patient requirements, regulatory requirements, etc.) that can affect treatment.  I believe it is in both my interest and my doctor's interest to be honest with each other and have that level of trust.
-1	I trust that my doctor is not going to do anything overtly damaging regarding my care however I do not trust that he is willing to fully treat some medical issues of mine. I have severe anxiety and depression and my doctor is unwilling to treat this issues medically to my satisfaction which causes some quality of life issues for me that greatly reduce my functiolity as a person.
-1	I basically trust my physician because she was able to help me with an issue that a previous doctor did not attempt to address.  I also feel that she listens to my problems and takes them seriously.  However, due to previous experiences with doctors, I am uble to trust any of them completely. 
-1	I respect and trust in the ability, expertise and intentions of my physician. However, he is still just a person, and no one is infallible.
1	My doctor seems to really want me to understand what problem I have and how to correct/ prevent it.
-1	I feel like there are too many profit based motivating factors with doctors in America that directly work against my best interest. I hear all the time about doctors strongly recommending expensive tests that prove to be unneeded in the eyes of a second opinion. 
-1	I don't really have a lot of trust in the medical decisions of doctors. There is almost always pressure to diagnose and get the next patient in as quickly as possible. If I had serious concerns that I wasn't sure of I would get a second opinion. Just a few days ago I read about a women who was told her breast cancer was only cysts and the cancer spread throughout her body in the year after her diagnosis, and she wishes she had got a second opinion. The cancer is termil for her and she is only in her early 30's. 
1	It has always been a very open and honest type of discussion between us. Nothing ever hidden with facts and consequences always fully disclosed.  
-1	I have seen doctors talk about how canbis is dangerous and can make you hallucite, and then proceed to put my mother on opiates as if they were a safer altertive for pain (with full knowledge of the fact that she was also on SSRIs and benzos). Once she was addicted to opiates, they treated her like an addict. When she quit her pills she lost her mind. She is now in rehab for alcohol and illicit drugs. She never drank or did any drugs before her doctors put her on pills. Meth and heroin are schedule 2 drugs, while canbis/ mdma/ psilocybin/ and lsd are classified as schedule 1 (no medical benefit). I guess I distrust the system more than the doctors, but they mostly have to buy in to the system to make it through med school.
1	I haven't experienced a doctor who didn't prioritizes my needs. I know there are doctors that aren't completely honest and are only interested in their pay check, but I don't believe I've ever met one.
-1	Icompletly trust my primary care physician because I have been a patents of his for years 
1	I have been with him for many years and he has always looked out for me. He was instrumental in diagnosing a serious condition that  when corrected completely changed my life. He also makes sure I understand what he says and follows up. I feel lucky to have him as my doctor.
1	I trust them because they have always been straightforward with me. There is  no reason to question them so I don't.
1	My PCP was researched well enough and my persol interactions have been very professiol. I can find no reasons so far o distrust my PCP, and if I did I would not see this person for anything.
-1	I trust my doctor because I trust my hospital. My hospital has a really good reputation. I have been them for years.
-1	Sometimes doctors aren't up on the latest research. I've had experiences where doctors let their prejudice against me affect the care I've received. Sometimes doctors don't understand how multiple conditions interact with each other. I think that while most of them are well-meaning and generally competent, they're also busy and stressed and sometimes get stuck in their habits. 
1	All of the doctors I've ever met have been extremely calm and thorough with everything. They always go through procedures and explain exactly what they think and what I should do and why I should do it. I trust them very much and have no reason not to. 
-1	I trust my physician because they are more knowledgeable in the heath field than I am and I have to trust because there is no other option.
1	My doctor has been helping me and my mother for years and has only recommended things in my best interest. If I hadn't moved away from home I would still use her as my main physician.
1	I trust my doctor because she has given my no reason not to trust her.  She explains her thought process when it comes to diagnosing any issues I am having and she explains the pros and cons of various treatment options.  If she makes a recommendation for a certain course of action she explains why.  I guess maybe a primarily trust my doctor because she is transparent.
-1	I just feel like when I visit my doctor or doctors, that I am just another person for them to get  through. I feel that they are always in a rush to get in and out. Its not always because they have other people to see, sometimes it just feels like they are ready to take a break and they rush just to get out. 
-1	"I trust my physician because he is a trained and qualified professiol. Even if he ""cares more about what is convenient for him than about my medical needs"", I can not know about it. He would not tell me. I can only trust him."
-1	I trust my doctor in a very basic sense. I feel that doctors don't take the time necessary to thoroughly go over medical issues with patients. They are quick to prescribe medications without considering the harm it can do with the side effects. I try to keep up with my own needs and search for medical information to better help me. I feel that I'm the best to look out for myself.
-1	my doctor makes me nervous. sometimes i feel belittled. sometimes i understand things but not fully and do not want to seem dumb so don't ask for examples. 
-1	Because you asked about my GP, I usually see him when it's about something specific. Generally he listens, performs a few simple, superficial tests and then refers me to a specialist.
-1	Doctors do not respect the moral or philosophical views which differ from their own regarding treatment. They treat symptoms and not underlying causes of illness and they do this by pushing medications that cause more harm and side effects to the body, thereby increasing the problems (and the number of medications) that one must battle.
1	I've gone to the same doctor for the past 20 years so I have a decent relationship with him. While I don't go to the doctor often, I know if I do need to that he'll be honest and up front with me. He knows me and is interested in helping me.
-1	In the end I feel neutral towards doctors. I know there are some that are good but I have had mixed experiences with them. Whether it be misdiagnosis, bad bedside manner, over charging, etc. So it is hard to feel anything but neutral towards them. But you have to have enough blind faith in them to get the job done because that is what they are educated in. 
1	I have been seeing this doctor for years and I trust his judgement. I have never had any issues or problems with him that would make me doubt his ability or honesty. I am comfortable with him as well.
1	Other members of my family see the same primary care physician as me, and she noticed a serious medical issue affecting my mother before any other doctor.
1	I believe my doctor is competent and knowledgable.  She has specialized training, so I often defer to her.  She is always professiol, and I trust the hospital she works for.  She is a good person who genuinely seems interested in promoting my health and well being.
-1	Although I'm sure he gives great information, I have a feeling that most doctors as well as my own throw out information in order to benefit themselves. Better feedback means more clients, etc. I feel like most solutions to my problems are a bit forced and not genuine.
-1	My doctor has been honest with me since I've been with her. 
1	I've only been seeing my doctor for about 6 months, but so far he has helped my take care of my health needs by referring me to specialists and prescribing medication which has helped me. He has also ordered tests to make sure nothing is wrong with me. He talks to me like a person and not just a patient, he understands my needs an listens to what I have to say.
1	I have always had very good doctors and fully trust there opinions. Both of my parents are doctors and I think that influences my opinions of doctors. I trust my parents so I trust other doctors too. I have never had reason to not trust my doctors.
-1	some times i can trust doctors but not all the time some times doctors advice go wrong because if we cant explain our doctprs how he can guide us. many times we never know our situation so how can we trust them in all casses.
-1	I feel my doctor is rather caring about my medical needs. He tries his best to cover all bases when an issue comes about to elimite any possibilities of what the issue can be causing any underlying illness.
-1	I trust somewhat because of professiol training but sometimes I feel like they have so much on their shoulders that they might just write off some of my concerns and think of the first thing that comes on their mind to solve my problem so they can get to the next patient
-1	He has actually listened and seem more concerned than most doctors I have had in the past. I trust him, to an extent, because he seems to listen and try to figure out the best action to take, but since I have had testing on things that were expensive and still had no resolution and he seems to not have as much experience as others, I do not completely trust him.
1	I've known my family doctor for a very long time and trust him on a persol level in addition to a professiol one.
1	My doctor says a good businessman can never be a good doctor and a good doctor cannot be a good businessman. My doctor has a simple practice in which he spends considerable time with each patient.
-1	I don't have one but the ones I had in the past do not fit the category of fully trusted.  
1	Been my doctor for a long time. Family and friends have gone to him for 15+ years. He is very smart and knowledgeable. He has never told me anything that was wrong or iccurate. He is also the head doctor for the hospital next to his practice. 
-1	I trust doctors in general, but they are human and can make mistakes. And then there are some who are not very good at what they do. My trust is conditiol.
-1	I feel that my PCF is a kind person and has intentions to help yet does not want to realty invest in the thought and process needed to truly uncover my medical issues. Specifically my secondary infertility issues. I have seen her twice and she can't seem to ever move things along in the process and sort it out. I am extremely discouraged by her lack of urgency.  
-1	There hasn't be a major illness I've had to deal with in my life or my family members life.
-1	I think there is a mindset is medicine today that you need to get the patient in and out quickly. You have to consider what insurance will pay for when running tests. Doctors rarely get to know you well enough to have a complete understanding of your life and finding out what underlying causes may be contributing to what's wrong with you.
-1	My doctor takes time to talk with me and answer all my questions. There is also time to discuss all options thoroughly to gain the clearest picture.
-1	ALL DOCTORS WANT IS MONEY
1	My doctor is a candid, relaxed older gentleman who seems to always say exactly what he means. He has never given me the impression that he's in a hurry to see other patients, or that he wants to quickly diagnose me. He's put me through thorough tests, asked me a lot of questions, and suggested many options to me.  The fact that he's so thorough and patient makes me completely trust him to act in my best interests.
-1	I don't have a primary doctor but I do feel that most doctors that I have dealt with of very trustworthy. I haven't had any issues of being mislead of being misinformed over any medical situation. Most doctors I have dealt with seem sincere and show concern. 
-1	My primary care physician is a very nice, warm, friendly woman, and I liked her immediately upon meeting her. However, during our last appointment, she prescribed a medication that has awful side effects, some side effects that I had expressed concern about with her during that same appointment, so I was disappointed to read about those side effects after picking the medication up from the pharmacy and that made me second guess my immediate trust in this physician. 
-1	I have always trusted my doctor.  He has been my persol doctor ever since I had my first heart attack.  I can say I do not trust his nurses due to their ruse behavior, but my doctor yes.  He has done persol visits to my home before and has taken good care of my health after my first heart attack experience.  I feel much better now than before. 
-1	i always follow  our   family doctor because he is updated the lated treatment and medicines etc
-1	I feel that today doctors are just trying not to get sued. So they go with the safest least liable option always and what is convent cause the most patients they see means the most money for them. 
-1	All doctors follow rules and procedures that are generalized for everyone and not for me. They may or may not take me 100% at my word when I describe symptoms and feelings and will not provide all options if they don't approve of one. I've only been able to get full information when I pressed and asked, although I have encountered some doctors that did let me make the fil decision without judgement. I feel I know my body best, and often they don't take that same attitude.
1	I have used the same clinic for 20 years and even though there have been times when they have had to try different treatments to figure out what works I have always felt that they have had my best interest in mind. Sometimes they will start with a treatment that cost the least in order to help me out fincially so that I do not have to spend excess money on test and prescriptions. They have always seemed to be upfront and honest with me and other members of my family.
-1	I've been seeing my doctor for a long time and he hasn't ever really steered me wrong, but I also haven't really ever dealt with any serious health problems. I have family members who have stopped seeing this doctor because they thought he wasn't taking the time necessary to deal with their conditions, but until that happens to me or if I have a condition I don't think he can handle I will continue to see him.
-1	Most doctors are in the pockets of big pharma, and too willing just to prescribe pills insteas of really looking into the problem.
1	I have been seeing him for a few years now. He is very thorough and he explains things to me very well when I have questions.
-1	Even though I have been going for at least 4 years, he often mistakes details about my conditions.  Also there is a language barrier communication problem.  He often prescribes medications which I find out later are harmful to take given some of my other conditions.  Unfortutely he is one of the only providers of my insurance carrier within my local area. Some of the problems I try to fix by writing out questions.  All in all, he will correct mistakes when I point them out.
-1	I trust my doctor's abilities and believe him to be honest. That being said, he has hundreds of patients and I'm not his friend or family member. I'm sure he does a great job, but why should I have complete trust in another person, just because they are my doctor. I don't have complete trust in my friends or family members, why should my doctor be any different? 
1	I tend to trust my physical because he feels like he is knowledgeable. He also doesn't seem like someone who rushes through patients. He takes the time to answer any questions I might have. He seems to care.
1	I have been a patient with my doctor for a while.  I have a good rapport with him.  He is thorough and follows up well.  He explains things well and answers any questions.  I trust his judgement and opinion.
1	MY PHYISICIAN IS GOD FEARING
1	My doctor is calm and collected and very sympathetic. She seems to care about me as a patient so I trust her.
-1	I trust physicians, however sometimes I believe they are too busy to fully disclose all options for medial treatments and typically provide the fastest answers as possible. Sometimes I feel like physicians could be a little more thourough, but there's only so much they can do with the time they're allotted, especially with large work loads/multiple patients.
1	With one notable exception, all the doctors that I have dealt with have been professiol, if a bit brusque. For the most part though, I've never gotten any bad advice or diagnosis, so I can't really complain about the bedside manner if they tend to do the job well.
1	she is my age and is very intelignet She is going throght some of the same issues I am and i just connect with her so much and trust her a lot she is  a contol freak but i love it anyway its good for me!!
1	I have never been given any reason not to trust my Doctor. He has always been able to provide the level of care that I expect and always answers my questions satisfactorily 
-1	My doctor seems sincere in his concern for my problems. He typically lays out what I need to know about my condition. He seems to make as much time for me as possible despite seeming like he is always busy.
-1	Because it would lead towards others not being truthful with their things
-1	My doctor is very knowledgeable and thorough but I still feel more comfortable researching and getting second opinions. I don't trust anyone blindly. 
1	I have gone to the same primary care physician for the past twenty years.  He has always been patient, upfront, and honest with me.  He has never given me a reason to second guess his intentions or information. 
1	My doctor is very bright and because of this I have learned to trust her more and more.   It is my own persol distrust of people that made me not trust her 100% when I first starting going to her for care.
-1	I've had some pretty negative experiences with PCPs. Mostly due to the fact I smoke canbis and don't want medication. I and my new PCP find that canbis is much safer than being prescribed benzos and adderall my whole life.I trust her because it doesn't seem like she is pushing pills.
-1	I like my primary care physician but I must be cautious. Although my doctor cares for his patients' well-being, he does seem to push prescriptions rather than talking about potential altertives. I do not feel he is wrong in prescribing the medications for most of his patients but I have a strong desire to seek out altertive treatments.
1	In general my physician does a thorough job. Never seem to be in a rush or anything.
1	He's always been upfront with me and has given me multiple ways to go about a situation. 
1	My primary doctor is really good with patients and caring.  I think she has her patient's best interest in her heart.  She is careful not to give me too many pills of the same med.  For example she didn't want to give me any more of the pink blood pressure med, so she gave me a different one so I could have more of what I needed but not too much of one kind.  
1	I trust my primary care because I believe that he really cares for my well-being.
1	They always take their time, aren't rushed and explain to me any test results.  They have a conversation with me rather than just reporting things.  They have a genial and relaxed manner.
-1	She has been open about what I have and how to treat them.  She seems to listen me sincerely and in a warm, attentive manner.  It doesn't look like she's going through the motions of pretending to listen and care about me, not brushing me off if I have concerns or questions, and she is accommodating towards me.  She also provides articles that she has her nurse print out for me to take home and study about treatments and conditions.
-1	I think that I trust my doctor but always try to relay on my own instincts also. If there is something that I don't agree with or a treatment that I'm not sure about, I always wait and do my own research before jumping on board. 
-1	I have a good doctor.  In most things I trust what she says.  However I am responsible for my own care and if something seems risky it is best to get more information on it first.  I try to avoid taking a lot of medications that has bad side effects.  
1	I feel really good when I go to my doctor because I know that I can go in the office with a bunch of questions and I will have them all answered by the time I leave. I do not feel rushed, which is a huge deal for me. I think my doctor is thorough and very interested in my as a patient rather than just a number or someone written in his appointment book.
-1	I know they get kickbacks for prescribing certain medications from companies and so they do in fact go out of their way to prescribe them when the might not be the best medication for the ailment or might even be harmful or just plain not need medication at all.  The can put their bottom line first which is never good for the patient.  This is not always the case of course but it happens way more than it should (of course it should never happen at all)
-1	My husband and I moved to a new state and we didn't know anything about a Primary Care Physician, so we looked up who seemed to be best in this town.  The doctor was not taking on new patients, but there was another doctor in his practice.  This doctor who I just mentioned is awful!  He barely seems to care when I have an issue and need his help.  We are currently looking for a new PCP and are getting ideas from others who we trust.  Also, our previous PCP where we used to live was AMAZING!  She took her time, asked questions and made sure that I was cared for!  That just makes this new PCP so much worse!
1	My doctor always takes the time to explore the best treatment options. He explains them in a manner that is easy to understand, the benefits and downsides of procedures, and how I should go about certain routines. He does not make me feel pressured, does not force decisions on me, and makes sure I complete agree with something before moving forward. 
-1	I don't know them well; we're on insurance and don't get top notch treatment, and I don't know the doctors well enough to know how objective they are.
1	I went to many doctors before I chose mine. She is very caring and very careful and attentive. I can tell she really cares and has my best interest at heart. 
-1	My doctor asks questions to be sure he is treating me effectively.  He listens without judgment (as I have encountered with another doctor) and he doesn't make me feel belittled.  
-1	I feel that i am just a number and a pay check most of the time. I have had a few different pain issues over the last 10 years that no medicine, exercise or checkup has been able to diagnose, help, or fix. 
-1	I do not know my primary care doctor.  He was assigned to me with the ovomitdon'tcare tax went into effect.  I have yet to be able to get an appointment with him.  Every time I need a doctor, I call and, first, I am told he is not taking any new patients.  When I tell them he is my assigned doctor, I am told the first available appointment is 6 to 8 months away.  Thanks to the ovomitdon'tcare tax, the emergency room is my primary care doctor.  I answered the above questions based on the two times in the past 4 years I have had to go to the emergency room.
-1	I have only seen my physician twice.  I do not know him that well. I believe that he is capable, and that he really does want to keep me healthy as can be.  At the same time I think he is also out to make money, which may mean unnecessary tests.  I have to see him more to find out if I really trust him before I am willing to say that I do.
-1	I trust my physician because I don't feel like he's trying to oversell me to get more from my insurance. His answers and explations are quite clear. 
-1	Some are not very persoble and always feels like they're in a rush.  The ones who have practicing for too long appear to fit this description.  It seems they have loss interest in their profession.  
-1	I'm not very trusting of him, because he shows no concern or care for the problem he is treating. His main focus is money, and when he recommends a treatment or medication, I need to go and research it myself to make sure it is even a viable option. He has suggested some options that are laughable at best.
-1	When I've gone to my physician or even one at an emergency care facility they often try to rush you and generalize what is going on. This would be when you explain symptoms and you say you've had a bad cough for three weeks and they just blow you off and tell you there is a cold going around and when you end up in an emergency room you find out you had a bacterial infection in your lungs. Its hard to trust them as it's a business now and they move people in and out like cattle. If you're lucky your Dr will spend 5 minutes with you but the nurses usually do all the interview work.
1	My doctor is very truthful to me and she always tells me exactly what I want to hear, which is the truth. She is very qualified and I consider her one of the best doctors in the area.
1	I don't know.  I am not going to put a whole lot of though into why I trust my doctor.  I suppose, if he had ever given me any reason not to trust him, he would not be my doctor any more.
-1	Doctors don't really seem to take their time with the patients, that's usually the nurses job, so they don;t seem to care too much or the cherry-picked the patients they went to care about..and I generally don't just anyone that pushes unnecessary medications and treatment on their patients so they can line their pockets or an money for their hospital. 
1	Over the years, my doctor has proven that he knows my issues, listens to me carefully and always makes the right choices for me about my care and well being. I completely trust him because he has fixed many conditions and proactively treated me to prevent complications and other issues.
-1	I've found that physicians rarely agree which makes me nervous.  Often there are treatments or reseasrch on existing treatments that unengaged doctors are not aware of.
-1	He's very open and discusses the options with me openly.  He takes the time to answer my questions and provide me with options.  What he's done so far has worked well.
1	I trust them because I don't think they would want to hurt me.
1	I've been with my Doctor now for almost a decade and I've had little or no reason not to trust he has my best interests at heart. He only prescribes drugs when I really need them and gives me more than one option for treatment with full information.
-1	I believe my doctor is competent and concerned. He is  nearing retirement himself and is pretty conventiol in his thinking. Old school is his approach and he doesn't stretch his thinking to consider newer treatment options. I think there is some value in looking at treatments like acupuncture, pain magement techniques beyond meds and holistic treatments. He pooh-poohs such ideas and finds fault with altertive practitioners. So I believe he has my best interest at heart but I think he stopped expanding his views on what options might be.
1	Their overall experience and rating among the community. I have not heard any bad statements about them.
-1	I don't like or trust her, she comes in looks at my chart prescribes another pill and walks out without hardly talking to me.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physicians. However, I've had recent experiences where the judgment was wrong and it's since made me somewhat skeptical. Two doctors prescribed an antibiotic that wasn't the right choice for treating an infection that almost led to serious consequences. I ended getting advice on a different medicine from family friends that ultimately led to a change in medication. While that experience has made me a little skeptical, I still generally trust doctors and think they have my best interests at heart.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician.  I think doctors in general, such as the doctors I've gone to in the past, want to get you out of there as quickly as possible so they want to avoid finding out anything more about a situation or saying anything specific to the individual and not generic.  I generally don't think doctors have taken me seriously.
-1	Doctors are humans too and sometimes they might be limited or bound by other things like insurance, law (like they can't insist/suggest rather strongly on doing something when you don't want to) etc. Doctors can make mistake and that's why you always need your second opinion (or even third sometimes).
1	I trust my doctor because he has taken an oath to treat his patients as such. No doctor wants the reputaion of bad advice. They take this seriously to become esteemed physicians in the USA.
1	i feel that i can trust my doctor because they always give me all the information that i could possibly need regarding treatment plans. they always treat me like a person. and whe also treats the whole person not just the issue and she doesn't just try to push pharmaceuticals on patients.
-1	"I don't care how much of an expert any doctor is, you should never trust any one completely. If you want to be healthy then you need to be actively involved, not just relying on someone else for all the answers. So, while I do have great confidence in my doctor, I don't take everything he says as ""the gospel"". I'm not at all above obtaining a second or even third opinion on an issue that I'm still not certain about. At the end of the day, I see it as a 50/50 relationship between doctors and myself...in order to achieve optimal results we both have to do our part."
-1	I like my new primary care doc very much but had really negative experiences with docs for way too long when I lived in another state. I am extremely cautious about all medications and am generally skeptical so I do my due diligence with all doctors and treatments they recommend. Right now I am dealing with some significant side effects from meds Rx'd in the late '90s and at that time absolutely no one told me the long term effects until a dentist did years afterward. So although I like my current pcp, I don't let down my guard and just accept everything they say as the complete story.
1	My doctor gives me no reason not to trust them. They always make time for me even when they are busy. The health of their patients is their number one priority. 
-1	I do not fully trust my doctor because it's just hard for me to do. I like to do my own research and find tural homeopathic ways of doing things.
-1	"I never have total trust in anyone. I do ""mostly"" trust my primary care physician. He's a good man. I like him and he hasn't failed me. But that doesn't mean I don't look online to learn more about the things he tells me to do. I think that's a good thing to do and I don't consider it to be distrusting."
-1	I don't have complete trust in them.  They are so busy and trying so hard to get patients in and out I don't feel they totally are dedicated to providing me with the best care. 
-1	I like my doctor. She is very thorough in some areas but a little cavalier in others. I've had to come back twice because she said something wasn't important and it turned out to be more serious.
-1	been my family doctor for a long time not just me but friends and family and has alway do their job well
-1	I believe if a person has dedicated their life to healing people, then their suggestions would be valuable. Doctors have a lot invested (time/money) in their careers, I don't believe they would throw that investment away by providing false information to their patients.
1	I can relate to my doctor with some challenges that we've faced with our kids.  He is my son's doctor also (Family Practice). He gets it.  He is very professiol but could not hide his frustration with the school system for special needs children.  It really helped me to not feel alone especially with a doctor who is so understanding.  He has such a good bedside manner.  He really does care about my son and I as his patients.  I truly feel that he gives his best advice and I would trust him with any health concern that I have.
-1	I sometimes get the feeling the doctor is thinking more about what the insurance company will pay for rather that what is best.
1	The doctor always explains the medical problem in detail, and doesn't assume you know what he is talking about.  He thoroughly answers all my questions about the problem or the options.
1	They have been with me since I was young and have built a reputation 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have known her for a long time and she always have time to see me and my family in case of any emergency. She is always honest and straight forward about my medical issues.
1	I trust my doctor to give me the best treatment options. That the doctor's job after all, to help me feel better. 
-1	I trust my doctor and like her but I would not place complete trust in just one person.
-1	I have to rely on my primary care physician, because I I don't have any other options to get medical advice. I am distrustful of him on some level, because he is driven by his business interest first very often.
-1	I have only seen my new primary care doctor once.  She was thorough in her questions and seemed very involved in my health care with recommendations for action and followup.  (Of interest, I had also seen a dermatologist about the same time... that physician/assistant seemed to actually be grossed out by me and responded with a lot of 'i really dont know what to tell you' and with no recommended treatment, and the clinic calling me with the wrong information only to have to call me back and tell me they made a mistake.)   Truly, I think going to the doctor is a crap shoot as to whether or not you will get someone that cares and doesn't treat you like someone they just need to move through the system.
1	if you cant trust you doctor who can you trust i trust him because he took an oath and is in the service buseiness the buseinss of caring adn heping
1	My doctor is very forthright and honest, they give me the information that I need to know and will give me ideas on what I can honestly do to help make myself healthier or achieve my goals.
-1	Most doctors care more about cost than patient care.
1	Doctors are in a profession to heal people so I would think that in general that they would care about people. And I'd trust them because I think that they want to give the best treatment either due to common human decency or pride in one's profession to do the best work.
1	I have been with my primary care physician for a long period of time.  I have gained a healthy relationship and trust level with her. She has always giving me straight-forward advice and information. Whenever I've asked of side effects or possible outcomes she has always giving me the knowledge and confidence the positive effect greatly out way the negative.
-1	My doctor is pretty old, and set in his ways. I haven't been to him that many times since I moved here, but the times that I have been to him he was not that great. He seemed to rush through appointments, not spending much time with me. The information he gave me about an issue I had seemed pretty outdated, so I didn't take his advice on that. I have been meaning to find another primary caregiver, but I have not found the time to do it yet.
-1	I am seeing my doctor for about 2 years.   I have to visit him every 4 weeks.  I distrust him because he doesn't answers the questions important me .  He just follows standard procedures every time.
1	My current PCP is much better than some I've had in the past. She is still hurried at times due to her full office visit schedule, but does her best to spend all the available time productively. She uses electronic communication when possible to continue conversations. This is a great improvement over past doctors who have listened to one or two symptoms, fired off a prescription, and hurried out.
1	I have had nothing but good experiences with my doctor. I always got the feeling that they really care about my health and what is best for me.
1	I trust my PC because I have been with him for years. He has no steered me wrong in all the years that I have known him.
1	My doctor has gained my trust within the past year by discovering a serious problem with my thyroid in the process of examining me for rhumatism. I would not have known this if he had not taken the trouble to examine my blood tests carefully and sent me for more specific tests. This process has definitely made me trust his competence and thoroughness.
-1	Because she is thorough. I have been going from doctor to doctor before I find this one about medical problems. She was the only one that ordered tests and found my problem, which was a spil cord tumor.
-1	If I did not trust my physician I would change and find one that I would.  I trust my physician currently as I watch how he lives his life outside of the medical field.  Church, community, family.  I judge their ethics away from work to get a feel and add it to how Im treated and the discussions at the office.  Its usually going to see other doctors (any little thing you always have to go see somebody else or 2 or 3) where I have my problems with trust, don't have many to choose from so have to use doctors that are available.
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for years and it's obvious she's someone who truly cares about her patients and isn't just trying to make money or has been burned out by the job. More than once she has told me I might want to get a second opinion on something, which only increases my trust in her, for I much prefer that rather than a doctor who thinks they're always right.
1	I think he is mostly trustworthy and competent.
1	"I trust pcp a lot. She has been my doctor for several years and she has been great. She knows me well and works with me to help me mage my health problems. I'm not ""just another number"" with her. "
1	I believe that doctors in general have their patients needs first in mind, but I also feel like they are over worked and over stressed. They also don't necessarily have all the answers, and have to solve some problems through trail and error.
-1	i trust my doctor because she takes time to give me as much information and advice as possible and does not shy away from my questions. Most importantly i find that doing want she advice's me actually helps and improves my health and happiness. She is also very kind and friendly.
1	My primary care doctor has given me no reason to distrust them, so I trust them. The Hippocratic Oath and medical licensing process are enough for me to trust them so long as they don't give me reason not to.
-1	I'd like to trust my doctor more. The issue is that he sees so many patients I often feel like a number. He gets in a rush during appointments. I trust him as far as I can, but I'd prefer to have a doctor that could give me more individualized attention. Sadly that isn't an option for me at this time.
-1	Because with them I feel very safe
-1	I feel I can trust my doctor because he is very professiol. He seems to care about his patients. He also explains things well.
1	I don't have a PCP but I consider my OBGyn my most regular doctor. She is very smart, compassiote, and takes time to explain things to me clearly and give me advice and recommendations. I like her and trust her a lot. 
-1	If you can't trust your Doctor, who can you trust? Even if you have some misgivings, it doesn't hurt to go get a second or even third opinion to allay some of your fears. It's not like Doctor's really have an incentive to lie to their own patients.
-1	I think that doctors are people to so they can make errors.  I trust my doctor but still use apps such as WebMD so I can get a sense of what might be the problem before going to the doctor.
-1	i just got a new primary physician not too long ago so i dont know him too well. overall i think some doctors, especially psychiatrists (my primary care doctor is a psychiatrist as well) do what is most convenient for themselves.
-1	Most of them are paid to push certain drugs on me.  I have a condition that through many doctors, i am uble to ever have two of them agree about it.  I constantly get conflicting info about it.
-1	Doctors generally have other considerations besides a patient's optimal treatment. They can be fincially influenced by pharmaceutical organizations and recommend newer and different medications. They can also be driven by profits when recommending procedures that may not be necessary. They also may avoid certain treatments because they do not have the knowledge to recommend them, or they may want to avoid liability. 
-1	I currently do not have a primary care physician for the simple fact that I can't find one who is willing to look past their training and realize that not everybody is an identical copy of another. Most of the ones I have encountered are medicine pushers. For those who can't, or would rather not take traditiol forms of western medicine, finding a doctor who believes or takes you seriously is a very difficult task. 
1	I have been with my doctor 3 years. He spends more than enough time going through things he thinks I should know. He answers my questions and will explain them where I can understand. I am able to email him with questions and he or his nurse will respond within a day. I receive updates on my health and tests. If he feels I need additiol tests done, he or his nurse will email or call me directly and explain why. 
1	I've been lucky enough to have a female doctor who understands my female health related issues.  I trust this person for the most part.  I understand that people are not perfect.  
-1	I have never really had an experience where I totally trusted a doctor. I usually go for annual physical exams and it doesn't seem like they really check all the things they should be checking. I think they have a routine to go through and there's very little else above that.  
1	My primary care physician has always had my best interest in mind.  He is always willing to answer my questions or concerns regardless of time.  I feel we have a good relationship and can count on him to provide the best health care. 
-1	I do not necessarily distrust my physician I simply don't completely trust anyone. I value my doctors opinions and suggestions greatly but ultimately I make my own decisions. 
-1	I don't have a primary care right now but my specialist that treats me has always been trustworthy and is a very pleasant doctor to deal with.
-1	I dont trust anyone to  be honest but i would hope doctors can be trusted to do what is in the best interest for my health 
1	Honestly, my doctor is from my community and i have this doctor as our family doctor since last 7 years. From the experience my doctor is being honest about our health condition.
1	He is caring and listens to what I have to say and how I feel.  He has had to pass all the testing done to become a Doctor and I don't think many untrustworthy people can pass all the testing that is done.  And he has taken an oath to do no harm all trustworthy people will adhere to any oath they take.
-1	Sometimes I trust her judgment other times,I do not. When it come to basic healthcare needs and minor ailments, I trust her. But major issues ,I do not. She is too quick to offer medicines, when I don't think it's a good idea. For example, she encouraged me to take pain medicine after a minor surgery and I refused.
-1	I don't fully trust any doctor. Any person can make a mistake. Also you never know how a person really is and how much they really care.
1	He examines me throughly and he runs test if needed.  I see a neurolgist due to a muscle disorder.  I have seen him for the past five years.  He has helped me with every aspect of this disease. Ran every test possible.  Also discussed my diagnosis with other neurologist.   He explains everything so I and my husband completely understand
-1	because they always show me how much they care about me.They answer any questions I have and calm me.
-1	I have a primary care doctor.  Sometimes he does not seem as thorough as he could be in medical checkups.  Or he keeps wanting to send me to specialists for things he could do himself
-1	I don't trust or distrust them. They are very busy and medicine is complicated so I'm sure they will make many mistakes.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because i believe him.
-1	I think doctors are doing their best according to their training. Few have any training or knowledge about altertive or tural remedies. I wish they did. 
-1	 Again, I'm sure overall my doctor is a good physician,  but i feel like if my opinion does not match with his,  it becomes a battle of wills rather than a helpful exchange.  And of course I don't always get as much time as I would like with him,  but more with the nurse,  which makes it seem I funny really matter to him. 
-1	I don't put complete trust in no one. That goes for doctors too. Everybody are human, and their well-being, opinions and feelings can affect my medical treatment.
-1	anyone who has spoken to a health professiol knows they don't know everything. more often than not, they have no opinion about some new drug or treatment you are going to ask them about because in fact, you have done more recent research and are probably talking about something that has yet to be in widespread use. they will rely on things that have worked in the past and give the same answers they always give rather than go out of their way. speaking for myself, I don't have a regular routine so I may never see them again and they know it
1	I trust my doctor to provide me with the best care that is in the scope of his capability.  If I have a problem that is outside the scope of his responsibility I trust him to recommend another competent person.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a professiol and knows what he's talking about. He's never led me wrong so far.
1	I have a long relationship with my dr. She has earned my trust over the years and is normally very accurate in her diagnosis. Her explations and communication is top notch.
-1	At the moment I don't have a primary care physician so I am answering based on my previous doctors and the many doctors I have taken my parents to.  I believe all these doctors are trying to be responsible and do their best.  But primary care physicians are much too quick to prescribe a pill or CHANGE medication based on one reading in their office (especially for blood pressure). I honestly don't believe some doctors understand that 'more' or a drug is not necessarily better. I don't think doctors have much time (or take much time) to problem solve these days.  I think they often make sp judgements based on how much your symptom looks or sounds like somebody else's rather than assuming your symptom might be unique.
-1	Having a myriad of experiences with physicians as a result of my background, I can say with absolutely certainty that physicians are predisposed to engaging in bad behavior and ebled by society's misconception of all physicians as a group as being compassiote, competent, ethical, trustworthy etc. Having seen shockingly horrifying and abhorrent displays of bad behavior by physicians, there is no way I have any trust in physicians as a group as they are one of the most self-serving, selfish, manipulative, and uncaring people I have come across. This is not to say that all physicians are like this, however, it is important that people drop their false notion of physicians being equivalent to saints so that patients are better equipped to deal with wily, deceptive physicians and are more motivated to be active when seeking healthcare/engaging with physicians. 
-1	i think doctors have a general sense of care about the patient that over exceeds any kind of selfishness they may have 
-1	Sometimes I feel like the doctor doesn't believe me when I say I have a problem and she makes excuses as to why I couldn't have this issue because of my age etc. She doesn't even try to find out if there is an underlying issue and just thinks I want drugs which makes it hard for me to get treated for things. 
-1	I have always had a good experience with my PCP. She's about my age, which makes me sometimes wish that she had a bit more experience. She always listens to what I have to say although sometimes I feel like she is a bit rushed and just wants to wrap up the appointment. I've never had anything serious come up that she had to treat me for. 
-1	Most doctors listen to patient concerns.  
-1	I have trust in my physician because they usually provide the right details for me and they thoroughly look into why I feel sick or whatever it may be. I trust their information and they rely to me the appropriate things I need to recover. Reason I put faith in them is because every time I went to them for help, they did their job well. 
1	I feel my doctor (or nurse practitioner) has my best interests in mind because she is always thorough and helpful when we meet with her.  She listens and troubleshoots any issues we have. 
-1	"In general, when dealing with a physician, I find that they are blatantly unconcerned with the welfare of their patients up to the point at which they have concerns about legal liability. The vast majority of physician are running assembly line medical practices and are far more concerned about how many patients a day they can move through their office in much the same way that servers in high-volume restaurants are concerned about how many tables they can move during their shift: It is the attempt to /appear/ to care rather than actual concern for the person who is being cared for. That said, I have been fortute enough to have experiences with truly professiol doctors who I often describe as being scientists rather than simply being a part of the medical industry, ""machine,"" so to speak. The pediatrician for my children is a remarkable man who is often willing to spend thirty minutes with each of my children making sure that they have no troubles and beyond that even longer discussing any concerns I have about my children's health. When one of my children needed a fairly minor surgery I was just overwhelmed by the doctor he recommended for it. He was intelligent, concerned, professiol, and not rushed. He was clearly very busy, but he was willing and able to discuss all of my concerns. All things considered, the majority of doctors are not professiols. The professiols are few and far between and rarely encountered in a random selection of doctors."
1	I have known my physician as a friend before he became my doctor. He was also a work associate before, so I know the type of doctor he is to other people, and I know for a fact he is good and cares about his patinets.
-1	While I don't currently have a primary care physician, in the past I have had pretty good doctors. For the most part, I trust them. However, I take some of what they prescribe or suggest with a little grain of salt. Doctors don't take all of the body's systems into account or preventative care when diagnosing or prescribing. They are taught medicine; not nutrition or other tural ways to heal.
1	most doctors that I've had has had the patients best interest in mind. Sometimes they may not seem too warm or attentive but most of the time they are in my experience. They make sure to go over everything thoroughly so they don't miss any symptoms I might be having and that I understand fully the information that they need to tell me.
-1	Some doctors don't listen to my needs and concerns.  Many doctors act as if they are impervious to my pain.  Doctors have a tendency not to explain enough about the diagnosis or why they picked the prescription drug they prescribed.
1	I fully trust my primary care MD because we have a longtime patient/Dr relationship.  She is fully aligned with my health outcome goals and supports me toward those.
-1	While my doctor can sometimes seem a bit rushed and hurried to get out of the room I do trust him.  Even though he goes through the options a bit fast he does let me know all the options I have.  I know he has my best interest in mind. 
-1	I trust him because he's been our family's primary care physician for a long time now. He is very helpful and courteous
-1	I believe most doctors a trustworthy and are in that profession because they truly want to help patients which equates to them being trustworthy.
1	I trust my doctor because he is the family doctor. My parents go to see him and he takes excellent care of them. Just with things ive seen him for, he has earned my trust.
-1	I haven't been to my primary care doctor in years. I sometimes feel like doctors over prescribe and over medicalize everything, when there could be more simple solutions. For example, there is proof of doctors over prescribing antibiotics when it isn't necessary.
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician. Doctors are very educated about health and they know much more than i do about whats going on inside of me, so if i am told by my doctor that  i need to take certain meds or do a certain thing to fix a problem i am having, i will absolutely do it.
-1	According to their knowledge and experience doctors will give you advice that is safer for one's health.
-1	In general, I am a skeptical person so probably likely to questions all things, so it seems like I am not completely trusting. Also, I don't feel like the doctor listens carefully to what I am saying, so I am hesitant to put complete in the doctor.  I don't think the doctor will intentiolly lead me in a wrong direction but maybe not the best option for me. 
-1	Doctors that I have dealt with have been upfront with me and told me what is wrong and what I should do about it. Beating around the bush is very uncommon.
-1	My GP is fairly new at this practice. She is a NP and I think she gets a little hesitant about making decisions on what medication to give you. This in turn makes me nervous. Overall, I trust doctors but I also arm myself with knowledge. I will not take a new medication without researching it. Doctors do not have the time to know everything there is about a medicine they're prescribing. So, a pharmacist and research can be your best friend when it comes to your health.
-1	Doctors are rushed, constrained by my insurance (or lack thereof) and are only human so I have a hard time trusting physicians. I usually put my trust in them though because I don't trust myself either. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is our family doctor and she always explain my condition to me and refer me to a specialty when I need one,she take good care of me and my whole family.  
1	I have been seeing her for many years and she has never given me reason not to trust her. She is kind and I really look forward to seeing and speaking with her. I feel that she cares about me persolly, and I am not just a number. 
1	They have always explained why they are going to use a certain kind of treatment and why it's best for me. I've never gotten the impression that they were out for their own gain. I have always been taken care of and wouldn't look to switch any time soon.
-1	I regularly trust doctors but i recognize that they sometimes might be biased towards recommending certain medicaments. I don't really pay attention to that though.
-1	I have never had one regular primary care physician as I have moved around a lot. My experiences have varied from one doctor to another. They are all individual human beings with different persolities and flaws.
-1	I have a neutral opinion. The only time I questioned the doctor's diagnosis was when I still went to a pediatrician, and they thought I had a bacteria infection. It turned out when the sickness came back, it was actually full blown bronchitis. 
-1	I've never really had a reason not to trust my physician. They have always given me what I've needed to feel better and have always been thorough and clear. They make things convenient for me.
-1	i trust my doctor knowing that he/she had medical training and education and i don't 
-1	One thing for instance, I just started seeing a new PCP due to insurance changing over,  I have not been impressed by my first visit, hoping it gets better, but like receiving a blood test in the mail stated all was negative and clearly a level of Vitamin D was very low, the test was highlighted in Bold, and labeled Low, but it was stamp signed stating all normal.,  
1	He has given me prescriptions that have alleviated my depression and anxiety issues. He seems to really care because he wants to see me every month and examine how the medications exactly affects me and make changes. When I tell him I have worries about my heart he always checks and listens to my heart for a minute. I have no reason to doubt his honesty.
1	I trust my doctor because she explains everything in detail. She always asks if I have any questions or if I understand. She also takes her time with me.
1	My Dr. is very good, caring, and is one of the better ones the local Free Clinic in my community has.  My first confidence in her was also boosted a little when after a first medical appointment I also had needed to get a perscription refilled for anxiety/depression and found that the psychiatric nurse I see at a Human Development Center my community has not only knew her but said that she felt that I was in good hands having been put in the physician's hands then proceeded to tell me a little about her background, experience, etc.  She also had suspected pre-diabetes in me, we did the blood test which proved right and I started following her reccomendations and feel much better.  She is also very humble- I went to thank her after an appointment using the title Dr., and her last me.  She immediately corrected me, thanked me for thinking that and said that she was only a P.A. and would prefer use of her first me.
-1	I think most doctors have good intentions but they are very overworked . . .  to the point where it's very difficult for them to do their jobs well.
1	Most doctors are businessmen first and doctors second, meaning that medical practice has transitioned from a profession to a crass, me-first money making operation. Most of the docs I know care about caring, and serving the best interests of their patients; but I have to acknowledge that for more than a few docs, money matters a lot.
-1	My doctor has a certain style which inspires confidence.  I think this comes mostly from his actions resulting from many years of experience.  There's never a sense that he's following a mechanical flow chart, or reading from a textbook. 
-1	I don't trust any doctors.  I have had many problems in the past with many different doctors. They do not know have of what they think they know.
1	I have a relatively young doctor, who is usually very thorough, and very plain-spoken. I respect and appreciate these qualities, and he's never given me reason to doubt him.
1	I feel that although most physicians have a high degree of integrity, I would contend that one is ultimately responsible for one's own well being. That said, not all heath care professiols are beyond scrutiny. I myself have experienced one such doctor who was self serving and egregious in the care of his patients. 
-1	This would be doctors in general. While I had a few doctors I trusted completely (in another state), I currently don't have that trust established here. I don't like to fight what is the right type of birth control pill to take (one phase or several phases) and then getting a prescription for the wrong type anyway and having another battle.  That was only one instance and one doctor (who is no longer my doctor). I had other issues where I had to take a stand to make sure that my preferred treatment was even considered.  I am not talking about altertive remedies, but established treatments.
-1	If I didn't trust the doctor and did not believe in his or her abilities and commitment to patients, I wouldn't be seeing this doctor. The standard of care for pretty much any injury or illness is established by governing medical bodies based on scientific evidence. With some small variation pretty much every doctor will prescribe the same treatment under the same medical circumstances. If I trust modern medicine there is no grounds for distrusting the care my doctor suggests. Which doctor I go to is mainly a matter of my convenience and my persol perceptions.
-1	I have never been treated wrong by him.
-1	It's hard to trust a doctor these days with the amount of money that is involved it's more about money than people I'm afraid.   
-1	He comes into the room, asks me a couple of generic questions, and tries to get out of there in a hurry because he has other patients to deal with. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a means to his golf course membership. 
1	I do not have a primary care physician and avoid seeing doctors when at all possible. However, I do see a clinical psychologist at least weekly, and I trust her completely. She has been working with me for several years now, has been very helpful, and always seems to have her patients' interest first. She goes out of her way to be kind and respect who I am as a person. As for doctors in general, my experiences have been very mixed - some very caring and helpful, others very cold, disrespectful, and arrogant. With that being the case, when I do have to resort to seeing a doctor, I try to keep an open mind, but I also find that I try to gather as much pertinent information as possible before I go to an appointment, communicate the problem clearly (and ONLY the current problem, no extraneous information), and let them know what has worked for me in the past if I've had this issue before. I find it difficult to trust doctors who seem to have their own agenda - for instance, ones who insist on prescribing medications that I know are not really effective for me, or ones who treat every patient as though they're a drug addict (and there are a LOT of these doctors in our area).
-1	I like and trust my doctor, I've been a patient of his for several years. I trust his judgement and diagnosis although I also know sometimes doctors are just guessing. 
-1	I trust my physician because I believe they have no reason to lie to me about my health. They are paid professiols and they get paid to inform me about my health.
1	I trust the doctor because has has a long career and has been through many experiences in his practice.  He has not been sued for malpractice and he is still in business. In our relationship, he has not led me wrong and has always given helpful advise.
1	My doctor always takes his time to explain to me what is going on with my health. He is very caring and listens to my concerns.
1	I really trust my doctor because I have been with her for a long time and she has been with us for many health situations. I have a lot of friends who go to her as well, and they have nothing but good thigns to say. I feel like she really listens to us and knows her stuff.
-1	I wouldn't say that I have complete trust. They do what they can do. For anything that is beyond their scope of expertise, they send you to a specialist.
-1	I was feeling a lot of pain and other symptoms. I went to my primary doctor and she accused me of exaggerating. She also said that she is not some clinic to get pain pills from because she said I always complain about body pains and it is unlikely someone under 30 can be in so much pain. She still took my blood for sampling and as usual, it showed I had a high white blood cell count. She said I haven't been eating right and she gave me antibiotics. I went for a second opinion and was diagnosed with 2 autoimmune diseases that apparently would have been easy to spot if the other doctor listened closely to everything I kept telling her every time I went in so she could have gotten the proper tests.
1	I feel a primary care physician or doctor is trained and highly skilled in their area of expertise. I respect this, although I am cautious and will consult a second opinion if I think it is needed.
1	primary care physician is one of the best things that we can do to ensure better care for ourself. This is because we are likely to become more trusting of our doctor as we see one another over the years, so this can lead to better communication, consistent treatment compliance, and regular appointments. For these reasons, it is important to take the time to find a clinic and primary care physician that we trust.
-1	I trust my primary doctor because she attentively listen to what I have to say, and is willing to provide me with the latest treatments and how she arrived at her decision about any treatment that she feels will benefit me. I like that we engage in a dialogue that is therapeutic from both perspective. I feel that my doctor is being honest with me based on her abilities as a doctor
1	I've been going to him since I was fourteen, and he's seen everyone in my family for years. He asks about how we're doing, he makes sure we know exactly what's going on, and he is one of our friends. 
1	The doctors I've dealt with have all been upfront and straightforward with me about whatever condition I've had. They've never deceived me and I've had no reason to distrust them or the advice they've given.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he really cares about my health and well being. He is very patient, and informative. 
-1	I trust my doctor a greater deal. She has always provided with a ton information for all treatments. When I call with questions she is always very happy to help or research information for me.
-1	I mostly trust my doctor. I think though that physicians generally think people are not smart enough to really understand medical information so they over simplify information or leave out certain information. My doctor is somewhat like this.
-1	I'm the kind of person that likes to verify everything myself. It turns out my doctor has been right most of the time. A couple of times he's been wrong. But hey, nobody's perfect, which is why it's important to verify.
-1	I have been going to the same office for around sixteen years. I have been seeing my current doctor now for seven years.  Being overweight he has always told me smaller steps to start losing weight. He always listens and looks into whatever i bring to his attention. He will even demonstrate small exercises if need be. Overall he is a kind doctor who looks out for his patients. If its something that beyond him and his office he is quick to refer you to a doctor that meats his standards which are high
-1	I do not trust doctors in general. However, since I am not an expert in the field of medicine, there are times when I feel really sick and have to consult a doctor. In such situations, I try my best to ask all possible questions that I have about my illness and the course of action suggested by the doctor. Only if I am completely satisfied with the answers will I follow the advise given by the doctor. If I feel that the doctor is being dishonest, then I will either seek a second opinion (if I am very sick) or treat myself with home remedies.
-1	I usually feel like the doctor is busy and has a lot of things going on at once. Sometimes I get the impression they don't really listen. All in all I say I have to trust their advice but sometimes I feel they can be real impersol.
-1	I trust my doctor because I feel that he cares about me and wants to help me
1	My doctors is very qualified and professiol.  I am highly aware that my doctor knows far more than I do.  My doctor has educatiol experience in many areas that I do not. I trust my doctor's knowledge, experience and expertise in all medical situations concerning my health.
-1	"I distrust most of the medical community in general because they assume that they know more than their success rate would corroborate. Their procedures and treatments are more of an attack on the body, hence the 'negative side-effects"". They rely almost entirely upon laboratory ""medications"", while scoffing at most tural treatments. They're drug pimps for the pharmaceutical industry. Most pharmaceuticals are the result of back-engineering things found in ture that are free. However, you can't have a trillion dollar industry informing people that they can use tural altertives at a small fraction of the cost (if not freely) and that the altertives don't cause sty side-effects. The medical community is great for dealing with body parts, but they're failing miserably when it comes to actually curing diseases. They focus more on making the patient FEEL better while they still have the underlying condition."
1	My primary care physician is a very nice young woman and I have been to her several times over the past years.  She has always told me what is necessary and I have never sensed any dishonesty in speaking with her.  She has told me the truth about everything I have asked about. She also listens to what I told her I thought was the problem.  She has agreed with me on many occasions. She has referred me to another physician when she thought it was beyond her scope.  I have asked for prescriptions that I felt would be necessary for me and she has complied and agreed with me.  She is young and I feel she has the most current knowledge possible.  I have never looked at her as inexperienced.  She has always presented herself very professiol and she presents herself as very knowledgeable.  In conversations with her, she IS actually knowledgeable. 
1	I have been going to the same doctor for a good number of years.  He is always willing to sit and discuss with me and explain to be anything I am unsure of.
-1	I have seen many doctors that seem rushed when doing their jobs.
1	He seems direct about my choices. He has good eye contact and is calm, not holding back information. 
-1	He doesn't have a deep understanding of some issues, like mental health, but has some standard medications and advice that he shares. Even though there's some areas he could be better in, he's not one of those stubborn primary care doctors that have it in their heads that they know everything.
-1	For the most part I have trust in my doctor's decisions, but I don't have complete trust  in anybody except the Lord. I value the doctor's advice, but I would not follow him blindly and if I feel he is not right on something I would not hesitate to get a second opinion or other counsel. I weigh my own thoughts with what he tells me. 
-1	I primarily trust my primary doctor. She is super nice and always answers all of my questions thoroughly and takes time to explain whats going on. That builds the trust every time I see her.
1	I just my doctor due to the fact that any concerns I have had she would always look into it with all her testing to get to the source of the problems even if it took a second opinion from a specialist she would take it a step up. Also because once my doctor has results the treatment that would be given would actually help with whatever was my concern so that's why I trust because I see good outcomes. 
1	I trust my primary care physician as she takes the time to listen to all my concerns and gave me the proper advise which so far has been positive. She will tell me the pros and cons of the medication before prescribing it. 
-1	this is true most of the time that doctors care more about what is convenient to them so we should not completely trust them but not all doctors are same so my view is neutral.
-1	She  has always been  great .. answers any question I may have and askes question s I have never thought of.
1	I trust him because he has open communication and when I ask questions I get honest responses as well as way to be even more health and get better
-1	I believe that my doctor can be a bit hasty sometimes when its a busy day but I still trust his knowledge.  Consultations seem a bit short, but all in all I am typically out the door with a prescription that will  help me feel better and they always do.  I think when and if there is something of greater concern than a common cold,  he'll be more likely to spend more time to explain the condition and treatment.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to him for a long time. He always explains things to me in detail. He doesn't rush, or ignore my questions.
1	I generally trust my doctor because they have always led me in the right direction and provided me with the best information or options in respect to my situation. I still like to do my own research as to things they say or recommend to me, but I generally trust their initial assessments. I think most doctors do really care about their patients needs instead of what is just convenient for them.
-1	He is an expert.  He has practical experience.  He seems like a good person.
-1	I do trust my primary care physician because he is really care about his patients with heart, perhaps he has aged with a happy family. I never seen any patients is not satisfied with his services. He also has a lot of nice staffs at his clinic office. He always clearly explains and give the hard copy of your heath notes if you have any concerns.  
-1	I distrust physician because I am completely dependent on them to do the right thing or properly inform my about available or possible options
-1	The do not listen. My issues are important and they do not take them serious. It is annoying.
-1	I usually ask what I already know so there is nothing much to discuss.
1	I have gone to my primary care physician for a long time and he has always helped me get 'better'.  I have never been prescribed a medicine that has harmed me in any way, nor have I been prescribed a course of treatment that hindered my recovery.  
1	I trust my doctor because he shows genuine care for me. He goes above and beyond and he gives me all options to consider when i have to choose
-1	i have been with him for the longest time and i have never have any issues that i might have to second gues. if i did i usually ask him right then and there 
1	My doctor is trustful. My doctor does what is best for his patients.
-1	My doctor takes the time to explain things fully and answer any questions I have. He is receptive to what I think and asks many questions to get a full gauge of what is going on with me every time I see him.
-1	I trust that they understand what they're talking about. However, I sometimes wonder if the prescriptions and procedures are given out to make them the most money
-1	I think they sometimes can make mistakes as any person and it's not good to rely on just one person.
1	I have to trust the person I am trusting my life and future with. I cannot doubt their abilities. If for some reason I find I don't trust my doctor I find a new doctor. I have done it. I don't want to have to be concerned that my doctor does not have my best interest in mind.
-1	I trust my doctor because they know better than me, also i would know or feel if the doctor is not being honest with me. I have my wife to help me too or guide me. My primary care physician has been my doctor for years and he has helped me a lot on different things so I have built a trust for him.
-1	My regular doctor is great. She is not always available however, and then I question the replacements. 
1	He has never done anything to make me not trust him. I've always received good care from him.
1	each time i go to the doctor, she always explains things clearly. She gives me all the options I have to cure what ails me. If she does not know an answer she is not afraid to say it either. So I know she won't just make something up.
-1	they seem kind of crooked
-1	"I do not have ""complete trust"" in any human being as any person can make a mistake. I tend to trust my Physician because based upon experience this person has proven to be trustworthy and knowledgeable. Ultimately my health decisions are mine to make guided by the professional knowledge of a trusted Physician."
1	I have been going to my doctor for about 30 years.  He is also a personal friend of my husbands.  At the same time, he is a very conscientious and caring doctor so I trust that he has my best interest at heart.  He is also passionate about his profession and has been in practice for a long time so I am sure he is very knowledgeable.
-1	My doctor is a confident and intelligent person whom I respect. He is willing to here my thought s and opinions on my own health and but as I have cultivated a reputation of years with the man, I know that I can trust in his expertise. 
-1	I feel like I can mostly trust my physician. I have been seeing them for a while and I feel like he answers my questions efficiently and makes sure to go over what he prescribes for me
1	I really think that he tries to make the best decisions for my care. I generally place a good deal of trust in him. If I didn't trust him, I would look for another physician.
1	My doctor has always been open to questions and replies with swift honest answers.He is highly trained, caring and gives no reason for me to doubt him. he has also been my family doctor since 1998.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he takes time to listen to my problems and examines me thoroughly. He is also smart and empathetic.
1	I've had no reason to not trust him. He always explains things well to me. He doesn't do unnecessary tests and doesn't seem interest d in overbilling for things, just gets right to the point and gets me out of there. 
-1	This person seems to be pretty objective in their decisions. I don't see them as the kind of doctor to recommend a lot of unnecessary tests. They mostly seem to want what is good for me.
1	I think he is competent and knows what he is doing. He will be honest with me and let me know what the situation is. If something is out of his realm then he will refer me to a proper specialist.
-1	I trust my Dr. but I also research my options on my own. I believe the Dr. acts in my best interest but still may not know what is best for me. Is is always better to be informed.
-1	I cant say whether or not if i trust or distrust my  doctor. In all honesty it depends upon the situation at hand.
-1	I'm a person who needs a lot of information and completely capable of understanding complex medical research. If I think they are hedging or not giving me all the options, I'll find another doctor. If they explain and give me detailed information I trust them.
1	I trust physicians because they obviously don't want to make mistakes, since malpractice is so costly. They have an incentive to do the best they  can, although no one is perfect.
1	I had the same doctor growing up and for a few years into adulthood. When I became a nurse I started noticing that my doctor seemed to just want to get out of the room and didn't really seem to care much. I switched doctors several times before finding the one I am currently a patient of and he is amazing. He truly cares and takes time with each patient to provide the best care possible.
-1	I think that they listen to me and try to understand me. But sometimes I question the treatment they suggest. I don't know if it is the only one, best one or the most convenient for the medical practice one. I want to trust them, but I do have to watch out for myself too.
1	I trust my PCP because she takes the time to listen to me. She gives me all the options needed for different treatments and health remedies. She asks me before doing things instead of just telling me they are what I need to do
-1	The practice is very busy and he is late all the time. He shuffles a lot of things off to nurses. He seems to know his stuff, but he rushes through it often. It can also take a long time to get an appt or a refill.
-1	Doctors are human. They have their own interests like everyone else. So there is going to be bias in there decisions.
-1	Doctors and arrogant and a high percentage of them are sociopaths. They represent the pharmaceutical industry and they will deny their rx drug prescriptions caused anyone any harm. Doctors are unethical and dangerous as they put their ego and money ahead of the public's best interest. I stay away from them and hate most I have ever had the misfortune to come in contact with.  The only times I have gotten better from anything is when i have avoided or stopped going to allopathic doctors. 
-1	I have no doc at the moment.  In general I trust no one so everything is approached with skepticism
1	They have more knowledge and experience than I do so I do trust what they have to say. They took an oath to protect their patients and I believe that most try to follow trough on that oath. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because they always treat me with respect and care. When I get that type of respect from someone they earn my trust with their professional opinions.
1	I explained this in the other answer. They really answer my questions in detail. I also research my questions and have access to my medical records online. I also get printed information on my conditions and steps to take when I leave the doctor.
1	"He goes through each option, detail by detail, explains the pros and cons, prices and impact on my health. He often says ""Full disclosure, I benefit from people being RX'd this drug."" If I have suggestions from research, he takes those into consideration and allows me to participate in my care."
1	down to earth, admits when he doesnt know something, is more then helpful and up front
1	I have been seeing my primary doctor for over a decade. She is always willing to listen to my concerns, sets aside enough time to answer any questions I have, and is always willing to listen to any input I want to offer & make any needed modifications to any needed treatment accordingly. I trust her primarily because she has demonstrated, over a number of years, that she is trustworthy.
1	He is a smart guy. Been around for many years. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he treats me kindly.
1	My doctor appears to spend the time necessary to understand my conditions/concerns and address them. She is willing to admit when she does not know something and refers me to a specialist that can help. It probably helps that I am friends with one of her nurses (friends before I started seeing the doctor).
1	my doctor has always given me proper information and prescriptions to make me feel better and each time his remedies have worked for me
-1	I recently had a doctor inject me with a different medication than what I normally take, without ever informing me of this or obtaining my consent. It was a generic form of the medication, which I understand is apparently legal to do. I however find it extremely and highly unethical. I have switched doctors as of today. 
1	I have had the same doctor for 9 years and he has been nothing but a profession al and friend. He always diagnoses my correctly and prescribes the correct medicine. 
-1	They are human just like the rest of us. My doctor has his own best interests at heart when it comes right down to it. I'm sure that he tries his best to help me, but if my needs conflicted with his I'm sure he would take care of himself first. Nothing against him in particular; I just feel that is how everyone would act. 
-1	Wrote this in the other section but fits here better. They write down possible conditions and never tell me so I have to read it on my medical records to understand why they are asking me something.
-1	I don't see a doctor regularly. In fact, I haven't been to the doctor in 8 years. The reason for this is because the doctor seemed overly concerned with herself, made me feel horrible about myself, recommended a method of birth control that caused damage, didn't give adequate information about the medicine and was overall in a bad mood the whole time. After that visit I had a reduction in funds so I was not able to find a better doctor. Without health insurance, that is difficult. So I just never went back.
-1	My doctor just rushes through things, but i think she always goes with the best choice
1	He's been my doctor for years I know him outside of his work. I trust what he says but sometimes I don't want to follow his advice.
1	In regard to doctors in general, I feel that most put people first and are there because they generally care about people. I don't believe any doctor will intentionally mislead a patient, because I don't think any of them want to face the repercussions from doing so. Ultimately, if they don't treat their patients right, they won't be practicing much longer.
1	I trust my primary physician, I've had the same doctor since I was a child and they're always very thorough. We often spend quite a bit of time when an issue arises to ensure we're taking the proper steps to rectify the situation.  
1	These people have gone to years and years of schooling to get into their position. They just want o do what's best for the patient and don't want to risk their job for anything.
1	I really like my PCP. She's super nice and understanding. She explains everything really well and makes sure to focus on me while I'm there. She always asks how I'm doing and about non medical aspects of my life. I feel like she cares.
1	My primary care physician takes his time trying to find out what is wrong with me. He doesn't jump to a conclusion or pass me off as a customer. There have been a couple of situations that, I could see, kind of stumped him in diagnosing the cause. That made me feel more at ease then him coming to a decision/conclusion quickly. 
1	I have never had any problems with her since I have been seeing her. She always answers any questions I have and always makes sure I don't have any unanswered questions before leaving the office. She always checks everything to make sure she has diagnoised me correctly. 
1	I trust my primary care physician. He has never been wrong about any medical condition I have ever had. He always explains everything that he feels may be complicated to understand. He always answers all of my questions very thoroughly.
-1	I think I can trust any medical guys that I come in counter with, I haven't met any quacks yet In my life time.
1	My doctor has never gave me a reason not to trust her. She is kind and caring and upfront and honest. 
-1	"my doctor does not mention/discuss any real ""natural"" ways to help any kind of  medical issue I might have so I do my own research because I cannot trust that the dr. will give me any such information, instead just wanting to prescribe medications when it may possibly not be needed."
1	I have never had reason not to trust a doctor. This could be because I have always had pretty good health but event he small issues i have had were taken care of without problems or concerns.
-1	I do trust my doctor but you can never be too careful because at the end of the day with all the good intentions in the world if something goes wrong I'm the one it'll effect, I have to live with it. So I do trust my doctor but at the end of the day I'm responsible for taking care of myself. I think doctors in general are well intentioned and do the best they can in general.
1	He makes me help safe when I talk to him. I trust in this ability to give me anwsers when every I feel hopeless.
1	i trust my doctor because they know i'm a nurse and we are able to communicate in the same medical terms.
-1	My doctor is relatively young, but I feel like he has grown over the 5 or so years I've seen him. Professional growth is a good sign that he is at least trying. I don't trust him completely because I live in an area that the best professionals tend to avoid. I assume he is a bit of a reject. Also, how can you trust any doctor when most of them spend all of 6 minutes diagnosing you?
1	I have been with my doctor since I was 18 years old. He has never done unneeded testing, is quick to personally call me when I have questions instead of having a nurse do it. I had a medical scare in November, and he actually came to my house when my blood pressure sky rocketed to wait with me while my husband drove home. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he's young like myself and I think that he has my best interest at heart. He gets the times that we live in and he knows that many times you don't need a doctor you just need to trust yourself and body and exercise good judgement to ensure that I live as long as I possibly can. With the help of God of course.
1	I have had bad doctors in the past, I like the relationship i have with this doctor now, I totally trust him, not everyone graduates is good at their job but mine is, at least with me
-1	I don't see a reason not to trust them.
-1	One, as a physician I have seen many physicians make mistakes.  I have trained myself to be objective and results oriented (preferring clinical studies to opinion)..  I have also been privy to compassionate and caring physicians and those who are less so.
-1	I distrust doctors based on experience of them misdiagnosing me and telling me my issues are imagined. If they dont know about a rare disease they tend to often want to dismiss you. 
-1	"I trust him because he seems genuine in what he says and seems like he truly cares about my wellbeing. However, I can't say that I trust him ""completely"" because I have a bit of distrust in medical professionals and the healthcare industry in general."
-1	I usually trust my physician because they have no reason to lie to me.  They go based off of current medical information.  Sometimes I get frustrated when I know I need an antibiotic to help me but they refuse or dance around the issue.
-1	I trust him because he doesn't try to upsell me on anything and takes a very relaxed and practical approach to things.  For example, I need to lose about 30 pounds, instead of being hysterical, he suggested I aim for 1 pound a month.
-1	I do not trust them because they will just prescribe you with over the counter drugs that will end up killing the human body one day.
-1	For the most part I trust my primary care physician. But sometimes doctors make choices based on insurance issues, drug company promotion, and other things that are not always good for my general well being.
-1	Doctors now a days seem pre-occupied and kind just go through the motions of their job.   I am not sure my best interest is their main concern
-1	Most of the time, when I go visit my doctor, she is so busy that she spends a maximum of five minutes with me, looking at her clipboard, asking generic questions and then rushes out. I feel like I am not allowed to ask her questions in the off chance that I am inconveniencing her and her busy day. Makes me not really trust doctors and someimtes i feel like I am prescribed something for the sake of pharma companies tryign to seel patients drugs when we actually don't need them. I honestly dont like to be highly medicated but at times, it looks like docs are looking out for their own salaries and compensations at times. like this. 
1	I work with my doctor and I really like him. He is very good at listening and let me be apart of my treatment plan. 
1	I've been with my doctor a long time and he never sugarcoats anything he tells me. He is always honest about whatever aspect of my life is going to kill me. He's good.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because it is their job and they are supposed to be knowledgeable on the subject. They have tons of training and education and should be prepared. 
-1	I trust them because they know a lot about what they are doing and they care about the patients. They have the awareness to know how to take action
-1	I have established a relationship with my doctor over a few years, and find his advice to be pretty trustworthy for the most part. If I ask about other options, he is glad to take the time to talk to me. 
1	I trust my doctor because I believe he has my best interests in mind. I don't feel like I'm being taken advantage of or being talked down to. I think that everything is done with the patient's best interests in mind.
1	My doctor has little reason to lie to me, so I can trust in them to provide me with the proper care. I do question medications when I can, as I know that doctors receive kickbacks and things like that from companies. I try to make sure to use holistic methods when I can. Medications can be dangerous and harmful if you become addicted to them. I prefer to use natural methods when I can, so that I can avoid anything unnecessary.
-1	The few times I have seen her, she seems to hyper-focus on ONE issue, and almost overdoes it. She tries to quickly get me out of her office after dealing with that ONE issue only, even if I ave 2 or 3 medical issues that need to be dealt with. To get the appropriate care, I would need to go to separate visits for all my individual issues and needs.
-1	My urologist is a little young, so it was kind of scary trusting him with my goods. But he showed confidence in himself and it made me feel confident in him. 
1	I have noticed when I am more open and honest with them then in turn it allows them to understand my situation better and they will be more honest and willing to help me because I am not trying to hide anything as well as the relationship I develop with them I can sense they want to help me. 
-1	he is an okay physician. i dont visit him much but when i do, he does his job and asks me questions. he gives me prescriptions
1	I trust my doctor to be completely honest with me. They took an oath in medical school to help people and be truthful.  
1	I've never been given a reason to distrust him and I haven't been steered wrong yet so until that happens hes good in my book
-1	Waiting around for an hour and more in order to talk with a guy for a few minutes annoys me.  I know they're busy, but I hate feeling rushed.  I feel like just another patient file/number.
-1	I am pretty neutral in general to how a doctor acts or any motivations I am not seeing. Mostly, I just go when I need to. Get seen and checked on. Told what they think is wrong and then get the medication. If it works great. If it does not then back I go to see what could be the issue. 
-1	I think it would be foolish to completely trust a primary care physician. They are humans and make mistakes like the rest of us. If it's something important I will want a second opinion.
1	My primary care physician has always behaved very professionally with me. He is open to answering my questions and will explain things to me when necessary. I know he has had years of schooling and he is very knowledgeable.
-1	Some doctors seem more interested in selling extra products that I really don't need..Seems they just want the extra income.
-1	I have had this doctor for a long time.  She always takes time with me.  She wants what will be the best option for me.  I never feel rushed when I have an appointment.
1	I trust my doctor.  He has never lied to me, or seemed to push me in any direction.  He gives me the information that i need, and his opinion, and leaves the decisions up to me.
1	I think that he holds himself to high standards and has always showed me respect and understands me and is compassionate. He has never gave me any reason for me to not trust him. He is always honest and straight forward with me, and that is how I prefer it.
1	My doctor has never been wrong. She has always been honest with me, and she knows when I am not taking my medications like I should. She gets me the results of my blood test back in short order, and changes my prescriptions if I feel they are not working.
1	I have been with this group for some time now and I feel like they have alway took good care of me so I think I can trust what they are saying and doing for me and I have no reserves
-1	I generally trust them to do what is right and make me feel better in the end, although sometimes they only give me one option for moving forward, when I often feel like there are probably many options I have, but they just aren't telling me about it.  I think they only tell me the one that they think is right or best.
1	My primary care doctor has been helpful to me throughout my life and has always made a point to make sure that I am getting better. 
1	My primary care physician listens to my questions and concerns, explains her thought process about diagnosis, and works with me to resolve any lingering health issues (fortunately, I'm relatively healthy). She also has evening and weekend hours, so I appreciate her willingness to work around patients' schedules.
-1	My doctor takes the time to get to know me and my life. He will allow my to voice and problems or questions I have about my health. I would like to think that my doctor actually cares about me, because that is the impression I get. 
-1	being inj good health just doesn't need a lot of advice from a dr. treatments are a few pills a day and i feel fine
-1	I trust my doctors in general. I don't think there is any reason for a doctor to lie to me or try and deceive me. They may not always be the most attentive or take the most time to get to know what's wrong, but I don't think they're ever intentionally deceitful or anything like that.
-1	I've been going to the same doctor my whole life, and when I was younger it seemed like he knew what he was doing. Now that he's older, it seems like he just wants to get patients out of his office as quickly and as possible. Prescribe some medicine and you're good to go. I like not spending a lot of time in the doctor's office, but it does make me wonder if he actually knows what he's doing.
-1	They're not bad. They haven't given me a reason to distrust them and have been okay so far as far as I can tell.
-1	I have a new doctor. I am still learning about him. He is older and I trust him but I also pay attention. 
-1	My doctor is open with me and generally is able to answer all of my questions.  Though I feel like the doctor is always in a rush and doesn't explain things as fully as possible.
-1	I trust him to an extent, but not fully.  I believe he presents the options that are available to me honestly, but I would not trust him to make medical decisions on my behalf - in an important situation or when facing a problem I would want a second opinion, would want to do some research myself, would want to talk to other people about the situation, etc.  I also think my doctor, like many, is often more rushed for time and more concerned with getting to the next patient than I would like him to be.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has done nothing to lose that trust. He always explains why he recommends things
-1	I trust my doctor because this is his job and his expertise. He has a background and knowledge of the subject, so I am really in no place to second guess him. I can ask questions for further explaination or instruction
-1	I am a very careful person and consider myself to be well read. I ask questions and do research on my conditions and medications. 
-1	i've had a variety of different primary care physicians and this varies for all of them - but sometimes i do get the sense that they're not being very thorough or diligent and just wanting to see the next patient
-1	I do not have a stable primary care physician at this time.  With doctors in the past it generally seems as if they are just handling another number in line and waiting to get through to the next person and the person after that.  They generally don't seem to listen very well.  
-1	I trust my doctor because She is someone I have known for a long time and also knows my family.  This person has always had my best intentions and has always helped me to feel better when I was feeling ill.
-1	You  choose your doctor and put your faith in them.  If your relationship does not have trust, it will never last. That does not exclude, however, sometimes questioning your doctors decisions.  For that reason, it is important to have a place where you can always get a second opinion. 
-1	"She is very busy and quick and gives recommendations rather than talking to me and asking if I want a certain test or procedure. In general I prefer a less ""medical"" approach to health care than she does."
-1	I currently don't have a primary care doctor so it's hard for me to answer this question. When I do have a problem I will go to an expres clinic and I've had good and bad experiences. More good than bad. I try to put my trust in doctors but sometimes they are worried about getting people in and out of the room like cattle. 
-1	It can be hard to trust physician due to financial incentives they may or may not have. I often wonder if physicians have to do so many procedures, write so many prescriptions, etc. just to stay a float. 
-1	I trust my physician. She asks a lot of questions and always wants to know what works and what doesn't work for me. She offers medication and solutions.
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years now and we get along very well; both of us almost look forward to seeing one another. Also, her being a woman like myself helps with our rapport and my general comfort around her.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have always gotten a working solution for my problems. She asks many detailed questions to make sure she can understand what I am trying to describe and is able to come up with a valid diagnosis. She also provides me with all the information I need to know about my different diagnosis.
-1	I have a rare condition and itâs obvious my pcp does not know a whole lot about it. Also I feel like doctors are rushed and donât take the time to do the best care
1	I trust my doctor because he seems to know what he is doing and is always super friendly. It helps that we are friends outside of work too. I feel like I could go to him about anything and he will do what is best for me no matter what it takes.
1	I love my Doctor and have been seeing him for over 5 years. He is brutally honest with me about everything and is very blunt, which I love. I like to know everything about any diagnosis and he always tells me both the good and bad possibilities. It makes me feel confident in him because he isn't hiding anything.
1	I have known my primary care physician for a long long time now, and every time I get sick or I need help with a medical condition he is there for me, always knows what is going on and always helps me
1	My doctor helped cure the problems I had with my neck and shoulder for over a year and listened to everything I said and was very helpful in getting everything done. It was better than seeing other doctors I had seen before.
1	In general, I trust doctors to be highly skilled and highly knowledgeable in their practice. I do believe they genuinely care about helping others and want to look out for the best interests of their patients.
1	I feel that you can trust a doctor fairly well because the last thing they want is to cause you harm. For one they most likely would feel bad and morally wrong for hurting a patient. Also they do not want any law suits on their record or in their life at all.
1	my pcp seems to be very knowledge and takes her time whenever I visit with her. she does not push unnecessary tests and always takes the time to explain answers to any questions I may have. she gives me all the options for certain treatments and gives me her opinion on which is best but always leaves the final option up to be. I feel I can trust her and I have not been disappointed in the past
1	I have never had a major medical issue come up for me.  It's always something minor like a cold, sore throat, or something along those lines.  When I have taken my daughter to the doctor it is always for something minor as well.  Our doctors have always given great advice and the right prescriptions for our needs.  I have no reason not to trust them, but I know I  might feel different if I went to the doctor more often.
1	I don't have a primary care physician, but I trust doctors in general. I believe that they are extremely knowledgable in their field, and took on the job because they have the desire to help people. Therefore, I would say that I am very trusting of their advice.
-1	I would have to say more than anything I feel a doctor is there to rush me in and out. I don't go very often but I never feel like I'm truly heard. I wait for 30-45 minutes for 5 minutes with them saying exactly what I have already told them and them prescribing something. I feel like I should be able to see a doctor nearly instantly for a cold, flu, or something common so I can be in and out and not waste my time.
1	I generally trust doctors in telling me what's wrong with me based on my symptoms.  My trust wavers however when it comes to being prescribed medications.  I feel sometimes doctors prescribe stuff that isn't needed in order to make money off that prescription.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician because I believe that they are generally caring about me and their other patients. Times where I have had issues with my health my primary care physician has been able to effectively diagnose and treat my illnesses and return me to the state that I should be in. I don't necessarily find any reason to distrust my doctor as she has given me no reason to. 
-1	I mostly trust the physician. But some physicians are work for the salary period. This may be lead to patient's uncomfortable. Physicians has the high responsible for their patient. But some Physicians are not take care about the patient. Their only focus is to improve their financial stability.
-1	I would like my doctor to give me more attention when it comes to my concerns about my health. I would like him to explain things to me better so I can get a better understanding of my health,
-1	I trust my primary care physician due to his professional background and the number of testimonies I've heard from others regarding his experience and their visits with him. He made it a point to build up such a reputation, and one should admire that.
-1	My doctor can come across as very demeaning and curt.  I think this may be because the only appt times I can make are late in the day and he is tired.  Probably more interested in ending the work day and getting home than dealing with my issues.
1	I have no reason to distrust. He has answered every question I have had about myself and family members without sugar coating anything. He is very upfront and honest.
-1	I've had my primary care physician for a long time. I like him and he's never done me wrong in the past. We have a good relationship and I trust that if something were to go wrong he'd give me the best options and treatment. 
-1	I was on a medication for 7 years that I really did not need. I did some of my own research and asked my doctor about it, and she took me off of it. Ever since, I have had trouble trusting her. 
1	I trust her because she has been my doctor for a couple of years now, and has had enough talks with me and has given me enough tests to where I have developed that trust over the years.
1	Thus, far I have had mostly positive experiences with my primary care doctor. Everything I have been prescribed has usually worked well enough.
-1	I haven't been going to them for long so the trust isn't completely there yet. I imagine with more time and continued good treatment I will trust them a lot more.
-1	My neurologist prescribed me an anti-seizure medication -- I had not had any seizures while I have been taking the medicine. I trust a doctor until I have reason not to.
1	My primary care physician guided me through the hardest point in my life health wise when I had to be hospitalized for a colon condition. His advice was spot on through the entire ordeal and it was possible to make a fast recovery due to him. His guidance is what makes me trust him really no matter what.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough when I see her for visits. She allows me to ask as many questions as I like, and she really listens.
-1	I do not trust m primary care physician, nor do I trust doctors in general. I feel like no doctors really care about their patients, instead they only care about making money in this terrible for profit health care system we have here in the United States. 
-1	I have a medical problem right now that my doctor doesn't seem interested in figuring out. I think they dont really care
-1	I have had the same PCP for many years and we have an honest relationship.  I trust him to a certain extent only because he knows me and for the most part my habits and can best prescribe something for me if needed.
1	Doctors go through a lot of training and education to enter their careers, and there's a 100% chance that a doctor who is anywhere close to decent has more knowledge about health than I do.
1	i have had nothing but good experiences with my doctor and he has given me no reason whatsoever to mistrust him. He has taken the time to address any and all concerns that I have had.
-1	I trust my doctors in that they have education and experience in their fields whereas I do not.  However, I am a strong believer in advocating for yourself and getting second opinions and asking questions to be able to make the best choices for myself.
1	I've had the same doctor for the last three years. He seems pretty thorough and accomplishes everything that needs to be done during my visits. He's brought up tests I could do if I wanted to but doesn't push them on me.
-1	I don't think doctors get to where they are by being selfish and always looking out for themselves. Also, I believe people have an inherent good in them. So even if a doctor is having a bad day or something to that extent, I still think they will do their best to be helpful, answer questions, and get their patients back to normal health or to where they want to be health wise.
-1	I think it depends on the type of doctor, but on the whole, I trust doctors to prescribe medications and diagnose, but I also trust my own feelings about my body and what I need. So I usually pit the two against each other. 
-1	I generally trust them becuase of all the schooling they had plus i can easily verify if they are lying by doing a quick search online in about 5 minutes
-1	the doctor i have no is really not a big help. it seems like he is only in it for the number of patients he can handle in a day. he often has senior citizens so its hard for to relate to the mid age group. he has gotten so much botox that his face is tight looking like something off of tv i call him a rockstar. i feel like he doesnt really care and this is one of the reasons why i am going to be finding me a new doctor this year so i hope it will be soon
1	I trust my PCP because I have a long history with him. He asks appropriate questions to see how I am doing or feeling. I answer his questions honestly & never withhold any information that could affect my care or diagnosis.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I really think he acts in my best interests.  He is trained and more knowledgeable than I am in these areas and so I put my trust in him. 
1	I trust my doctor or doctor's in general because otherwise why would I even go to them in the first place and if I am unsure of my doctor's ethic ability I would question everything about them.  That just doesn't sound like a good idea for my own health and I would be way more stressed out.  I trust my doctor because to me it's the best option.
1	I trust my doctor to what is the right thing to do for me. He has treated me for so long and never done anything to misuse his trust. I feel confident he will make the best decisions for me and my long term health care. 
1	I think my doctor takes enough time to address my physical and mental health concerns. She takes the time to explain things to me and helps me to explore options if we do not have a solid answer for anything I am dealing with.
-1	My current physician has taken me very seriously and been open about all the options, however, past physicians have not at all
1	I trust my doctor because who else can I trust.  It leaves me no choice but to trust my doctor.  I can always decide later whether I believe it's a good advice or not.  
1	My doctor always explains things thoroughly and answers all of my questions. He explains the side effects of medications before prescribing them to me, and allows me to decide on what I believe would be the best treatment for myself
1	I trust my doctor because he is always upfront and honest. He takes the time to actually listen to my concerns and takes into consideration my opinions about my health. He works with me to get the kind of medicines that I also will approve of taking instead of giving me medicines that I believe are more dangerous for me to take. He seems very trustworthy and honest. 
1	Being a nurse has helped me see doctors in a different way. There are some doctors that have proved to me that I can trust them and there have also been some doctors that have been deceitful to their patients. If a doctor is honest with me and spends time talking to me then I can trust them. If I have a doctor that comes in the room and doesn't engage with me or sends his/her nurse in to talk to me, then I have less trust. 
1	I trust my doctor's ideas and decisions, but I also allow for the possibility of human error or the fact that she might not know everything about what I'm feeling to give the exact solution I need. Whether that be because I left out something important or because she or I forgot to ask certain questions. My doctor is great, experienced, and well meaning so I don't doubt her but I don't take her word as a complete final decision either.
-1	I like to think that most doctors know what they are doing and try to help patients and do what is right for them in their lives.
-1	sometimes things go well and other times things dont go well it just happens to be that this is how things have been lately
1	My doctor is always willing to listen to my concerns even when there are many patients out in the waiting, even though I try not to waste his time.
1	I really trust my doctor because I have been with him for over 15 years and nothing he has stated so far has been false. He has the best in mind for me and will be honest when I am not doing something correctly.
-1	For the most part, I trust my doctor.  He is the expert and knows what's best for me.  However, I know that doctor's are overworked and stretched thin.  I am sometimes wary that they do things that are quicker or easier.  
-1	i don't really go to the doctor that often as i am very healthy generally.  I don't feel any mistrust in my doctor but have little interaction at this time.  I would go if I needed help.
-1	as we know little about the health concerns we have no other choice than believing doctor as we can't take risk with our life
-1	I believe doctors in general do have the patients' interest at hurt and thus is why I trust my primary care physician.
-1	I do not trust my primary care doctor because he tells me that I can only present one problem I am having during a visit. I have chronic issues, and I only go into see the doctor once a year, because he doesn't order tests, or seem to take me seriously when I present a problem. So, in turn, I don't trust that my primary care doctor really cares about me, or my chronic problems, and I don't bother going in to take care of anything because he won't do anything to help me feel better. Wish I had better insurance, so I could find a doctor that was interested in helping me feel better.
1	I hardly ever see my physician, but during the times I have seen him, I feel like he listens to what I'm saying and has offered good suggestions.
-1	Recently discovered an enlarged thyroid.  My PCP ordered thyroid ultrasound but, did not order TSH level.  I had to call office and suggest this be ordered.  
1	My physician takes the time to listen and does not rush me when I visit. They ask many questions and answer any I may have
-1	I don't fully trust my doctors because they're fallible and because I don't know their jobs and therefore can't know if they're truly correct or not.  But that doesn't bother me tremendously because I feel like I'm the ultimate decider on medical decisions and I'm a full participant in getting medical care.  I use the doctor as a resource, but not the final authority.  They answer to me, so I scrutinize their decisions and judgments while still recognizing their knowledge and experience.
-1	I trust my primary care physician fully because he or she needs to build a relationship with one an other to gain the trust and to feel safe.It is important to trust them because they are smart about the information and always work in your best interest for you.
-1	To an extent I trust my physician but it seems as if she is always rushed and just trying to get people in and out as quick as possible. Somethings that seem worrisome to me are just dismissed and not thoroughly explained.
-1	I think that in general doctors have little incentive to be dishonest to patients. However, it is easy for people to have biases that influence them and effect trustworthiness, even if they meant to be honest.
-1	I have a hard time trusting doctors sometimes because some of them only seem to in it for the money and dont really have a personal care for helping people be healthy. 
1	Even doctors nowadays doubt the efficiency of healthcare system advising patients not to trust physicians âany more than you trust your stockbroker (if you are ... Maybe this is the reason why many doctors are complaining on their patient's behavior accusing them of being âdifficult, nasty, obnoxious .
-1	My physician does not hesitate to tell me if there is something I should or should not be doing in regards to my health. She is frank and open with me, and displays concern when evaluating the issues I have. She often seems rushed, however, so I occasionally have doubts about how thorough she it.
-1	I donât have a close relationship with them, so I donât know them personally cannot trust them completely. What if theyâre told to prescribe a certain drug? I never know if thatâs occuring. 
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, so I'd have to say the reason I don't trust doctors in general is because they always seem too busy to really listen to me, and are careful only to avoid malpractice suits.
-1	Seems like he is into giving out pills like he is influenced by drug sales. So could be conflict of interest there.
1	I generally trust doctors, their abilities, and intentions. My only source of distrust would come from them seeming too busy or distracted and making mistakes.
1	I've been with the same group of primary care physicians for over 20 years. While the doctors/PAs change, they are always knowledgeable, current, honest, have a good bedside manor and answer any and all questions I have about any conditions, treatment options or costs. 
1	I like her because she presents all options and treatments and pros and cons without biasing me towards them and she is open to conventional and non conventional treatments
-1	I trust doctors in general because they know the right things to do in order to improve your condition. They have the right response every single time.
-1	I have seen my doctor make mistakes before treating me. However, he is brilliant and helped keep my children healthy growing up so I give him credit. I feel as though he did overprescribe antibiotics for me, though, as I did end up with C-Diff in the hospital two years ago from prescriptions he wrote on my behalf.
-1	I do not go to my family doctor often but if I had a health condition that I needed to see him more frequently, my answer might change. Sometimes I feel like doctors are in a hurry to see their next patient that they do not see completely to my needs (which there are very few).
-1	I have been seeing my doctor for several years and she knows me.  She knows how my body reacts to certain drugs and other stimuli.  She believes what I tell her.  
1	I have seen a few doctors at this point in my life and have had various different experiences with different ones.  I feel confident in the intelligence, concern, and care this doctor exhibits.  He is willing to take time with me and answers any and all questions I have.
-1	"I trust my doctor because she shows genuine concern and often discusses options with me in regards to my treatment. I am only neutral on some issues because I feel that she is very busy, and often is trying to get through things quickly, or discredits certain things I report as ""just my anxiety"" since I have a medical history with it."
-1	I do trust my doctor, but I also realize how busy he is.  I have never experienced my doctor making a direct mistake relating to my health, but there have been instances when he was rushing a little.  When I am prescribed something, I always take the time to research the drug and its results/side effects before taking it myself.  I do have faith in his abilities, but will still take the time to do my own research.
1	My primary care doctor is a family friend. He has also been my doctor for over 20 years and that I am aware of he has never lead me in the wrong direction. He might tell me something and then I will look it up and it will be what he says so therefore I tend to believe him. If I do the things he tells me to do I usually feel better.
1	i trust doctors because they know more than i do. i do not know what is wrong with me, just that something is not right. they have gone to school and received training to be able to help me, so i try to trust that they will not lead me astray. I have had mostly good experiences with doctors in the past, so i cant complain
-1	I just think that most doctors just want to get done with one paitent and then move on to the next. I also don't think that they listen very attentatively when you tell them something that doesn't agree with their preconceptions of the person they think the patient is.
1	My doctor has taken the Hippocratic oath, and I have no doubt that he is looking out for my best interests at all times.  If I had a negro doctor, I might feel differently, but I have always found the orientals to be trustworthy
1	I trust my primary care condition because it feels like she really cares about my health. She asks a lot of questions about any problems I have and doesn't rush to meet her next patient. She's very thorough.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is the one who went to medical school and I am not, and because I am in good health after seeing her for medical problems. All my problems have always been resolved by going to the doctor so I have no reason not to trust her.
1	I have been with my family Dr. for almost 20 years now. I know that he has my best interest at heart. 
-1	I do trust that our primary care physician is capable of making proper decisions involving health care if they were to take the time to do so. Often, issues are misdiagnosed or overlooked because they are in a rush. The same goes for the doctors support system, such as office staff. Many times they are so busy that they overlook completing there tasks such as calling in prescriptions or referrals.
-1	My doctor does not half ass his way just to get a job done. He actually talks to me and makes sure that I understand what is going on and what I need to do. Most physicians will look out for their patients because they are under their care and their reputation is on the line. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel like that I can tell them what I need to tell them. I trust in what ever I need to say to the doc.
-1	I believe they are trying to do a good job but the problem is they are always over booked so you have to be your own advocate and try to understand your condition.  You should also ask questions you have in mind.  After all it is your own body and your own health.  
-1	I have two primary care physicians that work in the same facility. Generally, I trust them with my medical needs. I don't go in too often, so usually when I do go, there is a need for treatment. They are good at assessing the symptons and prescribing treatment. Occasionally, there was a need for follow up that wasn't taken care of but overall, I trust them.
1	She seems intelligent and puts a lot of thought into treatment. She researched my case before I see her and so I know that she cares and does what she can to give me the best advice.
-1	I feel that doctors are generally trustworthy. As human beings, they do have biases, and they do make mistakes, so it's important for patients to educate themselves, ask questions, and so on, but on average I feel people in the medical profession can be trusted to know how to do their jobs.
-1	I have confidence and trust in my PCM, but I also have to weigh his recommendations against my own philosophy of life, and compare his diagnosis to what I research online form other experts in the field.
-1	My primary care physician has proven himself to be reliable, knowledgeable, and if was unsure about something would admit it and find out the information. That is why I can trust him because he is willing to admit when he doesn't know and willing to find out the information. That how I know I have a good doctor because he doesn't have a god complex.
-1	He seems to know what he is talking about when it comes to my health. He does take the time to ask questions and does a thorough checkup. What I find that frustrates me is he never calls back and it is hard to get an appointment.
-1	I trust my primary care physician to a point.  I think that medicine can be trendy and when my primary reccomends a procedure or exam that I think is unecessay I usually go with my gut feeling.  I have not taken certain test ie colonostomy for example because I don't believe the risk however so small is worth the possible pay off.  This is a procedure that is now common but I feel unecessary in most cases.
1	I feel that even though doctors are busy and rushed, and can't always possibly have enough time in the day, or in general, to give you the individualized attention you seek, they still know you depend on them. They value the importance you place on them and what they can provide, and they have a moral code that they abide by to make sure they give the best care possible. I know that doctors are also capable of making mistakes, and some doctors are better than others, but it would be an impossible task oftentimes to be able to find a doctor that would be able to give you the best individualized care and information possible in a manageable timeframe. It often feels like it's not necessary, either, as in most cases, with most people's problems, most doctors will suffice.
-1	I have known my PCP since I was born. My parents really liked him, but I never was comfortable around him. At times he would send me for too many tests and other times he wouldn't send me enough. He never seemed to care about me, just what made him feel important. The Physician Assistants in his office are just as bad, if not worse. Just recently I switched my PCP and have an upcoming appointment with my new PCP 
-1	Sometimes doctors lie for their own benefit, it is bad but it is definitely true. I do not fully trust them
1	I trust my medical doctor because she is a person that has been there for me throughout my entire life and has always done everything that she can to make sure that I feel comfortable and get well as soon as possible. I know that I can ask my doctor questions about anything and everything and that she'll try her best to answer whatever it is that I want to know without any kind of hesitation. My doctor is someone that I feel will always have my best interests in mind.
-1	I changed to a new doctor last year. I have only seen him once. He seems professional and capable. On the whole, doctors have treated me effectively. But I still feel I need to ask lots of questions to make sure I understand what they are doing.
-1	I visit military clinics to see my primary care managers.  This means that they have no reason to mislead me.  However, they can sometimes be in a hurry to try and get to all their scheduled appointments on time.
1	He has been my primary care physician for my entire life. He has never let me down in the past so I have no reason to expect him to in the future. He is a reliable person overall.
-1	I have had a longstanding relationship with my primary physician. He is knowable, experienced, intelligent and open. I feel comfortable discussing my health with my doctor as he is patient, kind and wise. I do, on occasion disagree with my physician and in most cases feel comfortable letting him know of and why I might disagree with him. Some times I may not speak up, and I guess that goes somewhat under the category of distrust but all in all I do trust my doctor. As far as other doctors are concerned, my trust level is on a case to case basis.
-1	I haven't seen my doctor very often since I've been going to him for 2 years so it's hard for me to trust him. I have seen him 4 times in the 2 years. I don't know him very well, but from past experience, doctors in general don't know it all and are humans and make mistakes. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because first off, he always remembers me, even when I have not seen him in quite some time. He is very personable towards me and makes me feel comfortable. He allows me to express what I feel that I need before making his own professional recommendations.
-1	I trust my doctor. He knows much more than i do. Always explains everything, even if i don't ask. I don't think he cares more about what is convenient  for him
-1	"I generally trust my doctor to prescribe what's best for me, but not to the fullest. I have sometimes felt like I was being rushed out the door instead of them hearing me out all the way. I have an anxiety issue that comes with very frightening chest pains occasionally. I was seen for this problem and had all my labs done and my heart checked out which ruled out anything ""serious."" I was put on medication for anxiety and not really followed up with. I stopped and just did the research for myself on what's wrong with me since my doctor couldn't seem to figure out what it was beyond anxiety."
-1	Doctors are stuck within a system over which they have limited control. They have to consider the patient, the budget, and themselves.
1	My primary care physician has always been there for more over the years. I have been seeing him for almost 10 years now. He always cares about my well being and does everything he can to make sure I am in good physical and mental health.
-1	They spend so little time with patients that it's very tough to get to know a person's individual lifestyle and complete health profile. There is a lot of pressure to see many patients in a day which burdens doctors and leads them to rushed decisions.
1	I feel that he is well educated in his field and he very friendly.  I feel that he truly loves what he doing. I also just trust Kaiser to hire the best doctors.
-1	"i trust most doctors, it depends on how they 'deal"" with me. As long as theyre willing to answer questions and not rush you out."
-1	I just started going to a new primary care physician this summer.  I was very impressed.  She took 15-20 minutes to just sit down and get to know me and my health history.  She seemed very knowledgeable and was very easy to talk to.
1	I have the best doctor. Recently had the flu, saw the doc and got medication. After four days my doctor called me at eight at night to see how I was doing. He treats me like family and I admire him so much.
-1	I have a chronic illness. Most doctors are quick to say nothing is wrong or that its all in your head when they can't find anything upfront. Most doctors have told me this, and then my last doctor diagnosed me with Epstein Barr. I have recently started seeing a new doctor and I don't know how I feel about her yet.
-1	I feel that my doctor has my best intentions in mind. He helps me to feel better every day and prevents me from getting sick. I have full trust in  him.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician because she has been with my family for many years. She took over a practice from another older physician that helped my mother and needed to retire. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician sometimes because he's made mistakes, rushed to his own judgment, and said things to me that made me feel like he was looking out for himself rather than looking out for my needs. That said, I still use him because he's been willing to admit when he's wrong, correct his behavior, and move forward.
1	I trust my doctor since they have the ability to know and they have the perspective to know whats going on
1	I trust my doctor, although we have disagreed on the best treatment options in the past. I do not always think that a pill is the cure, while he tends to prescribe medications for everything. I do think he looks out for me though and has my interests in mind.
1	I have been working with her for a while so we've built up some level of trust. She seems very involved and concerned in my well being every time I meet with her. We go over all aspects of my care each time we meet, and she truly tries to help me solve the issues at hand. 
-1	I trust my family doctor. He has been working with myself and other family members for many years. I am an active, healthy individual, so when something is wrong, I trust him to provide and recommend treatment.
-1	They know what's best for me. Even if they aren't totally honest about the best course of action, they still more about these things than I do.
-1	She is open to new studies and information. She listens to me. She stays on top of new information as much as she can herself. She will consult with others. 
-1	My doctor seems like a sincere individual who would not do anything to intentionally harm me.  He also seems to enjoy his job and be highly qualified.  He does not get frustrated when you ask him questions, and always has an answer ready.  Nonetheless, if i had a serious medical issue, i would of course get a second or third opinion.  This isnt because i distrust my doctor, it is just because i feel it would be the smart thing to do.
1	My doctor has always taken the time to sit and talk with me about any concerns I have regardless of the time crunch on her part.  She will walk me through different steps to take and even calls days later to check in to see how we are doing.
1	I have been through a surgery with him and have had good results. He openly shares the good and the bad and the tough things.
1	my primary care physician is very direct and honest about all aspects of my health and well being. my primary care physician always takes the time to make sure that i know exactly what is going on and that i have all the information that i need, and that i know what all of my options are.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has always been open and honest with me. She listens to me carefully and is gentle and kind and patient with me. She's fairly young as well, which I like. She's not judgmental of me
-1	"I mainly distrust my primary care physician because about a year ago I was told I ""needed"" to get the HPV vaccine, which I declined after reading the side effects and there is no need for me to get it, I was left in the hospital room for 1 hour with ""reading materials"" on it and I had to go get my doctor so I could leave."
-1	I trust him because he talks to me like he really cares. He does everything with a computer so he is always looking at the screen to compare how I am at his visit and how I was at last visit. He keeps tabs on anything that has changed, he has warmed up personality wise over the years which is nice.
-1	I do not feel the doctors are very careful in doing exams. Sometimes they did not make the right dignosis.
1	I trust my primary care physician as they have been the primary for my entire life, he's a great doctor who is very understanding and always willing to listen and pitch multiple ways of dealing with whatever is ailing me. 
1	I have had a relationship with my primary care physician for many years.  Throughout those years I have never had a reason to question his care.  He is a straight shooter and tell you what you need to hear whether you want to hear it or not.
-1	I am woman who has given birth twice, i know what it is like to have a doctor want to induce labor because he will be on vacation on your due date. I have had nurses deny me crutches because they didn't believe my pain level. everyone is human, just because you work in the medical industry does not make you infallible.
-1	I think my doctor is well educated and has patients best interests at heart however I also think at time her own prejudices get in the way of effective treatment.
1	I've known for this doctor for years, and for the most part he has been quite helpful. Thereby, when he outlines a plan for me to follow, I generally follow it. There have mostly positive results. Thereby, increasing my trust in him. 
1	I have had the same primary care physician for quite some time. He is thorough, makes me feel comfortable, and is overall a great person. There's not a time when I'm at his office where I do not feel safe and at ease. He has never steered me in the wrong direction either. 
1	I generally trust my primary care physician because he is a friend of my family, and also my in laws. He asks how family is doing.  He is knowledgeable about any issues brought up, and is open to discussing all options available.  He is friendly and kind.  I don't feel that he is ever in a rush to get out of the appointment, and move on to other patients.
1	She takes a great interest in listening to my concerns and questions. She tells me that I am in charge and that she is here to help me make the best decisions. She lets me know that she is determined to help me get well. 
-1	I feel that many doctors are overworked and don't necessarily care about wellbeing of patients.  They are also at the mercy of insurance and pharmaceutical companies.  It is a sad day, because I remember when it was the other way around and doctors did what was best for their clients.
1	My experience with my primary care doctor has been positive. She has not tried to push unwanted medications on me and she tells me exactly what she is thinking.
-1	Regarding doctors in general (I haven't seen a primary care physician in many years), I feel like I can trust them somewhat. As I've gotten older though, I think I've become more skeptical about doctors, knowing that, for example, doctors get a higher kickback on certain drugs or treatments than others, so there is a benefit to them to get you to take a particular treatment option. I still trust doctors in diagnosis, but treatment I'm more skeptical. 
-1	Doctors want money and they often push information they are being paid for, like from pharmaceutical companies and whatnot. I really don't know if my doctor knows what is best for me because of all the alternative medications and practices I can read about online. I don't put too much into what my doctor says as they have limited information from their medical school studies.
-1	I am assigned a dr through the military and dont really have a choice. I advocate for myself and only see them when sick.
-1	I've had several physicians over the years.  Most of them have always been trustworthy.  For example, I was taking ambien for many years for insomnia, and because my doctor truly had my best interest, she stopped filling my script and we opted for a different drug that was less addictive.  I have developed a lot of trust with her.
-1	He has made errors before because I have a specific chronic illness and see a separate specialist who treats it. My GP has increased medications to a level that is harmful due to my illness, or prescribed meds or treatments that contradict or react with my other meds. He also put me on three medications to lower my blood pressure at once, which caused my bp to drop so low so quickly that I had seizures.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that we can have made a connection over the past five years. He always tells me how it is with my physical condition and any issues that may be occurring in my life when I visit him. He is thorough with explaining all of my vitals, my lab results, my physical activity, and my history. In addition, he lets me know when I should start doing something different in my eating habits such as eating less fatty and sugary food items. I also think he cares about me when he gives me a serious look and starts critiquing my lifestyle.  
-1	I do not currently have a primary care physician.  Doctors that I have visited in the past seem to get stuck on one particular notion and don't listen well to what I feel.  Additionally, they are not interested in whether or not I can afford the test they are prescribing.
-1	TRUST A LITTLE BECAUSE THEY ARE DOCTOR'S AND PRETTY SURE THEY DONT WANT TO BE SUED, SO THATS WHY I TRUST THEM. BUT SOMETIMES I DONT BECAUSE THEY JUST MIGHT BE DOING IT FOR THE MONEY.
1	I have to trust my doctor because who else would I turn to when I have a medical  problem. If I don't trust my doctor, I would never check if I have a terrible disease and I could possibly die because of that. Basically, I trust my doctor because of necessity. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician. I have been for years with this physician. Through his appointments, there is no real reason for anyone to have to distrust my primary care physician at any point in time.
1	I do not have a primary care physician, but I have been to the doctor a few times in the past couple of years. Every time I have gone, I have been treated with respect, and the doctor has been honest with me every single time. I have no reason to distrust doctors in general, based on past experiences I have had with doctors. I have always gotten better when following a doctor's advice.
1	My doctors saved my life and I don't believe that 99.99% of doctors would give their patients anything but their best advice and information.
-1	My primary care physician is very busy.  I know that he has many patients.   I think he is thorough and careful but sometimes he may miss something due to being busy.   There is always other patients waiting whenever I visit him.  I always feel a bit rushed.   
-1	I distrust my primary care physicial somewhat because their primary obligation might not be to me, but instead to their career and their financial obligations.  Plenty of doctors have plenty of lawyers to offset complications of medical errors and other eugenicidal malfeasance.
-1	I tend not to trust doctors in general to a great degree. I have list family members to negligent care from doctors. I myself have a rare cardiovascular condition that most local doctors don't know a great deal about and, more importantly, don't try to learn. I feel very afraid overall and cannot be reassured by local doctors because of that reason. I have already had one major heart attack with cardiac arrest so one would think they would pay attention. 
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for 7 years and still to this day have never seen him I have only seen the physician assistant.  She does a great job but I think its funny I have never seen him
1	My doctor is very thorough at explaining my different treatment options and also understands her limitations. After working with her for sometime to find treatment for my migraines she referred me to a specialist who was able to help.
-1	I have little trust in doctors because in me experience, they have been very money orientated. They schedule more and more appointments, not because they care about you, but how much your insurance will pay them for each visit.
-1	A doctor just does not have time to provide a high level of service to every patient, even if they are motivated to do so. They are also subject to fatigue, influence from drug manufacturers, and biases. Sometimes their knowledge can be outdated, if they are decades into their career, or too green, if they are brand new doctors. 
1	I trust my healthcare provider because I have been going to him for the past twenty plus some years. My doctors has always done what is best for me and never put his interest before my own health.
-1	Doctors in far to big of a hurry. If you get ten minutes with the doctor I think you did very well. I feel they just push through to get to the next person so they can make that money.
-1	Most doctors have the best in mind for you. I usually trust most doctors and because I can often understand what is going on, I can agree or disagree and understand rationale because of my health care background. Very rarely do I find a doctor that I don't trust at all, if at all. Sometimes they aren't the most thorough, but if I feel the need to tell them to assess something, I will. I keep open communication and talk with them frequently, especially in the patient room and clarify things that I don't understand or need more explanation. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he always listens to me and my concerns.  They have always been good at diagnosing and treating my illnesses.  They also make sure my prescriptions are always available for refills if necessary.
-1	Although currently I do not have a primary care provider, I have had many MANY throughout my 22 years of existence and there were so many that didn't know what the heck they were talking about. When I can go online and find medical documents from the actual US government along with WHO and the CDC to name a few, showing contradictory information to what I am told by a doctor, it starts to shake your faith in em. Then we also have to get into the deeper part of, do we trust the government? Do we trust WHO or the CDC? And if we do, should be believe them over our own doctors? Should we trust our doctors medical training was equal to or superior to the training of those that work for the government? Can we trust those workers even have credentials and how easily can that be faked or covered up? As you can see the reasons run very very deep and is much more than I care to type here.
1	My primary care physician takes the time not only to examine me for whatever I am there for, but also spends time asking questions of how things are going for me in general.  If she cannot answer a question I have she will refer me to the appropriate person.
-1	I have a new doctor that I do not know very well. She is very friendly and seems competent. However, I would still ask questions to be sure that the right decisions were bring made about my health. I would never just blindly trust my doctor without understanding the information.
1	We selected our primary care physician based on a recommendation from our daughter after we moved. We have been completely satisfied with the family practice (my wife and I have different doctors in the practice). From day one, I got along well with my physician. We bonded, I think, partly because I was teaching at his alma mater (after retiring from my full-time position elsewhere). He will lay out various treatment options in a fair and unbiased way and leave the decision to me. Have never ever felt rushed. He takes the time that is necessary and we also toss in a discussion of sports, which is fun and makes me feel very comfortable (especially compared to some snooty specialists I have met over the years).
1	My doctor is very sincere and always go to the point.  She was very helpful with a health problem I was having for months, do all the tests and then recommended all the procedures available and what she thinks was the best for me.  It was my decision base on the information she gave me about all the procedures, secondary effects and results.  
1	Ive seen my doctor for a long time, since I was a child, so I feel very comfortable in their choices and opinions. They have never let me down before so I dont see why they would now. They've always taken good care of me in guiding on the right path and being very transparent.
-1	I trust because he has been very effective in his diagnosis. His advises has always been for my better health. He is seriously concerned about my well being.If I have a medical problem, he always clearly makes me understand the situation in very simple layman language. 
-1	I trust the doctors to do what is best for me and to provide access to the right treatments, but I wish that everything is laid out and simplified.  I would like to just be told of the long term survival rates instead of having to wonder.  I hold myself back from that because i don't want to know.
-1	i trust my doctor he has always been there for me and let me know everything that i need to know and explains it to me so i understand it 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I can talk to them and they will be honest. However, they are still busy and will push me off if I let her.
-1	I do not have a primary care provider. i normally go to urgent care if I am sick or if I have an issue that needs to be addressed.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough and has helped me with a few medical problems that I've had. She is patient and kind.
-1	I just don't feel there is enough time. My MD books a lot of patients and is cognizant of the time and need to be quick. I don't often get a chance to sak all my questions.
1	They are my doctor and I do not believe that they would intentionally cause any harm. My doctor has a family and he seems to really care about people. I have no reason to not trust my doctor. 
-1	I have never had a reason not to trust my doctors.  I'd rather give them the benefit of the doubt.  
1	I see my nurse practitioner instead of my doctor as my primary care provider.  I trust health care providers that are intelligent and kind and I prefer to understand all aspects before engaging in care.
1	She is quick but thorough, makes sure to explain anything if I need her to, doesnât if I donât, tells me what I should/shouldnât do not what I have to do/not do.
-1	My doctor has never been judgemental with me when I'm in her office. She encourages frank and open conversations and she's been able to clarify several situations for me and always seems to be able to answer my questions or check on it if she doesn't know the answer. I really value that transparency. 
-1	I have been to many different doctors and a lot of them have told me that there have been things wrong with me that there were proven to not be. I was diagnosed with something then I went to a specialist that completely disproved the other doctors diagnosis. In my belief the doctor who originally diagnosed me was just trying to get more money from me and have me pay for treatment for a problem that I didnt even have.
1	With the info you give them and the info they have a round then you can stand back and trust then that they are looking out for you
-1	I don't really have a primary care physician but I did see an orthopedist last year.  I kind of felt that his wish to go through with the surgery made it more difficult for me to get him to talk about what my prognosis would be if I didn't have the surgery.
-1	Sometimes i feel doctors are so jaded by patients that they dont really take the time to listen and respond.
1	because mt dr tells me every detail and leaves nothing out. he is straight forward yet compassionate and carindg, and listens to all i say to hm
1	My current primary care doctor is the first to take my concerns seriously. He is doing everything he can for me so that we can find answers for the symptoms I have been experiencing. 
-1	I feel that doctors only want to run a lot of tests to make money or over fear of being sued. Doctors are normally very busy and rushed and do not give patients the time and care that they should. I am distrusting of doctors.
1	I trust my primary care physician because of how long i've known him. he's always welcoming and calming and i've he's always been honest with me and answered all of my questions.
-1	In terms of situations that aren't serious sometimes it would seem as though doctors may give a patient the runaround in order to make more money or help out other doctors or institutions.
-1	I don't trust my doctors decisions because he is always in a rush when he is visiting patients. He doesn't take the time to explain all my treatment options. When I tell him about symptoms that I have been feeling he doesn't do any tests or anything until months later. 
1	I trust him because of how long I have known him.  It has been so long and I have seen him so many times that the trust grew.  I know about his family and other things about him.  Plus since he has done many procedures on me and I am healthier because of them I trust him.  He has not let me down and is there for me when I need anything including just to talk.  He takes his time with me which is important.
-1	The main reasons I trust my primary care physician is because they have been trained to deal with health issues and give helpful advice. I would only distrust advice about medication with side effects.
-1	I trust somewhat because they are trying.  However, I think they are sometimes rushed and it is difficult to get appointments on time.  I think they try but sometimes are short staffed as well.
-1	Overall I think my primary care doctor is thoughtful and knowledgeable and wants what's best for me. I do think it could be possible that she might miss something that could be wrong and I also don't know that she has the time to stay up on all of the latest treatment options. 
1	I like her. I don't know her for very long but she follows up and does what she says she is going to do. She seems trustworthy so far. I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. She seems to care about her patients.
-1	I trust doctors to a point, i feel as if some doctors could use a bit more training and i do not always trust them.  All in all i do trust most doctors it just really depends on teh situation 
1	I've seen my doctor for over a decade now, and we get along great.  She's been a good help to me, and as far as I know has not ever guided me wrong.  I have no reason to doubt her. 
1	I trust my doctor at the VA because he is very thorough and if I don't ask enough or the right questions about things, he will start asking me relevant questions about what is going on with me. Things that I have complained about in the past, he will also cover with me to be sure that those issues have been addressed as well. Any test that is needed he will order and follow through to be sure that everything is up to date as needed.
-1	Sometimes I feel I want to trust what she says but other times I feel like she's not even aware of my problems. She tends to focus on things that don't need to be done versus helping me with my true problems. I feel she is overwhelmed with other things and patients and I am just a number on a chart and not a real person.  
-1	I trust her, though sometimes I think she rushes me through because I am very healthy.  However, on the whole, if I had a serious problem, I would absolutely trust her to give me the all the options and detail risks and concerns.
1	I trust my physician because they were the one able to get certain medical conditions under control while previous doctors have not. I have gotten better while under their care.
-1	People can have favorites, flavors, ideas and treatments. So someone can easily get into the routine of recommending a favorite treatments. Also, people can be out of date in their ideas. 
-1	Sometimes my doctor give medicine in cases that are unnecessary and set up for appointment after appointment for no reason.
-1	I think that a doctor can make mistakes and sometimes it is easier to hide it from the patient. I have family members that work in a hospital and I already heard many stories that makes me worried about it.
1	I have seen my primary care physician for over 15 years and he always treats me with kindness and respect.  He will take the time to explain things to me in detail and help me decide the best route to take in my care.  He never rushes the visit and this makes me feel I can trust that he has my best interest at heart.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing the same doctor for various things over several years. I have never received bad advice. I feel like he listens to my statements and questions. I feel like he makes informed and educated decisions about my health.
1	Mostly thinking of my pediatrician, but she has proven herself as knowledgable and deeply caring about our situation even though she is overwhelmed by other patients at the time.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he knows what he is doing, afterall, he did go to medical school. He has never given me a reason not to trust his judgement.
-1	I think that for the most part, my doctor will recommend what is best for me. However, there are times when the office is very busy. At those times, I do not always feel as though my doctor is fully listening and may be in too much of a hurry for me to feel confident in his recommendations.
-1	My physician sometimes waffles or backtracks, which causes me to suspect her judgment on occasion. She has more than once recommended a certain treatment and then at a follow-up exam, has made statements about the treatment which caused me to wonder whether she actually believed in it or not. I do realize that doctors are just people, and sometimes not even terribly intelligent or competent, so I've trained myself to expect not quite so much from them as others may. 
-1	I trust all the doctors because they graduated because of something, although there are some that do not give me good impression
-1	I think doctors treat all bodies like if they are the same. Just because you have heartburn doesn't mean all patients should get the same pill. Doctors should look deeper into what lifestyle changes they can make and maybe certain prescriptions work well for some but not all.
-1	In my many years of dealing with people I have never found one I really trust to any great extent, certainly not with my life.
-1	I recently had to change primary care doctor's because the one that had been my doctor for many years retired. The new doctor that I have does not seem that dependable. As a matter of fact, I am in the processing of finding a different one.
1	I don't see any reason not to trust him. He's a medical professional who's been to school and been in practice for many years. It's his job to know what he's talking about.
-1	SHE DOES NOT LISTEN TO ME. WANTS ME OUT THE DOOR AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. RELYS ON BLOOD WORK AND NOTHING ELSE IT SEEMS. I ASK HER QUESTIONS AND SHE WILL ANSWER A COUPLE, BUT THEN GET SIDE TRACKED EASY OR GET ME SIDE TRACKED SO THAT I DONT ASK THE QUESTIONS AGAIN.
1	I trust my primary care physician as I have gone to him for many years and he has always been honest and upfront about any problems or procedures that needed to be done.
-1	My doctor used to really care about her patients.  It seems as though her practice has gotten way too busy and now she doesn't take the time she used to with her patients.  This makes me distrust her a bit.
1	I think my doctor does an excellent job of listening to me and following up.  I went in describing symptoms that I did not think added up to anything. She immediately ordered bloodwork for me and we learned that I have hypothyroidism. My doctor appears to really pay attention and I trust that she is working toward my best interests.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor for the most part, He does what he can to help me when I come to him with a problem. But one time when I suspected I had a ear infection coming and he said it was my neck. Few days later I had an infection
1	"I use a NP as my primary physician. She is awesome. She spends more time with me than other Doc's do and I never feel ""rushed"" through an appointment. She gives me as much time as I need when I see her. "
-1	I know most doctors are in this career for themselves and they'll prescribe high paying medications to profit. There are plenty of times when a doctor tries to rush the patient so they can go from one to the next without a proper diagnosis.
-1	For the first few years I had full confidence in my primary care doctor. In the past year or two she has taken on many more new patients, and as a result she is harder to contact and schedule appointments with. She spends less time with me during my appointments and the conversation can sometimes be rushed. I feel like due to time constraints, she often forgets to tell me something, such as a treatment option or type of medication that could be helpful to me. Because of this, I have lost some confidence in her ability as a health care provider.
1	Iâve been seeing Dr Lewis for 11 years. Heâs very direct and to the point but also understanding and has compassion for what he does. 
-1	I don't trust my primary care physician because I never hear back from them about test results. Also because I always have to wait forever for her to come back and then feel rushed when she does come in. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he has the experience to heal me whenever I am sick. I am not as informed and train as him, so I trust him tremendously. Also, he can examine me through scans and prescribe medicines.
1	My doctor is always very thorough when I see him. I've never had any issues with him, like being misdiagnosed or given a medication that I reacted badly to. I've generally had a positive experience with my current primary care physician. I trust that he knows what he is doing. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I know him very well. He is more than just my physician, he is my friend. The decisions he makes are in my best interest. 
-1	It is easy to trust a doctor if they are willing to give you time to talk to them.  Many doctors are in and out so quickly that it's had to even get an impression of them.
1	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind at all times. I don't feel that I have ever experienced health care that had other intentions at heart. 
1	My primary care physician takes great care of me. She is attentive and remembers details and LISTENS to me. I have seen many other doctors whether walk-in or specialists who do not listen to what I say. If they do not listen to me, they can't possibly diagnose me correctly. If a doctor is dismissive or rude, I won't trust a word out of their mouth.I find a new doctor as soon as possible. Last year, I had a piece of my jaw come loose and fall out of my mouth (it was as horrible as it sounds), in the beginning it just hurt a lot, and I could see my bone through my gums. The male doctor I saw at the walk-in told me there was no way it was my jaw and I probably had a cankersore. I asked him to look and he glanced into my mouth without a flashlight. Yeah, I spat out a piece of my jaw a few weeks later after several appointments with an oral surgeon. 
1	I trust my doctor because I have known him for years, and he has cared for me the to the best of his ability.
1	I am a very health individual, so I do not go to the doctor's very often; but when I do her recommendations seem appropriate and well-thought out.
-1	I think he's okay; my main thing with him is he always wants to send me to a specialist. I know myself, I am not going to make 14 different appointments to get a PAP, a colonoscopy, a mammogram...it's just too much hassle. I would rather have all my health checkups done at one place. He does listen, but doesn't delve into things, like I take wellbutrin and I'm not sure that is the solution but he doesn't ask me about or recommend anything else. He's a nice guy, I'm just not overly enamored of him but it's too much work to find another Doctor. 
-1	"My current primary care physician worked in an ER. He still has the ""treat and street"" mentality. He will only go over any concern specific to what the appointment was originally scheduled for, and will not allow time to go over any new issues or concerns that I have. "
-1	They do not seem to listen to me often about what is wrong. Or think that family history of something is anything more than me being stupid and an huh strung
-1	I have very mixed feelings when it comes to this. I sometimes feel that they are genuinly worried about what is wrong when on the flipside I have had moments where I feel that they are just trying to make it through appoinmtnets or just make quick money. 
1	He has always been honest with me and tried to help me or sent me to someone who could help. He asks if I have questions and answers them. 
1	I trust my doctor because she goes the extra mile and has ordered tests be done just to be sure of something she thought. She has passion for what she does and has my health and well being as her top priority. 
-1	I lost trust in past doctor's because it became completely obvious that they had taken on too many patients and their time and attention lacked because of it. They started to care more about the money than anything else. I left that doctor and moved on to the one I am with now. I feel like she cares more about what I have to say, but she also kind of rushes through things. She just opened her practice so i'm afraid with time, she will get worse and not care as much anymore. Sometimes it seems like it really is all about the money with doctors. They are a few that really do care though. My kids' pediatrician is a great doctor and I wouldn't want them going anywhere else. I've met more doctors that didn't seem to care than doctors that really do seem to care. 
-1	He always seems busy and does not provide enough details face to face. Depending too much on his staff instead of providing personal care.
-1	It is someone that I have been seeing for quite some time.  If he does something wrong I think its just from lack of knowledge.  There isn't a lot of time to be spent with each patient.  
-1	I do not always trust physicians anymore.  I feel that money and profits are he incentive behind all medical care, and often treatments may be given that do not even help or are sure to fail just to collect the money.  I am beginning to wonder if things like cancer are just big money makers for doctors and hospitals, and there really is no desire for a cure.  I feel that now, more than ever, doctors are not curing people, they just are creating customers that have to come back repeatedly.  Every prescription drug has so many side affects, that other things go wrong with a person, and the doctor is profiting by prescribing certain drugs.  I could be wrong, but I am starting to feel this way.
-1	I believe that my primary physician is completely capable and competent to execute his duties well. I do not doubt my doctor's conclusions.
1	So far everything that my doctor has told me has been one hundred percent open. He hasn't hidden anything from me or told me half truths. I have a lot of trust in him and don't have any kind of doubts of what he tells me. I follow everything what he says. My doctor also answers any question I have, whether it be a dumb one or not. He always answers my questions to the fullest of his ability. I feel I can continue trusting him in dealing with my health. That is why I trust my doctor in whatever he tells me.
-1	I always trust my doctor. He has helped me deal with some very important health issues and always been so easy to recover. He is over all very very polite and very careful at my disorders.
1	i trust my primary care physician because when i see her she calls personally to give me my test results and after and before examinations she always asks a ton of questions about my health to make sure that I'm healthy and i understand everything she said and the things we discussed
-1	I have never really had a regular doctor, so I've never really gotten to know one very well. The doctor I have currently I like a great deal. I trust her decisions and she is very kind and explains things very well. I have only seen her a handful of times though.
1	I trust mu doctor because he is thorough.  He explains all the possibilities and potential consequences when making a diagnosis and offering treatment.  He then asks allows me to make the decision given the information presented.
1	My primary care physician has been very effective in treating my present health issues to such an extent that my condition has greatly improved in a remarkably short period of time. Of course, I played a role in following the instructions; it is, after all, a cooperative effort. Her guidance and approach has been first rate.
-1	I trust my doctor enough to be able to accociate basic common symptoms and figure out the a good approach to taking care of those symptoms. I do believe the pharmacist have a much better understanding the scripts that they write out.
1	I trust my doctor because I feel he knows much more about medical care than I.  If he doesn't have an answer to a medical problem he will send me to another doctor that can help me.
1	I always trust my doctor because there is no reason not to. She went to many years of school to do what she does, and she took an oath. She looks out for my health.
-1	For the most part I trust that my doctor has my best interest in mind.  But I also know that I am one of many patients for him.  He is often following the protocols that he has to follow and does not know me as well as I know myself.
-1	I trust my primary care physician, but not too much. I always try to get answers from multiple sources, so I never fully go with what one individual says.
-1	I have no reason to mot trust him. He has been p[en gentle kind and sesitive to my conditions. I have no doubts about my trust in him
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for 15 years.  Over this time I have built trust in his diagnosis and treatment options.
-1	I had a couple of negative experiences with doctors, but overall my experiences have been very positive. My doctor is very thorough, takes time to answer questions and discuss concerns, and never made me feel like I was being rushed, or like a number.
1	I love my Primary Care Physician. I had been to a ton of doctors and was miserable. I saw her twice and she figured out what had wrong with me for a long time. One medication completely changed my life. She saved me. I trust her completely. But doctors in general, I only half trust them. You never know when you get a screwy one. 
-1	I don't trust my current psychiatrist. I changed to him for the convenience of his location to my home as opposed to the 1/2 hour I spent trying to get to my other psychiatrist's office. So I changed doctor's for medication management. The doctor called my pharmacy, found out the medications I was currently on, and prescribed those to me. He does not ask me how I feel when I see him or anything really about my life like my last psychiatrist. I don't feel like I am anything other than an insurance payment to him. 
1	I trust my doctor completely because he has always been honest with me and always helped with any medical problems that come up. Also because you can call him at any time and he will come to the office to help any patient that needs it.
-1	While I do think that the current health care system puts too much importance on volume of patients seen per day, overall, doctors want to contribute to healing their patients and making sure they are as healthy as possible.
-1	I mostly trust my physician, but I also do my own research just in case anything went amiss, after all, it's our own body, and we should do most of the jobs taking care of it
-1	they don't really know much more than i do and they treat us all like commodities if they see one condition in one person and the same condition in another person they treat it like the same thing but it is not they are just humans.
-1	I feel slightly distrustful of them because they need to push certain diagnosis and drugs and are overworked and overbooked.
-1	Doctors only know what they are taught and rarely, in my experiences, actually do more research.  As a result, I dont have much trust in drs.
-1	I trust my doctor because she genuinely seems like a good person, based on my past interactions with her. Though, between you and me, I wish she'd check my man parts during physicals like my old male doctor did.
-1	Well in general I do not trust people. But overall I trust what he is saying. I will get a prescription if I must on his recommendation. I will go see him from time to time to check up. But I don't believe everything sometimes I take my own advice as well.
-1	Thus far the recommendations of my Dr.(s) have been a positive and appropriate. I had a condition a few years ago and my OB-GYN recommended I start a daily medication. I don't like to take medications if I can avoid it but after following his advise my health improved and I have not had any problems with this condition in 2 years. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that she takes her position seriously and tries her best to make thoughtful and accurate diagnosis's. 
-1	I generally don't trust people, but my primary care doctor seems pretty trustworthy. She tells it straight up and that's important to me.
-1	Most doctors have a patients best interest at heart but many have become nothing but car sales man that deal out drugs because of kickbacks and free samples
1	She is very kind.  She is able and willing to answer any questions that I might have about my care.  She has never hesitated to tell me the truth about what is going on, and does it in a way that makes me feel as comfortable as possible.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough. She runs extensive tests when needed and rules out the worst possible scenario first. She takes time to talk with me, explain things and answer questions.
1	I expect most doctors, especially ones I have carefully chosen to see, to be an expert in their field, to know what they are talking about. Most people go into situations thinking this about doctors. I am generally trusting of the doctors that I see, unless they give me reasons to not think this.
1	I have a new Dr. He has been very thorough to let me know that I have his time and will be upfront and honest when it comes to my medical needs. 
-1	I do trust my health care provider enough to hear their advice and opinions, but i truly like to do some added research based off the doctors suggestions to feel more secure in my choice/decision 
-1	I don't have a PCP. I  have no insurance so I have to visit clinics and see different nurses, almost never a doctor. I can't think of a time I've seen a doctor. I generally trust the nurses because the conditions I've had are fairly simple to treat. I went in knowing I needed some kind of antibiotic so it was easy to trust the diagnosis. 
1	For the most part I trust my primary care doctor. Sometimes I feel like she is guessing and not really making an effort to help my situation. It seems like a lot of trial and error. I trust that she is getting the most current information to pass along to me. She is usually quick to respond to message also.
-1	My mother is a doctor. I love my mother very much, but I realize that doctors aren't magicians, and they are very much people too. I see her run short on patience for her patients---I see how things like drug seeking behaviour make her suspicious of many patients. I think many doctors probably feel this way, and it makes me wary of trusting them. 
-1	EVERY altercation I have had with a doctor, I have felt like they aren't really listening to me. They will look at their clip board and nod their head and stuff, but not actually hear what I'm saying. If they ask me a question and I don't answer it the way they think, they will say I'm lying. I dislike Doctors so much because they ALL just do the bare minimum and don't treat people like humans, but as another task before lunch break. 
-1	They are highly educated so I trust them, however, anyone can have a bad day where they don't do their jobs well.  Doctors are no exception to these rules.  They some times are going to make bad calls and so I can't 100% trust any doctor.
1	I have no reason to believe that they do not care about their work and patients. There would be no reason for them to choose such a demanding career if they did not care. They also would have no reason to self sabotage their career. 
-1	sometimes he seems like he does not listen to me, he is kind of quirky and i call him spaceman. i tell him something and he goes on to the next subject like he did not hear what i said.
-1	I don't think that my doctor hears what I am saying all of the time.  I also feel like the answer to everything with him is a new medication.  I would prefer to try and solve health issues without medication first.
-1	I distrust my primary care physician because I have gone to them before about an issue and they could not give me any answers, years later I went to a specialist and they were able to tell me what it was immediately. I kind of think my doctor is incompetent and doesn't care for me much. I also think a lot of doctors are just there to make money and only recommend medications that sponsor them. 
-1	I feel like doctors don't treat you as a person, they treat you by how they judge you when you first come in. They already have you figured out and they won't listen to you no matter what they say. 
-1	A primary care physician is a physician who provides both the first contact for a person with an undiagnosed health concern as well as continuing care of varied medical conditions, not limited by cause, organ system, or diagnosis. Since recently, the term is primarily used in the United States. In the past in the US and still in the United Kingdom (and in many other English-speaking countries), the equivalent term was/is general practitioner.
1	I trust my primary physician because I've seen him ever since I was an early teenager. He knows me very well and a lot of my habits both good and bad. He was critical in getting through high school and college with all the necessary vaccines and STD prevention tools, and has always been very open and engaging. It's almost like talking to an old friend where you feel like you can be yourself and open. This really helps in getting across to each other better, and allows him to more easily attune his prescriptions and medical diagnosis' to my situations. I think a lot of people tend to see their doctor as just a means to get medication when they need it, but I think a lot of people fail to realize just how beneficial it can be to have a doctor you trust and is willing to go that extra mile to help you.
1	I've had the same doctor for 16 years, and so far he hasn't given me any reason not to trust him. I have been extremely healthy for all of those years too though so he hasn't had much of a chance to be wrong. Overall I'm comfortable with him, and feel like he does a good job.
-1	My PCP is too nonchalant about my medical conditions and has ignored my high blood pressure in multiple appointments. He is also fat and diabetic, so...
-1	I'm a skeptic by nature, and I know that human beings are prone to making mistakes. However, I trust that my primary physician's medical knowledge is much better than my own, so I respect his judgement and analysis. As with anything, I like evidence and data-based reasons to believe and trust things. As long as he can provide that to me, I'm likely to trust more. Otherwise, I remain skeptical by nature. Even so, I am likely to take his advice even if I disagree with it, if it may end up benefiting me, and the risk is low. If it's a matter of life and death and I don't like his judgement, I may try to find a second or third opinion.
1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEY HAVE MORE ACKNOWLEDGES AND MORE EXPERIENCES. I THINK THEY WILL DO THEIR BEST TO HELP ME GET BETTER HEALTH.
1	I have had nothing but a stellar experience for 8 years with my primary doctor.She has gone above and beyond her duties when I have concerns, I completely trust her.
-1	When talking to others about their experiences with their primary care physician, I know mine is better. My doctor takes what I say seriously and examines them. She makes sure that I take all the necessary tests and she scolds me when she feels that I am not taking my health seriously. I told her that I was having chest pains but that it is probably anxiety or heartburn. She made me that an EKG and based on those results, an ultrasound.
1	I have had no problems in the past with my doctor. He has always been straight forward with me and laid out the different options I have for dealing with medical issues.
1	I have been seeing my GP for nearly twenty years, and I feel like we have a good rapport with each other. I can ask questions and offer theories and she gives them serious consideration because she knows that I am self-aware, and that I'm not not dramatic or prone to exaggeration.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to her for years and so has other members of my family. She has always given me the medical advice that I need and I trust her to do what is best for me. She is always open to any questions that I have and is able to explain things that I may not understand. If I happen to not understand she has no problem giving me more info. She tells me if I have any questions to not hesitate to call her. That puts me at ease if I need to call again for anything follow up questions she is there and if she is not there is always another doctor or nurse to help me,
1	I trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable about my conditions.  She's also a great listener and asks me thorough questions to get to the bottom of things.  I've never had a problem with her, nor have I been given any reason  not to trust her.  She gets my input before all procedures.
-1	Doctor are human. As human beings, they have their own personalities and agendas that are not entirely conducive to another persons needs or health. Therefore, their actions and advice require some consideration in the larger picture. One must take responsibility for one's health regardless of another person's opinion of your health. I guess we should all be doctors for our own sake...whether we like it or not.
1	I trust my doctor because he is not too quick to prescribe drugs.  If there is a natural approach to fix the problem he will give safe suggestions to try before encouraging a drug fix to the problem.  And what he has suggested has worked for the most part.
1	I think they tell me my options. I rely on their experience. I have rare skin disease so most doctor's don't know much about it. I can tell by their responses if I  trust them. Example - some admit they don't  know about my condition, while some try to suggest something I know doesnât work.
-1	I really dont trust them because they never give natural remedies. They always go straight to medicine which is not good for your body. 
-1	I don't en general trust very many doctors, too often they are misdiagnosing or diagnosing based on getting paid from drug companies. I don't want unnecessary treatments or drugs. 
-1	A few years ago, my mother's former cardiologist recommended that she have open heart surgery based on faulty results of an echo cardiogram. He was also not truthful about the surgical options available either. We confirmed this first through internet research, then with a leading heart surgeon at a highly-rated cardiac hospital. The end result was that my mother did not need heart surgery at all and after twice-yearly echo cardiograms with a different cardiologist, still does not require it. I have less drastic but similar experiences in the past with doctors. Unfortunately this has given me a healthy amount of distrust for what I'm initially told. I will always research topics myself, ask many questions and seek 2nd opinions.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor, but I know that she doesn't know how to deal with my real life problems.  She keeps telling me to go to a counselor, but when that is not an option for your patient, you have to have other options available to them.  She has not been able to help me beyond the basic physical ailments I have.  She is not any help emotionally or able to advise me where I can get the kind of help she thinks I need.  It's a weird situation. 
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been going to her for almost ten years. She usually takes the time to explain things to me and make sure I am comfortable with the decisions that we make.
-1	I trust my physician because he has been my primary doctor for many years. He listens to me and doesn't judge me regardless of my habits. He always tries to provide the best guidance possible.
-1	Doctors are people too, typically I believe they are trustworthy and what they say is knowledgeable but they can still have areas where they do not know much about, like nutrition. Also, doctors are heavily lobbied by pharmacy reps to peddle their product.
-1	i suspect that doctors in general are influenced by financial interests when recommending treatment options and prescribing medication. i also suspect that many doctors make assumptions without thorough examination sometimes because of heavy workloads or personal bias.
-1	I havw a new pcp because my old pcp misdiagnosed me. She did this with a couple different things. One being hep b and hep a. I do not have and she said i did. New pcp is more of a doctor feel good, meaning he prescribes anything you ask for. I feel like he just goes through ths motions. I dont trust him completely.
1	My doctor has always shown care and concern for me. She has never once brushed aside my feelings or acted as if I was stupid. She has always taken time to answer my questions. 
1	My primary care physician never makes me feel rushed when I have an appointment. She listens to my concerns and always asks if I have questions. I believe she is intelligent and keeps up with new developments in medicine.
-1	For the most part, I trust her because she is a doctor and hasn't given me reason not to yet. However... we did just switch doctors and have only seen our current doctor twice. We had to switch due to insurance coverage, but our previous doctor I had been with for 5 years and trusted completely. I hope to develop the same relationship with our current family doctor.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is kind and competent. They care about me and my health. They are concerned about any issues I have. We have good communication between us as well. She is also very concerned about other parts of my life as well.
-1	I think they have a lot of experience. My primary care giver was in a management position at a hospital in the past so I have confidence that they will do their best to look out for me.
-1	Just a level a trust is built up when you see the same doctor for many years and he has always solved problems presented to him. My doctor has been the same my entire life. He even saw my parents when they were younger. I'm fortunate to never have experienced serious medical problems but if I did then I would trust him as getting me on the right track to getting better.
-1	I trust most of what my doctor says unless I detect that she is in a rush to get me out of there. I always do my own research to learn different options and to learn about meds before I take them.
1	I have seen my primary care physician for a few years now, and have only seen my health improve during this time. I have had no reason to distrust her or feel that her opinions of me are biased in any way. She has always been open to any questions I have, and has been willing to look at a variety of options for medical issues that I have had, and adjust things based on how I feel. She'll check in to make sure that I've followed up with other appointments as necessary, and I just generally tend to feel that she really cares about her patients. I don't feel like I'm in a rush, and she always treats me like a person, not just part of her job, which I appreciate. I've also looked online and she's had good ratings from other people, as well as working with a highly rated medical group that other members of my family have gone to as well. I feel like she has the resources available to help with any treatment I may need, and has utilized them in the past when she thought some other specialist may be of more help than she is. Prior to this, I didn't have good experiences with doctors. They tended not to listen to my problems, and were quick to make assumptions. In one case, a doctor refused to listen to the fact that I believed I was allergic to a medication I was taking, and I actually ended up in the ER. This current doctor is the first one that I feel listens and is actually willing to help with any issues that I have come up.
-1	There is a hidden agenda in the medical practice in which medications are pushed for revenue, this is not necessarily a bad thing but it does make one accept most pill-based medications with a grain of salt.
-1	I always find that I have to do more research about different treatments for any ailments I might have.  I don't find that my doctor spends enough time talking to me about choices of medications or options for treatments.  I always feel rushed and that my doctor is not confident enough to recommend any treatments or anything to me regarding my health.
-1	I like my physician for yearly check ups...but have not had a thorough examination from her after 2 years.  I have very few reasons to see her outside that, but I did disagree with her on one Rx and told her I would not take it. She was fair and said it was my decision, but I am free to question if I don't agree with her. 
-1	My seemingly distrust for most doctors comes from experiences of people that are close to me. I've seen doctors misdiagnose or treat for wrong illnesses way too often. I've also seen and heard about them prescribing medicine that was unnecessary.
1	"Hard to comment on doctors in general, since I believe a lot of them don't do a lot of research on drugs and were not trained in preventative care outside of ""take this pill."" I try to seek out physicians who are also trained in natural care and prevention. My primary care doctor is Chinese with both a Chinese and US medical degree, but very unconventional. I trust what he says because my overall heath and well being has actually improved. I am 71 with very little degenerative arthritis, normal blood sugar/cholesterol and plaque-free carotid arteries. So I do trust him and the other health specialists that I see"
-1	I know that my primary care physician is qualified to do his job, as he has gone through the necessary schooling and training to gain the expertise for his position. However, I also realize that medicinal knowledge is vast, and that doctors only see me for a few minutes and therefore do not have the deep analytical insight that would make me fully trust them.
-1	I have repeatedly had issues (not serious) that were not helped by my doctor. I ended up figuring out what would help me, and I got better using alternative or holistic things that completely cleared the issue. I have also been repeatedly prescribed medicine that had severe side effects or addictive qualities, and was not told about it. Because I read - a LOT - I declined to take the meds because of this.
1	My doctor is very willing to spend extra time with me discussing things that I am unclear on or need extra help with. I am able to ask about alternative treatments or additional ideas on how to get better when I am sick or injured. He listens without judgement and shows that he cares.
-1	I tend to be trusting of my primary care physician because he seems very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. It seems like he is genuinely interested in trying to help people. Not just get them in an out.
-1	I trust my primary care physician but sometimes they are so quick in seeing me that I worry about not getting all the care I actually need.
-1	I trust my doctor and have a lot of faith in her. I like it that she is a primary care as well as internist.
-1	I dont feel like my doctor wants to talk for too long. Just that they think everything is ok or not. They do provide options for allergies though.
1	I trust my doctors because  they know more than I do about the situation, and if I express concern they explain the thinking process and differentials that they are concerned about allowing them to reach the conclusions that they do. 
-1	My previous doctor let this practice and the partner is now my doctor.  As far as I know he is dependable but I haven't actually seen him for anything.  I see a nurse practitioner when I go there and she is very nice and helpful.  The office is nice and professional so I am assuming the doctor is similar to the other characteristics of the office.
-1	In my experywith him he never made any decision or recommended any medical decision that was not for my best
-1	I only see my primary care doctor briefly, once per year for a physical. I feel she is polite and knowledgeable, but that she is often dismissive of my concerns. I trust medical professionals who I see on a more regular basis, such as my chiropractor, because they are exposed to me more frequently. I also recently went to urgent care for a matter that my doctor dismissed and received more effective treatment from urgent care. 
-1	I trust my doctor in that he listens to my concerns and takes my suggestions into consideration. He is a newer doctor to me and knows I have been dealing with certain heath issues for a while.
-1	One primary reason I have lost trust in my PCP is the fact that I have had surgery for the same reason twice now within three years and really need it again.  I went to an emergency room and the physician there asked me why I had to have the same surgery so close together and I couldn't tell him.  He mentioned that it was unusual for that type of surgery.  This made me contemplate a new option when I go back for the same reason.
-1	My new doctor is usually very good so I trust him well. However, I feel that doctors in general tend to push certain drugs  even when there are better options available. For instance I have asthma and my doctor pushed a certain inhaler that was more expensive than a cheaper, better option.
-1	"I have a lot of medical conditions that I've had most of my life, but I have overlooked because my parents told me they were normal. They were not. Now that I'm talking to my doctor about them I feel as though he thinks I'm a hypochondriac and doesn't take me seriously. I've had chronic soreness my entire life. He doesn't believe me. There are a few conditions that are more ""modern"" that he just doesn't believe in. "
1	My primary care physician treats me as a person she knows and about my well being physically spiritually emotionally and psychology.  She is very calm but direct and thoughtful. 
-1	My primary physician is fine.  But after my health catastrophe experience, where I had one of the TOP DOCs in the country and refused to do what he recommended, to my everlasting satisfaction, while my wife stood beside and cried, begging me to do what he told me to, I don't trust doctors further than I can throw them.
-1	I know that he is very busy with a lot of patients, so maybe he just jumps to a treatment that  he thinks might work. For instance, I used to have a lot of digestive issues and such, and I don't think he asked once what my diet was like. Instead, he put me on pills for depression. Don't get me wrong, I needed those as well, but looking back, I think diet had a lot to do with it as well.
-1	I have been with them through multiple appointments and issues. He looks out for what is the best for me, and I trust him and his diagnosis. He has soothed my worries and worked to make sure I am helahty. I have complete trust
-1	In general, I trust the profession but physicians are people - they can make mistakes and they may not always interpret symptoms correctly.   The more you interact, the higher the trust level can become.
1	I trust this doctor completely.  She makes sure we get to the bottom of any problems that I am having.  She also like to rule out possibilities when faced with certain symptoms.  She is very caring, kind and listens to what I have to say.  She doesn't talk to me like I'm a child.  She explains everything. 
1	My doctor is honest and open with me. He seems to provide all options regarding care and doesn't refrain from telling me things that may be difficult for me to hear. 
1	My doctor has been my primary care physician for over 20 years. Sometimes, she does seem to rush, but not often. She's been there for me through illnesses and injuries and always taken care of me.
-1	My doctors will take the time to research a problem if they're not familiar with it.  They always make sure that I have all the information needed to make an informed decision about any medical conditions that come up. I go to a doctor's office that has multiple doctors in it and don't always see the same one, so it's important to me that they look over my records and are basically on the same page as far as any care is concerned.  We live in a rural area and the doctors communicate with each other in a thorough manner.  When you are referred to a specialist they always get complete information on your condition which saves time for all parties involved.  
-1	I don't have a primary car physician.  I haven't had one in over a decade.  My doctor left the practice and I was switched to someone else without my knowledge or opinion and then they moved to a different location and 'lost' me as a patient and wasn't accepting new patients.  I've always left appointments feeling like I'd been let down in my interactions with doctors.  
-1	I trust my doctor to an extent because she has her own motives as well. Sometimes nothing is wrong  but she is addresses it because she wants the additional money, something she admitted to my husband who works in her office. So, I feel that all doctors probably think the same way. So, I could be worrying about an issue because my doctor, who already gets paid very well, wanted more money.
1	I trust my doctor because he hasn't really given me a reason not to. He's very receptive to what I think is wrong with me and is very thorough in explaining what I am suffering from. He also explains his choices as to how to treat and explains why my initial thought of my reason for coming is wrong without being condescending.
-1	One of the reasons is because the physician seeks to find ways or things that are beneficial. Sometimes certain information is held back for the sake of not telling everything in order to gain more power that gives the physician the upper hand. That is my speculation based on a lot of things that are taking place today. 
-1	I distrust my doctor because he may only be doing it for money or trying to finish up his work so he can move on to the next patient.
-1	It is not that I do not trust my primary care physician, it's just that I am not sure he is giving me the best information or just the information he gives to everyone.
-1	There have been mistakes made with my care that have resulted in a need for more medical services.  I am somewhat jaded with respect to receiving medical care.  
1	"I trust my primary care physician. He is always available via the electronic portal and will respond to me within hours, sometimes even on the weekend. Sometimes an initial treatment plan won't work, but he is always ready with ""plan B"". He also makes sure I'm on schedule with preventative care (physicals, etc.)"
1	I trust my doctor because he has always steered me right and will do his best to avoid putting me through a procedure that I don't actually need. While he could make more money doing so, he will be honest with me in telling me whether or not I need something done or not. 
-1	Well I trust them because I expect them to be professionals and know what they're talking about. But at the same time I have gotten second opinions and wouldn't hesitate to do so again in the future because it's always better to be safe than sorry in my opinion.
1	I just generally trust the profession.  I believe that almost all doctors are primarily concerned with the well being and proper treatment of their patients.  There may be exceptions to that general rule but there would have to be irrefutable evidence to that effect to make me doubt the sincerity if not the competence of any physician.
1	I had a primary care physician that I liked and trusted very much. She had me do a number of tests when I first saw her so she could see what was going on. She is always listened and answered all questions I had, she had a caring personality, non-judgy. Sadly she moved and I am currently looking for a new primary care physician. 
-1	"I often feel like doctors care more about their time and money that the patient. It can be difficult to talk in depth about medical problems because my doctor is looking for a ""quick fix"" rather than a long term solution."
1	I trust my doctor. He tells me whats going on in a straight forward manner. He explains anything I do not understand and answers any other questions that I may have.
-1	I distrust my PCP because doctor's today have to think first about appeasing insurance providers and covered procedures in a health insurance policy as opposed to what is best for the patient. As a result of this I don't think my Doctor's word can be trusted.
-1	I have a doctor that will really listen to me and will sit an evaluate my situation and symptoms with me while explaining everything.  She is great at making me feel like she really cares and tries so hard to do what's best for me and figure out the best treatment plan for me. 
1	I trust my primary care physicians because we have a mutual trust of respect and friendliness. I find that if I empathize with them and ask then questions in a friendly manner, they are always eager to listen and advise me best on how to proceed.
-1	There have been times where I don't think he payed full attention to what I explained to him, then had me do tests that were incomplete only to redo them again the next time when they failed to find anything. This ties in with my belief that he is rushed and therefore I feel rushed as well.
1	My primary care physician has been honest and helpful in my decisions regarding my health.  Even though my last blood work showed I was nearing a diabetic level, I was very concerned that she wanted to put me on Metformin.  I chose not to add this medicine into my body and wanted to change my diet instead.  She approved my decision and suggested that we re-do the blood work in 3 months.  I am getting ready to make my 3 month appointment for Monday.
-1	I have been going a long time and always get the help I need. My doctor goes over options with me and takes the time to explain things.
-1	My doctor is very thorough and I am pretty confident in her abilities as a doctor. I have gone to her for many different ailments I have had and she has always prescribed or ordered the right tests for me.
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part but they aren't the most open minded when it comes to alternative therapies.
1	I trust my doctor because I believe he cares.   He seems down to earth and he showed concern when he saw I had too high amounts of cholesterol in my blood.   Also he seems to provide good advice that has helped me in the past. 
-1	I don't know my primary care physician very well, so have developed complete trust in her. She's new to me, as my previous physician left for a job in another community and no longer is in my insurance network. Therefore, I am back to rebuilding trust in a physician.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because would have built a relationship over many years. I have come to trust them and their decisions regarding my healthcare. I always consult them in health related matters. 
1	I have been to the doctor many times in the past and there has never really ben any issues.  I have been provided good information and treated the way I would want to be treated.  There has been no reason to not trust him in the past so I will continue to trust until proven otherwise.
1	My doctor is willing to listen and doesn't ignore my concerns. She brings up different options and will let me choose which of them I think would work best for my situation. Overall, I'm very happy with my PCP.
-1	I have advanced lung disease and I often feel that the doctor has not taken the time to really look over my files and/or learn about my condition.   For example, he recommended the Shingles vaccine for me and I had to inform him that because I am on steroids I cannot have the vaccine.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician anymore so I will just go with my neurologist.When I started going to her I was on all the wrong medicines all of my Drs before her were just throwing pills at me hoping for the best, I was even on a medication that was so outdated they only prescribed for cases where nothing else would work. She changed all of that in just one visit by putting me on all new medication. She even took care of my constant headaches and other little issues that I thought where just there for life.
-1	My doctor is very thorough, when he makes a diagnosis he will tell you why and why not it is or isnt and what treatment he thinks will work,  He is very open about his opinions and ideas, and if something doesnt work he will quickly try a different treatment or diagnosis. Wether its something I want to hear or not, he will tell me, and provide his best opinion on how to cope with it.
1	My doctor has made efforts to connect with other doctors treating me for various issues, and she spends as much time as necessary with me during appointments.
1	Before she retired, I had a good relationship with my former primary care.  She was very open with me and worked with me to better my help.  I really trusted her.  Now she is gone and I'm back at square one with no one I trust.
-1	My primary care physician asks questions that implies they're trying to dig deeper into my symptoms to see what is wrong. They run tests that may help figure out what's wrong with me.
-1	I think in general most physicians have their patients' best interest in mind.  They are dedicated to providing quality care.  However, some doctors may be more concerned with profits and payments from drug industries so it is important to ask questions.  
-1	I think that doctors in general have my best interests in mind when I see them for a problem that I am having. But the trouble with healthcare is that it is a for profit entity and the cost and profit side of it always comes into play.
-1	My primary care physician shows a genuine interest in me. She shows that she cares about health, calories, weight and healthy food. I trust her.
1	I have only seen my doctor a few times since we moved to Kentucky but she seems to be very upfront and honest about things.  She also has to be just about one of the kindest people that I have met since moving here.  
-1	I've been seeing a D O instead of an MD for over 8 years. He use to just come in and make a few notes, get up, leave and then come back with prescriptions. Unless, I had a cold or rash or the kidney stone that one time. He believed in pushing pills. I have degenerative disk disease and have had several fusions. Since the government crackdown, he got himself (IMO) some trouble. I went to him last time and he could not believe that nobody had done an image on my lower back (no surgeries there). My point is, he's the doctor. Why should I be the one to order an image? Now, with the government crackdown, he's actually got to do his job!! I'm highly considering changing because I don't believe he is that good. 
-1	I think that doctors are humans...they make mistakes. While my dr may have the best intentions, he can make mistakes too. I therefore, trust myself and how I am currently feeling and what I think is best for my body over his opinion of everyday issues that may come up. 
1	My doctor always has my best interest at heart. He will listen to my concerns and do what we both feel necessary to help the situation. My doctor will explain the pros and cons with me and together help me decide my best option.
1	I have no reason to distrust doctors and I'm fairly confident that if my doctor did not have my best interests, and the best interests of all his patients in mind, he would not have chosen to be a doctor.
-1	My primary physician seems hurried to prescribe antibiotics over anything, and she does not like writing referrals to specialists or running tests, like the flu.  In the past Ive had to insist on seeing a specialist.
1	I trust my doctor to give me the best medical advice, as she has always been straightforward and sincere with me.   She always seems to take my overall health into account before making recommendations 
-1	I feel like I can trust my doctor to listen to me and answer my questions correctly.  However, if I forget something or don't ask the question correctly I fell like things have or will be missed.  This has happened.  I do so much of my own research before appointments I try and make sure that I pretty much already know the answers and he just confirms or corrects.
1	My doctor has always fully explained things to me in a nice way. He's never belittled me or made me feel unintelligent. He's fun, thorough and thoughtful. I would recommend him to anyone. 
1	I trust my doctor's decisions because my doctors are trained professionals and they know what they are doing. My doctor is super nice and kind and takes time with me when I don't understand something about my health or my wellbeing. My doctor is irreplaceable to me.
-1	My primary care physician does not know me well as a person or patient. I believe I am more of a number than a patient. My doctor is quick to prescribe medication.
-1	My current primary care physician is only concerned about getting my appointments over with. I don't have time to talk about issues with her and doesn't inform me about my health. I'm searching for a new physician because I do not have trust in my current one.
1	My good health is a reflection upon my provider, if I'm doing well, then so are they. They have never given me a reason to doubt that they have my best interest at heart.
-1	I have not had a negative experience thus far. They seem to be concerned with giving me the necessary information, however, there have been occasions where they seem rushed.
1	My doctor always gives it to me straight. He doesn't dance around or mince words.  I trust him for that. He's always open and gives options and opinions about the options. O respect him for that. 
-1	My GP listens to me and trusts my intelligence. He knows I don't like to take medication unnecessary medications and that I only call if something is very wrong. He's an amazing diagnostician. 
-1	Everyone makes mistakes and often there are multiple treatment options for a given condition.  So, while I do feel that I can trust my Doctor I don't rely on them completely without understanding the full situation.  I like to ask them what they would do, or if their loved one had the same issue what would be the top two treatments they would recommend.
-1	I feel that it is neutral when you first meet your doctor but as sessions go on, it is very important for you to be able to talk to your doctor and for them to truly care.
-1	Itâs not that I feel that doctors are intentionally wrong or misleading. In most cases Iâm sure they arenât. But medicine in general is so nuanced that Iâve found when I visit a dr for something I gain little to no actual help or improvements and often just end up trying their advice to little help. I feel like Iâm playing dr roulette every visit. Usually I just end up with a bill and no new help or information and often also have to get referred to another dr cause drâs are so specialized nowadays that you canât just visit one dr for most things. So that just increases my bills, wares my time and creates stress. 
-1	I trust my doctor as much as possible while realizing she is human and makes mistakes. My doctor asks open-ended questions and allows me to express my concerns openly.  She talks to me about different options I have regarding treatment.  I never feel like she is rushed or in a hurry to get to her next patient. 
-1	I don't have a regular primary care physician but in general towards doctors I do not have complete faith in them. The few times that I have had to take either myself or my child to an emergency room, the doctor completely missed something that was extremely important. Most think that you are drug seeking and ignore what could be going on. There are times I trust their judgement but I will speak up if I believe that they are wrong or not being as thorough as I think they should be. 
1	I trust my PCP because I work with them and for them on a daily basis and i know that thehy care about each and everyone of their patietnts. I trust them to give me the right options and recommendations about my care.
-1	I trust my doctor but they are human and can sometimes get things wrong. I know they are well educated and are looking out for my best interest. 
-1	It really does seem like my doctor does care about me at times and it is really nice knowing that. Everytime i go in he askes how am i feeling.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because i have been dealing with them for a while and they showed and prove to me that if i just eat differently and exercise a little more i can lose weight and become healthy and i did.
1	He's very blunt, like house level blunt. he may not be polite or kind or caring, but he knows the healthcare field and medicine. He has no problem saying it how it is and doesn't fancy foot around it.
-1	Overall I don't feel alot of trust of doctors in general. The reason why I feel this way is because I feel most doctor's are in it for the money and they don't necessarily want people to be healed. They give you medicine for almost everything and that is not a good thing. So overall I don't trust in doctors and don't go to the doctors unless I have no other choice.
-1	I haven't gone to this new doctor as much and it takes time to build up trust and believing in the professional. Too many doctors get bought out by pharmaceutical companies and leave out some other medications that could help you if need be. I am not all conspiracy gung ho but I need time to build trust
-1	I feel like most mainstream doctors are in trained to only treat symptoms and not cure and heal the body as a whole. Big Pharma is a huge business and many of those doctors get incentives for keeping people coming in. Holistic doctors would be concerned with treating and curing ( and maybe  few doctors).
1	I do trust my primary care physician. He has helped me through some trying times and has given me more time,during visits, than I expected and more than I have been given in the past by other physicians.
1	He is very thorough in running tests to make sure I am healthy.  I feel confident in his ability to answer any questions I have.  He takes the time to sit and talk directly with me about any concerns that I have.  He is very patient and I feel concerned about my well being.
1	I trust my doctor because she seems genuinely interested in my concerns when I ask questions. When there is something I need to do, she gives me options that are based in real, conventional medicine and doesn't try to brush me off by suggesting placebo-like alternative treatments. She seems cautious and checks my lab results, and will take some time to see if my concern is based on an injury or illness during an exam. If something seems like it will clear up on its own, like some pains, she will suggest contacting her office if it doesn't get better in a certain number of days or weeks. I like her style of care and her advice is almost always a good way forward.
1	I've had the same doctor for many years and I can fully say this man does truly care about his patients. He has a very good memory and understanding of what his patient's need. That is why I put a lot of trust in him.
-1	I generally trust them but at the end of the day they are they to make money and not just to help me or  to make me feel better so I have to take everything they say or recommend or do with a grain of salt and seek other opinions
-1	My doctor over the years I have lost trust in him he used to be throughout and take his time with me and discuss issues but now when I go I have to wait an hour and a half for him to be in the room for not even 2 minutes which really upsets me because I have to drive 75 miles each way to get to my appointment.
-1	The pay cash to see my doctor.  I honestly believe he is running the clinic he has for the money.  I do believe he understands the way I feel about my condition because he's experienced the same problems I have, yet I still think he is more worried about money than he is the actual welfare of his patients and their recoveries.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I my family and I have been going to the same one for many years.  She has helped me manage many things including my blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Also she is very up to date on my medications in which I need to order.
1	I trust him because I have a lot of experience with doctors due to a heart problem I had several years ago. I know he is conscientious and thorough and he presents all the alternatives to me.
-1	I feel very neutral about my trust towards my primary car physician. I can not whole heartedly put all my faith into them. That why I strive to get second opinions if something does go wrong. I go see a specialist in order to better understand, and make sure I am not being misdiagnosed. There have been instances when I do not believe my doctor has made the right decision such as not prescribing the right dosage of a medication, and I have struggled to come to terms with that. Until then I still go cause its a convenient location, and accepts my insurance.
-1	I don't like how Dr.s get kick backs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe meds. This makes me not trust them because they put themselves first.
-1	She's a professional, she seems to be pretty knowledgeable and she seems really caring.  I just kind of assume that most doctors know what they are doing, so I do not see why my doctor would be any different.
1	I trust that he has my best interests in mind, he usually presents me with options for any concerns/issues I have and encourages me to do my own research into those options to ensure I can make a fully informed decision. He takes his time during our visits to explain to me what I need to know, and almost always request that I follow up with him in a timely manner to ensure I am on a recommended path towards meeting any goals/treatments that have been selected.
-1	I sometimes trust them because they give good solutions, and sometimes I never get the right cure. Also some doctors tend to be very well behavied and this gives me some more trust because they judge the case as if this is their case.
-1	I think that people are often motivated by money and that sometimes doctors will not tell people the best way to take care of themselves but they will tell them what is most convenient and beneficial to themselves instead. 
-1	I trust my primary physician to an extent. I feel that my physician is too busy to really give me a thorough exam and is super quick to keep moving. I feel that there is no way there can always be a right diagnosis
1	I do not feel that my doctor has ever lied to or withheld information from me so I have no reason to distrust her. She answers all of the questions that I do remember to ask her and her answers always sound reasonable.
-1	Unfortunately, medical care in America is a business first.  I never know if the decisions my doctor is making are in my best interest or the best interest for his bottom line.
1	In my experience, with all the conditions I have gone through in my life and went to the doctor, all the information they have given me had proof that I had found out prior to visiting.
1	Mainly because I do not really need my doctor to explain to me what is going on. I can see that he gives instructions and recommendation based on current research and best practices by verifying it for myself. Unless you do this you allow yourself to be treated like an object instead of a sentient being. It is vital that a person educate him/herself outside of the doctor's office.
1	I generally trust skilled professionals across the board. I assume someone who was intelligent and hardworking enough to fulfill the obligations of becoming a practicing physician would uphold the integrity of the position.
1	I trust him because he listens to what is going on and if he can't figure something out, he will direct me to someone who will and will provide a referral with no problem.
1	My doctor knows that I will seek outside information about any conditions that he may be treating to make sure that I am informed. Therefore, he is thorough in his explanations and makes sure that I have the pros and cons before I make a decision.
-1	I think most doctors do what they think is right and its not always up to date. I live in a rural community so they don't always stay current.
1	He is thorough and talks to me at length about my conditions.  He is focused on my health.  He works me in whenever I need to talk to him and we can have an appointment that is long if I feel I need it.  And he has done great things for my health and is very intelligent.
-1	I feel that my doctor knows  enough to trsut him but sometimes its okay to get a second opionon to be srure
1	From my overall history with doctors, I trust my current doctor almost completely. She is young and I haven't had her for long (about 2 years), which is why she doen't have my complete trust yet. She does care about me and my health and is very thorough in her assessments. I am very pleased to have her.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to him for several years. He has proven over time that he wants to keep me healthy. He has never diagnosed me incorrectly so I have no reason to believe he is lazy or incompetent. 
-1	I trust my doctor because that is their job to know what is going on. I have not had an interaction yet with a doctor where I feel they were not doing their part to help me understand something. I sometimes think some doctors care more about things they need to be doing than the patient themselves but maybe these particular doctors are more on the research side of things as opposed to patient facing.
1	My doctor makes sure to let me know what is going on if there is anything going on and makes sure I understand everything they do as they do it. My doctor makes sure that my thought are heard when I have a questions or comment and makes sure that they understand ever question I have. 
-1	I often feel like my doctor is so busy that I am just another body walking through a room to hurry on their way. I often feel like my problems aren't big enough or interesting enough to warrant being given full attention.
-1	I've had the same doctor for approximately 10 years, he's always helpful and knowledgeable. Provides me with answers and comforts my concerns but every visit feels more and more rushed like they are squeezing in more patients than time. It's like you are leading the visit by talking non-stop so he doesn't run away to the next.
1	I answered in regard to my doctor of 30+ years who recently retired. I absolutely trusted him with my children, whom he delivered, and myself. He always turned out to be right, always listened and explained things, gave me options. I have not seen a different doctor yet because I lost my job and do not have any health insurance.
1	I have been knowing him for a long time.  I know how he works.  He has good online reviews.  He is a good listener.
1	My doctor is a caring person. My my doctor is very good at getting to the bottom of what is going on. I trust my doctor.
-1	some doctors are just wrong with the diagnosis and treatment.  Some treatments are very difficult to accomplish by me.  Some doctors just order them and don't give a thought as to how hard it is on the client
-1	I don't feel as though my doctor knows me or cares that much about my well being in particular. I think he sees me just as any other patient. I think that can become dangerous because then the doctor applies a one size fits all type mentality. 
1	My doctor is caring and shows genuine concern for my well being.  She is thorough and answers any questions that I may have.  She takes her time and is very good at what she does. 
1	I have had my primary care dr for many years. I know he is a very good man who does his best to help me. He knows a lot about different things. He knows my history. He spends the time to listen to me. I still make my own decisions about things, but I really do trust him a lot. 
1	I completely trust my doctor as I have known her for a long time, and she is also a friend of the family. She is highly regarded by her peers and the medical community in general. She is very professional, honest, and kind.
1	I always make sure the doctor I am dealing with is trustworthy. They usually have rules in place to make sure I am getting a fair deal, and if not, I can always find someone else or complain about them to the office/hospital. I have never had a bad experience at the doctor's office, and I can tell by their personality that they are taking care of me and have me in their best interests.
1	My doctor always makes sure to involve me in the decisions of my care. He always makes sure to ask if I have any questions. He spends an appropriate amount of time discussing my health with me and the reasons he is making the decisions he is. He always provides information about medications possible side effects.
1	I think sometimes doctors focus too much on pharmaceutical prescriptions to mask problems when it would be wiser to get to the underlying problem. In general, though, their solutions to help and can help someone who is getting or is sick.
-1	I feel that they usually know what they are doing but you can't expect them to care deeply about you because they see so many people that can't care about each one a great deal. Doctors work long hours and make mistakes because they are human so you need to watch what they do and say carefully to as a mistake they make can cause a good deal of harm to you or possibly death. Doctors are also going to lie from time to time as again they are human., in my experience doctors also have an over inflated ego which can cause problems as they are less likely to second guess their decisions.
-1	While I believe doctors are a trustworthy lot, in general, I am also aware that doctors see many patients per day and treatment options are constantly changing. Doctors may not be fully aware of the latest developments in medicine. Recently published studies showing adverse reactions to conventional treatments may not be foremost in a doctors mind while treating her patients.
1	I trust doctors because they seem very open to discuss questions and concerns. Even to the point of not wanting to take prescribed medicine they will refer to other alternatives. 
-1	I believe most doctors can be trusted in giving you the best advise available to you. The problem with doctors in the US, is they do not have enough time to spend with patients. They are usually in a rush to get you out of the office, so they can see the next patient. 
1	There are instances or maybe rare instances that I did not trust my doctor one time because all he/she ever gave me was simple remedy that I could have just researched in the internet.
-1	i currently have a great pa but often see neurologists and i know i need aggressive doctors and for the most part have been satisfied. i am an odd example of ms and have needed unusual treatment. 
1	I have a regular physician at the university hospital. I have been seeing him for past few years. So far, I do not have any issues with. During my visit, he is always very professional. He seems to care a lot about patients. He is always polite, kind and caring. He seems very focused during the diagnosis. After careful examination, he has been able to explain my problems in simple words and recommend the proper treatment. He always warns about possible side effects of any prescription.  So, far I have not had any issues with treatment and medicines. That is why I trust my physician very much. 
-1	I've been through many doctors and can understand that some are to be trusted less since they may diagnose you with something that nets them alot of money if you dont understand your own issue. Sometimes you may be a test subject for a new disease that makes alot of money for them and you have to go through a lot of bullshit just because you dont know whats wrong. I trust my primary care physician quite a bit since its more of a help me help you situation, but generally they're still a second opinion.
1	I trust my medical staff to tell me what is wrong or right. They take the time to explain the information to me and ask me if I have any questions.
-1	I trust my PCP because they are good at explaining situations with my health and laying out options. I am skeptical whether ALL possibilities are considered, but I am confident that the most likely scenarios are addressed first. 
1	I trust my physician because my friend and my friends mom were her patients. They went to a school i am familiar with . They have always explain everything and provided care for me. 
1	My doctor listens to my concerns without trying to push certain medications or treatment when do not benefit me in the long run.
-1	My primary care doctor seems to take care in doing all the necessary testing for illness and other conditions which might be present is a person of my age, gender and lifestyle.
1	I trust my doctor but I realize that sometimes a problem needs a different viewpoint. I think that my doctor does the best she can but sometimes a problem needs an expert in a different field. I trust my doctor to admit this and move me on to see that person. I think that my doctor has my best interest in mind when she makes decisions related to my health. 
1	I know that my doctor wants to do all he can to make me well.  He gives me options for natural medicine and regular medicine. I know he is a Christian and that also makes me feel better about my care.
-1	I do not really fully trust any doctor that much since sometimes whatever is affecting me cannot be solved by my doctors. 
-1	I currently don't have a PCP and haven't even gone to a doctor in over 3 years. I do have problems with depression and anxiety and was being seen at a mental health clinic up until about 6 months ago when they refused to re-new my medications because I was unable to pay the copays that I owed them.
1	Physicians spend years and years honing their craft, learning their skills, and making rational decisions about what to do in any given medical scenario. I don't feel that it's my place to question their advice, so generally they know what the best course of action is. I have full trust in what my care provider tells me I should do.
-1	I believe that she is kind and caring and will use her best judgement in my treatment. Obvious she does not know everything about me but she tries to get to know me as best she can. 
-1	I think doctors are packing too many patients into a day. It leaves them without the time or inclination to look too deeply into patients' medical issues. 
-1	I trust my primary physician because I know my physician for more than a decade and he has demonstrated competency and a caring about my medical needs.  
1	I think sometimes Physicians are in a hurry. So it is to their advantage to gloss over your case. So instead of carefully considering your case they just take care of the obvious and move on to the next patient.
-1	I sometimes dont trust medical professionals because like most other people they are just trying to do the bare minimum in their jobs to get by. Sometimes they don't care for the patients as much as they do the money they are making. 
-1	I think doctors are overworked and even though they might know the best thing to do, they might not have time to really consider what is best for you. They also cannot possibly keep up with all of the things they need to when it comes to research or making sure the best things for the patients arent changing.
1	I have known my physician for a very long time. He was my family doctor for my entire life. He has always had good solutions to all of my problems. He has never failed my family in any aspect. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because everything he has told me has improved my quality of life. I have yet to experience anything bad and his knowledge is evident at first glance.
1	My doctor has never steered me wrong before when I've come in with any issues, and he has always seemed very genuine, understanding, and honest. He always makes sure I understand everything and makes sure I know I can always follow up with him about anything if ever necessary. 
1	About 12 years ago I had major heart surgery due to life threatening conditions.  I have had chronic conditions since, and my care requires ongoing monitoring and treatment.  My doctor saved my life then, and my care has continued to be thorough and effective.  I have never been dissatisfied in the least with any outcomes from my doctor or provider.
-1	I do not trust many doctors in general which is why I don't go to the doctor very often. I believe that many doctors are just sellers of drugs and make way too much money in royalties for talking people in to taking certain drugs.
1	My doctor is open, funny, and easy to approach.  I enjoy my doctor and don't feel nervous asking my doctor questions pertaining to my health.
1	I have known him a long time, He also helped look after my parents and he was always honest with me. Most of the time I think to honest, But that was ok I needed something to be put bluntly  for me to digest everything that was happenings. My Dr understood that, he took the time to understand that being blunt was what I needed.
-1	I do trust my doctor but to a sense. Sometimes I feel like he just wants to hurry me out of the room to go on to the next patient. When I try to explain something that might be wrong he kind of dismisses it. But I do know that he will try to help out for issues that are already present.
-1	My doctor has gone to great lengths to help me. I am always confident that they know what they are doing or are at least trying to help. This is why I keep going to them.
-1	I trust the doctor because that is his job.  I have never been given any indication that he was unable to perform his duties.  I would hope that I would be given the same courtesy.
-1	It is natural for people to try and get as much money as possible. This applies to doctors because certain procedures that might be unnecessary are sometimes ordered so that the doctor can bill you or your insurance more than he typically could. I have good insurance so I do not mind having extra tests performed because it is not costing me anything and i am getting thorough examinations 
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician.  Sometimes, there are things he does that's unclear at first but he's usual thorough in terms of explaining things. 
-1	I definitely depend on my primary care doctor but I do know enough when to seek out a specialist.  I'm very fond of my doctor but I always question medical decisions.
-1	Trust my primary care doctor because they have my best intentions at heart and they are highly esteemed in their profession. They get good results and give thorough advice and council.
-1	I occasionally feel rushed when interacting with doctors. Although I know they make an effort to be efficient with their time, I sometimes feel as if they are sacrificing quality for efficiency.
-1	I distrust physicians in general. I believe that they are strongly misinformed and guided by big pharma. They are told to prescribe things and they don't do their own research.They just take what the pharma representative says as fact. 
1	I trust my physician because she takes the time to explain potential problems and my own research has given me no reason to distrust her information.
-1	I trust a doctor's medical knowledge but not a doctor's character or infallibility. A doctor can make mistakes even if they try their best, they can have beliefs that influence their medical advice, they can be influenced by prejudices or incentives. Doctors are only human. But that doesn't mean I should ignore what they say.
1	Overall, I trust in my doctor because of her confidence and demeanor. She has always been extremely kind, full of information, and has let me know of alternatives if there are any. A primary example was when she prescribed me anti depression medication last year. They worked well, and she made me feel confident that they would help with my situation. 
1	My doctor has seen me for several years. I trust them a lot because of the rapport we have built. My doctor has always given me great advice about my health, and has inquired about my life and goals. I think my doctor always tries his best with me. 
-1	I think Doctors can get in the habit of following the same treatment plan over and over. Each person is different and should have their treatment tailored to them. 
-1	I think in medicine, having some room for reservations is good, and second opinions are good as well. I think after taking classes with some of the next generations med students...makes me question them as well. They are people just like me. 
-1	I trust my doctors to a point. I do not trust them completely and feel they sometimes choice the easier way than the way that might be more beneficial to me. 
-1	I have always had good interaction with my primary care physician and feel like i can trust them with all of medical needs.  This person does not judge me and gives advice for all things that i come to them with.  I have never had a reason not to trust this person. 
-1	I do not believe that he spends enough time with me to really get to know me. He has given me drugs which help a little, but never asked me in depth about my chronic pain or fatigue, nor has he referred me to a specialist who could.
1	I've had my doctor for 10 years now.  He was my fathers doctor for over 20 years and he also treats my sister.  He's kind, very smart and has a lot of experience.  He's always willing work me into his schedule even if it means skipping his lunch or staying late.  So yeah, I trust him completely.
-1	I like that my primary care physician usually presents me with multiple courses of action to take for different problems (i.e. different medications).  However, it comes across as being a little indecisive sometimes when I'd rather have a straight yes or no kind of answer.  He also is quick to recommend a specialist instead of giving a medical opinion himself. Overall I think he is trustworthy, though maybe overly cautious.
1	The particular doctor I currently have takes her time during visits. She asks questions about my life, my family, and the current condition I'm experiencing. I've told my wife I believe my doctor sees me as a project, her goal is to keep me heathy and strong. 
-1	I don't distrust the doctor. I merely feel like so many tests and procedures are unnecessary and sometimes harmful. I don't go to the doctor unless I feel like something is wrong.
-1	My doctor is very sweet and kind to me, I don't see why she would purposefully be dishonest with me about anything. Sometime's I'm confused by what she tells me, but that isn't her fault.
1	My physicians assistant is very kind, listens, engaging, good sense of humor and makes me feel comfortable. He does not make me feel bad about myself if i am unsure or if i feel the need to vent or unload about a situation that is tied to feeling unwell to my situation. I would be very upset if he changes practices. 
-1	I do not have complete trust in my physician because sometimes they are just out for money and do not tell you everything.  They try to push medications and not everything requires prescription medicine.
1	I trust my physician because she has always been honest with me and straight forward. She always tells me things even if it isn't exactly what I want to hear 
-1	The doctor that I have now is pretty good. He seems honest and decent. So I do trust him a good bit. Don't feel this way about all doctors but this one is pretty good.
1	My doctor is a very good doctor, who i trust completely. I have been seeing her for the past 4 year. I feel that she always tells me the truth and looks out for my bet interest. Anytime that i feel something is wrong she always listens to me and doesnt blow me off. There has been times when she has made appointments for me for follow ups, within like a week. I have not had others doctors do that
-1	My primary care physician has known me for a couple years now and I have grown to trust in him lot. He is good at explaining things to me for the most part and is very easy going. He is also very thorough in explaining things to me and trying to see what I think about certain health issues. He has not let me down yet and has not given me a reason to distrust him.
-1	My doctor has become my friend over the years, not a close friend but a friend of a sort. I can trust him to be concerned when I'm not doing well and to think carefully about what the best course of action would be for me. I feel confident about his decision making.
1	My doctor is a DO, so I already feel that the philosophical underpinnings of his education are more patient focused than illness focused. He listens carefully to what I tell him, and responds point by point to my statements. He trusts in my personal medical judgement as far as my chronic conditions.
1	I trust my doctor wholeheartedly.  He is very concerned about my well being and has been very thorough in helping me solve my problems. He isn't afraid to deal with my insurance company head on to get me the best care.  He hasn't let me down in the past and won't do it in the future.  
-1	I go to my university health center currently, where I feel the credentials to be a medical professional are slightly more lax compared to a pediatrician you may go to as an adolescent or child. In my opinion the structured, budget friendly operation of a university health center is caked with many professionals screening and treating students the same for the most part. While I can rely on them for blood work, sexually transmitted disease screening, general prescriptions, and counseling services I would not go to them for diagnosis or anything major. I personally would prefer a resident at a hospital to the nurses I usually see. At some colleges it is worse than mine, some only have nurses and no licensed doctors. As such I don't really trust my doctor, but it's not awful.
-1	I have been working with him for over 10 years so I feel like he knows me extremely well.  He understands the health conditions I have and how the impact me.
1	I feel I can trust my primary care physician because he has shown me that the decisions he helps me make about my health are the ones that are best for me. My doctor is also very clear about the decisions he makes.
1	I have none my doctor for more than 10 years. He has treated me since I was a teenager. He has always putting my needs first. There has never been a time when I've questioned his decision.
-1	I believe that my primary care physician has outdated information on certain things. It's not like they go back to school every couple of months to get updated information on certain conditions. I also believe that they kept bonuses for pushing pills on to people.
-1	The last time I went to the doctor they ran a lot of tests on me that resulted in a $700 bill, later when I saw my gyno he said that the tests were unnecessary. I don't have a need to go to the doctor right now but I would look for another place to go. 
1	I trust my doctor because he has decades of experience in conventional medicine, and also has obtained extra courses lately in naturopathy. He is very knowledgable about medical conditions and how to treat them both conventionally or alternatively with herbs, homeopathy etc. He always looks me in the eye and listens. 
1	I feel like the doctor-patient relationship is built entirely on trust and so my basic foundation is totally trusting him. He's never given me any reason to doubt him.
1	I trust my OBGYN, I just think he is a little c-section happy.  Two high risk pregnancies and two c-sections for someone who wanted a natural birth is a little disappointing, but everyone is healthy and alive so can't complain with the results.
1	i've been going to my doctor for years and he knows me very well. he gives all options. if i want to do something like try a new medication he'll give me all the pros and cons and also give me other(better) options. he's never dimissive
1	I trust them because they seem ethical.  You lknow that feeling that you get when yoj talk to someone that means that you can just trust them?  I fet that feeling from her when I talk to her.  She's really smart and into you quite a bit when you talk with her.  Id recommend her to anyone looking for a doctor in their near future for sure!
-1	I try to avoid going to my doctor unless it's absolutely necessary.  I don't trust them because I have anxiety and depression and it makes trust almost impossible for me.  I realize that this is all on me but I just find it not possible for me.  I would like very much to do it.  I know they're not going to lie to me but I still find that I just don't trust any of them.
1	They are always very thorough in explaining what the possibilities are for treatment. They are always so careful in explaining the pros and cons of each treatment in a way that I can weigh them more easily.
-1	I have trust in my physician because he has always been correct regarding any health issue I have had in the past. I have no reason to distrust him as I have never left an appointment feeling anything has been overlooked when it comes to my health
-1	She takes time to really listen to me. If I am doubting something, or questioning why about things she will explain it. I don't feel like I cannot bring things up to her. For example when I mentioned my anxiety she really took time to get me on meds that made me feel better. It made all the difference in the world to me. 
1	She takes the time to listen to me and is very thorough in her explanations. Asks about my feelings etc.
1	I see my PCP every 60 to 90 days for migraines. He will listen to my every need or issue. Often I may have something else nagging me (back pain, neck pain) and no matter what he will address these issues and guide me in the right direction. 
-1	"I see my PCP once a month and in any given 12 month period he may take my BP or listen to my heart 1 or 2 times in those 12 months.  He does not generally ask how I am doing or feeling only comes in, sits down in front of the computer and asks ""what do you need today"" referring to Rx refills.  He is not a hands on doctor and If I should ask or complain about a problem he dismisses it and says we are all getting older."
-1	My doctor is thorough, but he can't know everything. I can't totally trust him or any doctor, knowing that they may not be able to find the answer. 
1	I trust my primary care physician fully because he is a very good doctor. I have been seeing him since I was a child and he has always given me the best care and been right about his diagnosis on the first try. He is nice and good at communication and making sure I fully understand everything and am comfortable
-1	I have been going to the same Doctor since I was a child, they care but they also don't make any money off me if I'm dead
-1	I am a very critical person. So I am always looking for more information than what is given. It has nothing to do with my doctor being a bad doctor, and more with my inquisitive disposition. 
1	My doctor always answers all of my questions and has never steered my wrong. I'm never rushed and am always number one when I'm in the room with her. 
-1	Sometimes it seems that they're too quick to recommend invasive treatments like drugs with bad side effects or surgery rather than trying to get the body to heal itself, which seems much safer (and less expensive) to me.
-1	I like my doctor, but his clinic is so busy that I sometimes get the feeling that he goes with the easiest explanation of something. It makes me willing to spend a bit more money to go to a clinic that I know isn't busy if needed.
-1	I don't care for my doctor much. I hadn't been to a doctor in 10 years. Before that I had a bad experience with my doctor. Recently I've also had a bad experience. Just more medical bills for them to prescribe me crap. Basically a 100 version of a drug that I could get for $1 over the counter,.
-1	"I don't have a primary care physician. I don't go to doctors much and have had mixed results. Different doctors have told me that strep is nothing to worry about and others have been ""upset"" that I didn't come in sooner. "
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he has a lot of experience in the medical field.  He serves as a mentor and teacher in the medical community and seems to be an expert in his field.  
-1	They have tried to push me away from solutions that don't involve taking drugs when those options are just as viable.
1	I trust my primary care physician.  When I went to him and told him I was depressed he immediately referred me to a social worker/therapist.  He did not just prescribe me medicine on his own.  He is careful and conservative but effective.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is very polite, respectful, and reputable. He is more than willing to assist me in my health needs as well as my decisions regarding choices that are more optional than necessary such as vitamin capsule intake. Overall, he's very helpful and a great source of health knowledge. 
-1	My doctor is very open when discussing medical issues and concerns with me.  There is no issue discussing alternatives, side effects, etc.  The doctor never makes me feel uncomfortable and has always provided me with accurate information.
-1	Because I have a lot of experience in care physicians giving me the wrong treatment, tests, and medications.  I have suffered a lot of negative side effects because of doctors not believing me. Doctors in my are do not have the knowledge to help me how I need to be helped. They are not willing to individualize their treatments according to individuality and differences. This made me skeptical over a lot of doctors.
1	I do not really have much distrust in the my primary care physician. I feel like he does a great job in being honest and transparent.
-1	I have never known him to lie about anything but sometimes I don't think another drug is the answer for everything, I like natural approaches to as many things as possible.
1	I've had my doctor for a long time. She always listens when i want to talk and has given me excellent advice in the past.
1	I have been working with my primary care doctor for several years. She has a personal connection to another organization that I work with, and a similar background to my own. She has gone out of her way to build trust and extend sincere personal insight.
-1	My PCP just seems to have a diagnosis ready to go before we even speak. He rarely seems to be concerned with side effects I report and love to have tests run. His focus just seems very narrow, he is late and just dismissive. 
-1	My doctor is usually backed up and busy and I usually feel rushed and that he is just trying to get to the next patient
-1	I have a lot of trust in my primary car physician. They treat me like an individual and show me a lot of care. They ask me about my concerns and really try to get to know me. They are very good at diagnosing problems that I have.
1	I only see my gynecologist regularly and I trust his opinion on conditions I am dealing with. He explains it to me clearly so I can understand what is going on and he makes me feel comfortable. He gets to know me as a person aside from just a patient and makes me feel like he cares about my overall well being. 
-1	He's very down to earth and tells me what is protocol but also what is necessary. He's a big proponent of preventative care and has always backed up his suggestions with research.
-1	I trust Doctors because they are in their position for a reason, but just like any other Profession they don't get to make the rules, are worried about getting sued, or don't trust their patients to tell them the truth and often go with their own assumptions, which can be both good and bad.
-1	I trust my doctor (cardiologist) very much. He has a great reputation and has a great amount of skill and knowledge.
-1	I don't completely trust any doctor. I feel like sometimes they are just guessing what a problem or solution is. I take the information the doctor gives and make my own choices on what I believe and what my next steps will be. 
-1	I distrust doctors a bit in general because I've had bad experiences in the past with doctors leading me down the wrong path. At the end of the day they are still just human and I believe it should be a team process in finding the best treatment for you since you are the one that has to live with the consequences. 
1	She was recommended to me by a friend i trust. She listens to my concerns and addresses them. She is warm, sympathetic, and seems very intelligent and competent.
-1	We tend to put doctors on a pedestal and to me this is so absurd.  They are human and subject to human error.  There is so much medical negligence.  You read about it just about every day.  My doctor does not hesitation to write out a prescription.  He is aware that I am totally against taking prescribed drugs. He only cares about a quick fix.   I also feel that it's a money game.  
-1	i trust my doctot because he always goes to great lengths to get to the bottom of my health issues and ive known my doctor since i was young an ive never had any issues with him all the time ive went to him
1	I trust him because he seems to really know what he is doing, and was able to treat my infection correctly. He is also very kind and caring and seems to really care about the patients.
1	I have been going to the same dr for years. I have never had a bad experience.  She has always steered me in the right direction.  She seems knowledgeable and is always open to listen to what I have to say .
-1	I feel they do not care to put in the time to really figure out and discuss health complaints and often rush patients in and out. I do not fully trust them for fixing health issues.
1	I feel doctors, in general, have the patient's care and well-being in mind when they are treating them. I feel that a patient has to have that trust in their doctor or they should probably get a new one.  A patient needs to feel that trust because their doctor is such an important part of staying well, or getting well.
-1	I trust my physician for the most part. There are times though that I have questioned her. It is because medical degree or not we all have preferences and she is going to only offer me her preferences and I may not know about other options 
-1	My doctor will sit down and listen to me and my concerns and she will also talk to me in terms that I understand  she will not leave until I fully understand her and what she is saying
-1	Based on anecdotes and past experiences, doctors cannot be trusted many times. Sadly, there are a lot of doctors who will play with your lives for the money. That is not to say all doctors are like that, but you have to be careful.
-1	I think that nowadays, most doctors are about the money that they want to make and they will give you the treatment that cost the most even if a cheaper alternative is available.
1	My primary care physician is also my mother's primary care physician and has been since I was 7. He became mine when I was 18 and before that point would ask my mother about how I was doing. He is also a rheumatologist and I have rheumatoid arthritis and have since I was 11. He remembers extremely minor details and things about me and my health without having to look through my file every time I visit. He is extremely busy but always takes time to follow up and is very thorough. He is willing to recommend I take a treatment that he cannot provide and is genuinely interested in keeping me in the best health possible.
1	I have seen my current doctor for several years now. he has always listened to my concerns and has worked with me in finding the best treatment that iI need.
1	I mean, it is their job to make sure that I receive the best care possible. I am sure they don't want to be facing some sort of repercussions based on how they care for me. I would like to think that they became doctors to help people like me to get the best care they can administer, and so it would be somewhat out of character if they were to skimp on my care.
-1	I trust my doctor but if I had a serious illness I would see a specialist and if I was given a new medication I would investigate it before taking it.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, but overall I think doctors will do what they can to help you. Unfortunately I think sometimes circumstances force them to treat patients in more of a hurry which may make them seem like they don't care. But overall I think most doctors genuinely want to help people and have no interest other than to help you get well.
1	Doctors take an oath of not doing harm and with the risk of malpractice they would not do what is convenient but what is right.
-1	Alot of my anxiety of fully trusting doctors boils down to when my grandfather was sick.  The doctors were not able to identify the source of his fever until I mentioned that after googling his symptoms that lymphoma has all the same symptoms.  Only then, they finally tested and were able to diagnose him 24 hours before he passed away.
1	I really trust and respect my doctor.  He takes a lot of time with me at each appointment and always asks me a bunch of questions.  He is kind and seems like he really cares about me.
1	My doctor seems professional; I have no reason to distrust their advice given to me with regards to my health. Every step they've taken when I've been unwell has made a lot of sense and ultimately helped me.
-1	Sometimes when I visit my doctor, I feel extremely rush and unimportant. Other days, I feel like my doctor actually listens to my problems and needs 
1	I trust my doctor because he has yet to steer me wrong. Whenever I am having a problem or I need a question answered he is there to listen and give me a thorough diagnosis. He also looks out for me by recommending me the best products with the lowest price. If my problem can be fixed easily with a drugstore product then my doctor has no problem bringing up that product first. Even if I feel as though my problem was major and my doctor diagnoses it as something simple like a stomach ache, he will still treat the situation as important and reassures me in showing that it wasn't a waste of time to come.
1	I guess if I had to think about it, I would have a hard time coming up with a reason not to trust my primary care physician. I have been seeing him since I stopped seeing my pediatric doctor when I was a teen. He has never led me wrong or given me trouble about my prescriptions when I needed to get them filled. I also see a psychiatrist for anxiety and he provides me with the medicine needed to treat my panic disorder. I have been seeing him for over a decade and by now I only need to see him for a quick appointment once every three months because he knows me so well.
-1	I have family in the health care business and would trust them whole heartedly. I think that it is important to have trust in your doctors. They go through a lot of training and pledge an oath to provide to their patients as well as they can.
1	I generally trust my primary care physician because she consistently treats me with respect and listens to my needs. She's also willing to say when she's unsure about something and when I need to seek additional resources or opinions, rather than pretending to know everything about everything. 
-1	I did quite a bit of research before I finally selected my doctor.  She has very good reviews from other parents, and works for a very reputable institution, Johns Hopkins.  Most of my interactions with her have been extremely positive and she has given me no reason not to trust her judgment.  My one concern is that she seems to be extremely busy, and probably feels pressure not to spend much more than 15 minutes with any of her patients.
-1	I would have faith and hope that as a trained physician they are both skilled and have the knowledge and upkeep in the medical field. They do this as a living, doctors/nurses and physicians, so I should put at least some trust into their job that they are evaluating me and my health properly.
1	My primary care physician has the qualifications and the experience to make the right decisions. She also takes into consideration my opinion and strives to give me the highest quality of life she can.
1	My PA is extremely intelligent.  He listens to me, and he gives me credit for knowing something is wrong with my body.  He involves me in treatment planning.
-1	I think i can trust my primary care physician i feel that most doctors are honest people.some doctor my not be trustworthy but i have had no reason not to trust my doctor. if i thought my doctor could not be trusted i would look for another primary care physician.
-1	My physician does not rush me out of her office. She sits and talks with me and makes me feel like a person rather than just another face in her daily routine. She tells me about her past experiences as she is less than ten years older than me and has gone through a lot of the same things I have. She tells me what things she thinks are optional (flu shots, etc...) and what I really need to get done to stay healthy. 
1	Firstly, I tends to trust people. For doctors who are well-educated and respected, I trust most of them. As I experienced, most doctors are very nice and professional.
-1	I trust my primary physician because they would have no reason to lie to me or falsify any information. They would not benefit at all from lying to me so it would not be worth doing that at all. 
-1	I am not sure he takes the time to understand everything is happening to me. Sometimes I think his time is much more valuable than my health.
1	I trust the care of my primary care physician because I have been a patient with him for years and also because I am a LPN, he trusts my knowledge as well and we can always come to a decision together regarding my care.
1	I actually have a new PPC so I don't have a lot of experience with her.  From what I do know, I trust her and her judgement.
-1	I trust my doctors because they answer my questions when I ask them, they don't treat me like a child or an idiot, and they actually pay attention to what I am saying. My doctors are engaged with me as a person and while our goal is to make me feel better, it never feels like the docs are focused on the endgoal - diagonsis - and are instead focused on me and what I need and what I'm feeling. 
-1	I trust the doctors i see because of the training and education they receive. I do think there is a bit of opinion difference between different doctors but i think overall that is marginal in diagnosis. I do believe that in general almost all doctors and nurses are out for the patients best interest.
-1	Because if they are so rushed to see you and need to make appointments that they can't even keep most of the time, then something is wrong with their time management. I feel like I've told the doctor things before and they just brush it off like it's no big deal or that it's normal when I know that it's not. They just don't want to have to sit there any longer. 
-1	I've been going to my primary physician for years and she has earned my trust. Also my mom who works in the medical field says nothing but praises for my primary physician.My primary physican gives me good advice and tries to maintain my health in the right area.
1	I was going to the same primary care physician since i was very young. My mother personally knows my doctor so i feel very comfortable taking advice from that person. I think this person has good intentions and really wants to help me 
-1	In my case I have always looked for doctors who earn my trust. Currently my doctor is trusted because he has a lot of academic experience and also has a very good experience practicing what he already knows. During the consultations shows that he knows what he is doing, and that gives me confidence, something that is very important to deposit in a doctor
1	I had trouble for a long time finding a good doctor. I had stomach issues and other weird problems for a decade. Then I switched to my current doctor, she tested my thyroid and Iâve felt so much better since. Sheâs been pretty spot on since Iâve started seeing her. My whole family see her we trust her so much. 
-1	My primary care physician sometimes did not respond to my request about different treatment options. She swayed me into a specific option without asking my opinion. My friends got a certain treatment option but she did not even let me ask for that,
-1	I lost a lot of trust in the medical field in general and especially with doctors while uncovering some information over the years. When I have learned that companies pay doctors to push their pharmaceuticals and also offer them incentive for prescribing their products and meeting up with them. Uncovering things like this just added to the distrust in the medical profession. 
-1	I don't trust my doctor. They just write things and don't say anything. They want to hurry up and get out of there. They always call me a liar. 
1	I went to several Doctors to find the one that I have now.  My doctor will stay in the room with you until they have answered all questions.  My doctor does not let anything else distract him while you are being examined.  The doctor will ask several times if you understand or if you need them to go over anything else again.
1	I have a strong trust in my provider. She has spent extra time with me when I needed it and followed up after stressful visits to make sure I fon't have more questions and to just check in with me.
1	I trust my primary care physician because they are a professional and it is their job. In my experiences, they seem to know what they are doing, provide good advice, and respond to any questions and concerns I have. The person looks and acts professionally and I have no reason to distrust them or doubt their competence. They are more knowledgeable than me so I trust their advice and directions on health matters.
-1	They are experienced and i feel that they know more about what is going on than i do.  I don't feel they are swayed by drug vendors often but that thought has crossed my mind before.  Overall i feel trusting of doctors.
-1	I beelive that he knows what is best for me. He has taken care of his education, and has been training in his life in order to make sure he knows what he's doing. That is something that lets me think he is a professional,
1	My doctor was really good, he seemed to care a lot for his patients. Sometimes you could tell, because he would go out of his way to do things that seemed above and beyond. He was also older so you knew he was putting forth more effort than someone who was younger.
-1	I believe that doctors are trained to be trustworthy and have taken an oath to put their patient's interest above all. Of course, there are some doctors who fail at patient interaction in any number of ways, but I believe them to be the minority.
1	I trust what my doctor says about a medical condition. I have found that what I read about a given condition was in agreement with what the doctor said about the condition. I trust what my doctor says about a specialist to see. For example, if my doctor recommends a specialist doctor, I know it will be someone who is excellent. I have checked the patient reviews for a recommended specialist and found out that the reviews were consistent with what my doctor had said about the specialist.
-1	I do not either trust or distrust my doctor. I feel they are they to evaluate my physical condition and to make recommendations to maintain or improve my health. They are a valuable resource which I can then use to make a decision of how to proceed given the options which have been discussed.
-1	I do trust my doctor for most things but I do believe that doctors do not take people serious unless they can see actual signs themselves. Seems like most doctors send patients back home for a month to see if the symptoms go away or get worse. When most patients come in they have actually already been suffering from the problem for a long time but just waited to see the doctor. I do understand that some patients are lying to the doctor just to get medications or other things. It just seems like the patients really have to convinince the doctor that they really have these problems. I know it has to be hard for the doctors as well because they have to make sure they do not mistreat a patient even if that is what the patient wants. Of course, we have all heard about the few dirty doctors that have lied to patients about have cancer or other illnesses just to profit off the insurance money. We can't forgot about the many drug seeking patients that only want pain pills. That makes it hard on the people who are actually in pain or have cronic pain and really do need pain pills daily. 
1	They have many years of experience and tell me their thoughts and diagnoses without trying to put anything delicately or hiding any concerns.
-1	I have not been to a doctor in over 15 years, so I do not fully trust doctors, but that's not why I haven't been, I just know that unless its something very strange or a broken bone, most things go away with just taking care of yourself, good nutrition and staying hydrated works for me. I havent even used over the counter medicine at all in over 10 years. 
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. Since seeing my current doctor, he has on one occasion spent almost an hour with me explaining why my cholesterol is the way it is. The fact that he invested that much time with me instead of leaving in 10-15 minutes told me that he cares about what I need to know and is willing to take the time to make sure I understand why things happen like they do.
1	I trust my Dr because he takes his time while I am there for my visit.  He leaves no stone unturned.  He always does blood work before the visits.  He orders appropriate test just in case.  He encourages me to continue on a healthy path.  He helps in dieting and what to eat and what not to eat.  I also trust my Dr because he is sought after by lots of patients.  He is always booked up.  He has been in the business for quite a few years.  
-1	She never remembers me.  I go in for one problem and she ignores it and instead complains about my weight.  I once went to her to acquire a sedative for a very stressful upcoming doctor appointment and she screamed at me saying if I take 4 Valium pills I will turn into an addict.  She also gets my age wrong every time.  I only go to her for referrals.  She is at an age where I think she needs to retire and every time I have been there I never see any patients in the waiting room.  Her online reviews are also terrible. 
-1	I know they are in the positions that they hold because of extensive education, experience and trust building with patients. They are able to answer all of my questions in a credible and convincing manner. I have had no breaches of trust to make me react otherwise.
1	My doctor takes a great deal of time with his patients.  My last wellness visit lasted 1 1/2 hours.  I met with his assistant, his student doctor and him.  They took a full medical and social history.  Because he is a teaching doctor and has a 3rd year medical student working with him, he uses the questions I ask as an opportunity to educate both me and his student.  He runs all the tests he feels are needed to make sure I am in good physical shape.  He also counsels me on nutrition. 
-1	I do not trust my primary care physician because he acts very rushed. He only wants to deal with one issue per appointment. I am also worried that doctors are encouraged to prescribe pharmaceuticals over other treatment options.
1	I trust my doctor because of his track record over the years with patients who aren't me and the fact that doctors can easily get in trouble for not doing the right thing.  
1	All in all over the years going to the doctor has been a pleasant experience. The doctors I have visited have been kind and helpful. One reason I think I have such a positive opinion of doctors is because I rarely use them. 
-1	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because she has extensive experience in her field. She is backed by a degree specializing in her area and she's had no complaints from me or any other patients. She makes me feel comfortable.
-1	I've been seeing my current PCP for 9 years but he often forgets (even with my records in front of him) the nature of my chronic conditions. He is disorganized, abrupt, and has a tendency to dismiss my concerns
-1	I havent felt that my doctor has ever misled me in the past, nor given me bad advice. Whatever I went into the doctors for, eventually was healed or cured. 
1	I mean he's my primary doctor. If i can't trust him i would go find a new one. It's very important to have a doctor you trust in because if not you won't be able to get the treatment you deserve.
-1	When my doctor is not rushed and has time he always answers my questions and does not rush me.  When he is very busy I feel as though he ignores me and does not take what I say into consideration.  I trust him when he explains his decisions to me but I do not trust rushed and unexplained decisions.  
-1	I have never had a bad experience with a doctor. I always ask questions and have an open dialog. It works for me.
1	My doctor has taken an oath to provide the best care and help ensure I am healthy. I trust their advice and guidance in terms of my wellness. I have no reason to believe that my doctor is anything but straight forward with me.
-1	I had a doctor for years who was incredibly thorough and I did completely trust always. Unfortunately that doctor is no longer in practice. I have had experiences with other doctors that have led me to question whether they truly are thorough at all, and I don't have the level of trust with any of my current providers that I had with my former PCP. 
1	She shows me that she cares. She refers me to specialists when she's unsure, she follows up with me quickly, and she seems very knowledgeable.
-1	I somewhat distrust doctors in general to take the time to explain all treatment options because they are in such a hurry and want to get to the next patient to make more money. I don't think they want to waste time to followup when patients need additional explanation, help, or guidance with their situation.
-1	I don't feel I have a reason to doubt the sincerity of my primary care physician, as I feel that when I've gone to see him, he performs a thorough exam and blood work, etc., and has not recommended any courses of treatment that seemed suspect to me. Fortunately I have been very healthy and so have not really had many visits with him other than my yearly checkups, so I suppose I don't know if I can fully trust his decisions on treatment options, but I really don't have a reason to doubt him.
-1	I don't go to the Dr all the often, but when I did, it always seemed like he was in a rush. I would tell him what was ailing me, but it felt like he was just talking at me instead of to me. It felt like he never took me seriously. He has since moved on to another practice out of state, but I don't miss my former doctor at all.
1	She is a family friend. She takes the time to check on me as a person and not just what is written on the chart for the reason I am visiting her.  She touches up on multiple aspects of my life as far as family, physical activity, emotional state, and other things that may have an influence on my health.
1	For the most part, I put a great deal of trust in my doctors.  I listen to their diagnosis and try to ask relevant questions until I have a good understanding of the condition and subsequent treatment plan.  I do however try to verify on my own and if I do have more questions, I do not hesitate to get a second opinion from another reputable health care provider.  I have, however, not had a bad experience with the various doctors that I have sought treatment from. 
1	I have seen my primary physician for a number of years. He has always been thorough in hearing out my problems and then giving multiple options as how to treat the problems. All the times ive had to go see him the diagnosis and treatments he has recommended have been spot on
1	I very much trust my primary care physician. She is quite young but doesn't hesitate to scold or call me out when she's not happy with me. I don't like doctors or the whole medical process and she knows what buttons to push. She answers my questions patiently and explains her thought processes behind all her decisions. She very much talks to me and never through me and that's a huge plus. 
1	I trust my physician because I have known him for years. We used to work side by side in the hospital. I know without a doubt that he will tell me things honestly even if it goes against what his normal protocols are. I am fortunate to have this relationship with him.
-1	Really they are just humans like everyone else. They chose a career path, went to university for many years and got a job in the industry. How much they actually consolidated from their education is questionable. Often times it seems they're doing a lot of common sense work or things that a layman could figure out himself if he had access to the equipment and the internet. You also have to question if they have ulterior motives or reason to push medication that may not be the most advantageous. Their education is very very narrow as well, they don't often know much about natural medicine or even things like paleo diets or aspects/principles of primal living. I have to question what kind of person these doctors are and whether they even value their lives themselves because stepping back it looks like they slaved away at school just to become a doctor and deal with sick people all the time. A life like that would be miserable to me, so I wonder if some doctors even care about anything they are doing or if they are following a path for money or to impress others. 
-1	Sometimes I feel that my primary care physician is stretched too thin and sees too many patients. I realize he cannot remember everything, but he does have my electronic medical record readily available to him. I feel that often I have to repeat issues I have, and I don't think he is just testing my understanding. I think he has forgotten and not bothered to remind himself by reviewing my record. I also have to call the office because I will sometimes get test results before they call me about them. I don't think that my physician would intentionally harm me or lie to me, I just think that he is seeing too many patients - putting quantity over quality to make a profit.
1	I have always had trust in my primary physician.  He has a great bed-side manner and is very personable and explains things very well.  My father was a physician and I am able to relate to him because of this.  I also know that he his telling me the truth that I need to hear as this is the same things that I heard from my father.  I respect his years of service in the industry as well as he has practiced his trade for over 20 years.  I also trust the people that recommended this physician to me.
-1	"i haven't been to my primary in years because when i had a medical problem and i came to them they said they wouldn't do test because it wasn't their ""area"". they are general practitioners. everything is their area they could have taken blood and run labs and then refereed me but they didn't do anything  "
-1	I have been misdiagnosed so many times by doctors that I do not trust them to be able to help me in any capacity. They seem to have their own motives in mind and do not care about the actual problem I'm experiencing or finding a solution. I feel like the reason they are in their profession is solely to make as much money as they can.
-1	It is not that I do not trust my doctor, however, I am aware that my doctor is only trained in western medicine. I am open to remedies and treatments that western medicine may not be knowledgeable about or have believe works. I know that my doctor is limited due to their training. 
-1	Very few doctor visits are completely satisfactory, maybe because my expectations are too high. I think that if you see the medical profession as just another job, you tend to just try to go through and get over with any patient care at hand as quickly as you can. 
-1	I trust my primary care doctor for the most part because I develop an relationship with this person for a couple of years now. I know when I need something urgently, they will always be there when I go for help for me and my family.
-1	my doctor is only telling me whats best for me. He has my best interest in mind when I have an appointment with him. He is only trying to get me to stay healthy or get me back to that point.
-1	I do a LOT of research on my own, because I suffer from chronic conditions. When I see a doctor, they don't always mention all of the options available. The docs are double and triple booked in 15 minute time slots, so they don't have a lot of time with each patient. They hardly have the time to fully discuss EVERYTHING that's going on and maybe connect some dots that could be connected. 
-1	Again working in the medical field I see things that worry me and make me more cautious.  Such as, a Dr that delivers too many c sections because he has plans for the weekend and doesn't want to get called in. Or a doctor that doesnt explain appropriately to the patient, or even worse doesn't even see the patient and provides service thru only looking at a chart. 
-1	"I think the vast majority of doctors become insensitive to their patients and their problems.  In fact, I think they lose the ability to even recognize that their patients are people.  They seem to push whatever ""treatments"" benefit themselves the most financially, without any regard to how that's going to affect their patients financially or otherwise.  "
1	although trust has inherent as well as instrumental value for patients, clinicians, and healthcare institutions, trust can be misplaced, and distrust can be unjustified. Thus, if a physician reveals truthfully to a patient how s/he is paid, trust in the physician may diminish as a result of this trustworthy behavior.
-1	I trust that my primary care physician makes good choices and care about me. He is very knowledgeable about his expertise and always very patient to answer my questions. He will analysis different options to me and don't pressure me to make a choice he preferred.
1	The only real reason that I would not trust my PCP is that she is not an expert in a specific medical field. However, I trust her recommendations for specialists implicitly.
-1	"I don't trust my primary care physician because she didn't listen to me when I told her the things which were bothering the most. Instead she arranged expensive tests simply because I'm of an age where I need them and should have them first to rule out things before moving on to the things I am most concerned about. I understand that logic, but when a person is in pain and can pinpoint exactly where that pain is, this information shouldn't be ""put off"" in lieu of routine procedures, no matter if you are due for them or not. "
-1	"In the current times it seems doctors easily push the strongest drugs on a patient. By saying this I don't mean to suggest any link to the opioid crisis in the country. For instance, my last emergency care visit was last year when I had a kidney stone. This wasn't the first time I've ever had one (2nd time in the emergency room for it in 10 years), and they gave me extremely harsh prescriptions. One of the medications prescribed was Ciprofloxacin instead of pencillin to fight bacteria (I apparently had a UTI). After only taking ""Cipro"" a total of 3 times, it gave me deep pain in my joints that lasted for over 6 months. I could hardly walk and I definitely couldn't bend my knees. I think doctors  jump the gun with a lot of medications instead of starting ""small"" to see what works. I tend to believe doctors now are really careless with all the serious side effects because they spend so little time with patients."
-1	My primary care physician is okay for routine care, but I have never been so sick that I needed extra attention. If something big were to go wrong with my physician, I'm not sure I would trust her completely without a second opinion. She has been fine so far, but I'm generally healthy.
-1	Usually, when I have several questions about something that is going ion when my health, my doctor usually has all the answers to whatever my questions are to put my mind at ease. Sometimes, I have my doubts about the answers and then just google search more about when we talked about or on my visit I will ask more questions and he will answer them once again to put my mind at ease.
-1	Doctors in general seem to want to prescribe the most efficient treatment possible in my opinion. I've only ever had one experience where I felt like the doctor was rushing me along or not really listening to any concerns I had.
1	Overall, I trust my physician.  That isn't to say that I won't seek out more information on a subject after getting my physician's opinion.  I will take what she tells me as a stepping point to learning more for myself.  My physician has shown to be open to Western Culture health care in addition to Eastern Culture health care, and that matters to me.  She is always warm and kind, and strikes me as genuine.
-1	It's their job and usually their calling, so I trust them inasmuch as it makes sense. They're still fallible human beings and I don't mind seeking second opinions. 
1	Out of the plethora of doctors I have seen in my life, only two stand out; one I used to see in another state before we moved and my current doctor.  My current doctor tells it like it is and doesn't sugar-coat anything.  Actually, he is quite assertive with me and I respond well to that.
-1	I haven't been to the doctors in awhile, however, as alluded to in my previous answer, I don't believe dermatology doctor is through. I have had the same issues I presented to him over a year ago and he simple just keeps suggesting new types of medication instead of fixing the root cause.
1	All of the doctors that I have interacted with over the past few years have been understanding and compassionate about my current situations. Sometimes I feel like they haven't been completely helpful in finding solutions to some of our health problems, but I've never felt like they haven't been doing their best job to communicate and give me options. 
1	I think my doctor is often busy but is very concerned about my care. He does listen and tries to take time.  He cares more about what is good for me and will schedule more tests and or refer me to another doctor he knows and truest.  Overall he's very good but I always like to check on things myself so I do have to questions what he tells me or get a second opinion and he encourages this.  So far my primary care physician has been very accurate and has offered good advice or treatment.
1	I have been seeing the same primary care physician for 30 years and have established a long-standing and mutually respectful relationship.  While I trust her judgment completely, she also value my input and abides by my wishes if I prefer one plan of action over another.  when I need a referral to a specialist, she acts quickly.
-1	I trust my personal primary care physician because they seem competent and know what they are talking about. I am iffy with doctors because some of them may seem like they are out of touch with society. 
-1	I have been seeing my PCP for 10 years and he has always been very good in all ways until two years ago I was sick and nobody could figure out what was wrong. My Dr told me I was just beginning the change of life called perimenopause and had nothing to worry about. I knew that was not right I was much to sick for it to be normal. I went through 5 additional Drs trying to get answers and even specialists. I finally found one Dr who actually sat down and talked to me for an hour which never happens but he could see how sick I was and I had lost so much weight I weighed 81lbs....so he did a whole battery of blood tests and finally after 2 years of being mostly bedridden I had an answer. It was or could have been found in the beginning if my Dr would have listened to me and just did some bloodwork. After that I will go to my regular pcp but I don't trust him after that, he could have killed me. I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia which is a vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Thank God for that one Dr and my gut instincts.
1	The general care practitioner I go to is really good. They do the basics really well and I don't ever really require anything besides some antibiotics every 7-10 years anyway.
-1	Most doctors enter into their profession to help people.  Extensive training is required to become a doctor, so they should know what they are doing.
-1	My current primary care doctor is only concerned with my weight. In her mind any issue that arises could be solved if I would lose some weight. She always makes sure the address my weight at each visit and ensure that I am aware of the negative ways that being overweight could affect me. She assumes that I will become addicted to certain medications just because I am overweight.
1	I've being going to my doctor for over 35 years.  I trust him explicitly.  He has always been there for me and my family.
-1	I typically trust my primary care physician unless they are inattentive or give me a reason not to trust them. If they lose my trust then I just find a new doctor and I do not give them the chance to betray me a second time. 
1	My family and I have been with the practice for a long time. The experience is always comfortable and open and honest.
-1	I mostly trust my primary care doctor. I trust them in addressing my concerns and treating my problem appropriately. Sometimes, I feel like doctors differ over what treatment option is best so I get a second opinion.
-1	I have had several doctors over my lifetime and I don't trust quite a few of them. If they don't listen or believe what I report about my own health then I can't really trust them to make accurate diagnoses or appropriate treatments
1	I have used my doctor for almost 30 years as I had my son when I was 18. He was just started out in his practice. I have used him since then for my other two deliveries and as my primary physician for my yearly checkups. He goes above and beyond with his bedside manner and thoroughness. He took care of me throughout major complications with all of my pregnancies and I have three healthy children.
-1	I feel that my doctor has often gone out of her way to help since I am in a very dire financial situation. As well she has given me advice and recommendations for alternative treatments for certain problems I have had i.e.she does not believe that drugs are a cure-all but helps me get to the root of certain health conditions.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician. I sometimes go off of family/friends opinions of a doctor that I am seeing. In general I'm not sure that I trust doctors completely. I think that sometimes they aren't as thorough as they could be because they are trying to get you out of the office so that they can move on to the next patient.
1	My doctor changes about every year or two, but my most recent doctor has been very honest with me from day 1.
-1	I currently do not have a primary care physician, but the one that I previously had did not seem to care that much about me or understand how I was feeling. I distrusted her, because she didn't take much time to listen to what I had to say about my thyroid, symptoms, and she didn't act like she wanted to help me. I felt like my previous primary care physician treated me more like a number, rather than a patient.
-1	I trust my personal care provider most of the time. She errs on the side of caution. Some doctors at hospital are terrible at listening to complaints and refuse to consider the underlying pain when they hear the word cancer.
-1	I am currently between primary care physicians because my insurance coverage and physical location has changed several times recently. But when I did have a regular primary care physician(s) which I did for many years, I felt that in general I could trust them. However, in all cases I do my own research and use logic whenever possible. I try to avoid any and all medications, which I feel is too often the focus of physicians, to push drugs. For that reason, I canât say that I ever have complete trust in a doctor.  I take pretty much anything a physician might say or do with a âgrain of saltâ, always considering the possibility that the drug factor could be playing a significant role.
-1	I really think that this person may have an asian fetish and think of me as a geisha.  It really makes me feel uncomfortable.
1	I have never had a reason to distrust them. I have had a somewhat wrong diagnosis in the past, but this wasn't a major issue and they directed me to someone who could provide me with a more accurate diagnosis and method of treatment. 
-1	She is a fine doctor, but very busy and does not seem to spend the time necessary to think through all of the options or which option is most likely - she picks something that might be an answer and we move forward.  It's OK, I trust that she is being honest, but I don't trust that she has the right answer.
-1	I think she is very intelligent and is definitely capable of taking care of my needs. She also makes a point to pay attention to my input about things. 
-1	When i trust my doctor, it helps to create a better relationship between the two of us. Those who distrust the doctor may end up being combative, and that is not conducive to good health. Of course, trusting your doctor starts when you have a good doctor that is professional
1	He makes the time to talk with me and ask me if I have any questions. He never seems to be in a rush or rush me. He has made good decisions for me in the past.
-1	As a human being I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, unless they prove otherwise. As far as regarding my relationship with my primary physician, I would say it is mostly trustworthy. But I do not put pass anybody moving in a way of their own benefit. I am in my sound mind when it comes down to my health, you can not pay enough for it, and it is very precious. So with that being said I trust me only. My health is very important for me. I try to be well versed in it myself, so I can know what is going on with me. My body is my temple.
1	I trust my primary care physician, in part because my father, who was also a physician had recommended him. All my interactions with him are positive and he has genuine concern and interest in my health.
1	I have a complete trust  my primary care physician.They dont lie about my health reports and provide me actual information about my health.They even help me understood if anything is hard know about my health conditions.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I've been going to her for quite some time and she's been pretty good at keeping me healthy. She knows my health and my needs so well, I almost feel like my chart is the only one in her file. I've asked other people in the office for their opinion on our doctor and all the responses seem to be very favorable. The office staff seems to be very knowledgeable and attentive. It really doesnât bother me to go to my primary care physician at all because I know Iâm going to feel better. 
-1	I mostly trust her, but I feel that she is very rushed and asks few questions. I feel like she does not ask enough questions. This is compared to previous doctors I've had in the past.
-1	I trust my doctor to an extent. They seem very passionate and wonderful whenever I am a patient, but it's hard to get in touch with them. They don't always have great follow through and they always seem rushed. 
1	My doctor always takes an extended amount of time to discuss all of my issues with me and make sure that I understand them. He is willing to do whatever I would like to make me feel comfortable and taken care of. He is bluntly honest and makes sure I know all of the side effects of my medications and whether or not I should be concerned about them. He has been right in every diagnosis he has given me so far. 
-1	I think generally I do trust my doctor, however, I think that ultimately after listening to my doctor any decisions about my health are basically mine and I don't always agree with my doctor. I had doctors who would tell me I needed procedures, that I don't think would have been right for me, so I I would seek another doctor. I also feel like some doctors are only interested in money and aren't interested in your well being.I have had doctors bill me for things I didn't get or charge me for cancelling an appointment.
-1	In most doctor I don't have a whole lot of trust. This is based on my experiences in life. I have had some good experiences as well. Not all doctors are bad.
1	I have worked hard to find a physician who will listen to and believe me when I talk about my health.  My doctor not only listens but acts on what I am telling her.  I trust her because we work as a team when it comes to my health concerns.
1	I have been using my doctor since I was a child.it was our family doctor and I have kind of grown with him as I have aged.he has always been right
-1	I have been seeing my PCP for almost 8 years, so we have developed a pretty good relationship, and I do trust her. I trust her so much that my children also see her. There are some areas that I feel she isn't expert on, but that is why she refers us to specialists.
-1	I am not currently on pain medication, but if I were I would be extremely wary of having only one doctor's opinion due to the prescription opiate addiction epidemic that is sweeping the United States. 
-1	I trust him because he has taken care of the sickness I have had and my family has had.  I do sometimes have trouble understanding what the nurses call me back about for diagnosis
-1	"I believe that doctors see a lot of people and give a lot of ""canned"" answers that are probably good advice but aren't tailored to each person individually."
1	They treat me as a friend. Being a medical professional they done use word to dum down what is being discussed. I much rather they tell me using the medical term vs trying to avoid miscommuication
1	I've been going to the same doctor since I was an infant.  He's well known in town and well liked.  He spends as much time as you need NEVER giving you the feeling that he's rushed.  Never.  He sits and listens quietly and intently to what you have to say.  Which also makes the patients outside waiting impatient and complain until they get in the room and he shows them the same patient listening to their symptoms, issues.  That's why I wait patiently when I'm waiting because I know what he's doing.  
-1	Its been a mixed bag for me some doctors are really good at what they do and others not so much, its been 5050 for me so far. its rather difficult and finding a good doctor has been inconsistent 
1	I fully trust my doctor because I know her personally outside of the doctor's office. She also delivered our child and I have seen her in action. I trust her.
1	My primary care physician belongs to a practice which both myself, my wife and several of our friends have been patients in for many years. They have great reputations in the community. Additionally, my physician has excellent bedside manners, is very easy to talk to and always asks if there is anything that they can do better during the course of my visits. My primary care physician makes me feel comfortable and secure in knowing that they are giving the best attention possible.
-1	I know doctors just want to push pills most of the time. I have been fortunate to find a doctor who would rather treat me with something natural first before going to extreme measures. I have had doctors int he past who just want to prescribe something and want you to stick to it no matter what.
-1	I fully believe she is doing her best, The current health care system piles workloads on top of the short supply of doctors. Due to the high workload and the short amount of time available for each patient they are not nearly as thorough as one would like. Also due to time constraints and information sharing problems they are almost never up to date on your files and past Labs, ext. They put out health fires but do little to promote general good health and long term goals. I also feel there is a long gap between current medical research and what is being practiced at the physician level, i believe in the worst cases there are old doctors practicing the medicine they learned in college, when 30 years of new science is being ignored. 
-1	I trust doctors because they are extremely knowledgeable but they can make mistakes because they work in a fast pace high stress environment
1	I trust her because she is extremely personable, takes her time to really understand ALL my symptoms. She discussed different options and different ways of handling everything and gives me a set of difference choices based on my needs. She even seeks out sheaper medications due to my low income
1	I'VE BEEN SEEING THE SAME DOCTOR FOR OVER 15 YEARS AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND FORTHCOMING WITH ME. THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE TIME I CAN THINK OF WHERE I QUESTIONED WHAT I WAS TOLD REGARDING MY HEALTH
-1	I neither trust nor distrust my primary care physician. I believe in looking at the relevant information around you in a skeptical, but pragmatic way. You must neither let your suspicions about doctors fool you into not taking their advice all the time nor should you overly trust everything they tell you. It is, after all, completely up to you in the end to come upon the best course of action concerning your health.
-1	I am not sure if I completely trust my primary care physician because he seems more concerned about liability or convenience at times rather than in the welfare of the patient. He is not as open to answering questions about medical care. He also is not as uptodate on treatments and may recommend something that he is familiar with but may not be as effective as more new or modern treatments.
-1	I have issues with my primary care physician.  I scheduled sick visits (reluctantly, because it is so expensive) only to come out of the office with more questions than I started with.  Recently I went in for issues with my hands and I knew the diagnosis the doctor gave me was completely off the mark.  He spent very little time examining me.
1	The doctors I have had throughout my life have always been good to me.  I have never had any problems with them.  I am very confident in them no matter what the situation is.
1	I trust my dr because he is always up front and honest with me and tells me all. He always listens to my concerns and is always listening and helping me out. He is a caring dr. Not one that just gets you in and out to make money.
-1	It is really hard for me to trust anybody. Also, a lot of doctors are only out for themselves. However, I have had about 8 surgeries and all of my surgeons were awesome and I trust the surgeons! 
1	My doctor has my best interests at heart and u believe this to be true because he shows genuine interest in my well being and my day to day life decisions that may affect my health and self worth
1	My doctor is human like, not robot like. They show they care. They show that they aren't perfect but they try to do what is best for me.
-1	I trust my physician to be analyzing any potential issues and recommending appropriate and safe treatments for me in order to recover.
1	I believe that most doctors are good hearted; they do their best for the patient, Iâve only have a few bad moments with some doctors, but in general they are to be trusted.
-1	I sometimes feel doctors are overbooked and a result hurry too much with each patient. I also feel that sometimes they are a bit too confident in what they think and dont explore other options well enough just to be safe.
1	I have had my doctors for several years now. We've built a relationship and I do trust them to share information with me freely and that we will choose the best course of action together. 
-1	Many times they simply do not listen to concerns especially in relation to medications. They tend to trust too much in medications that can cause serious side effects and don't realize how much they can negatively impact your life. Specifically I was given medication that was not working well for me but the doctor kept telling me to give it time. I listened and regretted it. I lost most of my hair and gained about 40 pounds by the time I gave up and stopped taking the medication. The doctor was not empathetic or concerned about the effects but the experience had a very negative and lasting affect on my life. I've had more than my share of negative outcomes due to poor medical advice. My son also went through years of unnecessary treatment due to a misdiagnosis. So I can't say that I fully trust any doctor's medical advice.
-1	"Because many doctors are either a) trying to get through patients as quickly as possible; b) trying the safest (and not always most effective) solutions that minimize their own liability; c) have a ""band aid"" approach to medicine that treats symptoms rather than the underlying cause, and d) depend on medications and writing prescriptions. Furthermore, most doctors are not interested in preventative care and have very little good advice on nutrition. "
-1	I feel like doctors often dismiss what a patient is saying- and roll with their accumulated knowledge of what is actually happening with a patient's medical issue. You can almost see them smirk at times when you describe something.
-1	Personally, I distrust my primary care doctor because she is always in a hurry and rarely takes the time out of to fully listen to me. She is always leaving the room and doing multiple things at once not being fully immersed in my care. 
1	I had the chance to review other physicians before choosing the actual one. I have also learned from a close family ember about my doctor's qualities. He indeed proved to be very professional and also close to his patients.
1	All of my physicians are thorough, personable, and genuine. They never make me feel rushed or like they only do things that are convenient for them. They always provide me with extensive information while weighing in on the pros and cons of each possible outcome. 
-1	Faith based, honest, she is very thourough when I come in to see her seems concerning. The nurses aid is very helpful as well. If u don't have trust in your doctor then you need to change
1	I trust my primary care physician because this person has had many, many years of school, and dedicated their life to making sure they explore, examine and treat those that are in their care for different illnesses. I have little medical knowledge so I always listen to my physician. However, that doesn't mean I listen blindly. I always do my own research and get a second opinion.  
-1	in the past she has misdiagnosed me when i was having pain problems, but most of the time she has been very thorough and good
1	I have been with my PCP for over 20 years and we have pretty much grown up together (HA).  She is very careful and complete in her care for me.  She has usually been right is her recommendations for any treatment I have needed.  However, I always will retain my right to make my own healthcare decisions if I disagree with her recommendation.
-1	I believe the medical field is too dependent on money, creating big profits while minimizing care to patients.  This trickles down most heavily on the doctors who make the call to run certain tests or not and to dedicate enough time to caring for patients.  I believe there is too much pressure on doctors to overmedicate patients as well.
-1	"Normally and previously I have had total confidence in her. However recently my medical needs have started to conflict with what is ""popular"" to do because of certain topics in the media. Though no one has told me that is the reason. I have been given NO reason why I'm being denied effective treatment. "
-1	I trust because he has valued me in a correct way and I consider him to be a capable person since he has experience and many patients have been valued by him and I feel satisfied with this
1	I trust my primary care physician. My primary care physician always tells me what is going on with my health and answers all of my questions. She recommends things and tells me how I might feel during procedures which turned out to be true.
-1	My primary care doctor is new to me, so Iâll answer about doctors in general. I have a lot of experience with doctors, and for the most part I think they are honest and trustworthy. But I know that in a busy clinic that has a lot very ill patients, there is  a lot of shuffling of priorities. One day you may have the doctorâs full attention, other days you may not. Also, Iâve had enough errors in my treatment over the years (none fatal) to know that doctors and nurses are not infallible. They prescribe the wrong dosage, or donât fully investigate drug interactions, etc.
1	I know him personally as a friend and have worked with him in the past, before he was a doctor. So I also know him professionally.
1	I have a holistic doctor, who is a trained MD and oriental medicine practitioner. I trust her guidance and follow her instructions, but I don't ignore my own intuition if it conflicts with what she says.
1	My primary care doctor is caring and seems very wise. She has been a doctor for many years and always has good answers to my questions. I've verified many things she's told me on websites such as Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins and she is always correct.
-1	I like that the dr takes the time to listen and make sure to understand what is going on and to make me feel like a person that can get better and do well.
1	I have a big trust in my doctor because he has chosen his profession because he wants to help people achieve good health and good life.  I feel that my doctor has no reason to give me something that would jeopardize my health and my life.
-1	I trust them because they know more than me but am still apprehensive at times. As long as they listen to me. 
-1	I have never had problems with them.  They always listen to me, as they know I have some medical background, and then we discuss options.  I always leave appointments knowing that it was the right decision.
-1	Doctors now days are taught to get a patient in and out.  Very few take the time to really hear what you are saying and even fewer spend the time that is needed to find out what the root problem is.  They usually give you some med and it is just a band-aid and you will have to come back at a later time.  Some older physicians still take time but most of the young ones do not.
-1	I feel like doctors today are too busy.  They aren't thorough on examinations and do not make sure you understand what they are telling you.  Their practice earns money in volume so they move people in and out as fast as possible.
1	I completely trust my Doctor because my Doctor haven't given me any reason not to. My Doctor has never prescribed me something or recommend any kind of treatment that I was skeptical of, everything my Doctor has said to me I didn't really have reason to question it.  
-1	I don't distrust my doctor, but he's human and no one knows everything. When it comes to my health, if its a serious issue not just a cold, I always want to get another opinion. 
-1	I some what trust but sometimes I feel like I am not being heard and the doctor is always in such a rush that he doesn't listen to me
-1	It is not that I do not trust my doctor as much as I am aware that he is human, has a lot on his plate and is therefore subject to error.  I do believe in getting a second option when I don't believe that a concern is been met.
1	i trust my doctor, she seems very capable and have a lot of knowledge, i always follow her instructions and get better
1	My doctor has shown to be really caring and trustworthy over the years that I have known him. He has never led me wrong and always seems to know what he's talking about involving my health.
1	I find my self without any reason whatsoever as to why I should not trust my doctor. I have always followed his transcriptions and every time I get cured. I therefore have gained a lot of confidence and trust in him. 
-1	Like I stated before, sometimes I feel as if physicians are so overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people they are seeing that they do not conscientiously take the time they should to sit and explain, question, discuss with their patients. My parents have both been on the bad end of their primary care physician not doing what he was supposed to do. One time he even made a very bad prescription for my mother that could have been very deadly if the pharmacist had not caught the mistake and called him on it. Physicians are trying to see too many and utilizing the factory model that the United States has fit to everything from labor to schools to prisons.
-1	I trust them for the most part. It's an extreme amount of school and experience required to be one so they aren't messing around. Though, sometimes, they are in a rush and your problem may be really low acuity in their eyes so they may hastily treat you.
1	I haven't been to my primary care physician in a while due to no longer having health insurance, but I'll do my best to explain. I typically take good care of myself and try to avoid going to the doctor's office at all costs. The main reason that I would visit her is because of my IBS, which is something that she also suffers from, so I know that she understands what I'm going through. More generally, you never feel like you're being rushed. She always listens to whatever you need to say about your issues, no matter how long you go on about it.
-1	In general I trust my primary care physician as they have demonstrated their honesty in the past. Additionally, I trust most doctors in general. Furthermore, it takes a certain type of personality to be a primary care physician. They are stereotypically honest, trustworthy, and caring.
1	In a couple of different appointments, I've asked about certain treatments or options for ailments and my doctor is very forthcoming.  Normally if he thinks it's overpriced hogwash, he'll give me his honest opinion.  He's also happily given me referrals to doctor's offices and recommendations to quality referrals for things that are recommended like an annual skin screening to proactively prevent skin cancer.  I think sometimes doctor's can be a little pill happy to offer them unnecessarily, but mine is usually more calculated and cares about finding a solution. In addition, his thoroughness actually saved a friend's life of mine when she had been complaining and struggling through a health problem with her other doctor, he uncovered a serious situation and got her the care she needed.
1	In general I trust my primary care physician. I haven't had a reason ever to distrust him. He has always been helpful and courteous, I think the care is of good quality.
1	I like my primary care physician, he treats me fairly and gives me good advice. He also lets me know when he feels I need to do something to improve my health.
1	I like my COP because he seems to care. He doesn't rush me. If he's unable to give me an answer, he has no issue Googling it to figure out a good solution instead of insisting it's not true or he knows better. His humour doesn't hurt either. 
-1	My doctor has found and been able to diagnoses what other doctors just left untreated..I completely trust my Doctor and his team of staff.I would recommend anybody and everybody to my doctor.
1	the dr I refer to is my oncologist who has treated me for Stage IV breast cancer that is metastatic.  It will be 6 yrs in July that I was diagnosed and also had major surgery to remove a mass in my colon that was also cancerous.  I feel without their careful and thoughtful medical expertise I may not be alive.  I see my oncologist to check my lab levels and also to receive the next round of oral chemotherapy.  I feel it is in my best interest to trust him and I do.
-1	I donât anyone should have complete trust in doctors. Different doctors can offer different opinions. A lot of doctors are also in the pocket of large pharmaceutical companies. 
1	I trust my doctor to some extent where she is trying to give me medicine and helping me stay healthy but at the same time my total belief is in God.
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I feel like she dismisses a lot of what I say except for what she wants to hear and treat. For example, I suffer from depression and anxiety and all she does is prescribe medication that doesn't work. Sometimes my anxiety is out of control and I get very little sleep. I have a medication that is not working for me and she just keeps adjusting the dosage and it still doesn't help. This has been going on for over a year. She takes my high blood pressure and cholesterol very serious but doesn't give me much help other than a diet and exercise and medicine. The practice has also become much more busy than it used to be and I feel like sometimes her mind is someplace else because of that.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has been our family doctor for more than 15 years and all his diagnostics and treatments have been accurate. He always gives us advises and we feel that he cares about our well being.
-1	I do have a primary care physician. She and I have known each other for many decades. We frequently disagree with each other, though I'm confident that she has my best interests in heart...but her business office, my insurance, other third parties, et al. that are mostly concerned with their bottom-line can and do interfere.
-1	Sometimes doctors recommend certain medications because they get a percentage of the revenue and I dont like it because they could probably recommend something cheaper to you but they just want to make money
-1	I trust my primary care physician as she is very thorough and wants to help get down to why something is bothering you.  I don't always trust that she is 100% present as she is very busy, only works two days a week, and has a packed schedule. I frequently have to wait a very long time while at the appointment before I see her, and I wonder how focused she is.  I feel like I'm inconvniencing her with my issues.
-1	I mostly trust my PCP. Of all the doctors I've seen in my life, he's better than most when it comes to listening to my problems and trusting that medical issues I bring up need to be addressed; a lot of doctors I've seen will try to explain away symptoms or avoid doing more tests. But even he's not perfect, although maybe his medical judgment and my instincts may sometimes be in conflict.
1	My primary care physician has always helped me with my problems or illnesses.  She is conservative and will start with the easiest remedy to see if that works first but is always open to taking the next step.  She listens to and answers my questions and seems to care about me.
1	I have a few doctors I see regularly. They are all very dependable, capable, and intelligent. I don't see any reason not to trust them.
-1	He spends a long time with me and makes sure I have a lot of reading material to take home. He makes sure in depth that everything is okay and makes sure to run regular tests.
-1	I had a LEEP procedure twice last year. I trust my doctor because She is professional and I am not. However, after having first procedure, She recommended me to have another procedure even though my after procedure result was negative. According to her, Just make sure all bad tissue is taken away by taking bigger portion . So, I followed her recommendation because she is very careful person, but on the other hand, I feel having second procedure is really needed or not.
-1	I know that they know what they are talking about but I feel that I get lost in the shuffle of other patients. I feel like they are quick with me to move on to the next person. I really don't know what to believe when it comes to what my doctors are telling me. I believe about half.
-1	I trust doctors because that's the only gap between dying from a cold and living with cancer. I believe doctors are really important and valuable to the world for the sense of security and safety. They are the closest things to magicians due to the miracle they are able to perform.
-1	Do not think they give you a lot to pick from as they get a kick back for the drugs the prescribe. Would get at least 3 different opinions before I would make a decision.
-1	My husband and I have the same doctor.  She always does and suggests many solutions to any problem we are experiencing.  The always trouble shoots are issues, and suggest tests.  I feel that she genuinely cares about her patients.
1	I trust my particular primary care physician because she is a friend of mine.  Most importantly, I trust her character.  I know that she cares deeply for people and takes her job very seriously.  I know that she has done a great deal of personal research on many health topics, especially those pertaining to women and children.  She also takes a holistic approach to medicine which I appreciate.  
-1	I mentioned my extreme anxiety and how i just couldn't relax no matter what I tried. She told me that I just needed to walk out in the sun everyday and completely cut out caffeine and I'll be cured. She did blood work for my hypothyroidism and did a cholesterol test with it. The test came back I had high cholesterol and she put me on a medication they just called into the pharmacy and she didn't talk to me about anything. Just told me to take the pill.
1	I for the most part trust my primary care physician. They always seem to give me the best information and always give me the correct treatment for my illnesses. 
-1	I do trust my doctors. I went to the same doctor for 21 years and when I turned 21 I was referred to a new doctor by my old doctor who I had good communication with and I believe that he referred me to a new doctor because he understood what I needed as a patient and that this doctor could help me. 
-1	Sometimes for the same symptoms different specialist give way different, sometimes opposite prognosis, so there are many things they disagree with one another in, that makes me nervous.
-1	I generally trust him, but I don't completely trust everything they evaluate. He is just a person with his own biases after all. but I generally think of him as credible
1	I have been going to the same physician for many years, and have built a great deal of trust with her.  She understands me and my health history and needs.  
1	My primary care doctor is always willing to take as much time as we need at each appointment to cover all of my medical concerns. She is also always willing to listen to any concerns I have and doesn't brush me off.
1	I assume that our doctors are trustworthy. They undergo a minimum of seven years of postgraduate schooling, pass rigorous tests and are responsible for our health and the health of our families. But in recent times there are few cases in which doctors are not considering as trustworthy. So I think it is better to check few things before preferring doctor.There are several doctor-rating websites where patients share their reviews and experiences with physicians.
1	He asks me questions about myself and my family with genuine interests. He asks me my opinion and explains things to me without me asking. His team seems knowledgeable and coordinated. I feel like more than a number or source of income.
1	I trust my doctor I have been going to him for about 10 years if he has any doubt about what is wrong he refers me to a specialist. 
-1	I have had plenty of experiences with doctors where they don't even seem to exam whatever concern you have, they just brush it off or prescribe something so that they can get on with their day. Rather than really looking into something, i think they'd rather just treat everything as if its routine even if it isn't. Add on the fact that I can walk into a doctor's office and see a cutout of a pharmaceutical that they are being paid to push and it makes me feel like they're here to be salesmen instead of helping.
-1	I haven't seen a doctor in a long time, and my recent visit had me feeling a bit wary about everything. I was worried about the cost of everything, and listening to my doctor talk about going to see some specialist for one thing, and a specialist for another thing made me very alert and unwilling to agree to either one. I just don't believe I have complete trust in the American Healthcare System and its practices, in regards to cost for the patient. I.e. a saline bag being charged at $100, when they are manufactured at perhaps $0.25
-1	I chose neutral because I currently do not have a primary care doctor. My medical needs are usually taken care of at an Immediate Care center due to health insurance.
-1	Well sometimes i feel as if my doctor doesn't take the time to really look at me i know they are in a hurry but they could spend just a little more time
-1	I don't currently have a primary care physician because I switched insurance providers and still need to select one.  Basically, I've seen too many things go wrong with friends and relatives' doctors, and I'm pretty paranoid about doctors in general. I inherently don't trust them and want to avoid them. Also, I think I have a form of hypochondria where I'm always afraid of something being wrong and so just want to avoid it.
-1	I've had family members with doctors who have rushed them thru things, misdiagnosed or allowed very serious illnesses to remain undiagnosed, and not been careful enough in prescribing and monitoring the effect of medications. There are good doctors but I think in the US nowadays if you want to be assured you're getting the best care possible from your physician then you must be vigilant and persistent. I would be wary of any doctor even tho I know most don't mean to cause harm.
1	My doctor is generally aware of my needs and the needs of my family. I always feel a level of personal care and attention when  I am in her office
1	I've been going to the same doctor my entire life and he's always been a great help in helping diagnose and eliminate the various viruses, infections, and flues that I caught throughout in my life. I've had no reason to not trust him for the entirety of my life. So, ever since I was a child, I've learned to trust my doctor.
1	My PCP has been treating me a long time and has went out of her way to help me with new treatments and with exploring different treatment plans when traditional ones weren't working. She would also visit me during hospitalizations which has given me a lot of reasons to trust her and feel she is looking out for me. 
-1	I believe my doctor as well as the majority of doctors do keep my best interest in mind. To be in such a field shows and proves that they care about people's well being in general. I feel it is more of the patient who do not follow through with doing what is right for them
-1	I trust them to do the right thing because they studied a long time, took an oath to help patients, and should care about people.  I have to trust them.
1	My doctor is completely honest with me no matter what as I allow him to be.  If Iâm over weight heâll tell me, if I have high blood pressure he will tell.  He tells me all these things looking me straight in they eyes and letâs me know all the bad things that can possibly happen if I donât do better. Death, stroke, being paralyzed.  This is why I trust my doctor 
1	I do not have a primary care physician.  I do feel that the majority of doctors are going to try their best to do what is in the best interest of their patients. 
-1	I work in the medical field and I understand the way that pcps interact with their patients. Sometimes admin gets in the way of getting things done and this can impede the patient process, sometimes doctors are burnt out and are sacrificing patient outcomes for their own gains.
1	She spends a good deal of time with me during my appointments.  I never feel rushed, and she appears to genuinely listen when I ask her a question.  I'm also able to carry on a constructive dialogue with her, where I share my own opinions.
-1	"For the most part I do trust my Dr, but at times I feel like she is rushed. Last time I was there I had told her that I had hurt my back and my chiropractor did a MRI and I found out I had degenerative disc disease. I asked her if she had someone she would refer me to if I needed injections. She acted like it wasn't a big deal and said ""ya, we dot that all the time."" I guess I would have felt better if she had asked to obtain a copy of the MRI (or look to see if she had it, as I gave her name when it was done) and look at the extent of damage and give me some names. I also feel like she doesn't look at previous issues and see if I have had any symptoms relating to those. "
-1	I basically trust my primary care physician because she is extremely experienced and seems caring, and her treatment recommendations seem appropriate.
-1	I trsut my primary care doctor for the most part. However, i do feel as though they rush me out and dont take as much time as necessary.
1	My doctor has shown me that she is thorough and caring. In the few times I have thought that she might be wrong on something - it turns out that she was right! As far as I am concerned, my doctor has a great batting average when it comes to health, so I am with her for the long haul. 
1	I have full trust in my PCP. I have never in all the years I have been seeing her had one issue. She always makes me feel comfortable and answers all questions and concerns I have. She doesn't always take drastic measures but takes things slow to get to a solution. 
-1	Doctors in general are pretty untrustworthy I think. I think part of my reasoning for that comes from knowing that they push samples on people for their own profit and that they're really overworked and don't have time to really hear you. I saw a video recently about a bunch of people who saw multiple doctors and every doctor was brushing them aside and saying it was nothing when really it was ovarian cysts and split nerves and doctors just didn't take the time to care. So I think I've always felt this way but that recent video kinda watered the seed that was already planted in my head so to speak. 
-1	"The doctor's clinic I go to often wants to run a bunch of tests which I think are often unnecessary. And because my insurance isn't that great, I end up paying thousands of dollars. Last year I had to pay $600 for a lyme disease test that my dr. thought I should get because I garden a lot. Every single time I go, a $40.00 charge for 'smoking counseling' shows up on my bill. But it is literally a five second conversation of ""You smoke?"" and me saying yes and the doctor saying ""you should quite"". No joke, nothing more than that 5 second sentence and they charge 40.00. I think it is a huge scam. "
-1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years. They spend ample time listening to any symptoms or issues that I have to present before making any form of diagnoses or prescribing medications. They also take the time to fully explain any diagnoses to me at that time. 
-1	My primary care physician is kind and he listens but I feel he is often in a hurry and hears my words but only the ones that he wants to. He wants to order more test on top of more tests and sends me to other doctors that I can not afford even after I express to him that I do not have the finances to go to others. 
-1	The medical field in my observation us more focused on insurance and getting paid well rather than helping people. It is all about how much money the medical field can get and with insurance how much the insurances can save on patients.
-1	i trust him too much because of the years, what he has advice me had never proving to be false. he is so caring and approachable. he tell me what is needed and not what i wants to hear. he is such a wonderful man. also he put patience first before money.
1	My doctor is a very down to earth person. I think that he and I have a lot in common. We are able to talk freely with him and have agreed on almost everything that we have every talked about. The decisions that he has made thus far I have agreed with and would anticipate that he would continue to make decisions in the future that I agree with.
1	I found from my past experiences that my primary care physician treatment opinions are best for my good health. As the result I have full trust in my primary care physician.
-1	My doctor usually rushes through, spends bare minimal time with me.  He makes me feel like I don't know my own body. He usually tries to push his opinions on me. 
-1	In general, I trust my primary care physician. I think she is trying her best to provide good medical care to meet my  needs.  However, I think sometimes she may not listen to my point of view and may instead rely on her own experiences and training too much, as opposed to seeing what may work uniquely for me as an individual.  However, I do feel like she cares and does a thorough job overall.
-1	I trust my primary care physician she is always so helpful and nice. She has been with me for a very long time. Ive been with her for over 10 years. She has helped me through a lot of medical issues I have had.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician. In general, I expect and believe that doctors want to help people and be honest with them about their medical conditions. But, they can be busy or overworked. They might be a bit busy and not focus as much on patients as they would like.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because so far she has not given me any reason not to trust her. She has really good online reviews and so far my experiences with her have been pleasant.
1	I have gone to the same doctor my entire life. He has been my family's doctor for many years. My family and I trust him completely. He has always been very honest and has always taken the time to answer all my questions.
1	My Primary Care physician is incredible. She's relatable and kind and takes the time to address any concerns I have. I trust her completely.
-1	I trust that most doctors truly have their patient's well being in mind when they recommend courses of action. Most doctors that I have seen have been very open with me about my treatment options and about finding what is affordable for me at the time.
-1	I think that they are not intentionally trying to do wrong by me. However, I do know that doctors often do not have the time to keep up to date with all of the latest advances in healthcare. So it's important to double-check any recommendations yourself.
1	I trust my primary care because I have to be able to rely on them to help me make informed medical decisions.  I also need to be able to trust my doctor to explain to me the best course of action.
-1	Generally, i do trust my physician, but I also feel that they see me so rarely, and see so many other patients, that they are not able to provide the best recommendation.
-1	I distrust my doctor because I feel that I'm just a check to them. I sometimes leave feeling that nothing had been accomplished by my visit and that my suggested treatment was the most convenient for them. I've also been misdiagnosed at least once to my knowledge.
-1	When I had serious medical complications, my doctor sent me to a specialist rather than trying to deal with the situation himself. I feel confident that he actually cares about my well-being.
-1	I place trust in my doctor, but have not done so blindly. I take everything with a grain of salt, at least initially. I have been with my PCP for a significant amount of time now, an dI understand and trust their judgement when it comes to matters of my health, though I could not say the same for other doctors with whom I am not a patient. I mainly base my trust on my experience with my PCP, which has been by far one of the best 'professional' relationships I have had in my life.
-1	I have only had one bad experience with a doctor and that was more about billing and paperwork than the actual care. When a doctor gives me an opinion I generally accept it and follow their advice. So far in life that has not let me down.
-1	"I haven't seen a doctor in over a year; I had to have stitches in my arm due to an accident. I'll use that experience to explain here. The doctor I saw was very trustworthy, in my view. The first thing he did when he saw me - before he even said a word to me - was put on gloves and poke/prod a lipoma near my eye. I had seen my doctor about it years previous so I knew it wasn't anything to be concerned with, but having a doctor who goes ""hey, this guy is here for stitches.. but I'm going to take a brief moment and check out this other thing that I'm not even going to put on the record"" really made me feel as if he was looking out for me. I really appreciated that. When we got to looking at my arm, he explained how I was lucky because if the cut had been just a small amount deeper I'd need surgery (of course today I couldn't use the terminology that he did, but at the time I fully understood everything he was saying -- if you're a redditor, it was very ELI5). However, when speaking with my normal doctors.. sometimes it seemed as if they weren't really paying attention to what I was saying. For example, when I was in the military I told my primary care physician that it didn't matter what time I would lay down, I could not go to sleep. His response to me was ""go to bed earlier"". He eventually sent me to see the base psych and I was given medications that helped."
-1	I have had bad experiences in the past with doctors and i have learned what to look out for when it comes to bad care.
-1	I generally trust my doctor but I feel like with the workload they have that sometimes I need to be responsible in following through or asking the right questions in order to make sure I get the right help.
1	there have been times in the past I thought the doctor was not taking my high cholesterol as serious as they should.  However,  I changed my diet and worked out and brought  my level down without medicine so I am glad I did not rely on the drugs. 
-1	I want to be able to fully trust my doctors but sometimes when I ask for further information about my specific problem, they don't seem to want to go into details which makes me doubt them. I also feel when they try to lump things to past problems I've been dealing with instead of looking at the problem individually I begin to distrust their judgement. 
-1	I never fully trust a doctor because I know they are just human beings. As a lawyer, I understand that there are many people who can go through medical school and come out under-qualified.
-1	I do think doctors have a lot of pressure to get one patient done and move onto the next; hence lapses in high quality service.  My doctor is careful, but could probable be a little more detailed.  Also, I can do research on my own to determine what medication I need and know my medical history well enough to know what medication doesn't work well or causes a reaction.  
-1	I trust my PCP and one other doctor. Following that, I usually trust male docs I donât know if he doesnât jump into the examination and gives me time to feel him out. Talks a bit, etc. I canât trust women doctors. :( (Personal history). To be fair, I donât have a feeling that most are not in it for the right reason, not as a business venue.
-1	My dr and i believe that most dr's are too by the book.  They see a person as a payment or a number rather than an individual. This causing them to just use us as test subjects to kind of see what works rather than really getting to know us and our bodies. 
1	I have not had a reason not to  trust him, everything he has recommended thus far has been accurate with no reason to question his decisions.  
-1	I feel I haven't seen my newest Dr. enough to have complete trust in them. They do give me my options and seem knowledgeable in what they are doing. I do however always have some worries as to if sometimes they are just being paid by some drug companies to give certain meds out or prescribe certain treatments.
1	My doctor has known me since I was young and knows my entire medical history. He always takes the time to go over my symptoms and questions with me.
1	I have never personally had an experience with a doctor that would make me not trust a doctor's advise.  I believe that in general doctors do have their patients best interest in mind. 
-1	I trust my primary physician because he is honest with me and tries to help me as much as he can. I also get to freely engage him when i have a problem
-1	For the last several years I have primarily seen a pain management specialist.  I feel like it has been write a prescription rather than deal with the problems. Then when the attitudes began to change about medicating chronic pain patients it became trying to stop giving me medication. At no time have I felt my best interests were served.  I would prefer a more middle of the road approach. 
-1	well sometimes its hard to trust on your primary care physician because they cant guarantee your health back and even other doctors wont  take responsibility they can just try their best to take care of a person
-1	I feel i can trust my PCP. She is being very honest with me about options and potential results. I feel i already established a personal connection with her
-1	I want to have full trust in my primary doctor but I feel like some training is outdated.  I feel that pharmaceutical companies influence doctors greatly.  I've experienced a situation where I was not given all my options and I feel surgery was recommended and pushed to make money.  I feel like it's too much about making money and less about making people healthy.  Especially considering the fact that Americans are growing more and more unhealthy - kids and adults alike.
1	I have known this person for a few years now, and I trust his judgement. I have felt that he is interested me as a person, not just a chart. I feel I could talk to this person about anything going on in my body.
-1	I recently moved and do not have a primary care physician. I think doctors in general have the patient's best interest in mind. I have enjoyed working with most of my doctors, but I have occasionally felt rushed during appointments. Therefore, there has been occasional distrust.
-1	"Almost all primary-care physicians are driven by market forces and social need to see more patients per day than they really should. I think this leads them to make ""snap"" decisions without spending a lot of time considering possible alternatives; the ""easy"" answer isn't always the right one. I sometime distrust my doctor's opinion when I feel he wants to rush through answers or complicated diagnoses without really considering whether they're totally correct or whether I understand them fully. I recognize their dilemma, but will not allow it to stop me from getting all the info I need on my medical condition."
-1	"Sometimes I'll get different feedback from a different provider of mine that makes me question who is right or who is wrong. Or I'll bring up something I read online or heard from others with similar conditions and the physician will say ""Yes, that is an option."" I don't like to have to be the one to bring up other things."
-1	I feel like I need to trust them because that is what they have studied and trained to do for many years. Though I have experienced negative situations in hospitals that have made me feel somewhat distrustful. I have been present in situations where a doctor has taken too long or has not demonstrated much importance when trying to be reached with questions. Sometimes they have so many situations going on at once, that it would seem they forget some patients.
1	I trust my doctor because I have read reviews about him. I also trust him because I myself have checked up on the internet the treatment and procedures that he has suggested or prescribed. 
-1	Doctor has given bad advice a couple of times, such as don't read about side effects. I don't have anything else to say.
-1	"Generally speaking, doctors are a product of their systems and culture. They often see themselves as godlike figures, incapable of being questioned, and the environments where they work, with their constant reverence for doctors, reinforce that mentality. This, combined with their fear of liability often makes them completely averse to anything new or different, even when the literature and research show that there is significant potential benefit. I feel that more doctors are concerned about ""not rocking the boat"" than doing what is best for the patient. There are, of course, stellar exceptions, and I have been fortunate to work with some of them.   "
-1	My Primary Care Physician is an exception to the rule. Nearly all other physicians I've encountered would have received the exact opposite scores. My physician runs a small-town cash-only clinic, removing insurance from the process altogether and creating a much better Doctor-Patient relationship in the process.
1	My doctor talks to me like a friend instead of a patient. If he needs to prescribe a medicine, he talks to me on my level of understanding about the pros and cons and tells me about his success or lack thereof with his other patients. He is very honest and open about what I do and do not need to change in reference to my lifestyle. Most importantly, if he doesn't have an answer, he is not afraid to tell me he doesn't know and needs to refer me to a specialist. That most of all is why I trust him so much - that he is willing to admit he doesn't know something or admit someone else may have a better solution.
-1	I feel like my doctors are trustworthy for the most part but sometimes I wonder if they get paid by people like drug companies to give out certain kinds of medicine for people who have problems and maybe that makes them find problems that aren't there sometimes. 
-1	I do generally trust my doctor, but I know there's a lot he doesn't know, and the same goes for most doctors. So I always supplement whatever information/recommendations he gives me with additional research to get a bigger picture. Doctors generally overprescribe medication, which usually has side effects and can do more harm than good in the long run, so I want to know exactly what I'll get into if I make a certain choice.
-1	Doctors come in an listen to you for barely 5 minutes, then do some perfunctory examinations like check blood pressure and come to a decision on your situation.  Its obvious often doctors have no clue on how to diagnose a non-visible symptom like stomach pain or neurological issues.  They just tend to prescribe yah a prescription and rush you out the door.  The prescription might do more harm than good too.  Its clear that some of the doctors I have fit this profile and aren't very circumspect or patient oriented.
1	I moved to this city 13 years ago and have been seeing this doctor for all my health care needs, apart from my dentist and eye doctor. She answers all my questions patiently and never hurries through the appointment.
-1	I find that my PCP has a genuine interest to see that I am as healthy as I can be.  She listens to my problems and seems to expend the appropriate amount of concern and energy into solving my problems.  She will also freely give prescriptions or referrals when I need to see a specialist.
1	I been seeing my doctor for several years.  He has always been helpful and profession when my family or I are sick.
-1	I pretty much trust my primary care doctor. She is friendly and easy to talk to. Sometimes I do feel like she is a little preoccupied with other things and in a hurry. But over all I think I receive adequate care from her.  
-1	The primary care physicians are going to spend as little time with patients as possible.  They are busy and dont have time to explain everything or care about every patient.  If the doctor prescribes me a drug or suggests a certain treatment I will do thorough research on my own time and make my own decision about my course of treatment.
-1	The few times I have visited the doctor I have felt a sense of urgency from them as if they were too busy for my time. I also feel like they do not care as much as they should, too many times have I experienced a doctor telling me a bunch of information at once like they were a robot, not making any eye contact with me through the lecture. 
-1	I do think that doctors for the most part have your best well-being in mind, but I'm skeptical that sometimes they may be guided by less savory interests (pharmaceuticals).
-1	I get a new doctor each time so it's hard to build trust. They don't necessarily know my medical history so it's hard to trust them.
1	I trust my doctor because she is very understanding and knows me really well. She is almost like my friend and is really nice to me.
1	I trust my doctor because he tells me exactly what I have, why I have what I have, and how to correct my condition. He does not try to push medications on me but looks for natural solutions if possible. 
-1	I have been seeing my current primary care physician for nearly 4 years. She is very competent, compassionate, and will send me to specialists if I have medical problems that she cannot treat. 
-1	my primary caretaker is very awesome! She is always down to earth and gives it to me straight. The only negative thing I have against her is she is not for using medicine as much. If it can be done, she would rather the body heal itself naturally. This is ok sometimes but when I have a dance concert coming up there is just not enough time so I don't want to have to argue about giving me medicine. 
1	I have been around physicians all my life. Iâve volunteered in hospitals, worked in hospitals, job-shadowed various doctors, and have numerous doctors as colleagues (Iâm in medical school). I have a primary care physician and whenever I have a checkup etc. with my own knowledge I know he tells me the truth and shows a caring side, and answers all my questions. Trust is earned, and I believe (since I am doing it), with all the education doctors go through, trust should be there, because it is a respected occupation. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with him since I was a kid and he has been truthful and honest ever since. He has also been my family's primary care physician.
-1	I don't have much trust in my former mainstream (allopathic) doctor mainly because of the way information in allopathic medicine is taught, from a top down and 'condition-osis' perspective.  There is no such thing in mainstream medicine as understanding a situation from the ground up.  Instead, a description of a condition is projected onto the patient and care is given based on that projection.  My doctor did absolutely nothing for me in regards to my scoliosis that got so bad my entire rib cage began to slip out of place.  Instead of seeing what was there, he acted on the preconceived notion of what scoliosis was and the problems it can cause.
-1	I don't completely trust my primary care physician because I think he is mostly in it for the money.  He knows that I am very limited financially, yet he insists that I make an appointment to see him for any prescription refills, even if I just saw him two days before.  He routinely prescribes the most expensive drugs, knowing that I can't afford them.  On top of that, his office routinely charges me double what my co-pay is supposed to be.  
-1	I generally trust doctors, but I don't believe you should trust anyone 100%, without at least verifying their information with another expert at least once or twice, every so often.
-1	i trust doctors for the most part because i believe many of them are inherently good people who got into the medical field in order to help be of service to others. Occasionally there are doctors who seem to be pretty detached from their work and just see all their patients as a paycheck, and that is truly an awful thing.
1	I completely trust my doctor. I believe that if you don't trust them,  u should find one that you do. Mine gives me an honest opinion, backed by facts and not just suggestions. They give me solid advise and are patient with me. They take the time to sit with u and listen to your problems and questions. Thru don't always want to shove a pill down your throat, they respect my natural path of doing things. 
1	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because of his personality and willingness to answer any questions I would have. His explanation for his methods or recommendations are pretty reasonable and sound and he never rushes me through an appointment. 
-1	I have been recently assigned a new provider. As far as I can tell, he is a very competent doctor. He has been very helpful in my medications and I have not experienced any problems under this current provider.
1	My doctor listens to me and spends a good amount of time with me instead of just rushing along the appointment. She always asks me if I have any questions and addresses every one of them if I do. When I call the office for a need, I always get assistance over the phone in a timely manner.
1	I do not go very often to a doctor, but I have the same family doctor since I was quite young, and I believe he has always done a good job helping me to maintain good health, and warning me of risks and dangers posed by my behaviors.
-1	i see a nurse practitioner which was new for me. i think it's a red state thing. or maybe it's the future. anyway the practitioner was able to refer me to a specialist
-1	It's not my primary care physician in particular that I distrust, It's the fact that doctors are people too and anybody can get lazy and careless at times in their profession or simply be having a bad day. I mildly mistrust all doctors until I have reasonable proof not to do so. There are problems with how the medical field is run in this country and I'm sure there are doctors out there that disgree with things they must comply to on a daily basis which can be disheartening in the longrun. Most doctors have the ability to be great, but I believe it's harder than it has to be. Overall though, I do trust my doctor because I have faith in the decision I made to choose them as my pcp based on my experience with them. 
-1	Often feel rushed or forgotten by my doctor's office. It's packed and I have a hard time getting anyone on the phone or talking to busy staff while I'm there. I ferl like one in hundreds of patients they see in a week. I wait for literal hours for my appointments and spend maybe 30 minutes being seen.
-1	I've worked in healthcare (previously) for over 15 years, and have had first-hand experience with many doctors.  I've seen a side of doctors that patients don't see, and some of these interactions have fostered a lack of trust.  I've had experiences where I've gone to see a new doctor and they've had a prescription written for me before I even spoke to them.  I've seen my husband prescribed contraindicated medications that caused an adverse reaction that even I knew shouldn't be taken together.  But, alternatively, I've had some doctors who treated me well who I've really trusted.  I've known other doctors to go out of their way to cater to their patient's needs/fears/wishes.
-1	I can't say I completely trust my general doctor, I mean, he has given me good attention for a whole year and he treats me well but sometimes I think he cares more about making money than myself as he makes me do many tests in the same hospital where he is. It's kind of suspicious.
1	My primary care person is a local Nurse Practitioner.  She is busy but never seems rushed while visiting with me about my concerns.  She listens and then asks questions to be sure she understands.  She explains the reason she will chose a certain treatment or why she's choosing to wait and see rather than treat right away.  I like that she doesn't talk down to me and treats me as though I am intelligent enough to understand.
1	I have only had one bad experience with a doctor, and it was because he went against my wishes. Other than that one experience, my normal doctor listens to me completely, and always has insightful advice or resources for me to utilize.
-1	 As a poor citizen of the United States I like millions of my fellow countryman probably avoid seeing doctors as much as possible. The cost of health care is insane and the treatment that is given to lower class individuals is often not very good. I can say this from first hand experience as told in my previous statement. Doctors often seem to care more about money than about the ethical side of their profession which is to help people. I feel there is a large disconnect between healthcare needs and healthcare providers in this country. Doctors taking hand outs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe their drugs is a huge conflict of interests. Healthcare should not be a for profit business but rather a human right. Until this concept is realized in this country and in the rest of the world who is falling behind the general public will continue to not trust doctors and not seek medical help. Going into crippling debt for simply seeing a doctor is not an option for most people.
1	I have been seeing my doctor a while, we are around the same age and she is very smart and knowledgeable. 
-1	My primary doctor is my OBGYN and she is amazing. She listens to my concerns and takes them seriously. Whereas other doctors would gloss over my anxieties/fears, she will go the extra mile to make sure I am well taken care of, even if that means transferring my care to someone else.
-1	my doctor has been very open and honest with me about my health and the things i should be doing and avoiding. she does not sugar coat anything but she is also compassionate when relating her message across to me which makes me feel more comfortable and apt to listening to her medical advice.
-1	Sometimes it seems like he is pushing pharmaceutical trials on me. He does not always seem genuinely interested in my welfare, although we make small talk often.
-1	I trust them as much as I should. What that means is if they are clearly pushing a prescription for something I don't think I need, I distrust them. If they are actively pushing minimal treatment I trust them more because I think that my health is their priority opposed to making money by seeing me over and over again or by prescribing more drugs.
-1	sometimes people have other things on their mind.  they see a lot of patients and might not be feeling good that day. they might not be as informed on new things out in the medical field. they may have been last in their class. there are many things that  can cause mistakes to be made. they are only human also
-1	I do feel that if I go to my doctor they will give me the best medical attention as possible but I am also aware of natural way of healing that can also be applied.  The natural way are never mentioned by my doctor.  Because of side effects of medications I will often try a natural way of healing first followed by a medication only if absolutely nessesary. I often feel that side effects are overlooked and not discussed. 
1	I trust doctors because they have the most knowledge on what is best for my condition. There is so much conflicting information that a healthcare professional is the only source of an effective care solution. If I want to recover as quickly as possible then following doctors orders is the best method.
-1	My physician is trustworthy but I do feel she can be pre occupied with what makes her life easier at times
-1	I do trust my doctor almost completely, you have to if you are not going to go crazy. But I know in the back of my mind no one has my best interest at heart but me. 
1	I'm active duty military and see my doctor at the base hospital. I feel as though they honestly care about me and my fellow military members and do what is best for our health and long term care. I have no reasons to doubt this or experienced anything to discredit this opinion and view.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she will explain all options to me and also make sure that she understands who I am as her patient. She also makes sure that her staff is also aware of who I am as a patient. 
1	My doctor is fairly conservative in treating most issues initially. On the other hand, he is proactive and quick to address problems needing immediate attention and action. He also believes in natural solutions over pharmaceuticals whenever possible.
1	I like my doctor, we have a private practice doctor, so I feel we get lucky and get extra time he doesn't seem to rush me and I feel he listens to me when I go in to see him.  I also like that I see only him, so he can look back from last time he saw me or review his notes, that gives me confidence that something won't be missed
-1	I utilize different professional medical settings (i.e. urgent care, hospital, offices) and have had multiple bad experiences, both personal and of my friends. It seems as though many doctors rush through without properly analyzing the situation, or push for the more costly of treatments. Medicine has taken quite a plunge in recent years, and the Hippocratic Oath does not mean what it once meant. 
1	I trust her because she seems so genuine and caring. She is very thorough when giving me information and very knowledgeable. We have a lot in common and I can really relate to her. 
1	I trust her because she has been my doctor for Two years and even delivered my son. She has always made sure I was in good hands and made me feel comfortable to talk about my health to
1	She has always listened to what problems I am having.  She runs the tests necessary to diagnose my medical conditions and my general health.  She changes medications when needed to better treat my issues.  She seems to genuinely care about my health and well being.
-1	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. she is very attentive, always listens. So far all of her recommendations were spot on.
-1	Doctors are busy and use mental shortcuts.  There is a large body of literature showing this.  Doctors are also generally very busy and shocking self-important, with little experience in the humility that actual scientists have.
-1	The doctors who I know personally genuinely do care.So while sometimes it is a situation of covering their butts, most the time it is done for my welfare. 
-1	I have had a lot of bad experiences with doctors. I currently have a nurse practitioner that I like and trust. My experience began young when I had a doctor tell me on several occasions that I couldn't have whatever disorder I came to see him for. Such as telling me a thirteen year old can't have ulcers (I did). Once I had a doctor put me out of work for seven days for whooping cough as an adult, and when j explained to her I needed one more day to not get in trouble at work so I'd be on sick leave she denied it. There are other instances where I felt my voice wasn't heard. 
1	My primary care physician has been my doctor since I was born. He always was my mom, and cousin's doctor.
-1	My primary care physician sometimes seems to be in a hurry on days when he has a lot of patients to see, so he does not ask me many questions on those days. If I have any symptoms that are bothering me, then I would have to make sure to point them out to him myself when he is in a hurry. He always prescribes treatment or orders tests to learn what is wrong, so he can prescribe accurate medicines.
1	My group of doctors work together to get me the care needed. They toss ideas around with each other so there is always a second and third opinion before we move forward with anything in the event that I do get sick.
-1	I trust that my primary care physician is knowledgeable but sometimes wonder if she has ulterior motives when she is always trying to push medications on me which I do not think I need. 
-1	he is a doctor and he know what to do and how to treat so i trust him/her but i also do my research on it and seek out the treatment  
1	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a long time and he has always looked out for my well being. I never had any issues with him and I trust his medical advice based on prior experience.
1	I do trust doctors in general but it's hard to find a doctor who truly cares. For example, I used to go to the doctor and I always felt rushed because he had million patients waiting in the waiting area. He is a good doctor but I like when I have enough time to tell about my problems or what I feel or my concerns and he just didn't really have time to listen. I found another doctor who is amazing. He has a small office and not a lot of patience because he really takes his time and really cares. You can call him on his personal phone number and he will answer and will try to help
-1	Doctors are after the bottom line for the most part, which that is how many patients can I see in a day and how much money can I make off them. My doctor is sort of that way and I don't like having to wait hours for just 5 minutes of his time. It takes longer than that to diagnose someone and help them through that situation
1	I believe my doctor is qualified to make decisions about my medical care. They are more informed and knowledgable about healthcare than I am.
-1	I trust her because she is a licensed doctor and looking out for what is best for me. If my physician wasn't trustworthy, i'm sure they would've stripped her of license to practice medicine.
-1	I lived next to my primary physician for a few years and we always got along very well, having that personal relationship was one of the reasons we chose him, and him being a younger person knowing he would be around for awhile also helped.
1	I have always had a good experience with her and she seems willing to answer questions and explain things. For the most part I trust her. She seems very intelligent and like she thinks before she speaks.
1	I have to see doctors relatively often, and although most visits are quite short, my doctor (or the nurse) is always willing to explain something I don't understand. I believe my doctor is concerned about my health problems and prescribes the medications he feels will work the best (I often have to change medications because one isn't working or a new one causes problems with an older one).
1	My Dr. has always though about my good health, sometimes more than me. He declined to do a procedure because I just had it done lass the a month before and he was afraid it might cause me more discomfort.
1	She has entered in to a relationship with me with goal setting and holding me accountable, she's not just passive.
-1	I trust my doctor because she takes time with me. She spends more than one minute in the room with me when I go. She takes the time to not only see to my health but to ask about my personal life. She remembers me and asks me always about different things I have shared with her such as work or my personal life. 
-1	I trust my doctor for a few reasons. First off, they are a doctor for a reason, they want to help people improve their health. Also, there are plenty of laws and reasons for them to not slack off and do a bad job, so they are well incentivized to be accurate.
1	I trust her because she genuinely seems likes she wants to help and she has the knowledge to do so.  She is very kind but stern, and does talk about a lot of options I may have.  She also is quick to refer me if she knows I would be better suited with a specialist.  My only distrust would be that she is fairly young, so she does not have the experience of the more established physicians.
1	I trust that my doctor is giving me all the information to the best of her ability, and wants to help me make the best decisions possible. However, she is human, and busy, and human health is complicated and constantly evolving. I do not expect her to know everything. 
-1	There have been times when my Dr. has overlooked things, but there have also been times when my Dr. has been very thorough. 
1	I do have complete trust in my primary care physician, because I have been a patient of his for a long time. He is a fairly young doctor and is intelligent and knows about new technology and medications. I have always been able to get same day appointments, if needed. He has never steered me wrong on the topic of health or taking care of myself.
-1	They get in to mush of a hurry, it feels rushed. They will come in and start discussing what needs to be done and while I'm there I feel like I don't even talk the same language sometimes. I almost always look everything I can remember on line. It helps me figure out what is really going on. 
-1	I feel like my doctor listens to me and will do everything they can to find out what is going on with my health when I need them to. They have always listened to me. 
1	My doctor is very well educated and experienced. He is warm and approachable and always tells me the plus and minuses regarding medicines and treatments I need.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has always listened to my concerns and taken time with me,  instead of rushing through my appointments.
-1	For the most part I trust my doctor to monitor my health and if a problem presents help me find a reasonable solution. But I also people in human mistake and that sometimes you have to be your own health advocate.  Doctors don't always have the right answers and sometimes you have to be persistent if you feel something is not right. 
-1	I have had bad experiences with doctors and have been misdiagnosed. I have unfortunately had doctors with God complexes who believed they were right and would not listen to me as their patient and it turned out I was right all along.
1	 I trust my primary care physician for several reasons. I know he has a strong educational background and has been in practice for many years. I have researched online and read reviews on my physician and they are very good reviews. My physician has always listened to me, given me good advice and treatment and I have never not benefited from his care.He has certainly earned my trust.
-1	I feel like no matter what Dr. I go to, no matter what the reviews are lie they are always just about the money. it really sucks and I feel really awkward. I always feel like the doctors dont care about there patients. I have yet to find one that actually cares.
-1	I trust the doctor because he is experienced and deals with patients with similar problems. Since he is familiar in his field he will know how to treat me. 
-1	Overall, I may put trust into doctors generally since they are professionals within the field, but I suppose I have a bit of skepticism toward some doctors and their thoroughness. Also, it seems that some treatments in the past haven't been the most adequate in treating various concerns, which influences my perception.
1	I havve been with my GP for 20 years. I can trust anything he says. He has been with me through the good and bad times and always tried to do whats best
-1	I will go to the doctor if something is wrong and so far have never been sent wrong or given wrong advice or information
1	My primary care physician is a young man who takes his time talking with me and actually listens to what I have to say. He then asks relevant questions and discusses which course of action would be best for me and which he feels would best address my concerns. He is always available through his patient portal and responds in a timely manner. His staff is also very kind and caring and I get a sense that they actually quite enjoy working for him, which to me is very telling.
1	I do not trust all doctors completely. They are human and can make mistakes, and may not always have all of the answers, and may not know the entire situation. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has an excellent track record. She has consistently provided excellent care and treatment for myself and my family. She has proven her abilities over the long-term.
-1	I dont completely trust my medical physician because often I feel like instead of doing what's the right thing for me they are likely doing what can get them paid the most. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I think they are very thorough. I feel like they go through all the necessary questions to diagnose me and prescribe the right medications to help me feel better.
1	I feel like my doctor went through a lot of education and training to get to where he is now, so I feel like he probably has a pretty good understanding of my health and how to treat and maintain it
-1	I trust my physician because I did a lot of research and got some recommendations from people I trust. I made the best choice for my needs and situation. My physicians has my best interest at heart. 
-1	all doctors care about one thing, money. they don't care about you. to them, you are a bank and they want to drain you, even if you die.
-1	I have known my doctor for ten years. He has always been honest and patient with me. He was my doctor through my pregnancies also.
-1	My physician has always been very helpful in getting me any information I need, even when I am asking a lot of questions. 
1	I have been lucky to have always had doctors that I have complete trust in. They have always been thorough in evaluating my symptoms or issues and have taken the time to sit down and have a conversation about my options. They have always been open to questions and I have never feel rushed or felt they were putting their convenience over my well-being.
-1	I have some trust in my primary care physician but would hesitate to have full trust unless I have gone through many more health issues to see her response/care to them. I do tend to do independent research on the health issues so that i have some comparison to her response & care of the problem. So, mostly, i feel like she has been truthful and has provided adequate care. 
1	I do not go to my PCP often because they are far away but when I do go I do trust their option because they have not seared me wrong yet. It is important to be able to trust your doctor. 
-1	My doctor is caring and understands I like natural remedies and cures, but will make sure I am aware of all of my options in any condition and suggests what she feels is the best route for me. We have developed a relationship of trust and genuine care for each other. She always makes extra time for me during my appointments because she knows I like to talk and I feel that relationship helps foster trust so she doesn't rush me to a remedy to get me out of her office but cares about my well-being.
-1	The physicians ive had generally rush through the procedures, and care little for my thoughts. I have never had a severe condition but it would worry me if i ever did
-1	i don't see my primary care physician too often. he's a decent guy, but i think he's more interested in sending me off for tests than anything else. he doesn't seem to know that much himself, it's always more tests.
-1	Since it's the doctor's job, and they are more knowledgeable in the field of health, I have to trust them, even if I think if their decision is a little questionable. I can ask them questions on why they recommend something, but they have more expertise in the field than me.
-1	Sometimes I feel the doctors are only going to do as much as they need to cover the basics. For instance, if a patient only have medicaid or medicare the doctors will not suggest better treatment options that are available because the health care doesn't cover it. This practice is done without regard to the patient being able to fund the treatment in another capacity. This same treatment is the opposite for those with private healthcare. 
1	While I have been lucky to have great doctors whom I trust, and I trust my current doctors, I would say that I do not necessarily trust doctors in general. This is because I understand that doctors are less likely to take women's reported symptoms seriously, medications that may be prescribed are tested much less thoroughly on women than on men, and especially in obstetrics women are not given important information to monitor their own health during/after childbirth which leads to the US having an incredibly high maternal death rate for a first-world country. If I were a man, I would trust medical practices a great deal more. 
-1	I do get the impression that the doctor is trying to get through his visit with me as fast as possible. I understand that they need to do this to make a living, and I know the realities of insurance reimbursement and the way they are paid. Still, it means that I am suspicious of my doctor's motives and I don't really fully trust them. I know they are looking out for their interests before they are necessarily looking out for mine.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing her since I am a child and she always will go the distance to figure out what is wrong with me when it is something more than just a cold. She will order multiple test and blood labs, and always tries to explain all information with me. I am comfortable in talking with her openly and she does the best she can to keep me at ease.
1	I think the doctor I have has made several diagnosis that have been correct about me over the years, so because of that I trust him quite a bit. Doctors do seem to minimize the time they see me in the office but I can forgive that since they are very busy.
1	"I trust my primary physician because to say the least he is a realist. He keeps things honest and it's not just about saying what he feel's is required to be said, he gives me relatable examples and tells me personally things about his life and hose around him as well and it gives me a much more relaxing feeling and the ability to trust his word. He doesn't always come with the ""Dr. Talk"" that people whom are not in that field doesn't understand. he gives me advice medically and personally."
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is extremely careful and honest telling me about all the different treatment options all the time.
-1	It's hard to keep cynical thoughts out of my mind. I can't help but see them as flawed and just figuring things out like everyone else. It's hard to know if I'm communicating clearly enough for them to totally understand everything anyway.
-1	I think that the amount of patients doctors are forced to see to be paid reasonably means they spend small periods of time with large numbers of patients. I am sure that given more time with each patient, along with adequate time to review medical tests and records, more nuances of medical conditions may be noticeable and it would be easier for doctors to prep for each appt with adequate resource material to provide the patient.
-1	I have had terrible medical experiences for the last twenty years and I finally have a great Dr who will spend hours with me if necessary and appears to actually care how I am doing. 
1	It is a rare quality these days since I have seen at least 15 different family doctors throughout my life, and the family doctor I have now actually listens, he hugs me when I walk in, he looks for any side effects for my current medications if he has to put me on something temporarily, e.g. antibiotic, and he spends quality time with me. Even after months of telling him something, he remembers it like we just chatted about it moments ago. His memory, attention to detail, and time with the patient is extraordinary!
1	My family has been going to the same physician for over 50 years, starting with my grandfather. Our doctor has been reliable and up front for all that time. I have no reason not to trust his judgement.
-1	I feel doctors do not generally look at all options and want to do what is best for their schedule, not what is best for the patients needs
1	He has been in the healthcare profession for quite some time and is very knowledgeable. He is well respected in the community
1	My primary care physician takes the time to go through what has gone on since the last time I've seen them.  They go through all of my medications.  They do an exam and go over any and all symptoms I may be having. They thoroughly discuss any labwork that was completed and then discuss all options for changes.  I trust their opinion because they take time with me. 
1	Physicians have generally given me plenty of information and different options for care. They explain things when asked. I have rarely encountered physicians that are not attentive to my needs as a patient.
-1	I do have trust in my PCP - as he is intelligent and qualified, but he runs a busy office and I often times feel as though he rushed through the process or appointment. 
-1	I have a good rapport with my personal physician. I feel this way because she not only takes the time to thoroughly discuss my health, but she also spends time with me discussing issues that are not always directly or indirectly for that matter, related to my health.
1	I guess I could say that I trust my primary doctor because he hasn't given me a reason not to trust him.  He is upfront, tells me about options, explains procedures, and is good natured.  I believe he is looking out for my best interests and until he does otherwise, I will have trust in him.
-1	I believe my doctor has my best interests in mine, but sometimes I do not agree with their treatment ideas. I had a doctor make me get an endoscopy for abdominal pain. It was quite an invasive test that was useless as it did not show the cause of my abdominal pain. I went to another doctor who ordered a non invasive abdominal ultrasound which showed gallstones. I had to suffer and take it upon myself to get the care I needed.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, but in general, doctors are open about a patient's health. Even when they are stern, it is because they want the patient to have the best outcome. There are few doctors who would deliberately mislead a patient. 
-1	I feel that doctors often are overbooked and take the easy way out.  Itâs got to be a nightmare dealing with insurance companies.  Many just treat every patient the same.
-1	I trust my doctor. He has never done anything to make me think he should not be trusted or that he is not honest. He has always been candid about my health concerns, and explains everything. He happily answers questions I might have and has even given me his email to contact him if I have any further questions.
-1	I feel like my doctor seems me as a number and not as a patient. He never allows me to fully discuss all of my issues and just rushes me out. He comes off cold and i do not have trust in him but will be looking for a new doctor.
-1	doctors and staff are motivated by pharma, insurance, and liability.  They are also overworked, often seeing several patients at once.  That puts my best interests at the bottom of the barrel.  I have had bad luck with doctors through most of my life-- bad advice, dismissive of my symptoms, etc.  I don't dislike my current doctor, but don't fully trust her either.  
-1	I don't trust my doctor completely because she sort of rushes the appointment.  She doesn't really do whats best for me because she should be testing my thyroid on a regular basis.
-1	I think all in all doctors are worthy to put your trust in their care. I just think there aren't enough doctors to go around. They are so frazzled and tired trying to keep up.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with him my entire adolescent and young adult life. I have fallen ill beyond a point where I could recover without assistance from a medical professional and when I went to my doctor for consultation, I felt like I was in knowledgable and caring hands. Furthermore, my parents have faith and put trust in my doctor and I know my parents want what is best for me and my own health, that is why I would trust my primary care physician even more. 
-1	I trust most doctors to do what's right, but I also believe that they've been taught to treat illnesses instead of trying to avoid being sick in the first place. So I believe there are tests done to people that might not be totally necessary in the first place. That's just what they're taught. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is always willing to take the time to answer questions I have about medications and treatment plans and he works with me to make sure I get the medications that my insurance will cover and he checks to see if there is one that they cover more of the cost. He also explains why he makes medical decisions, like prescribing medications or doing certain tests for me before he does it to make sure I understand completely what the reasons for doing it are and the benefits and risks of it.
-1	I think my doctor is very likely to want to prescribe a medication too early without looking deep enough into my condition. I think my doctor could gather more symptoms in order to make a more informed decision. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I do not really have a better option. If I am sick I have to go and visit him hoping that he can figure it out how to get better. But on the other hand health care system is lead by money so it all comes to the end where it is about our pocket. If everyone would be healthy then hospitals, health care providers, doctors etc. would be in a big trouble. No customer means no paycheck. So till a certain extent they must have patients. Health care system does not create cure. It creates consumers.
1	I have a great doctor who is very understanding and takes time to dig deeper. My previous primary care doctor just wrote me prescriptions and sent me on my way without listening, which is how I went undiagnosed with a thyroid problem. Having a doctor who listened and took the time to figure things out why fighting my insurance makes me trust her a great deal. 
1	I have been lucky in life.  I have not ever had any serious medical issues.  So maybe my faith in medicine hasn't really been tested yet.  But I tend to trust my doctor to give me the best care that she knows how.  I know that science and medicine are always coming up with new ideas, so not everyone can know everything.  all I as is the best care you know to provide. 
1	Well my doctor has been seeing me for a while now so he has understanding where i am health wise. I trust his judgement due to his experience and so far its been good.
-1	Doctors are people who can make mistakes. My issue is less that I distrust my primary care physician, but more that I do not trust him/her completely. No professional should be trusted completely, and patients need to have basic critical thinking skills when seeing a doctor. 
-1	I do not put complete trust in anyone but myself. I would like to believe them but odds are I will get a second opinion or verify what they told me myself.
1	"I trust my physician because she is always very personable with me. She always gives me both the ups and downs to new medications and doesn't push me to take anything that ""she wouldn't take"". "
-1	I don't think she is that great of a doctor. I wouldn't mind changing to another one if I could find one that's better.
1	My wife and some other family members have the same doctor as I do. All of us have good things to say about my doctor. She does a good job each time I go to see her at an appointment. The reason I didn't put strongly agree is because all doctors are't 100% perfect and that some of the decisions regarding medication are mine. There are a few prescriptions I am on that I am not the biggest fan of. 
-1	Most doctors care about their patients. Unfortunately, the system is set up so they probably cannot spend as much time with each patient as they would like. I think they do the best they can given the circumstances but I also believe in taking responsibility for my own health. I take everything with a grain of salt and often wonder if health professionals are not telling me everything for their own financial gain (i.e. pharma companies supplying incentives for pushing certain medications/treatments).
-1	I believe doctors often do not want to admit when they do not know something so they will bs and beat around the bush. This leads me to not trust them and be skeptical of future advice.
-1	I have migraines. My former pain management doctor gave me botox injections. I also got occipital nerve blocks for a different headache. My new doctor (moved to a new state) told me nobody is trained to do that. He didn't offer any type of option. He doesn't care. I don't trust him with my care for that reason.
-1	I generally trust doctors in general. However, they get caught in a huge bureaucracy and regulations and fear of law suits when it comes to healthcare in general, it limits their options.
1	He will actually open up studies and show me where the information is coming from. He does not beat around the bushes. He gives me pros and cons for everything when it comes to symptoms or medications
1	I don't go to doctors a lot but I'm surrounded by them,  I don't trust just any doctor in general but the few doctors I do go to, are very trusted by me.  I have seen by the times I went there that they are very intelligent and reliable.
-1	My PCP does his best, I think. But he is often rushed and is getting older. I trust him less than I used to. That said, I have absolute trust in the NP in his office.
-1	It is not that I distrust them. I know that they have many patients, and that their attention cannot be 100 percent on me. It is my own responsibility to make sure that I am doing everything I can to keep myself healthy. They have a lot of patients, but I only have me.
-1	I trust my doctors in general, however sometimes it seems like it would be easy for them to just prescribe medications to treat ailments rather than getting down to the root cause of the problem.
1	I trust my PCP because he always explains in depth why he prescribes a drug or treatment. He takes the time to listen to my symptoms and does a thorough exam.
-1	Generally, I tend to trust my doctors' treat and their recommendations.  Since I have not been in severe health condition in the past, I didn't think seriously about doctors' advice because I mostly respect their treatment and recommendation.  I think most doctors should be reliable and trustworthy in giving best treatment and recommendation for their patients.
-1	I believe that my primary care doctor is mostly interested in the money and as such is not completely honest when prescribing medications or diagnosing problems. sometimes I feel as though he is too busyt to explain in detail and gets frustrated if I ask questions. I pretty much think this is true of the medical profession as a whole and as such I am reluctant to trust any doctor. 
1	I guess I have only had one issue that involved a pap smear test going to the wrong lab and me being charged way too much (like $10 vs $500). Considering that was just human error, I have no real reason to distrust my doctor. But mistakes can happen, so I don't fully trust anything. 
1	I trust my primary care doctor because I've had many doctors before him that I did not trust, so it's easy to see that my doctor is trustworthy in comparison. I can tell that my primary care doctor is caring and kind, and that he explains all my options. I trust him because he goes over everything in detail and will go over lab results with me line by line and ask if I have any questions. Before I leave for my visit he asks if I have any other questions or concerns I wanted to address, this shows me that he cares and is trustworthy. 
1	He has always been open and honest about everything and fully explains what is going on or what he is doing.  He will give me all my options and let me make a decision or give his opinion as to what is best but still let me decide. 
-1	I've only seen this doctor twice in the past couple of years.  Once for my general physical and he was very careful and checked out when I needed my next tests, etc. I have now not had any blood test for over 2 years, and he just keeps refilling my Rx.  I went in for a skin problem and saw him for 1 minute after waiting 2 hours - I was upset of course.
-1	I believe my doctor is fallible, just like any other humans. All doctors have difficult and stressful jobs, and will sometimes take the easy route of simply prescribing unnecessary medications with both short-term and long-term side effects instead of providing other options.
-1	The reason I trust or distrust doctors is because I believe they have a protocol to follow. They might order an xray when it could of been more beneficial to order an MRI. I understand they also have to perform what is approved if the patient has limited insurance.  
-1	He doesn't even remember my name or say hello to me if I walk by in the halls.  Like he's emotionally detached from everything and is just there to do his job, nothing more.  I can't trust someone who share little care for their patients.
-1	I don't trust doctors in general because they are not there to truly help you but rather to sell you medicine and procedures which simply hide the problem and not fully address it which ultimately results in the worsening of my health. 
-1	 I feel I can trust them based on the general information , and listen to solutions where I know they are not just trying to take my money. Many times the use of fancy language and misdiagnosis lead me , and many other patience astray which is why I am neutral in that I trust most of their practice , but know they can have bad intentions and give wrong information.
-1	as a person that knows a fair amount about medicine and practices i know that at times there are doctors that look out for themselves or the drug companies over your well being
-1	As I stated previously, I haven't had any serious conditions, but I have been to my doctor occassionally in the last few years.  Whenever I have seen her she has never seemed rushed or like she was trying to just move along to the next patient. I was able to talk very easily and at length.  Additionally, the illness or issue has always been resolved fairly quickly with the doctor's recommendations.
-1	Doctors have received the proper training and certification to perform their job to the best of their abilities. I trust these qualifications enough to trust doctors, but just like every other professions there will be problems. I do not expect everything at a hospital to go right for doctors, but I expect them to treat patients with care.
-1	It always seems that doctors are rushed. I don't think that they always have patients best interest in mind. Paying more attention to the bottom line than well being of patients. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I've known him since I was a child. He's been my doctor for my whole life and I trust him. He's made great decisions for me and has almost always been right in regard to my medical issues. We are very close and he is very intelligent and has a wonderful bed side manner.
-1	I distrust my doctor because they have to google the answers to my questions when I come in to see them with questions. I currently have Medi-Cal and the selection of doctors that accept Medi-Cal are limited. After I finish school and have health insurance, I would definitely do research to switch my primary care physician to someone I trust more. The doctors at the office have a cosmetic focus as well as primary care, so when I had asked for a referral to see a dermatologist, I was not given one. Though the doctor did not push me to get cosmetic treatment, I feel like referrals to dermatologists would hurt their business.
1	Initially I have complete trust in my doctors.  Some have lost trust.  Some have gained a lot.  I tend to trust the doctors with the most education.  Trust is very important to accurately give all the personal information required.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for serveral years and he explains any problems I have to me in detail.  He describes and goes over every decision made and we decide on treatment option together.  
-1	I don't have any reason not to trust my doctor. I will continue to trust her until she does something to earn my distrust. I would apply the same standard to any doctor.
-1	I've been seeing this PCP for the majority of my life so i trust her judgement on most medical decisions. Sometimes i feel as if though she has a lot on her plate and can't spend more than a few moments reviewing certain pieces of information about my medical history, but overall she touches base on all of my medical concerns. 
-1	A couple of times she had misdiagnose my illness. I went to a specialist after talking to my Primary care practician
1	I generally am in good health, but that's partly due to having some knowledge of nutrition as well as a working understanding of well-being. Accordingly, I can tell when a doctor is bullshitting me but I find that they generally don't.
-1	I have pcos and I feel like the doctor is always trying to give me false hope with something new that I haven't tried that will help me have another baby. Sometimes I feel like they look at me as a money person who will pay. 
-1	I trust doctors mainly because I don't really have a reason not to. I have never been mislead by a doctor or have received any bad medical advice in the past. 
1	I trust doctors that take time to go over any questions I have in detail. They are not rushing out of the room to get to the next appointment. They see me as a human and not a dollar sign or bottom line.
-1	He is the new young doctor at the clinic I go to. Straight out of residency. A few times he has had to consult with the other doctor there. I take this as a good sign. I know he will never give a bad diagnosis or advice
-1	I recently started with a new primary doctor and I don't trust her.  She has not been very helpful and just wants to send me off to other specialists.  She's not really helping me.
1	I trust my doctor because he's been with me for quite a while and he's never brushed off any of my concerns.  While he talks to me like I'm a friend, when he needs to be, he's serious and blunt and makes sure that I understand what's going to happen.  The one time I needed surgery, his recommendation was wonderful.  He regularly checked up on me and made sure I was recovering nicely which definitely made me feel more like a friend rather than just a patient.  Considering that and the way he thoroughly explains things to me, I have complete trust in him.
1	My primary care Doctor is great. She spends a lot of time with me and monitors my health very closely! She is really caring and gets really excited if I eat healthy and drop weight and get my BP down and my cholestral down. She is a nice person and if she is late she will apologise when she comes in unlike most Doctors!
1	Because i have been going to him for over 5 years and he has always been good to me he listen to me and he would never put me on anything that he wouldn't put his family on
1	He is trained to do his job and to do it well. He took an oath and doctors are supposed to keep up with the latest research and developments in health care. If he makes a mistake he risks his job and reputation not to mention his ability to practice medicine. I have no reason to doubt he would do everything he can to help me as my doctor.
-1	My doctor wants what is best for me and will prescribe the best course of action. He has a lot of experience doing what he does, so I trust his decision and authority over anything that I might think.
1	Because if they lie to me they would be in big trouble. Doctors should always be truthful to their patients at all times no matter what.
1	I have no reason not to trust my primary care physician.  She has always been straight forward with me.  She listens, investigates the problems, provides a solution, and if the solution is not working, then we work together to find another solution.  I wouldn't say i have complete faith in her, but i trust her and her ability very much.
1	I trust him because I never feel rushed or pressured when I go in for a visit. The nurses seem to also care a lot and help where and when they can. My doctor also tries to make himself available outside of the office, which is really nice.
-1	I feel neutral about them because sometimes I feel like they are just telling me the most common solution to my problem instead of thinking outside the box.  Sometimes I feel like they make excuses so they don't have to really think in depth about what could be wrong with me.  
-1	The doctors office i go to is always so busy. I normally have to wait a very long time for appointment. Then when the doctor sees me now it does not last for more than 20 minutes. They are always telling me to leave and that there is nothing I can do.
1	She is always helpful and straightforward with me. She seeks to empathize with issues I've been having and understand better what's going on with me. For example, she asked me about my vegetarianism when I told her that was something I was doing.
1	My doctor is an excellent communicator, a good listener and expresses his opinions with confidence.  He is well-trained, experienced and view him as a trusted friend. I trust him and confide in him.
-1	I think that overall I trust my doctor, but will verify for myself if there is anything that she says that I am suspicious of.
-1	I trust that most doctors have the patient's best interest in mind. I don't have a general distrust for doctors, but I also don't blindly accept their opinion. I always research.
-1	I never completely trust anyone.  I think that all doctors are purely in it for the money first and patient well being a distant second.  
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I feel there are things besides good medical practice which afffect the decision making of my doctor. When it comes to treatments, I feel my doctor is influenced by the pharmaceutical industry either directly (through an active relationship) or indirectly (through the funding that is given by those companies to research which then dictates what treatments are available or not).
-1	My doctor has been a family friend for years and is aware of my needs. My doctor treats me like a member of family and makes sure that someone has the information I need before I leave in case I forget what needs to be done at a later date or later on in the day. 
1	My doctor is very open and honest. She just not speak down to me or just give me orders. She communicates with me in a dialogue, listening to my concerns and opinions. She shows real interest, offers advice, and listens. She does not lecture but works with me as a teammate to take care of my health.
1	He seems to know what he is talking about and explains things quite well, so i trust what he tells me.  So far I have no reason not to.
-1	"I know that my doctor is at the mercy of insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. He doesn't have time to invest in talking to me, he has to electronically chart my case in detail to kickstart the billing process, and he often does that in front of me. His waiting room has pens, clocks, and other knickknacks branded to pharmaceuticals, and his exam room has branded ""informational"" posters, all of which are badges of bias. "
-1	Many doctors seem to rush through appointments and take the easy solutions when a more thorough visit might be appropriate along with discussion of all treatment options.
-1	I don't currently have a PCP, but have had two children in under 2 years, so I am answering in regard to my OB/GYN. Unfortunately, the Banner office I go to does not allow me to see my regular doctor all of the time and forces you to rotate through doctors. There are 3 that I really like and trust and the rest I do not know so well. Also, during my latest labor (Sept 2017), the doctor told me we needed to use the vacuum because my son's heart rate was dipping. I pushed him out on the next try, after she had already attached he vacuum. Even though it wasn't used to extract him, he now has a calcified bump on his head from the vacuum suction. I do not feel like I was given other choices in the moment. 
1	I have been seeing my doctor for 15 years. He sends me to specialist when my care is outside of his realm of primary care and so far he has sent me to doctors that have been pretty good with my specialties. There was a time that I did not have insurance and my doctor did his best to do what he could that would help without insurance.
1	We have a family doctor that I started going to at an early age and now this doctor sees my daughter. Myself and my family members have been seeing this doctor for many of years. There has been a lot of trust built between us We do believe he has our best interests in mind..
1	I trust my primary care because he hasn't ever done anything wrong. He gives me the utmost care and isn't ever in a rush. But to say I completely trust him would say I don't trust my own hunches. I know when something is wrong with my body so I can't put all trust in him. He's great at what he does but he can only do so much.
1	As I mentioned earlier, my father was admitted a week ago to my hometown hospital with kidney failure and pneumonia so I'm drawing on my past week. I haven't been to a doctor in a long time or had any medical issues. My interactions with his primary care physician, cardiologist, renal specialist and all his supporting staff have been professional, transparent, caring and seem to be of the highest quality. He's in rehab today after flat-lining and a close brush with death and I have nothing but respect for every medical professional  I've dealt with.
1	She addresses all my questions in a thoughtful and caring manor. She never seems like she's trying to rush me out of the exam room. Also, I've been seeing her for a few years and have never had a bad interaction or diagnosis that was wrong.
-1	I trust my doctor and his decisions about what is right for me, but overall I am know what is best for me and I do not trust many medications.
-1	In general, I trust my doctor. Sometimes I get disappointed. That happens when I cannot get an appointment when I need it, I do not get phone calls from doctor's office informing me about a problem when I have to wait for a refill of medications.
-1	I generally think that doctors are good people who go into medicine to try to help people. I also believe that like any profession, there are nuances that average people do not understand or care to, and I can not completely trust an individual who has personal incentive to provide you care that is not necessarily ideal for you. As long as pharmaceuticals are as big of an industry as they are I cannot completely trust doctors. 
1	I have a really good relationship with my primary care physician.  I've been seeing the same primary care physician for over 7 years now.  He's helped me through issues that I knew I had (anxiety/depression) and also issues I didn't know I had (possible melanoma).  I have gotten to know some about his background as well, and given what I know, I trust him implicitly. 
1	I just had my doctor leave the practice I go to and I've started seeing a new PA.  She is very nice, but we are still getting to know each other and figure out communication.  My PA was very nice and straight forward the last night I met with her and listens to my questions.
-1	Sometimes I feel like doctors thinks they know more about what I'm feeling than I do. It sometimes makes it difficult for them to take me seriously and leads to them downplaying my symptoms or ignoring some of them and telling me it's nothing or I'm worrying too much.
1	I have seen the same doctor for years who I have an extremely close relationship with.  He has been honest with me whether it has been a negative or positive thing that we are speaking about.  After him giving me extra time and going out of his way for me on separate occasions, he has more than proved himself as genuine.
1	I trust  my primary care physician because I have seen her for years and she is actively involved while I'm at my appointments. If I have a question she takes her time to find out the answer if its not something she can immediately answer and gets back to me about it. She also spent more time training for her profession than me. 
-1	It is her job and she has the training necessary to give me proper information; she also seems to really care about her job rather than just going through the motions and takes time to think about questions I have rather than answering off the cuff, which seems to mean that she is giving some real thought.
-1	I trust my primary care physician sometimes. This is because I have been seeing him for awhile and he has prescribed me my birth control, iron pills for having low white blood cell counts, and has given me different types of medicine for my anxienty. The only thing is that I have complained about both axienty medicine pills making me extremely sleepy and my doctor has not done anything about it. I took it upon myself to stop taking the pills because I hated being sleepy all day long. Doctors should also not be giving patients all of these opioids and other pills like xanax where people can get extremely addicted. That is why I do not trust doctors.
1	I trust my primary care physician. I believe that he cares about his patients and gets them the help they need. He is competent and if he can't help with a specific problem he can recommend a doctor that can.
-1	I have trust in doctors because i feel that are trained very well and see things everyday and know about them.  I feel my doctor is paid accordingly and should trust my doctor as she would know best and whats best for me regarding my health. My doctor is usually a no nonsense kind of doctor and is very direct which is what i prefer so i know exactly where i stand.  
-1	I some times dont trust doctors as they have become commercial now a days and sometimes they are selfish about their own growth financially irrespective of the patient's health. sometimes i do trust my doctor's decision but sometimes m doubtfull but dunno why but no doctor is more careful about my medical needs than his own.
-1	once again i know how to trust the doctors because when I was young my mom and dad taught me everything I need to know about how to talk to my doctor and stuff.
1	he always answers all of my questions, explaining things in a way that i as a non-medical person, can comprehend.
-1	My physician has forgotten medical information about me, and had to be retold. Also, my physician has said offensive things that seem to step across the line of patient and doctor relationship. I haven't switched because I'm only living here for one year and hopefully don't get sick until I move. Finding a new physician would take too long to get in. So I don't really trust my physician.
-1	My primary care physician is not very thorough. He also doesn't take my concerns that serious. It also seems as though he is always rushed when I go in for an appointment. 
1	I've been in and out of doctor's office since I was a teenager to help with my depression/anxiety issues. With the exception of a few, all have been genuine people who have shown a complete and utter dedication to helping me be my best physically and mentally.
-1	I suppose there are numerous reasons why I don't trust doctors, but the biggest reason for me is that I feel most get into the profession because they want to make a lot of money. The concern for them isn't treating sickness out of the good of their heart, they simply desire to make a lot of money, even if they sacrifice their time/well being for it. It's about them being well off, not me. For me, this is an icky feeling and I have trouble getting over it. I have met doctors whom I have come to trust, but that takes time and they have to prove exceptional to get over that greed-hurdle I've imposed on them.
1	For me, the default is to trust doctors, and my PCP has given me no reason to distrust him. In addition, he has always been sympathetic and responsive to any problems I bring up. He also does some community events. I believe he cares about and values all of his patients, including me.
-1	Before my doctor's office was so busy it was hard to get an appointment and it was never the same doctor. I have a new doctor now and he seems more detailed but I felt rushed again. 
1	I have had the same primary doctor for at least a decade. He is a primary care physician, and he has never done me wrong. He is flexible enough to let me try new drugs when they are helpful in being productive in my life.
-1	My PCP has always been very kind, thoughtful, and educated. I have never felt like an idiot while being in the office with her. 
-1	I just moved to a new city and have only met with one doctor. She doesn't have the personality to work with me. I'm very educated about my disease and she pretty much brushed me off instead of working with me. I wish doctors would listen to their patients instead of putting them on a 5 minute time clock. 
-1	Doctors are highly educated but may not have all the information regarding every disease, particularly chronic illnesses and it is always better to do your own research as long as it is done properly and well.
1	I have an excellent PA who has consistently steered me in the right direction with the treatment of my health and I believe he listens and understands my concerns.
1	My primary care physician has only ever shown me they are thorough.  They do not make me feel rushed and always provide a satisfactory answer and checkup before they move on.
-1	I think i trust the physicians to do their job to the best of their ability. Sometimes, i think that there are areas that are too specialized and then i seek out more information. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician for the most part because he treats my whole family, but I personally don't get along with his personality that much. I feel like he jokes around and doesn't get to the point fast enough. I trust that he knows of A way to treat something, but he feels very confined in his treatments and doesn't feel comfortable exploring other options outside his comfort zone.
-1	I distrust my doctor because of medical advice that he gave me, that turned out to be completely false. This makes me have little trust in doctors in general.
1	I have never had an experience with my current primary care physician that would make me question my trust in them.  They have always been helpful, receptive and caring.
-1	I believe physicians or primary care go to school to have the up most education in understanding another human. Sometimes you know your self too much to want to hear what a physician has to say. But its always great to hear the physician out because that its there job to do so. They are there to help the public and anyone in need.
1	In my family we have the habit of always seeing the same doctor and socializing with him, because of that, the trust we have for him and, apart from that, he has proven to be a reliable person over the years.
-1	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE I HAVE GONE TO HIM FOR MANY YEARS.  I CAN ASK QUESTIONS AND HE ALWAYS EXPLAINS THING ADN TAKES GOOD CARE OF ME.
-1	I think they have a good knowledge of medical things. Sometimes they might do what is safer than more effective
-1	I usually trust doctors to provide the best care possible for me or my family.  As long as frequent checkups and follow-ups occur, doctors can closely monitor a patient's health and provide the appropriate treatments for any conditions they may have.  As long as a doctor keeps a good relationship with me and makes me feel comfortable I trust in them to have good intentions for my health.
1	I trust my doctor because we have built up a solid report, where she listens to and respects my feelings and does not trivialize them.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician as I rarely need a doctor and if I do, it is for something specialized (kidneys). In general cases, I trust doctors and believe they give me credible, appropriate information but I'm not willing to completely believe everything.
-1	In general, I will trust what my doctor has to say 90% of the time, and may do more research on my own about their suggested treatments. They have the experience to know the different treatments, surely more than I know doing research. If I ever feel like my doctor doesn't really have my best interest in heart, I will get a second opinion.  The more I've seen one doctor in particular, the more likely I am in trusting what they have to say to me. 
-1	I have an equal amount of trust as I do distrust with my doctor, given that I know him and my mother talk, and that I distrust her entirely with my health causes an issue. I believe that what I say to him can impact my home life, because it gets back to my mother. In general, i suppose I trust doctors, as long as they're not corrupt or anything. When I will be tasked with finding my own doctor, I will look long and hard for someone I believe to be trustworthy
-1	Sometimes I feel that my physician has a lot going on and not a lot of attention going toward me. I understand that they are overworked but I do feel that I will need to take charge of my own health if I feel that they do not completely understand me. I will take what they say strongly into consideration but if it does not seem to fit me, I believe that I know myself better than they do.
-1	I trust them because they have taken some health issues (depression, anxiety) more seriously than other doctors I have seen. I sometimes feel rushed though, so I am unsure if I always receive the complete truth or all my options. Overall I feel I have a good relationship with them and accept their opinions. 
1	Generally, I feel they have little reason to be dishonest or disingenuous, compared to the large incentive they have to be truthful and helpful.
1	I was taught to trust doctors and those in authority.  Even though I may have questions regarding what they are prescribing or telling me what to do, I still do have some skepticism.  Doctors often work with pharmaceutical companies and I wonder if the drugs they suggest are actually good for me or good for their profession and their bottom line (AKA money).  
-1	It's not more of a trust or distrust, it is more of a time thing. I feel like doctors, including my own, need to be able to spend more than 3-5 minutes with a patient. Yes, I know I have a cough and sneezing, so my asthma is acting up. Don't just throw a new inhaler on me. Give me some options and other things I can do at home. I want to know the options I have for medications too. So I feel that adds a little mistrust, but I still feel like he is a good physician. I hope that makes sense. 
-1	I have more trust in doctors than I distrust them but there are always exceptions. Mostly it comes down to the situation because there are times when I can tell that they are hard pressed for time due to having a lot of patients. If it is a serious medical issue I would also want a second or third opinion regardless of the trust I have in my doctor.
-1	I trust my doctor because they have never given me a reason not to. I have been seeing the same primary care physician for about six years now and they always address all the questions I have and spend a fair amount of time with me. I have always felt well taken care of.
1	I trust my doctor because she has always listened to my issues and questions.  She always gets back to me with an answer if I happen to email or call her.  I have always felt safe and well taken care of and I never worry about her not getting back to me.  She really cares about me and my well-being and it shows in her interactions with me.
-1	I trust  my doctor in their opinion Until I donât recently were sent to separate specialist with a special said what are you doing here and they couldnât understand why the doctors on is there because there wasnât a problem and that cost $600 over heâs help me and a lot of other ways but thatâs a lot though
-1	my previous experience with my primary care physician gave me the impression that he was more interested in me as a cash cow than as a patient.
-1	I do have a lot of trust in my physician as he has always been there for me, he tries very hard to get me n to see him in case of an emergency, and he has even called me at home to check on me, after I have seen him.
-1	He would rather talk about himself and laugh at his jokes than pay attention to my needs.  I can get whatever prescription I would like, just by asking. He doesn't remember from one visit to the next anything about me.  When he is not laughing and not paying attention, he has his nose in that stupid computer of it.   
-1	Although I tend to trust my doctor, I am also a little bit skeptical.  Having worked with many different doctors I know there are many that think they know everything or are influenced by pharmaceutical companies and won't listen to the patient's ideas or won't take the patient seriously because they're the doctor and know better.  
-1	I do not completely trust my doctor because it seems as though he really doesn't care anymore. He is close to retiring and just seems as though he wants to get in and get out of the room as quickly as possible. 
-1	I feel that my primary doctor is very trustworthy but is quick in the amount of time he allots to my visits. I would like a doctor to spend all necessary amount of time with me to explain everything and answer all of my questions.
-1	I distrust all the doctors because I do not see that they try to help, they just thinking how to sell expensive medicine or expensive treatment. They offered my son a new medicine for treating his allergy for $100 out of pocket, this medicine is extremely new and doesn't tested enough, knowing that allergy problems start from the gut I can't except the doctor who sell skin creme and doesn't think about the gut. This doctor drives Tesla is that possible, no. That is why I am extremely careful I try not to argue but can't accept to work who are thinking about their profit instead of helping patients
1	I trust my primary care doctor very much. I have only had need to see her twice, but she was a good listener and very thorough both times. I can contrast this with doctors past with whom I had trouble getting my needs addressed. 
1	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been going to her for years. She is a very caring and understanding physician. She listens to your needs and helps you find a solution to your problems that makes you comfortable. She doesnât make you feel pressured nor incompetent when you donât understand the health terminology. She breaks things down so you can understand and she makes sure she available if you have any questions or concerns. My physician takes pride in what she does and itâs transmitted through her having our best interest at heart.
1	I believe my doctor is talented and capable.  I place a large amount of faith in my doctor and I feel that it is rewarded often. 
1	I trust my primary care physician, because he is careful with me and medication (I'm very sensitive to medications).  He understands when I do not want to continue on a certain medication (because of the side effects I have read about or have been told about by other medical professionals).  He spends time with me discussing my health issues and immediately responds when I send him a message via my health portal.  He remembers my health record and seems to know my past history even though he has hundreds of patients.
-1	I tend to trust my PCP because my family and I have been with him for a long time. Negative experiences with new, specialized doctors have recently led me to doubt/question all doctors.
1	I trust my physician because they always ask whether I am doing okay or whether a certain medication is working for me. They want to make sure that I am in good health every time that I go to the doctors office for a visit. 
1	I have complete trust in my doctor because I have been his patient since I was 19 years old.This doctor has delivered all 3 of my kids and I know if I tell him something that conversation stays between him and myself. He's very professional and he cares about his patients.
-1	I trust my doctor to do her job. To diagnose and treat. Doctors have gone to countless lectures and read numerous medical books and journals. They know much more about the human body and how it works than I do. With that being said, Doctors are still people and they do make mistakes but I trust them a lot more than Iâd trust a medically uneducated person to treat me.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has known me since I was baby. She makes sure that I know what is going with my body at all times but she also tells it how it is.
-1	I trust most doctors because I do not believe they have ulterior motives. I know a lot of people think that the medical field is a sham, and doctors are only interesting in making a buck off sick people, but I genuinely believe that most doctors are good, honest, hard working people. If we did not have trustworthy doctors, there would be a lot more issues in the world than there currently are. There are also a lot of things in place to keep doctors ethical. It is a huge part of the profession. I doubt people who spend years of their life competing to be the best have any desire to be untrustworthy or scam people. 
1	he is very knowledgeable and always provides different options and talks about possible side effects and is a great listener,not in a rush to get to the next patient.
-1	"I do trust medical professional to do the right thing or at least provide the correct treatment to their patients, however, I feel that it is very easy in this day and age for a doctor to overlook things (or not want to look into issues further because they are ""sure"" that's not what it is) I also think that doctors tend to over diagnose and test for things they don't necessarily need to in order to receive more money from the insurance companies."
1	I'm trust in my doctor because I know him since I'm a child and every time that he told me something is right he is someone with sense of kind and he is helpful and he care about his patience, He can make mistake like everyone because is human but I trust completely in him.
1	I trust my primary care physician because they do give me all the information I need to maintain good health and that all depends on me doing my due diligence and ask all the questions I should be asking about my health.  She's never late when I arrive wait times are no longer than 15 minutes and she does listen. My only blip is when they couldn't tell why I suffered the emergency, but it's not like she doesn't want me to know...right now they just don't have the answer.   
-1	"I don't completely distrust my primary care physician as much as I think he just doesn't care.  He seems pretty apathetic and uninterested in what's going on with me.  I don't think he realizes that I do take my health seriously most of the time and so I am going to do things that most people won't do to take charge of my health.  Where most people want a magic pill, I am willing to make changes in my lifestyle.  I don't think my doctor necessarily cares.  He just wants to prescribe a pill because it's the quickest easiest way to ""fix"" the problem."
1	I trust them because they are supposed to be the experts.  If i go to a doctor and i feel like their diagnosis isn't right, I will go get another opinion.  I trust them until they give me a reason not to.
-1	I'm not sure I trust him because he's a psychiatrists I've been seeing for 5 years.  I'm going downhill and he doens't seem concerned.  he's told me to look on the internet for advice that he should be giving.
-1	The last time I want to my doctor he seemed rushed and had other things to do do. He said he was going to do a tetnas shot that day. He never marked it in his notes so the nurse never gave it. 
1	My doctor is a great doctor, but she has so many patients (1800) that it is just hard to trust her 100%. She is a doctor at a VA hospital and they are always so busy that they may sometimes overlook or not notice something. 
1	I have a NP who is under the license of a PCP. I love her! She is more thorough and caring than any other physician I have seen (other than my best friend, who is a nephrologist) in many, many years. The thing I like most about her is she really listens to my, my needs and wants, and I can trust her with anything.
-1	It's great to have a personal doctor and it was could be the way u can save your life.An they care about u more
1	My doctor is amazing.  When I have had a medical condition, everything was done to get me to the correct specialists to make sure it was taken care of.  My doctor even called me after the appointments to follow up.
-1	She is thorough and informative, and won't give you unnecessary drugs. She actually tries to get to the root cause of ailments instead of treating the symptoms 
1	My primary care physician is the only physician that I've had so far that hasn't made me feel bad about my body or my health decisions. She works with me to come up with the best plan and answers any questions I have about my treatment. 
-1	I distrust my doctor because he is always in a hurry when I see him. I feel like nothing but a number to him during most visits. 
-1	For me personally, I spent several years with an diagnosed problem, despite how often I was going to see my doctor about the problem.  Being that this problem was causing incredible pain, I am a bit distrustful of both my doctor and doctors in general.  I do not blame my doctor for missing it, but I do blame them for not even suggesting that my problem could have even been the cause.
1	I think I could trust my primary care physician to give me the care I need. I don't have one currently but I should probably find one. I would prefer a female doctor so I can talk honestly about my needs and concerns without feeling like I am being treated like it's 'all in my head'.
1	Because she is always open and honest with me. She doesnât sugar coat anything for me. And that is exactly the way I like it. She takes her time with me. She never acts like she s in a hurry or look at her watch and clock all the time.
1	Well they are there to help you, no reason to lie or trick people unless they have a horrible agenda under their belt to hurt some one. but I trust them very much because they have helped me. Now I wont go to a doctor the doesn't seem to care how I feel or treat me with respect.
-1	My doctor has been working for many years. I trust his experience, but sometimes I doubt his knowledge of up to date medical procedures/medications/causes.
-1	Well in general, doctors sometimes listen to you and sometimes have their own agenda. I had a doctor once that knew I was allergic to codeine, so kept giving me 'alternatives' that I was also allergic to, even if I told him, yes, it says if you are allergic to codeine to not take this other one. 
1	I have no reason not to trust my doctor.  So far, she has always been thorough and helpful with any problem I am experiencing.
1	While I was in the Army, I had no trust in my medical professionals. Now that I am a civilian, my doctors seem to actively listen and care about solving any issues that arise. 
-1	I have had issues with doctors prescribing medication that has harmed me while pregnant.  I have a son who has hearing loss due to a medication provided to me while I was pregnant.  I later found out it was not approved for pregnant women.  I also suffered a miscarriage after taking some medication prescribed for a virus from a doctor.  I can't say that it was caused by the medication or the virus, but looking back, I still don't trust that the medication was safe.
1	In general, I trust my doctor to take into consideration my wellbeing when and guide me in the right direction but at the same time I have reservations about whether they are giving me ALL the possible options.
-1	I don't trust or not trust my doctor, I just feel like they always point my symptoms at something that it's not. And I also worked in a doctor's office, so it made me not trust doctors as much as I would like to.
1	I trust my primary physician because I take the time to ask them questions and gauge their answer.  If they do not seem to speak as if they have my needs in their consideration, I switch physicians.
-1	I believe that my doctor is honest and trustworthy, but with all of the resources out there on the internet to research your health symptoms, it is hard for me to put complete trust in my doctor. I have also heard so many stories of people being misdiagnosed and the results were almost catastrophic! I have always been told to trust my instincts if I think that something is not right. That makes me so nervous to just accept what doctors tell me. I also ask for extra testing or information to double, even triple check what my doctor is telling me.
-1	Overall i trust that doctors have my best interest but sometimes i don't think they take what i'm saying seriously and that could because they see so many patients that they don't have time to really hone into the problem
-1	I trust my primary care physician because the few times I have been when I had a problem they were able to diagnose me correctly and do the right thing to get me better again.  
-1	In general regards to doctors as a whole, I feel that they are very rushed and dishonest. They do not take the time to answer all my questions and make sure I feel comfortable or am fully informed about any decisions being made.
1	I have learned to be very selective in choosing who I work with as a health care provider. If I find myself in a situation where I don't believe the provider is communicating on my level, or if they raise their voice or are clearly not concerned about my quality of life, I will cease to be their patient as soon as possible and find other practitioners. I also, have, on occasion, written letters of complaint to practitioners. The physician I currently am seeing is someone I've had a relationship with all my life, and from her way of communicating, I can see that she has good judgement.
-1	I don't have one primary care doctor, and the doctors at the Army hospital are more interested in keeping the patient flow moving than they are in effectively treating their patients, whom they will most likely never see again.
-1	Its important to me to have a good relationship and a strong degree of trust with a chosen physician.  I'm relying on the physician to take good care of me and use good judgment.  They do the best they can I'm sure.  The patient too, has an active role in the relationship so try to do my best as well.
-1	I feel like it's a treadmill these days. The doctor listens to you the customer about your problems and try to give you a quick bandaid fix to your problems and most of the time, just tell you to wait a few days for your immune system to take care of it. I trust their authority most of the time, but feel like there's some hidden information not given as well.
-1	I take everything with a grain of salt. In most situations, I will follow the recommendations of my primary care physician as they typically know what is best, however I also do my own research. Occasionally, if I don't feel my questions have been answered satisfactorily then I will seek a second opinion. 
-1	I have a good amount of trust in my doctor- he seems to have my best interests at heart. He doesnât rush when he sees or examines me and takes copious notes that are added to my electronic file. He has his staff do follow- ups if he canât do them himself. 
1	I have been seeing my primary doctor for seven years.  She is through, and takes the time to listen to all of my concerns.  Although I have many health conditions, they are all controlled by twenty prescriptions.  I feel my main concern is RLS, which I research at RLS.ORG.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have family members the use the same one and have had good experiences. He follows up on my health with phone calls and long conversations.
-1	I generally distrust doctors because they seem prone to prescribing drugs to put a Band-Aid on a problem rather than fix the problem itself.  I would be far more trusting if I found a doctor that was willing to help me fix the issue.
1	I trust my doctor, but I'm also interested in doing my own research, asking questions, and ensuring that I understand the reasoning behind the choices made.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is kind and caring.  He gives me options about my treatment, tells be about research that has been done, and lets me choose what I think is the best option.
-1	My doctor does not seem to give as much effort into examination of me.  They mainly just ask a few questions and then take a quick look.  I feel that therapists would be much more helpful.
1	I trust my doctor because I have no reason not to and she is competent. Again, I have had only routine visits, nothing serious, so I don't have a lot to base it on.
-1	I feel good about my primary care doctor because I've been seeing her for a while and she's helped me several times when sick or feeling depressed, etc. but I don't have the same good feelings about most doctors in general. 
1	I feel like I get an adequate amount of feedback and explanation for their decision making to understand their thought process leading to the medical decision.
-1	I feel like sometimes my physician takes the extreme treatment option first, as in, wanting to do surgery immediately, versus taking a less invasive option first and seeing if it works. I often feel like my physician has one foot out the door because there are too many other patients waiting to be seen. I would rather weigh all of my options and start with the lest invasive option, and move further up the scale if it is needed.
-1	I feel that most doctors become doctors in order to do good and help people, however a few can let greed and selfishness get in the way of their original goals. I have been fortunate to have mostly positive interactions with my medical professionals throughout my life. 
-1	My doctor always tells it like it is and is completely trustworthy and down to earth. She knows that money is an issue and tries to make things as easy on me as possible
1	I trust my primary physician because I've known him for many years. It is more of a built up trust that we have.
1	I have known my primary care physician for years. Every time I go there, I walk away positive and confident about my sickness and know that she will do what she can to help me get better. She is very thorough and has a lot of information to give and is patient with me. 
-1	I don't actually believe the doctor is actively trying to mislead, but are they getting an incentive to prescribe one drug over another????  and it is almost impossible to keep up on all the different medical studies.  How up to date are they???  are there other options they don't know about. 
1	It's just the feeling that I get. With doctors it is all about trust. If I didn't trust a doctor I would shop around until I found one that I did trust. And again it would just be the feeling I got off of them that decided.
-1	Most of my interactions with my primary care physician are straight forward. I mainly interact with him for general check ups so as long as nothing is wrong most of what I hear from him is that everything is good.
1	My doctor is around the same age as me. She is very aware that weight loss is important but it's not as simple as just losing some pounds. She has never pushed any shots or drugs on me if I'm not interested.
-1	My husband is in the Air Force so I have to see the military doctor on base.  Sometimes I feel rushed when I come in for an appointment and don't really get my needs met.  Sometimes I have a couple of problems but them only want to talk about one and that can be frustrating because I can't keep taking time off work to come in for everything.  There have been a few times where I've come in for a problem, one time in particular for an ear ache, and the treatment my doctor prescribed didn't work at all.  Instead of just referring me to a specialist they made me come in for another visit.  In the end, I'm still dealing with this ear problem that comes and goes.
1	I simply trust my doctor, because every time I needed to go to him, he was very clear and helpful about what ever the situation is. My doctor has been in his practice for over 20 years and he is very knowledgeable about his practice. 
-1	I have found that a lot of them will prescribe something because they benefit from the pharmaceutical representatives. I usually do more research on medicines to find out which is best for me. Some doctors know more or just care more than others. 
1	I made sure to get friends opinions and also to do online research when choosing my doctor. She has an amazing bedside manner and makes me feel at ease. She does not over react and also does not under react.  I think there are some doctors that can come across as condescending and she is not like that at all.  It takes a special doctor to be able to answer your questions without making you feel like stupid!
-1	I trust my physician in general medical information, such as if I have the flu or strep throat or something like that. But if it was a serious medical diagnosis I would probably want to get a second opinion to make sure that they were onto something.
1	I feel my Dr. always listens to me and seems very caring. She always takes her time and is not in a hurry to get to the next patent. She explains everything more then once and always ask me if I have any questions and if I do when I get home to call or email her. 
-1	I don't have a PCP, so I'm just going based on random visits I have. Doctors seem rushed and unwilling to challenge anything other than their first assessment. 
-1	I distrust him because he just wants to hand out pills instead of getting to the root cause of the problem. He has been treating me for migraines for years and years and it turns out it wasn't even migraines. It was tension headaches. So he just wanted to switch me to a different medication instead of offering massage with the physical therapist (which is covered by the insurance).  I had to make a huge scene to get him to let me go to physical therapy over just trying to medicate the pain away. He's so focused on getting through his appointments in his allotted 15 minute slots that it keeps him from giving an honest look into the best solution for each patient individually. Some patients may be perfectly content with popping pills, but I'm not. He should have said here are the options available, which do you prefer?  But that doesn't happen with this doctor at all. 
-1	I feel like doctors are fallible.  Doctors are just people with extensive training and the body is such a difficult and complex machine.  I don't blame my doctors for not being accurate 100% of the time, but I think that it helps to keep an open mind and trust what my body is telling me. 
-1	I believe they do a good job, are a decent person and a good doctor. However I would still never put my trust completely fully in them, not without them earning my full trust in some way.
-1	I don't know where the doctor is coming from or what motivates the doctor. I am young so the doctor would probably overlook serious issues and may misdiagnose me
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a medical doctor. He once brought a medical condition to me that I had ignored for a long time and he persistently asked me if I had certain issues that I was in denial of. He recommended getting some blood work done and I am so glad I did because it turned out I was actually pretty sick on the inside. Once I started a treatment for this medical condition I improved so much. I trust him for reasons like this. 
1	I have used the same PCP for  the last 5 years. In that time ihave got to trust his decisions on my health care.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician, but base my answers on the experiences I have had with various medical professionals. I have had some negative experiences with medical professionals where I feel they did not give me any valuable advice or services, but I was stuck with a large bill. One example was an experience where I went to a doctor for a birth control prescription. I was told I could not be prescribed the medicine without having my blood drawn, something I have never heard before. A nurse attempted to draw my blood unsuccessfully before asking that I visit a phlebotomist. I got stuck with a bill for an unsuccessful appointment, which generally is covered under my insurance as preventative care. Instead of going to the phlebotomist, I went to another doctor and got what I needed, all included by my insurance.
1	I believe they are legally required to tell the truth, based on the information they are given. If I truly didn't trust the doctor on something I would go to another doctor and see if they have the same conclusion.
-1	I don't see a primary care doctor because I have had trouble finding one that really listens to me and works with me to solve my medical problems. It seems to me that they are too busy most of the time and want to solve the immediate need that I have come in for, rather than working towards long term health. 
1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR HE HAS BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR US FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS ALWAYS LED US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH THOROUGH AND EXCELLENT MEDICAL CARE
-1	I trust my doctor because of the relationship I have built over the years. Also my doctor has a stable client base and they have never misdiagnosed or prescribed anything I would refer to as unecessary.
-1	My doctors tend to rely more on pharmaceuticals to treat common problems, even when other options are available. I'm not sure if she's playing it safe or if it's just easier.  I believe all options should be made available to the client/patient and then allow the client/patient to decide the best course of treatment for them. 
-1	My Doctor is first off human and fallible. Second, he has repeatedly failed to listen to me and my symptoms when I have described conditions, only to discover that I indeed had the condition which I claimed. He also has a tendency to talk over me and has no real regard for my health, only placating my symptoms and referring me to specialists.
-1	He usually explains the situation to me, asks my opinion when choosing a treatment. This way, he earned my trust
-1	physicians tend to look out for themselves and only provide medical advice/prescriptions based on what pharmaceutical company is paying them the most. They are overworked and don't spend enough time with their patients. 
1	She is straight forward with me and lets me know about the options that I have. She doesn't sugar coat things and doesn't pressure me in to decisions that are unnecessary. I feel that she actually cares about my health. 
-1	I have a long-standing relationship with her and she has been right about diagnosis and treatment the vast majority of the time. During times where I've had complications, she's made herself available to me and has been flexible.
1	Doctors are highly trained professionals. They know what the best course of action for your conditions are better than you do. I think you should just trust and be honest with them if they have not given you a reason to do otherwise.
-1	I do trust my physician with my medical treatment. I do feel as if he rushes me through my appointments and doesn't necessarily treat my issues with the severity I feel they may be. I have found that any issues with mental health are taken more seriously though.
-1	I just switched my primary care doc after over 20 years so I really don't know her all that well.  It isn't that I don't trust her; she's just new to me.  Being a nurse, I do have doctors that I work with that I trust and will ask their opinion on something from time to time.
1	I mainly trust him because he is a smart person who is detail oriented and when he explains something to me it makes sense to me. I have had doctors who tried to shoot me a line of bull to manipulate me which may seem good to them but if it does not make sense I can't believe anything they say.
-1	I have a good endocrinologist that I trust with medical issues; however, when it comes to diet recommendations he does not have accurate info.  I listen to my body and know that I must eat a ketogenic diet which my doctor does not agree with.
-1	I mean, overall I have trust.  That doesn't mean I wouldn't look for a second opinion on something life changing.  I always felt that most all Dr's know more then I do about these things.  I don't like it when they seem more interested in pushing a particular pill my way to mask rather then to look for ways to fix any certain condition.
-1	"I sometimes feel doctors prescribe way too much medication - pushing the latest drug of choice, which may or may not be a good choice for me.  I prefer to research drugs before using them and would prefer a doctor that would respect when I say ""No that isn't suitable for me - find something else"".  but too many doctors prefer the ""take this pill"" solution."
1	My PCP was recommended to me and I felt comfortable around her from the first time we met.  We have similar views about certain issues and that leads me to believe that she will definitely have my best interest in mind.
1	I trust him because in the years that I have gone to him he doesn't seem to push anything on me as far as medication and most times gives me a practical way to work with illnesses I might have.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor.  She has never given me something I don't understand and has always explained things carefully and thoroughly.  I understand enough about my diet and lifestyle to know if she gives me a medication that I probably need it.
1	My primary care person is an advanced practice nurse practitioner. She has demonstrated a high level of active care for me, and is extremely thorough in her work when examining me. She is an exceptional listener, and has even detected health issues of which I was not aware. She communicates very well, and takes all the time I need to address my health concerns.
1	I have had my doctor for a while now and have been to him many times.  He has always been kind, gentle, intelligent, and informative.  I think that he really cares about his patients and me specifically so I trust what he has to say.
-1	I dont feel like I trust my primary care physician because she seems to force me to take shots that I dont really need and forces unnecessary tests onto me just to make a few couple bucks. But she seems knowledgeable and thats the only reason i am sticking with her for now.
1	I trust my PCP because he is thoughtful and caring. He always asks about my health and if I have questions. He remembers my name and information we have discussed during prior appointments. He is thorough with examinations. He takes his time.
1	primary care physicians are there to help us, people may have different outlooks on treatment but none of them have a medical degree to back up there beliefs. We have doctors for a reason, they are trying to help us get well. Even a physical can make an error in treatment, I recently has a visit do the dermatologist and he prescribed me medication that did not help.There was no reason of me to be concerned, I called him back and got a different drug that helped. The amount of knowledge and understanding of science that the MD have is incredible. I'm very grateful for there service. Trusting your physician is important part of anybodies life, they will not harm you or judge you , they are there to help.
-1	My PCP is part of a group.  They need to see as many patients as possible.  They rarely have time to deliver quality health care and be able to think through all options.
1	I have never been given a reason to not trust my doctor and he always seems to take precautions even when he believes everything is ok.  This makes me feel better because he is not just going off of book knowledge and things he's seen in other cases.
1	 do not currently have a PC. in general i trust doctors because they are more knowledgeable than i am. this does not mean i do not see the value in second opinions, however, i recognize these are trained professionals who have a better understanding of any health issue i might have.
1	Because he is a good guy and I have known him a while now.  He often tells it like it is and doesnt sugarcoat things, but he is always honest.  He has often told me things that other doctors would tell me one way and he would say that was just a waste of money and it was.
-1	I think my primary care physician is really good at his job and I trust his recommendation most of the time.
-1	because she tells me nothing. she invites other doctors in that also say things like it doesn't look good but when you ask them what it is they say i can't tell you here is a referral to another doctor who then says the same things and prescribes drugs without an explanation at all of what it is and what its for
1	I trust my doctor completely because he has saved my life in the past and helped me to better myself.
-1	I am in control of my health and I like to do research on what the doctor is saying rather than blindly trusting them. 
-1	Although my GP is most likely intends to do her correctly, with the high number of patients under her care I can't trust that she able to fulfill her responsibilities. With the private health care system dominating in a society where so many people are below the poverty line, it becomes impossible to see a GP more than once a year. If you develop any medical issue between the appointments the only option for so many Americans is to go to the emergency room.   
1	My pcp is thorough and listens to my opinions about my medical issues. She frequently informs me of my options and lets me decide what I think is best for myself, since I know more about my problems than her.
-1	I feel they are under tremendous pressure to move quickly from patient to patient as well as keep costs low and use certain prescription vendors.
1	My current primary care physician is incredibly thorough in her evaluation of my health issues and in her explanation of the options available. Whenever she makes a recommendation she goes into a lot of detail about her logic behind the recommendation and explains why others might have a different opinion. I usually do some research after my appointments with all physicians in order to make sure that I understand all aspects of my illness or treatment and have never found the information my current doctor gives me to be lacking in any way.
-1	I feel that my primary care doctor often does not have nor take the time to listen to me thoroughly or allow me to ask in-depth questions.  Therefore, I cannot trust that the decisions that he makes for me is thoroughly informed. 
-1	For the most part I trust his knowledge.  I think the problem lies in our approaches to medical conditions. I am more interested in natural drug free options.  He may not always agree but he will allow me to make my own decisions.  
-1	I somewhat trust my primary care physician because I do not believe he shares with me all the possible solutions to my ailments. Many of the times he prescribes drugs for something that can be healed with more natural substances. I would like to know the full range of my options, from natural to prescribed medications when making a medical decision.
-1	My last primary care was a DO not an MD, and would not treat menopause as a medical condition.  I had to request a referral to an OB/GYN to treat my menopause symptoms.
1	I am lucky to live in an area where I have access to qualified medical care. My medical conditions are complex; I need to be able to trust my doctors. If I have any doubt, I move on. Otherwise, I am just wasting my time and theirs.
-1	"Doctors are generally good, but they only work with what you give them.  They make mistakes as well.  They ""practice"" medicine.  I know my body best, and many times have successfully diagnosed my own problems.  Doctors go on evidence and when they don't find any, they can sometimes dismiss you.  But I feel deep down, we as patients know when something is not right within us.  "
1	We have built a relationship over the years. He knows my conditions and understands my thoughts and concerns about them. He wants me to be happy and healthy 
-1	My physician is condescending. Usually when I have questions they're met with a 'duh' attitude or as if it's something I don't need to know. I struggle with making regular visits because I end up feeling angry and marginalized. 
1	I go to the doctor when I am not feeling well and when they give me recommendations it is usually something that helps.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to examine and talk to me.  My physician cares to know me as a person and takes a lot of time to ask me questions and gives me time to ask questions to make sure I understand everything.  
-1	Once you reach 60 and all the doctors are 30, you lose a lot of trust.  Then many doctors are treating statistically, instead of treating personally.  I take what I can get.  It could be a lot better.
-1	My primary physician has been a physician in my family for a long time. I completely trust that the reason he has been was because my family trusts him. 
-1	I have one medical condition that is rare and doctors have no effective treatment. They generally pretend to have some awareness of the condition and offer me treatment I know if not effective.  Once in a while I will get a doctor who is honest and their lack of expertise with my disease.
-1	I generally trust most doctors, while I don't have a primary care physician if I ever need professional medical help or advice I usually just go to the urgent care center and they have always been able to help me with my problems. So my trust level for them is average I would say, I don't necessarily believe everything a doctor says, but I also don't think everything is a lie they are telling me either. 
1	I have been going to him for years. He listens to what I say and tries to help me. If I am having a problem he will send me for test to see if anything is wrong. he sent me to have an echo cardiogram when someone said I had a heart mur mur. 
-1	I don't trust the American healthcare system in general, not necessarily the doctor. Nowadays, patients are just numbers to doctors. The medical care system is deeply flawed and needs reform. People aren't being treated properly for their illnesses because of astronomically high medical costs. Everything is about profit, so that's why I don't trust any doctors.
1	My primary care doctor goes over all of my options and I have asked about options that she has not presented and she will explain why she thinks that option would not fit my lifestyle.  She also genuinely listens to my concerns and answers my questions.  
1	He is courteous and attentive. He is very informative and talks about every option available to me in regards to my health. I always feel as if he is treating me like I am his only patient, as he devotes all his time and attention to me in that moment.
1	I have been going to him for a long time.  He listens to me and knows me and my history.  He values my input, as he says no one knows my body better than me.  When I had some financial problems, he understood and started with the most conservative course of action, while still giving me good care.
-1	I have been misdiagnosed with mental illnesses twice. He is quick to prescribe medication and get me out of the office and on my way. One of the medications I took had negative side effects and he was unconcerned. It seemed he just recommended it for the commission cash. That medication has since been recalled. Both the doctor and his medical assistant rush through questions during check-ups. I feel like I'm inconveniencing everyone by being there.
-1	I am a little wary of doctors and their personal interests, and how this may conflict with my interests, but I generally feel confident in my personal doctor. He has always been straightforward with me. 
-1	I trust my doctor to give me the best advice that they are aware of. I do not think of doctors as gods or in fallible, because of which I do not trust them without question. I also do my own research and seek second opinions when I feel I should. I do know that my doctors want to give the best care they can provide, that just might not be the actual best care availible
-1	I feel like most Dr's are good and want to serve their patients in the best manner possible. However, there are some that are self serving and will recommend care for what is convienent or will generate the most monetary reward.
1	I facebook stalked my current doctor. I was in search of a black female doctor who was not overly religious to be my primary physician. I truly trust her and know that she has my best interests in mind because she is like me. I don't get the same feeling of controlled condescension that other doctors have and none of the fanaticism some black women are wont to have. It 's just pleasant, and I feel like big pharma cant buy her either. 
1	The took an oath that I respect.  They would have no reason to not have my best interests in mind.  I do have an obligation to myself to double check their recommendations.
-1	I feel like my doctor takes the time to talk to me and truly understand what I need. If he didnt, I would switch doctors
-1	I have had some recent negative experiences with my doctor perscribing certain medications that have extreme negative side effects and my assumption as to why this medication was prescribed to me was because of the comission the doctor receives from the pharmaceutical company.
1	I trust my doctor because I know of their certifications and background. I have known them for a long time as well with no issues. Every time they helped me their advice has worked well.
-1	I just think that sometimes doctors do what is easier and convenient and time-effective rather than giving me the time and attention I may need.
1	I trust my doctor, because she is very thourough, and very careful. She is ver concervative in prescribing any and all medications. Sometimes I wish she wasn't so concervative, but I'm grateful she is. Most Drs. just throw medication at you, she does not. She looks for other alternatives first, if that doesn't work, they she'll try meds, but very concervatively.
-1	I know my doctor knows more about me than I know about myself health wise. Some things I really dont feel comfortable speaking about with anyone. This is usually the case with the doctor, as I do trust what he/she will tell me but comfort isnt always there. Sometimes I get angry with my doctor as well when I hear things I dont want to hear. Especially when telling me to change certain habits I have had for years. I do also use the internet to self diagnose myself and certain sicknesses I get. Sometimes its really just a tossup on if I want to ask or not about something. 
1	My doctor is honest and takes what I say into consideration instead of having God complex like a lot of doctors seem too.
1	I trust him the most because since I started going to his office my life has changed for the better. I feel great about myself and I think that is all thanks to him.
1	I've been seeing my primary care physicians for over 5 years now.  He has never failed me in letting me know what my problems are.  I completely trust him when it comes to my health.
-1	I mostly trust my primary care physician. However, there have been a few times where I go to this person over something and the doctor gave me bad/unhelpful advice.
-1	The nurse practitioners have started to slowly replace primary physicians. I have had negative experiences being touched inappropriately by a physicians. I distrust their motives.
-1	I have issues sometimes with the doctor's staff doing things to make my treatment more difficult. They sometimes do things against my doctor's orders.
-1	He has made mistakes and has misdiagnosed both my wife and I. He can be very arrogant and moody too. At times, he can be downright dismissive. He got fired from MedExpress. At other times he is helpful and more thorough thinking outside of the box to find the source of an ailment.
1	Doctors train for a huge part of their life. They are incredibly knowledgeable and determined to provide the best care for their patients. I have no reason not to trust my doctor.
1	I have known my primary care physician for awhile and he is a family friend. I believe that he does everything he can to make sure I am getting the best treatment possible.  Not only for me, but for my whole family since he is all of their doctors.  He seems to take his time and is always available for questions.
1	I've thankfully had good experiences with doctors. I don't need to see doctors often, but when I do I have received care that I had been satisfied with. I feel that the doctors I have seen care about me, they care about making sure I understand my issues and they explain to me the importance of my options and the results of any decisions I make. I have not felt at all that doctors don't care for me or that I am wasting their time.
1	I have never felt any reason to not trust my doctor. I feel as if they try and do their best to figure out what my issues are. Until then, I will trust them.
-1	I've started to distrust her as of late. She seems more interested in just refilling my prescriptions and getting me out the door than actually helping me solve my problems. 
1	"My new doctor is quite friendly in every interaction I've had with them be it in person, over the phone, or through online messaging. He makes eye contact and generally has a smile on his face. You can just ""feel"" that he genuinely cares about his job and helping his patients. He actively listens to everything I have to say, and I get the impression he hears my hesitation or what I don't say just as much as my words. I don't just feel like a patient with him, but a member of a team. We work together to come up with the best plan of action in treating my health needs."
1	I completely trust my primary care physician. She is a kind, considerate and thorough doctor who shows genuine concern for her patients.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he has helped me find treatment for things when I have gone to me and given me advise on how to treat things in a helpful way.
1	I trust my doctor because I am able to discuss about my health and receive appropriate care.  My doctor appointments have been good and I am able to understand and learn about my health during my check-ups.  I am able to ask questions regarding my physical and mental health and receive a professional answer from my doctor.  I trust my doctor and the services being offered at clinics, health centers, and hospitals.  During my visits to clinics, health centers, and hospitals, I was cared for, treated, and given appropriate care from staff.  I love the work that nurses and doctors do and will continue to check-up on my health.  
1	my primary doctor has been working with me for a few years and he is one of the best doctors i've ever had.  he is soft spoken, tells the truth but in a polite way, is an excellent listener, and has a pleasant attitude.  i have no reason not to distrust him; he hasn't lead me in the wrong direction yet.
-1	I feel that I have complained about the same symptoms for several years and only recently has the dr started to listen to my valid complaints. I understand that people have a magnitude of problems, but getting answers is very important
-1	I do not trust all doctor's . My perception is based on a negative response I had with a doctor some years ago. . I did not like her results and when I went with another opinion with another doctor it turned out that  I did the right thing by doing so, Because my primary doctor was way off on her prognosis.
1	I have a personal connection with my doctor. It is just something that occurs, chemistry, that I feel about some people. Once that connection is made it is just easy to trust what he is telling me. I can think of no reason why he would tell me things that weren't true and would not be in my interest.
-1	My doctor has only ever been helpful and kind when I've visited her. So far, her recommendations have been positive and yielded good results.
-1	I trust my doctor because they have more knowledge in that field of study and in the pains i may be having but i don't trust them to make the best recommendation for me when deciding between home remedy and hooking me on meds for profit; and benefiting from my insurance company. 
-1	In the past when I have had medical issues, my current primary care physician has brushed me off and not listened to my concerns. Through my own research and self advocacy, I was able to get the resources I needed, but definitely not with much assistance from my own physician. 
1	I trust my primary care physicians to do what they believe is best and affordable for me given the knowledge they have. That said, one can not be an expert in every specialty and sub-specialty so I do expect to be referred to a specialist if necessary.
1	I trust my Primary care doctor because he respects me and the knowledge I have about my health and body. I have some different health issues and he lets me somewhat control my treatment. He listens well to what I tell him about my body and asks thoughtful questions. He helps me plan my treatment, and defers to my preferences. He's not a pushover, but he is aware that I'm the one living in my body, so i know my body best of anyone. And i really appreciate that!
1	I have certain things in common with my primary care physician. He routinely vacations in an area I am familiar with. My doctor speaks English, and there are no cultural barriers between us. He has a good sense of humor and is, generally speaking, a very nice man. I like him as a person, and I trust his judgment. 
1	I have brain tumors. That diagnosis came totally out of the blue and I was devastated. I ended up with the best doctor, and he saved my life. And he also made me understand that things would be okay. He moved away to teach not long ago, and I've saved his last voicemail to me just because hearing him always makes me feel better about life.
-1	i often have to seek a second opinion because i don't think my doctor really understands my problem. she is good for easy things, like a flu shot or antibiotics prescription, but i would not trust her to correctly diagnose and treat a more complicated issue.  
-1	My doctor himself is trustworthy, however, as he works for a for-profit hospital I know sometimes his decisions are based on money and he has to follow certain rules based on how his bosses see to make money. In order to have complete trust in him he would need to work for a non-profit
-1	the doctor profession is a divine profession, I have great respect towards them, they know our body situation better so I trust the doctors verymuch
-1	I just can't trust doctors any more.  I think they are like mechanics and just trying to upsell me on every little thing that they do.  Every stupid appointment is two hundred bucks.  just stupid
1	I trust my PCP because I have been going to see her for a long time and I know she values me as an individual.
1	My doctor is very personable, friendly, and honest.   She does thorough tests yearly, gives me all the details and takes a much time as needed.
-1	My primary care physician has led me astray before, and a substitute doctor almost killed me. I had issues with my gall bladder and my doctor did not catch the signs of that happening, even though I was making appointments for a knee issue. Also, my knee issue was misdiagnosed as well. She did do a good job telling me all the treatments available for my knee issue, and she did diagnose the arthritis in my foot accurately.
1	I think my dr takes the time to listen to me and give me good feed back when needed.  He is also good at referring me to the correct ppl.
-1	Overall I feel that doctors are honest and trustworthy. For the most part I believe that doctors want to help their patients and will do what is best.
1	I believe my primary care physician is trustworthy.  He came up as a PA from the previous doctor that was there at the practice and the retired doctor was very much a people person.  The current doctor has learned a lot from him but is now more of people person as well.  I trust him because he will follow up with questions and answers to treatment options.
1	I think my doctor really cares about his patients, as all should. I've never once even gotten a slight implication that my doctor wasn't doing what was best for me.
-1	I have been with my doctor for many years, he has done a great job taking care of me. I have no reason to mistrust him or suspect some hidden motives.
-1	I trust my primary care physician for a few reasons. For one he is an excellent listener. I often over think or over worry and he puts up with it. He offers a variety of medical options when issues arise and he is always knowledgeable on these options. This makes me trust the he is making informed choices for my health.
1	I trust my doctor because he genuinely shows concern for my health. He explains all of my options along with short and long term effects. He is attentive to my concerns and offer effective plans  and he is there when i need him
-1	I trust most doctors I go to I normally go off of their attitudes, I dont like a doctor that doesnt show compassion or caring, thats how I rate a doctor.
-1	I trust my doctor.He has always come through for me.He has never steeredme wrong. He has always helped me with my health and known the right things to do.
-1	I trust and do not trust my doctor. I believe that they will do their best to help me. Although, I also think that they might add in unneeded tests just so that they can get more money.
1	They have been through extensive training in the subject area and certainly at the very least know more than I do, and have no reason to want to deceive me
-1	I have had the same issues for years the the Doctors never can find anything wrong.  It is extremely frustrating!
-1	I get a general vibe off my instincts on how I feel I should feel about it. There are some doctors that I trust and some I do not on that alone. 
-1	I think that the doctor has my best health and happiness in mind when making decisions. I ultimately think that the doctor makes a lot of money, but that this also motivates him to give me the best available care.
1	I trust my doctor. I trust my doctor because he has a degree and went through a lot of tests to ensure he knows what he is doing and is good at it. He see's a bunch of other patients who also think highly of him which is what in return I trust and believe the same about him. He has a lot of education and does a lot of good things in his profession.
-1	Doctors in general: They are narcissistic, arrogant snakes who care more about their country club membership payments than patients. I repeatedly have received misdiagnoses and inadequate when it comes to doctors such that I now view them as a means to an end--the end being the laboratory test results and that's about it. Dr. Google has served me far better than any doctor ever has.
1	When i go to the doctor they listen to everything I have to say.  They answer all my questions.  They will also ask any follow up questions that they need answers too.  They don't rush through the appointment.  they take all the time that is needed by me and by them to come up with a solution to whatever the problem is.
-1	i trust my doctor because he treats well and gives all the information i need. whether its good or bad. there is an app where all the lab reports are uploaded directly and he has asked me to log in to it so that i dont feel anything is hidden from me
-1	He/She has a full record of all my medical history at there fingertips.  They can order new tests and/or labs easily which can often be done in the same facility.  I have had one doctor before moving for over ten years which enabled him to get to know me a bit personally which I think helped the overall care.  This facilitated discussion on lifestyle and care out side the clinic. Often, they new colleagues in the same medical plan that would be a good fit for me in other areas of care such as back doctors or physical therapy.
-1	Well, because unfortunately doctoring is a profession, and legal practice if you will. Therefore, there is a certain amount of accountability and responsibility that they must exercise, therefore I may come second to that.
-1	I am neutral in trusting my primary care physician due to having a negative experience during my childhood where I was misdiagnosed multiple times and given wrong advice/information regarding my health. It got to the point where it was almost too late for me to survive because my parents were being told that their child only had a cold/fever. Outside of that experience, I normally do not put that much trust in a person regardless of it being their profession because some people only have their own interests in mind.
1	My doctor has always been very well educated on any problems that i've had. He is very intuitive and understanding and will always give me an honest answer regardless of the situation. His dedication to his patients has been simply amazing.
1	For me, it is because I was his office nurse for 28 years, so I know him very well.  He is a good doctor.  I did not always agree with everything he said, but as a patient or as an employee, we could still work it out.
-1	I always feel that I am rushed when I go to the dr. The usually ask a couple of questions and make there decisions that way instead of examining or running test.
1	"I am a ""Type 2 Diabetic"". I know that my doctor must get frustrated when my A1C count is high. He does not give up on me for not trying my best to control it. He still gives me advice on how to eat, exercise, and not give up. "
-1	I go to a medical professional for their knowledge and expertise. If I don't feel comfortable with the information or advice, I feel confident in my own ability to seek a second opinion or read up on treatment options.
-1	As to doctors in general, I don't trust them completely because they will often do what is best for them rather than what is best for the patient. For instance, they may not prescribe a patient with chronic pain the right medication because they don't want to prescribe certain drugs.
1	I feel comfortable with her.  I believe she has the same philosophy as me as to healing holistically vs. medically. 
1	I trust my primary care physician implicitly.  If I did not trust her, I would find another doctor.  My doctor is caring and always takes the time to discuss all of my questions about my health.  She is not an alarmist.  She always remains calm and is not upsetting regardless of the health issues that are needed to be dealt with.   
-1	I think that the doctors I have used are traditional thinkers and that they refuse to think about alternatives other than traditional treatments. I do not think they take into account other options, especially holistic treatments.
-1	I haven't gone to see my doctor for a while because I haven't had any new, pressing issues, but I do believe that, in general, doctors have an expert opinion that cannot be gained from internet sources such as WebMD. However, with the fairly broken medical system we have in America, I also understand that many doctors may have profit motives outside of simply providing the best care possible, and so I question choices and opinions when possible. 
-1	the doctor seem to rushed to be totally trusted. He sometimes seems to have made a decision very early in the process and ignores evidence as I present it. he is also under pressure from insurers to provide the low cost options. there I have been times when I have mentioned more modern thinking or treatments and he was unreceptive.
1	My doctor is fairly new to me.  I have only seen her a couple of times.  So far, I feel that she is trustworthy and has explained why the need for certain tests and paths of treatment.  She is educated, warm and very friendly
1	I trust my neurologist because she is very knowledgeable and informed regarding all of my medical conditions. I have complete trust in her
-1	"I've been through 3 primaries in the past 4 months, trying to get diagnosed and treated for hypothyroidism. None has been a great experience; the first one was very hard to reach, the second ignored my question about additional tests (I left a message with the receptionist and never got a return call), and the third, while explaining one part about how insurance works that the other two should have done (they all knew I'd been out of the ""system"" for more than 20 years), also ignored a question I left with a receptionist. I'm not sure whether I will stay with her. At this point I feel like there is no such thing as a good PCP."
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for years. I have gone to him for my ongoing health issues. I trust his treatment options and decisions. If I don't agree with something or a medication prescribed, he is open to listening to what I have to say. He does not rush me through an appointment like some of my previous doctors. For this reason, I have complete trust in my primary care physician.
-1	I have had good and bad doctors before. The good ones really seem to care and take the time to listen. They are able to help me thoroughly. Very few doctors have been bad. They seem to not listen and want to prescribe something that I don't agree with.
1	"She has always been correct with her diagnosis.  Most people would rate her low, due to the fact that she takes a lot of time with each patient, so her wait times are in the hours, at times.  However, she is spending quality time, with each patient.  Making sure she doesn't just, ""put a Band-Aid"" as a solution but she tries to find out what is causing the issue.  For example, my husband went in with a bloody nose, she didn't just give him medicine, she spent time with him and did tests to figure out why his nose kept bleeding."
-1	I do trust my physician, but only when we engage in a discussion and come up with a mutual plan for my treatment. If I do not advocate for myself, I feel like he may not put forth as much effort in my treatment
-1	My current Primary Care Physician is not even a physician.  She is only a nurse practitioner.  Every time Iâve gone to see her she has literally said âI just donât know what to tell you.â  âIâm not really sure what is going onâ.  After she did some research online, she came to the same conclusion that I already had by searching online.
-1	I do trust my doctor because he/she knows best.  Or shall I say doctors are more knowledgeable than me about medical terms.  If I won't trust the doctor how will I be treated.  I always believe that prevention is better that cure.  Only doctors knows it.
-1	I distrust most doctors because I believe they are mostly concerned about money.  Most of them don't care how your health really is.
1	I have been seeing my pcp for the last 20 years.  he is kind, thoughtful, and smart.  He sees his patients as people, and has a full understanding of their needs.  He is an amazing doctor who has actual conversations with his patients.
-1	They take the time to listen to me and explain what they are doing and thinking. Sometimes they are rushed, but overall, I think they are doing well.  
1	She spends lots of time answering my questions and discussing all facets of every situation.  She answers questions thoroughly and never seems like she's in a rush.  
-1	My primary care physician has seen me a few times and has always thoroughly explained information about my health with me.  These discussions are backed up by data, and the correlations between what I am being told by my physician and the data I am being shown align.
-1	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN MY DOCTOR FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND HE KNOWS MY CHART. 
1	I completely trust my doctor and his judgment. Thus far, he has always been professional, yet caring and compassionate. He fully explains his decisions and why they are the best for me. All of the risks and benefits or each option are given to me, as well as what he thinks is best and why. My doctor will also explain other options and why he would or would not choose them. 
-1	I often feel that doctors have their own agenda when it comes to diagnosing patients. After all the medical field is for profit. To that effect, I am cautious about completely trusting doctors. 
1	My doctor has over thirty years of experience practicing medicine. This gives me a lot of confidence in his ability to care for me. He is very caring and through when treating any medical condition that I may have. I trust him greatly.
1	I trust most doctors because they are highly educated and have much more knowledge and experience than I do on the subject.  I do not trust some of those I go to because I am in the military and some are just HMs who have not necessarily been to college let alone medical school and could be lacking in the right information.
1	I trust her because she is a very honest person. I have her cell number and she is always abvailable.
-1	I have had way too many bad doctors in the past. I literally had a doctor look at my mom when I was 5 and tell her it wasn't if I got cancer due to my family history, it was when (while I was sitting there). After that, I started having anxiety about going to doctors and my health. I was severely overweight and another doctor told me to run and eat less. I wasn't physically capable of running. My knees were damaged. I have never been able to trust a doctor to look out for my health. 
-1	I trust my doctor with my medical health care needs. I don't have any reason not to trust her with my questions and concerns about my medical health care. 
1	My doctor has been with me through all of my children, he has helped deliver them and he knows what i am interested in and what I am not interested in. He finds ways to bring other options on the table when I do not agree with what he or another doctor has said.
-1	I feel like we almost have no choice but to have a general trust in our doctors, right? Otherwise, what else is there? I am not naive enough to believe that there aren't plenty with special interests and motivations beyond doing their jobs well and with care, but a certain trust has to exist.
-1	In general I trust my doctor, that being said I know that s/he has a heavy case load and i may not get all the attention i need. Also I know that insurance, HMO's and pharma influences decision making/medical advice i receive
-1	well, you baited a lot of negative opinions about primary care. Also, I have issue with your question which assumes that primary care is bad. It's not. People like it. It can make you a comfortable living, and can be extremely rewarding just like any other specialty.
-1	I don't like spending money to see a doctor when I am not sick. I avoid hospitals at all costs because of the associated costs. I won't see a doctor unless I'm really sick/in immense pain.
-1	I have not been with her long, but certain things have fallen through the cracks, like orders for follow-up tests. She's also not show much curiosity in helping me identify problems.
1	I trust my doctor because she has never been wrong in diagnosing me. She has a caring and concerned bedside manner.
-1	My doctor and I disagree about pain management.  I would rather live with some pain and not be on pharmaceuticals, and he thinks it makes more sense to take pharmaceuticals to reduce (but not eliminate pain) despite negative side effects.  I think many doctors don't understand what it really means to manage a chronic pain problem.  Taking pills everyday is not everyone's first choice.
-1	I do trust my primary care physician basically because she has never given me a reason not to trust her.  I think she is kind and caring, and she has never misled me in the past.  She has been helpful any time I have gone to see her. 
-1	I do trust my primary care physician but I also don't feel like I get very personalized service. I feel as though I get a generalized service saying that I have basically the same issue as other people. 
1	I like to give physicians the benefit of the doubt.  I have never been steered wrong yet.  I bet there are a few crooked ones out there but I have not encountered them.  I like to think people are more good than bad.
1	My doctor has always been very upfront and honest with me about my physical condition and what treatments I need to take even if they might not be what I want.  He always asks about my well being as about my family and will even recommend me to seek other consolation if it is beyond his expertise. I consider him a friend as well as a doctor.
1	I feel that my doctor is typically very attentive and does a thorough job. However, there are times where it feels like they might be rushing a bit. If I ever had something serious going on, I would definitely seek a second opinion so I do not blindly trust my doctor. 
-1	Alot of doctors care about making more money not about peoples actual needs. As in they make money off of giving prescriptions. You see so many people taking medicine. People dieing faster off taking medications prescribed by the doctor.
-1	i trust my primary care physician because i have been going to him for the longest time and i have not had any reason to believe otherwise
-1	I have had a past where there have been some missed diagnosis. Because of this I do not always trust they they are taking the time to get the job done well and make sure they are doing the right thing when it comes to my health. 
-1	I do not trust doctors or really any kind of medical professional.  In fact, most of the time they don't even seem that professional at their jobs.  From my personal experience, it seems like doctors are only concerned with getting each patient in and out as quickly as possibly so that they can see more patients which of course lead to the doctors making more money.
-1	I just got a new Doctor and he is very good and explains everything to me very well which makes me feel like he is concerned and wants to make sure I understand.
1	I trust her because she is a strong female. Currently she serves in the Army National Guard and just got home from overseas. She is as tough as they come and listens well. I am a little intimidated to tell her things in relation to myself at times because she is so strong. Overall, she knows my home situation and understands being a full time caretaker is a hard job. She makes referrals when necessary and only lets me try meds that she knows will not make me too tired to care for my family member. I don't feel like a number when I see her. Nice office staff helps too!
1	I have been seeing my primary physician for over 20 years. He takes care of my physical health as well as mental health. He is always honest about treatment options and I feel he cares deeply about being thorough and careful.
1	I trust my doctor because that is what she went to school for. She has been trained in a way that people that are not doctor arent. 
1	I trust my primary physician because he also took care of my mother while she battled a terminal illness. We became close with him during that time and he did a lot for my mom. His care went above and beyond and that has made me trust him very much.
1	My doctor has always proved to be a trustworthy person.  He's been very helpful to me.  The one time something was very wrong with me, he attended to my needs in a thoughtful and respectful way.
1	I like my doctor and I can relate to him. He's a very funny guy, uses humor to relax his patients and to communicate.  It works!  He gets to the heart of the matter quickly.
1	I feel that my doctor does not have any reason to lie about something. I also know a few things myself and can tell by my doctor's body language. I am able to research the doctor's advice myself and compare it.
1	I generally trust my doctor since he doesn't speak condescendingly or brush aside questions/concerns. He answers them patiently and thoroughly. I've been researching and trying different medications and each time I suggest one, he makes sure I know the side effects, the neurotransmitters involved, and its off-label uses before filling the prescription.
1	I trust that my doctors are following the oath they made to do no harm. Additionally, I believe in science and believe that the doctors who have years more training than I do are far more capable than I am in this regard. However, I do think that it's important to tell them when you are experiencing side effects etc. so you can get a treatment that works for you. 
-1	I could only say that I can't agree totally on number one because I have personally seen that my doctor's waiting room was empty without patients being seen at the time and have still been made to wait excessive amounts of time for my own appointments on numerous occasions.
-1	Because as much as they are trained to remove personal opinions it is near impossible for slight bias' not to be within a doctors recommendation. Also what they are more familiar with they will feel more comfortable recommending. For example a surgeon will always be more comfortable with a surgical approach, while an internist with a medicinal approach. All advice in life should always be taken with a grain of salt. 
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because they know there stuff. They went to school for a long time to know all the stuff. If they mess up they are gonna hear it from me.
1	I feel like she takes times with me and really tries to understand what is going on with me. She asks me a lot of questions. She never rushes me. She runs a lot of tests if necessary. If she can't find answers she refers me to someone else. 
1	In the past, I have not trusted my physicians. I felt they did not take the time to follow through with care.  My current doctor is thorough and seems to care to exhaust all possible ways to figure out to make me feel better and also seems to notice how a patient feels at the time of the visit
1	He's a trained professional and has always been open and honest with me and always lays out the options for treatment when I have any issues.  He's polite courteous and very intelligent.  
-1	I feel like I am being rushed through appointments and that she is only half listening to what is going on with me.
-1	I do not have a primary physician, but I did have a cardiologist in which I seen somewhat often. For the most part I trusted him with the tests he authorized for me to do to find out what my condition was before coming to a conclusion because he went to rule everything else out before I received my diagnosis. I generally trust him, however I know that doctors do not work for the welfare of the people, but the welfare of deepening their pockets. The old doctor vow was to help people and to recommend dietary changes to promote health and well-being. Now it's about their contracts with Big Pharma and prescribing poisonous and toxic medications to create a lifelong patient and to create more money for themselves. In general, I believe my doctor's intention were in the right place, but I'm fully aware of the scam and can see through it all, so I generally do not trust them.    
-1	I feel like doctors always rush through appointments. I feel like a lot of times they act like I'm making it up.
1	MY PULMONARY DOCTOR IS THE ONE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF MY LUNG FIBROSIS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER TO KEEP MY GOING SINCE 2008. I HAVE GONE TO MAYO CLINIC WITH HIS SUGGESTION TO GET SECOND OPINIONS TWICE AND MAYO AND MY PULMONARY DOCTOR COME TOGETHER WITH A PLAN TO EFFECTIVELY KEEP ME GOING.
-1	I often feel like They do not full understand that some treatment options although a little safer might cause more of a daily issue for the patient. My physician also shames me on things that I can not control rather than offer help
-1	I trust that for the most part my doctor is open and honest about everything, but on the other hand it never hurts to get a second opinion about things involving my health. I trust that my doctor has no reason to lie to me or not give me all the information I need but sometimes things can be overlooked. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he fully listens to me. I never have a problem with my doctor listening to my worries or health concerns.
-1	My primary care doctor is part of a large company. That company has huge turnaround, a huge patient base and relies heavily on billing. My primary care doctor probably wouldn't recognize me on the street.
1	 My primary care doctor had shown diligence in researching ways to help me personally. She knows my conditions and is careful to address all of my concerns. I trust her because she's earned that trust over time. 
1	My primary care physician has become a friend and is concerned about my health beyond medical appointments.  She acknowledges when she doesn't know a detail, researches and follows up with an answer.  She's active in her professional community, speaking and writing.  
-1	I distrust my primary care physician because one time when me and my sister both went for a check-up, he prescribed both of us potassium pills. I was living on campus for college at the time and had a completely different diet than my sister back at home. It was strange that all of a sudden, we both had low potassium. I ended up not taking mine because mine were huge pills that were a capsule, and I have a hard time swallowing pills. I just ate a couple bananas for a few days. He never prescribed them to us again.
1	I put complete trust in my doctor because he has been my doctor for many many years. He knows all about my health and medical needs. He is straight forward with me. He has never lied to me to benefit himself.
-1	I think that your doctor should be one of the most important people in your life. If you do not trust your doctor or if you do not have that bond with your doctor, then I think that you need to find one with which you can form that bond with. I think trust is the number one thing between doctor and patient. 
1	I trust my doctor because they always take the time that they need in order to help me, even if they are backed up.   They never rush me.  They make sure that all of my questions are answered.
-1	I trust him because he is a good doctor that has always been able to treat what I am to see him for.  He is been in the same place for many years and has many patients so he must know what he is doing to stay in the same place for so long retaining so many patients.
1	I trust my doctor because she is thorough, kind and takes ample time to explain everything that I need to know. 
-1	I feel that my doctor, who is nearing the end of her career (upper 60's) and thinking about retirement in the next year or two is no longer placing my needs first.  I think she's having some sort of compassion fatigue and it doing a lot of things that are easier for her rather than giving me the proper care I am paying for and deserve.  I've gone to this doctor for over 20 years and it's difficult to see this happen however, I think the end of this doctor patient relationship is near either due to her impending retirement or me finding a replacement prior.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I know they put in the time to learn the skill. I also trust them because they keep up on everything.
-1	I have collaborated professionally with doctors and know that they often do not know how to interpret the results of a drug or the results of a scientific paper. So I am a little hesitant to trust their knowledge as the perfect gospel. I trust doctors that are upfront, direct, and friendly.
-1	I have had many bad doctors. I use a mouth guard during the day for stress, and doctors have treated me like a mental patient. Many doctors have refused to treat my infections because they have treated me before. My immune system is bad. I have had doctors call the police on me and lie, saying I hear voices and want to die. I never told anyone that. A majority of them have been bad. 
-1	In general I do think that doctors act in the patient's interest and would at least put a good amount of stock in what they tell me.  But at the same time I have my reservations about total trust.  Especially the more serious the medical situation is, the more likely I would want other opinions.  But for routine things, I figure the doctor knows how to handle the situation.
-1	Doctors do what the hiarchy tells them what to do. In this day and age, our health condition is a push-pull battle between our insurance plans, and how much influence the drug companies have over the doctor's profit potentual for prescribing what is best in their best income, not what is best for the patient. For that reason, I really don't trust anyone unless I can verify their recommendations without a shadow of a doubt that they are not selling me out.
1	I love my doctor. Any concerns I've ever had, he has listened to me carefully and has given advice when he can as appropriate. He is genuinely concerned about my well being. He likes to laugh and makes jokes when I see him. He seems happy when I come in for my check ups. He has never steered me in the wrong direction. He looks me in the eyes when we are speaking. He can gauge if I'm having not a great day just by the responses I give him. He's a great doctor and I completely trust him!
1	I trust my primary care physician very much and the nurse practitioner, my therapist, and the people that I have seen for my health in general. They are all skilled and very knowledgeable, and seem like they truly care for me. If I have extra questions, which I pretty much always do, they always take extra time out to talk things over with me thoroughly. 
1	I try to have any issues I want to discuss written down and keep to a max of three things, if possible.  He always makes sure I am up to date with any shots I am suppose to have.  He tells me things for my own good health care.
1	I trust them as I have had them since I was about 7 years old and know them very very well. They are more like family at this point, for me. .I am grateful for this as they are a good person and very helpful to me. 
1	I moved from Ohio to Florida 4 years ago  and health care in Florida is far inferior. I have never been seen by the doctor where I go because I see the PA because the only reason I go is to get my meds managed.  I like and trust the PA but it will never be completely.  I am still feeling the sting about a situation that occurred a year ago that was extremely critical and the doctor overseeing the PA who is ultimately in charge totally let me down.   It was cold and impersonal and there was no commitment to me as a patient what so ever. Horrible and extremely stressful experience
-1	I do not always have trust in my doctor because they always try to prescribe me medications for every problem that I have. I think that if they took the time to listen to me and understand my symptoms then I would achieve more of my therapeutic goals rather than having to try new medications every few weeks. 
1	My doctor takes a lot of time and effort to explain my conditions to me. He gives guidance for modifying my diet in connection with my medication. He also gives directions to appropriate resource persons. He also provides scientific literature regarding my condition.
1	I've been going to the same GP for over 11 years now, so he knows all of my medical history and suggests what I should do to better improve my health. Usually he knows right away and can diagnose what is wrong with me when we talk and i get treated in a quick office visit.
-1	I trust them because I have to, they are the medical professionals and as long as I give them all the information they need they should be able to tell me what's wrong. I distrust because they are in business to make money as well. Medical world is big business and driven by insurance company's and their reimbursements 
1	I trust my doctor because we have built a solid relationship over the years and there is mutual respect involved. He will tell me the truth whether its easy to hear or not, and he will listen to hear what I need to do better. 
-1	For the most part doctors seem to want to help but they don't all have the time to spend with you to really figure out what is wrong. They usually go with the easiest course of action, which I understand is commonly the correct one. But, I cant tell you how many times people have had to go back multiple times just because the treatment they were given was for something they didn't have.
-1	I believe for the most part my doctor sees hundreds of patients and is on a time restraint.  I feel that the rush to get people in and out makes looking for the most convenient option the first response. That the doctor does not know me or the other patients well enough to have a relationship beyond our charts that he barely looks over as he is coming in the room and that the nurse has actually more details and stake in personal care.
-1	It's not that I think my primary care physician is particularly untrustworthy. I just think people in general can at times be lazy, malicious, or in some way disincentivezed to help you. And it's not always easy to tell when that's the case. So I take what my doctor tells me as being probably true but potentially not the whole story, as I do with most people. For instance, I happen to know that doctors are under a lot of pressure right now to not prescribe opioids, so if my doctor tells me the best route for me is lots of ibuprofen, I'm going to be skeptical. But what other thinks am I not aware of, that might be relevant to my health? It's just best to get second opinions and take things with a grain of salt. 
-1	I have visited a lot of Primary Care Physicians and finally have one I trust. He is extremely knowledgeable and great at answering any question no matter how small. She gives me multiple treatment and medication options and lets me decide what path I would like to take.
1	If I go to a mechanic, i assume he knows more about cars than me.  If i go to a physician I expect the same.  I am in no place to tell the doctor how I should be treated medically.
-1	I feel like they rush through my concerns and questions.  Explanations can be in excess or too little. I havenât found a Dr. I really like in awhile.
-1	Why I trust my my primary care physician is because they are trained to help me feel better from the illnesses that I have. Also the physician would not be in this field if they did not want to help those around them. 
-1	I believe that most doctors want what is best for their patients. But due to fast pace and so many patients they see I don't think that doctors can always fully give everyone the time needed. I also think that there is so much medical information that it can be difficult to get consensus among doctors and you are often give mistaken information. 
-1	I generally trust my current doctor, and I think she's a lot more trustworthy than the ones I've seen before, and she always takes extra time to explain things to me and walk me through my health plan. However, I've only seen her a few times over the past couple of years, and I don't completely trust her yet. I guess I just have an ingrained distrust of doctors when it comes to prescribing medications due to previous negative experiences with them disregarding the side effects I was having and pushing medications on me that were not essential (such as birth control pills and certain sleeping pills).
-1	I have no issues with my current primary care physician. However, in the past, I had a PCP that was not very attentive during my yearly physical examinations. This resulted in my performance anxiety condition to go undiagnosed throughout my childhood until finding a new PCP later in life. 
1	He is a family doctor. He been In the family for twenty years. He is always right with his diagnosis and treats my family according he feels like a family member .
-1	I don't feel like my doctor understands what I'm trying to communicate sometimes. He wants to do some test instead of actually listening to me, or he ships me off to another doctor who only knows part of the story. I would trust my doctor more if I thought he was actually hearing what I'm saying and if he would not be so dismissive of my insights into my own health.
-1	I usually go to a clinic, so I never know which doctor or NP I will see. I like some of them, they go over everything with me. Some of them it seems like I only see for a minute, and then they leave the room before I can ask any questions.
1	I generally trust them when there is no incentive to skew the truth. Even in that case they aren't lying they just aren't giving the best solution. 
-1	I have a great general physician, but I typically like to research my conditions and then review options with my doctor before making a decision. If I disagree, I seek a second opinion. 
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. He's never done anything to upset me. He listens to me and is very patient. I have had to switch my children's doctor one time though. I did not agree with her many times and she hardly seemed to check out my kids, I did not trust her at all. 
-1	My doctor seems pretty neutral. The last time I went in, I had a question regarding this rough itchy spot on my skin. He didn't look at it and asked me if I've tried any over the counter steroid creams on it.
-1	A doctor is only one person, and sometimes people make mistakes. It's also impossible for one person to have all the relevant information about an issue. My doctor is competent and I like her, but I always do my own research to verify what she's saying. I like to get multiple opinions, so even if my issues aren't serious enough to seek out a second opinion in person, I'll at least do my research.
-1	She sometimes will not listen to me and its my body. I once had to fix my ear infection because she would not help me. Now she listens to me.
-1	My physician doesn't make a habit out of asking for unnecessary tests or making me pay more than I should for a service or diagnosis. I trust that the doctor is looking out for my best interests.
1	Well, I've only gone to my new PCP once but she really took her time to get to know me and my history.
1	I have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I have been with my primary care physician for almost my entire life, so we have had plenty of time to develop a good rapport and a good relationship. I trust her with my concerns and with explaining things to me so I can understand them
-1	I trust him because he looks out for my well being, and if he prescribes something that I am not comfortable with after reading the side effects of reviews then he recommends or prescribes an alternative form of treatment
1	My doctor spends a good amount of time in the room with me, 15 to 20 minutes or more, talking with me about any issue that I am having. She listens to what I have to say and does what ever tests are needed with out hesitation. She also felt a lump in my breast that turned out to be breast cancer.
-1	My PCP has never steered me wrong. She doesn't take chances. She sends me for testing when she thinks there is something that does not look normal. She is very honest and doesn't sugar-coat anything for me. I appreciate her honesty very much.
1	I have had nothing but positive experiences with doctors. They are highly trained and knowledgeable in their subject, I have no reason to doubt them.
1	I trust my PCP because she has far more education than I do. She would never intentionally do anything that would cause me harm. I know that if something is wrong with me, she will figure out the best way to treat it.
-1	My doctor spends more time with me during check-ups than any doctor ever has. She continues to ask questions, give me tips and pieces of information I wouldn't normally expect, and will even bring up questions regarding other possible issues I have to ensure there is nothing being missed. She truly listens to everything I say and never seems like she's rushing to get to the next patient. I feel she really does care about my health.
-1	I have a rare illness that my Physician had never heard of, so his choices in my care have not always been the right choices. I do see a specialist that I trust a bit more, but overall I am very discouraged with most of my healthcare providers due to their lack of knowledge or willingness to educate themselves on my conditions. 
-1	I donât go to the doctor often. I see doctors as well educated people, and their decisions and diagnoses are more times correct than not. If I have a feeling theyâre wrong, I would let them know. As for prescribing medicine, as far as I know and what I have seen, doctors prefer prescribing the more expensive medicines so they themselves profit off of it. In that regard, although they arenât being dishonest, they arenât disclosing all options either. 
-1	"If the doctor is bad, it's likely that it would have been revealed by now to someone else. It's extremely unlikely that a doctor would be ""out to get me"" specifically. Furthermore, since I lack the necessary scientific knowledge to verify everything the doctor says, I have no real way to check what they say. Since it's unlikely that they're misleading me and attempting to verify them is impractical, there's little point in worrying about it. Of course, if someone does mislead me, I wouldn't hesitate to distrust them in particular."
-1	I've been going to my doctor for a few years, she has a good way of explaining things and listening to what I have to say. She answers questions thoroughly. I also checked her on the list of doctors who accept gifts from pharmaceutical companies and she doesn't accept those gifts.
-1	In general, the medical profession is run by corporations and pharmacy companies who are as interested in a profit as they are anything else.  Individual doctors and other medical personal may be more interested in a patient's care, but the institutions themselves are a different matter.  A government intervention is doing nothing to make it any better.
-1	I don't trust medical doctors very much. The reason is because I feel that there is constantly contradictory medical advice and I think that many of the practicing doctors were taught information that is now old and they are stuck in their ways. I would much rather have a young doctor than an old one because old doctors are mostly ignorant to advances in science and how to treat illness before it comes on.
-1	unfortunately I have to say that most physicians I have seen firsthand didnât give me the most trusting feeling, although I can't say I wasn't cared for but I feel a lack on the care system. As mentioned before, most prescriptions are given based on symptoms and 'guesses' and not on facts, or exams. I do give attention and value to what my primarily physician says but I never see situations as a one way street so I do my research. And sincerely get disappointed if I look for help and medical guidance and am told that nothing is wrong without any testing done. 
1	I trust my doctor because they tell me what I need to hear versus what I may want to hear. Hearing those true facts allow me to make sure I am aware of the decisions that I choose to make. I believe it is important to gain the trust in the doctor, so they know what your background story may be. Most times it is best if they share their own story to make myself or the patient feel more comfortable. this allows me to open up more to them and tell them whats writing frequently. 
1	I've little choice in the matter really. My trust would have to be in the institutions that educated the idividual(s).
-1	The doctors I have visited seem like they judge me and I feel as they know something is wrong with me but won't tell me and they always have the same pity look they give me. I don't trust any doctors because I know they just want to get rid of me and they think of me as another patient (another number) in the system.
-1	In general, I think physicians are well trained and probably know what they are talking about.  However, I rarely get a chance to see a physician for more than a few minutes once or twice a year.  There isn't really a chance to build a trusting relationship.  I think the way the health system is set up forces doctors to go for quantity instead of having the opportunity to build real relationships with their patients.  Trust takes time to be earned and I just haven't really had the time to build any with any doctor in years.
1	Generally the doctors I've had give the impression of compassion and empathy, and at the very least, they seem knowledgeable and confident.
1	I have been going to my doctor for a very long time now. When ever I have a pain or any other problem with my health I head over to his office. With my major back pain issues he has always been stright forward with me. Always telling me the truth straight to my face even when I might not like it. He has always been correct about the cause of the pains or illnesses. His procedures and getting better plans have had a one hundred percent rate of effectiveness and I have always gotten better when I follow his instructions. I trust him because he gets things done correctly.
1	I trust my primary physician because he is very thorough in what he does and has been my doctor for many years.  Any time I have needed him he has been there and properly diagnosed me.  He is not afraid to involve other doctors when he is unsure or would like a second opinion.  
1	My primary is part of a medical group that is responsive and communicative. I find throughout my health needs they explain all tests, procedures and issues. If I have questions I can call any time. Plus they have an excellent online presence for appointments, access to records, payments etc. 
-1	I do not fully trust my primary care physician because they have such a busy and hectic job.  How could they possibly always be able to perform well under their stressful work conditions?  They see patients for such a short time and it's hard to think they could always be right about what condition a person has, and what drug will make them better.
-1	I feel that my primary care physician is concerned with my best interest.  However, it is difficult to totally trust them knowing the lobbying they receive from pharma companies.  I often wonder if I really need the medicine they prescribe or if they are receiving a kickback for it.  On the other hand, my PCP spends a lot of time answering my questions and explaining treatment options.  I do not feel pushed to take medicine I am uncomfortable with.  All in all, I trust my doctor and am not considering switching. I just wish the healthcare system overall was more transparent!
-1	My doctor seems rushed just to get me out the door so they can move on to the next person. When I need things explained to me they bring in a nurse or someone else to speak with me. When I call with questions it sometimes takes days to get back to me.
1	My primary care physician seems very thorough. I think he pays attention and he knows his stuff - he seems to know what he's talking about.
-1	I think that my doctor is a good and genuinely knowledgeable person, but sometimes thinks he needs to dumb down explanations or ease my worries instead of giving me all the facts.
-1	"I have served in a medical sales capacity for more than 10 years and have seen doctors who recommend and even require certain patient services that will benefit them financially although they may not be the most medically necessary or advantageous service.  Medicine has become a ""business"" more than it used to be and managed care does not always allow the doctor to provide the best care, rather what is allowed."
-1	I have several friends in the medical profession and the horror stories they have told me, as well as the life or death situations some of my less healthy friends have had to suffer because of poor care at a hospital, has tainted my view of the profession. Medical Error. Overwork, Carelessness, Corporate Pressure, Ignorance. It's all a big problem. 
1	In all of my recent doctor visits, the doctors have suggested minor preventative things I could perform to better my health, that were completely unrelated to the original visit's intention. It wasn't necessary, but they care in general to see less patients.
1	I come from a small community and there have been several times that myself or a family member has been in for one thing or another and it would not be uncommon for our Dr. to call the home phone or cell on his time off to see how we were doing and if something was not right he would meet you at hospital or even your home, all on his own time.
-1	"Along with the strong development trend of the market economy, many social values have been changed: social relations, morals and morality are also reversed. For the medical industry, besides a number of achievements are very proud, a small part of the doctor insensitive to the pain of the patient, against the moral, contrary to conscience, doctrine, do ""stained ""The image of the noble profession of medicine has traditioned for many generations. So what is morality? What is yoga? What is the content of ethics? What are the causes of medical ethics? How to improve ethical issues in the health sector? These are urgent issues of the society today."
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very smart, well qualified, and she knows what shes doing. The office that I go to is also very well known, and its been around for years so I trust them. They are all very professional, clean, and enthusiastic in their practice their.
-1	I find that they are all about the bottom line. They often either ignore your complaints, don't take into consideration the HUMAN with feelings behind the symptoms, or worse, they go on a great zebra hunt when a horse is staring them in the face, more to cover their asses against malpractice than for the patient's welfare. If you are not attractive and/or young, healthcare declines.  I can figure out what is wrong with me faster on google than I can by going to the doctor and BE RIGHT.
1	Physicians are in their career for a reason and a lot of trust is involved when they are helping patients out. There is a relationship that builds
-1	"Normally, I would say that I trust my primary care physician, however, there are times where they've ""dropped the ball"" on important physical issues/experiences that I've encountered, elongating the amount of time it takes to receive treatment."
1	She takes her time with me. She listens to what I say and even to my suggestions for treatment  If she does not know something she gets more info for me. She is totally honest with me.
-1	I trust doctors but only as far as I can throw them. There is still a line of distraction in them, and that they do not exist inside of you. You still need to be informed and ask questions 
1	I trust my primary care physician. I have been seeing this doctor for twenty-plus years. He always takes the time to explain things and ask questions to understand what is going on with me. I always get the proper treatment for whatever ails me.
1	I trust my primary care physician very much. He is thorough in my yearly check-ups. I have been seeing the same doctor for 17 years. He is very knowledgeable about my medical history so I am confident in asking questions if I have any. 
1	I trust the doctor I have now because he listens to me and is willing to do a large number of tests if necessary to find out what is going on. He doesn't regard my symptoms as something unimportant. If he can't figure out what's going on he refers me to a specialist in that area. In the past my doctors would act as though they didn't need to listen to me because they already knew what was happening. They wouldn't order tests, so it took me much longer to be properly diagnosed. 
-1	I trust her because she trusts me. I feel that I can talk to her honestly, and I expect her to be blunt in return. Most recently, she was worried about my cholesterol level but I was reluctant to go on new meds. She agreed that I could try to bring it down with lifestyle changes, so she gave me some diet tips instead of a prescription. With changes in diet and exercise, I brought it down 53 points. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because they are very professional, experienced, and knowledgeable. They have never done anything detrimental to my health.  
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a very competent and experienced medically trained physician who is familiar with various illnesses and treatment options who seems to care for his patients..
-1	I think doctors get rushed by office managers. I also think insurance reimbursements to doctors are diminishing so the doctors are having to see more people in the same amount of time and this results in subpar focus and attention. I also think doctors get into a 'groove' and tend to prescribe the same things and give the same diagnoses without giving extra thought to if there is more going on than it seems at first. 
1	I trust my physician because he is generally caring and I see him over do himself daily for his patients. He gives patients his work and personal phone number so he can be reached at anytime day or night. He's also really good about what tests he orders or doesnt order to find out the cause of whatever is going on. He also listens to each and every patient for as long as is needed. He doesn't stick to the every fifteen minute schedule he's set to.
-1	He seems to know what it right for me. I do not have any trouble understanding what advice he gives me.
1	I have been with my primary care doctor for more than 8 years. I have also had 2 major medical situations and he has guided me through out the processes. 
1	I trust my doctor mainly because he has very good listening skills and is attentive to my needs and concerns. He is most easy to talk to and never attempts to talk over my head. Even though he is a young physician, I feel most comfortable with him. I do not usually get stressed out when I go to my physician. I can't say that I really look forward to getting and sick and needing my physician's care, but at the same time, I do not dread having to schedule a visit with him.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because they have a degree in medicine, and has seen many others like me with similar issues in the past.
1	I trust my primary care physician is because I've been with him a very long time. He is very thorough and honest with me every time I go to see him.Therefore I trust him completely.
1	I guess when a primary care physician attempts to connect with me even though I know it is standard, it makes me feel like I can trust them. 
1	"I work for a world-renowned health system with some of the best doctors in the US. I always look to see where they attended school, I have access to their ""heath scores"", and if I have to I'll ask my boss, who is the CEO.  They were able to diagnose that I had an autoimmune disease that usually takes 12 years to diagnose."
1	I rarely go to the doctor because I am in excellent health. when I do have to go, I feel that the doctors that have been assigned to me always take good care of me and don't let me leave not knowing what is going on with my health or if there are any health concerns. this in turn gives me the optimistic and trustworthiness of my doctors that I can go into a health care facility and not have any regrets. I don't feel that the doctors at any time are looking more for convenience for them, than my actual health.
1	I trust my doctor because he tells me the whole truth about my health.  there's no sugar coating anything and he gives me all of the best available options for helping to continue to be in great shape.  All of the advice he's given me has worked, so I will continue to trust in his advice and recommendations.    
-1	It's rare I visit with a doctor that seems genuinely concerned or one that assumes his first diagnosis isn't correct. All seem to be THE expert. Some seem tired of the repetitiveness of their practice. And most seem to prescribe a specific, expensive drug, when there are other options available.
-1	Some time it feels they dont  believe you what you telling. Or they seems like they so busy  and have not much time for you and spending much time with computer not with the patient. 
1	The methods implemented by my doctor to help me have always worked in the past. I have asked my doctor questions about why they wanted to be a doctor and what kind of education they have. Therefore, I know my doctor is passionate about their profession and wanting to help people. My doctor communicates with me promptly when I have a question or concern about my health. My doctor also has a good bedside manner, is always respectful, and does not make inappropriate comments. I know my doctor will be up front with me when I ask them difficult questions.
-1	When it comes to doctors in general I will trust their ability to identify a problem. What I do not trust is the ability to prescribe a solution to a problem.  Most doctors solution to most problems is by prescribing a drug even when a problem can be resolved with simple diet and exercise. This is the main reason why I will not trust what the doctor prescribes  but will trust his diagnosis.
-1	Are usually trust my doctors about 80% you can truly trust them 100% because some doctors do make mistakes and thatâs why itâs always a good to always ask a lot of questions and if you have any doubts get a second
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician, they genuinely care about my well being. If I have an issue, regardless if it seems minor to me, my doctor always insists for me to make an appointment. My doctor possesses the proper credentials and has board certification.  
1	I trust my primary care physician primarily because he has always taken the time to listen to me when I have had health concerns and discussed treatment options and recommendations with me. He discovered that I had a heart condition when I was 40 that I had all my life, and he sent me to a cardiologist,who was impressed that the doctor say it on my EKG. He has been careful about prescribing drugs unnecessarily, but prescribes medicine as he feels necessary. He even takes time to answer health questions I have when I am with another family member for an appointment. 
1	I trust that my doctor is looking out for my best interest as I could give him a bad review otherwise.
1	Before I choose a physician or hospital that I would go to ER visit I always check the reviews and I always do my research and up to now I've had great confidence with all the positions are hospitals that I have chosen
-1	My primary care physician has many many other patients and very little time, is constrained from making definitive statements, and is affected by the pharmaceutical companies they receive benefits from, their insurance, my insurance, and their own social personal and religious biases.
1	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY PCP. HE IS YOUNG, TRUSTWORTHY, FRIENDLY, PROFESSIONAL AND HAS A GREAT BEDSIDE MANNER. I RECOMMEND HIM HIGHLY AND HAVE NEVER HAD A COMPLAINT. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HIM AND WILL NOT CHANGE PCP'S. 
1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for many many years and he is very honest and helpful. He doesn't do unnecessary procedures or tests.
-1	I trust her because she listens to me and genuinely wants to know how i a doing. She suggests things for me to try that fit with my lifestyle instead of pushing pills on me. I appreciate that she isn't rushing to go out the door and listens to what I have to say. She is thorough and has a lot of knowledge in the things i need answers about. Plus one of my illnesses she also has so I get that extra insight.
1	My Primary care doctor spends time with me and answers all my questions, tells me if I need to be concerned about something and doesn't waste my time if I don't. I have asked for him on the phone and he answers my calls and emails promptly if I have concerns.

1	She is very sincere and caring. She is very knowledgeable and sensible. I feel like she does this job because she genuine enjoys taking care of people and she is very good at it
-1	I trust my primary care doctor as he is a quite a bit honest person, and very direct on any health topics, and provides different options and explains everything very clearly and answers thoroughly any questions I might have, and even he listens to me and try to understand my feelings on some sensitive topics. He is also one of the highest rated doctor in my area as a trustworthy doctor. So so net net my experience with him is very good that is why I trust him.
-1	He's just a regular doctor, maybe he's trying to sell me something for all I know. That's what some doctors do a lot.
-1	I am generally trusting of doctors but I do like to do some research on my own as well -- forewarned is forearmed.
1	My family has used our primary care doctor for many years and he has always done a great job in treating us.  He has never given us any reason to feel like he doesn't have our best care as a priority and for that we have complete faith and trust in him.  He's never done us wrong.
-1	i don't trust anyone fully but that doesn't mean i automatically distrust them either..........................

-1	I trust my primary physician because she has never given me reason not to. She is attentive and always helps me feel better than when I arrived
-1	My relationship with my doctor has really changed over the 15 years I have been going to him.  When I started seeing him he was a family practitioner and I trusted him a lot more.  Now he wants to specialize in geriatric medicine and he doesn't really seem interested in my primary care needs.  I am in the process of finding a new doctor but I haven't found one yet.
-1	They are always looking out for my health and making sure everything is good and I don't have any problems at all
-1	Sometimes it seems like doctors are mechanics, trumping up small issues to make you spend countless money. 
1	I have been treating with my doctor for more than 10 years. Everything he tells me or recommends has helped my overall health.
1	My doctor is from The Republic of Moldova.  She went to medical school in Russia.  Now she is in America and has a Natureopath license.  She restored my hearing in my right ear using lasers and ozonated tea tree oil/olive oil.  Now she is helping me to clear my lymphathic system.

-1	I believe my doctor has my best interests in mind.

-1	I have a new doctor. So I have to see how I can work well with them. I need to communicate with her carefully to get the information and help that I am in need of.
-1	I find in hard to trust doctors because a lot of people become doctors for the wrong reason instead of becoming one to help people they become doctors because it's a high paying job.
1	Whenever I've gone to see him for an issue he is able to help me. He prescribes medicine that works for me and if I need to follow up with him he tells me so.  He's thorough and I feel confident that he cares.
-1	I'm very middle of the road on this because of my own personal experiences. Ive never been mislead by a doctor but I do know people who believe they have, including close family members. So as with anything involving humans I don't completely put my faith in it.

She even referred me to a surgeon who has been responsible for the death of a patient, so no I don't trust her one bit and I will never go back to her
1	I switched doctors a few years ago after 5 years of suffering from a mystery illness. She had it figured out in a few months and got me feeling good as new. Her treatment since has been great

-1	I don't really trust doctors because they work with insurance companies to benefit their pockets instead of their patients. This can cause serious malpractice and misdiagnosis.

I do believe there are a few that actually care though but they are scarce.

Nowadays all of the caring, bedside manner, and respect I have gotten comes from nurses.

I believe if we had universal insurance, Doctor's would be more understanding, if there wasn't a price tag attached to every person.  If every Doctor could look at every person, the same, and treat each person accordingly healthcare would be in a better light. I think the health care field needs to have guidelines securely in place pertaining to ethic's and morals.  I think it would make a great differences.

I also had a doula and the birth was still tense due to the overbearing OBs in the practice, who almost forced me to have a c-section as well. Thankfully my doula was there to fight for me to get the birth I wanted.

What seem like common sense solutions are ignored in favor of drugs an constant treatment. Several lifestyle diseases, like most cases of diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol can be treated with lifestyle changes. Dangerous drugs with tons of side effects is not the best way. But how often do you hear a doctor just suggest diet changes and more exercise? Rarely, since those solutions don't make money.

1	The primary care doctor that I have now is the doctor I went to for my second opinion. He seemed to care about what was wrong with me. Explained what he thought was wrong and proceeded to have me do tests. Which is more than the previous doctor I went to had me do.
-1	I don't totally trust anybody I trust myself most of all, I know doctors who honestly prescribe drugs because of promotions received from a drug rep.
-1	I do not trust my physician because they have yet to tell me whats going on and ways to help my situation 
1	I trust my doctor. He is thorough. Whatever I ask he lets me know what is going on. He gives me the advice I need
-1	I don't have a lot of trust in doctors in general, but when a emergency happens there's nothing I can do but seek professional care
1	She is dependable and caring, Her husband performed my surgery and she has maintained my health since then she has been very honest about my progress,even when its not necessarily what I wanted to hear
1	I trust my doctor to tell me the truth whether it's what I want to hear or not.  He hasn't told me anything that's not true so far.
-1	Alot of my symptoms have been resolve and some she is still working on. So im still having back pain and knees are hurting and getting stiff.
-1	They prescribe a pill for whatever ails you and they don't have time to search for the real cause of disease. Too many prescription drugs prescribed for 1-sentence diagnoses 
-1	I don't completely trust anyone. I consider my doctor's advice but if it doesn't sounds logical or address my issues, I ask for clarification. Sometimes I seek another opinion or research the problem. 
1	They always help me when I'm  in need of help with my medical needs. I been going to  them for a long time and I trust them
1	I have doctors that I trust to give me good services and provide ideals to help keep me healthy and to live a good and longer life every time I see them.
-1	Sometimes when I get a second opinion or third, my primary doctor is wrong. I want to get various opinions and facts before I make my own informed decision.
-1	Most of the time I feel rushed.I honestly feel as though all he wants to do is push pills as a solution for every problem.  He does a lots of tests but no real follow up to see how I feel after each visit to see if there is really any change in my condition. 
-1	I normally have a good relationship with my doctors. Although we have disagreed on some topics, they have mostly been correct in those cases.
1	I trust my physician because of my previous experiences. He has always done right by me. I trust him with my life

1	I trust them because I know they have to much to loose, additional to the fact that they're licensed

-1	I trust my position because they treat me as if I were their family members. They actually care what I need and what is best for me they ask a lot of questions so that they can figure out the best solutions for me and the best treatment. And often sometimes emotionally there for me during bad times. Great doctor I couldn't ask for anyone better
1	I trust my doctor due to honesty, making decision about the best treatment for me, and extremely thorough as well as being careful.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has yet to give me a reason not to. Before I was diagnosed with a life threatening illness, she kept me updated on what her findings were before recommending me to a specialist. Additionally, she makes me feel welcome and less nervous when entering her office. She'll make sure that not only my physical health is in shape, but also my mental health because I have a history of depression. She is a really good doctor.

-1	As stated in the letter of intent, the NHMFL offers the capability to measure actinide materials under unique conditions. Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile samples.

-1	There is two things that I think that you need to fine find that what's love and what's things thing are going we need to help 
1	...he is young, discusses his research findings & current opinions, not his personal ones, seeks my input, answers my questions and solicits options, recites what he is documenting, shares printouts w/me of what he has documented & discusses OUR plans. However, he does rely on computers more than I prefer & at times, selections within the computer are not available to address my actual concerns; for example, pain in forearm-nurse only found elbow pain in computer so entered that-PCP discussed elbow pain-redirected to discuss pain in forearm-he kept discussing elbow pain so offered options for that-I declined option for elbow pain & redirected discussion to pain in forearm to no avail, asked perhaps muscle?-ignored/dismissed/discounted? documented tennis elbow & that I declined tennis elbow splint which I did...oh well, another appointment next month to address pain in forearm, partially researched it, found muscle termed brachial-radialis (sp), more to do so am prepared for discussion on next appointment, takes a team to 'git 'er did'! Oh, pain in forearm was only one of other concerns for office visit (monthly weight loss management regime f/u, feeling of something in throat when swallowing, unlike history of swollen tonsils (US ordered), recent pain in forearm when lifting heavy objects). Thank you ~
1	I have two physicians who I see.  Because I'm in good health (no major health issues) I feel quite comfortable with discussions I have regarding my maintaining my health and with regard to any issues that might effect my health.  I try to keep active and maintain a healthy lifestyle so there isn't much I would not trust them about.
1	I trust mt doctor because whatever is happening to mt health and if i am having a problem and i taln with my doctor and they tell me what is happening they would prescribe a treatment that causing the problem.
-1	We I go to the doctors I can say I trust in the most of the time especially if they are experience doctors
-1	I dont completely trust any doctor simply because they get paid to treat sick people and so sometimes i feel they prescribe medications to prolong symptoms or treatment in order to make more money off their patients.
-1	I don't trust primary care physicians because I don't know if they know what they prescribing to me 
-1	First of all I don't trust to many people. I have been to a doctor in about 20 years so trust has not been built at all. From what I have seen from other people their physician is only interested prescribing drug, somehow I think that get a cut somewhere down the line. I also believe the are concern but making that money is their main focus.
1	My physician is young like I am, so I can relate to her. She is very good at remembering things that I am interested in so she can make an honest connection with me. So when I get some bad news about a medical condition, she is very thorough about making sure I understand what options I have and that I can talk to her if I need to.  
-1	I trust my doctor because she seems knowledgable and trustworthy so far. ive only been to her oncce though so we will see
1	I trust my doctor because my doctor have my best intense at heart an will not recommend anything that is bad for me or anything that I will regret in the future

1	I trust my primary care doctor because she's thorough and takes the time to talk to me about my health. I feel like she cares about my physical and emotional well being. I can talk to her about anything pertaining to my health.
-1	i trust some doctors. Not all doctors. everybody is not honest and trustworthy. Some nurses are very nice but not all
1	He takes time and explains everything.  Then he has me to tell him what I heard him say.  He makes sure you know what he is saying before you leave.  Then he gives you written instructions just in case
-1	I trust my medical physician in suggesting good medical treatments for me and I believe that my medical physician is capable of successfully treating any illnesses I may encounter.

-1	I trust my Primary physician because so far they have done a very good job and were right about what to do about the situstion. 
1	My last physician I really didn't care for her to much. She was not professional enough for me. She took to long and to get to see me but when she did see me I wasn't there long at all. Her office was to small and she constantly had drug reps there. I know that she was very busy but I think she needs to learn how to schedule her patients and not have them sitting for hours just to see her. She has a very important role and she has a very nice staff but I think her office could be ran better than that.
-1	I believe doctors will just throw pills at issues that I go to them for and would like cures more than pills.
1	My primary doctor always have been sincere with me, I have full confidence on him, is great in all senses actually 
-1	Don't have a physician and primary care. Or doctor to trust or distrust in a general care need in general
-1	i trust them alot. they know what to do for me. they give me meds i need.  i like her and her practice
-1	Sometimes not everyone has your best interests in mind. Your doctor is suppose to assist you with your health but at the end of the day they still have to make money so im unsure about completely trusting them
1	I have always trusted my primary care physician, since they have always given me the means to get better when I am ill. I believe my doctor has no ill intent regarding my health, but might be more skeptical of someone who is not a doctor.
-1	I neither trust or distrust my doctor. While I know he will give me what he believes is the correct diagnosis I also believe he will recommend a drug that is more expensive than others or try to get me to go to see another doctor for the issue to get a commission. 
1	I have been going to my primary doctor for a lot of years and I have come to trust his judgement completely.  I feel he always has my best interests in mind and tells me what to expect.

-1	My primary care physician only seems to know the basics.  He has diagnosed a few things others missed.
1	i figure he knows what he is doing, what meds to prescribe based on the reason for visit/illness,etc.
-1	After multiple tests, a doctor decided that all my issues were a result of stress and that there was nothing they could do or suggest for me.

1	We have known each other for a long time and w ae a great relationship.  He is a professional and I trust him.

-1	I trust   my primary  care  doctor   to provide   my needs. They   provide   my   needs and tell  me how to take  care of   my   health   they are  concerned  about   my   health .
-1	all things in the end are based on the insurance you have or do not have and where you can go to get the care you need

-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is upfront with me.  He also advise me to what type of medication I should take to resolve the issues that I have with my health
-1	I could create sentences. No need to. And since I'm gonna be forced to I'm going to probably get an attitude with this question. Pointless things like long waits and attitudes when patients ask for simple things ,- food, water, soda, etc. Those are the things people consume at home and could possibly help in the decision making process of healing. 
1	My doctor holds nothing back from me she explains all options in detail and lets me make the final decision
-1	He has many years of education and experience. But he is also most likely getting kickbacks from drug companies which may influence his prescribing of medicine.
-1	sometimes I think doctors deliberately hide information to keep you coming back to the doctor so they can earn more money off of people
-1	my doctor is knowledgeable but good gracious they do not have time for you. They are always in a hurry, are as impersonal as possible and that creates a perfect distrust for me.
1	I trust my doctor and all doctors cause they go to school for a long long time and are very friendly and know it all when it comes to my health.
1	Because I have a good doctor I trustHer she is good and works with meWhat more do you want me to say that's all I can say
-1	all doctors are just after the money, and they are all in bed with the pharmaceutical companies vying for free trips an such. write prescriptions like its going out of style
-1	In most circumstances I put my faith in my doctor's opinion, though I am aware that physicians are often bribed by pharmaceutical companies in effort to increase prescriptions written for their given product.  As such I always like to do my own research or get a 2nd opinion on said issues.
-1	yes i trust primary care physician as they provide good services in hospital so that in future i dont get any trouble
1	She always takes into considerations all my concerns and answers my questions thoroughly. Has a lot of patience with me, and never makes me feel judged or that she's basing her judgment on a stereotype or character judgment. Takes care of my varied problems the best she can with what I can do.
1	My primary care physician is very much straight to the point. I only see him once a year because I am rarely sick. 
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for a long time.  she always gives me good and trust advise
-1	They are greedy, underpaid, and will do whatever it takes to make money off their patients and not really try to heal them. 
1	My trust in my doctor depends on which doctor I go to. For instance, I trust my general physician and gynocologist but not my dermotologist because he doesn't give me a lot of attention and seems to be in it only for the money.
1	Choosing the right doctor is often put in terms of trust. Can you trust the doctor to do the right thing? Start off with the idea that even very good doctors do the wrong things sometimes. There is so much to know. They may not know as much as someone elseâbut the good doctors will go out of their way to learn what they may not know.  And they will ask for help from other doctors. I would trust some doctors to treat some conditions out of their area of specialization more than I would trust a specialist in that field whom I knew was careless. They can be relied on to approach a medical problem carefully. I cannot describe what goes into having good clinical judgment, but it is a real thing. I am not sure exactly what quality of mind and character it involves. It is a kind of being sensible.
-1	"My doctor seems to provide a lot of information and entertain any questions, even if they don't see particularly well thought-out or ""smart"""
-1	I sometimes feel they're a bit rushed to get to the next patient, but I do feel they are listening to what I'm saying about the state of my health.
1	I typically trust that doctors know how to treat and care for whatever health condition I'm dealing with if they can pinpoint it.
-1	I trust them to do the right thing whenever possible. Listening to a patient explain their problems is utmost in doctors minds to assist them in recovery.
-1	I have been going to the same office for my whole life, so I feel that the team of physicians there is invested in my family and I. I am comfortable with them and their decisions as a result.
1	He is a very caring person, who takes the time to really talk to and bond with his patients.  I am lucky to have found him.  We are short on physicians here in Hawaii.
1	First of all its I do not trust to many people, do the doctors and nurses, police and everybody else falls into this category.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has the education and experience to make the right decisions pertaining to my health
1	My doctor is genuine and very caring.  She knows me and what my needs are.  She goes above the call of duty and asks me to call her if anything comes up or I have any questions.  She is a great listener and allows me to make suggestions.  She also takes the time to explain things and doesn't treat me a just another patient.  She asks the right questions and gives great advice.  
-1	Sometimes i know my body more and know how to react to things. I dont necessarily believe fully in pharmaceuticals. 
-1	I take what any doctor says with a grain of salt.  I do not see them as gods or absolute authorities.  I do respect their knowledge, however I blend it with my own knowledge as well.  I'm the only one who has lived in my body all my life, therefore I am the authority of my body.
-1	I don't trust doctors because they are only doctors so they can make big bucks, not because they care about helping people. They do not listen to what you tell them, they are in a hurry to get you in and out so they can charge you the money and get on to the next person.
1	He takes his time and listens to me. He takes what I say seriously and gives me the impression he cares
-1	I've been going to her for many years.  She is as good of a doctor as anyone.  However, sometimes I feel my opinion and desires are ignored.
-1	It's difficult for my PCP to find the time to see me, and when she does, I almost always feel rushed and unable to get through my appointment in a timely manner.
-1	"My doctor doesn't take the time to listen. She makes it a priority to only spend so much time with you. She even said to me last time ""I don't think I'll have time for that today"" Didn't offer another appointment either. It was an issue I was really concerned about. I told her I was worried and she did give me an extra 3 minutes and a referral. I'm glad I'm being assigned a new doctor in a month "
-1	The majority of doctors I've seen dismiss what I say and treat me like a number. They're always in a rush and want to just get in and out, instead of taking the time to listen to what my concerns are. They just want to shove pills at you and get you out the door, instead of exploring underlying issues.
1	They know me pretty well and have my best interest at heart however they are busy so if I really need something I will remind them
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my doctor for many years and has always done the correct thing pertaining to any sickness I've had. He has never treated me wrong or diagnosed me with the wrong illness. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he has never led me astray. He seems genuine in his concern for my health and the methods I need to use to fix whatever ailment I have. 
1	My doctor has never treated me without respect and has worked with me in the past years to help me stay healthy. Since I don't have any physical or mental conditions to deal with my annual checkup is normally without incident or problems.
-1	Doctors or primary care physicians often rush their patients. A visit is too quick to get to the bottom of one's needs. 
-1	because it is in his own best interest to what would best for me. This what he has trained for and has taken an oath to do what is best for his clients. so I believe he would do what is best for men.
-1	I trust my primary care physician and I do have a primary care physician who has always been trustworthy. They are known to have a good reputation within the community.
-1	He seems to be open, honest and checks everything out!!  Takes the time to explain everything and gives me more than one option
1	My doctor is upbeat and personable.  She is younger than my previous doctor who was wonderful.  I trust her because she looks out for my best interests and does not insist I take drugs that I deem unsafe.  She is very knowlageable and competent.
-1	I don't necessarily trust doctors. Some are very trustworthy, others are not trustworthy at all. Doctors are often more caught up in imposing their ideas on their patients and don't actually listen to their patients. Too often they tell women that losing weight will fix all their problems or that they can't have a hysterectomy, even when it is medically called for, because they might want to have children later. Too many of them have relationships with drug companies that make it hard for them to be fair-minded about which treatments are best. Some of them haven't kept up with the latest in medical science news. 
-1	I just that my primary Care physician is well educated on the subjects at hand i mean he doesn't have a degree for nothing right
-1	doctors are too busy seeing people that they have trouble keeping up with the new things that are being learned.
-1	mostly trust but no one is perfect and dont hold them to 100.  If they do get something wrong or if they cant do what I expect then I can flex to what they are thinking or doing at the time
1	I have been going to my doctor for over twenty years. He's the best doctor I have ever had. He will always tell me the truth about my health conditions and what kind of treatment is needed for them. He will then let me decide which one I want. He never suggests a treatment that I do not need. The two times I have gone through cancer, he was extremely helpful and caring. At appointments, he always takes his time with me and other patients. In other words, he does not rush through them as some doctors do.
1	Because he has always told the truth and he always gives me a solution to my discomforts or diseases
1	They define the position for the organization, for potential applicants, and legally. If there's any question about whether a staff member is actually doing her job, or being asked to perform duties that have nothing to do with her position, the job description should clarify the situation. It should also make it clear who's ultimately responsible for specific tasks or areas.
-1	I have rarely had any issues with my medical treatments that are recommended by my doctors.  They seem to know what is best for me based on my medical history.
-1	Because Doctors do care about my health and for my whole body to feel much better.Sometimes Doctors don't care or didn't do a good job when it comes to asking so many questions and Got me upset, about something.that's awkward.Doctor's are there to find out what's going on with my health and to learn about me getting the help I need.
1	My doctor is thorough and caring. I know he keeps up with the latest research, because he mentions that. I am sure that he is doing the best he can.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have informed myself of options and treatment prior to my doctors appointments.  that way I can listen to his proposals of treatment and decide in a positive way if I think he is on top of my situation and treatments.
1	I trust my primary doctor because he is very thorough with his examinations.i trust.my doctor. I will continue to see him as my doctor. 
1	if I did not trust him I would not continue to go to him.  he always explains things well and in words that I can understand
-1	I tell my doctor problems and he brushes it off. He does not respect my needs.  He is too cold. I told him about a knot on my foot 6 months ago. He ignored it. Now it is painful and bigger
1	I have had my primary care doctor for about 25 years now, so I trust her completely. She is always upfront and honest with me all the time. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he doesn't rush me out of the room and genuinely seems to care. He's gotten to know my family personally. I even have his cell phone number.
-1	I do not have a primary care dr. I just moved and havent found a new dr yet,will be finding one soon
1	My doctor is out for my best interest. He will make decisions not based on his hospital's needs, but the patient.
-1	Sometimes doctors do not take the time to really look at the whole picture and just prescribe what is common for a condition
-1	You should always trust your doctor to give you the best care you can receive. Doctors are not there to purposely harm you, they care about you and want the best for you. Not every doctor will have the right answer but you should still trust them 
1	I have had the same primary physician for almost thirty years.  he has earned my trust. he has always given me good advice and care.
1	because me and my mom have been going to him over 15 years and he has never been wrong for both of us and seems honest and caring and always meets our needs
1	I have a background in the medical field and am able to effectively build a rapport with my physician to ensure a trustworthy relationship 
-1	i read my medical documents, and they are two-faced, call my condition fake, reason that I lost my disability.  
-1	I dont trust all doctors but my primary physician is a very nice man. He is very thorough and honest but always uplifting and looks on the bright side.
1	I trust my primary doctor to tell me what I need to know to take care of my health. I am confident she will give it to me straight. I trust what my doctor has to say.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he knows me well and has bewen my provider since 2002. Sometimes I feel he knows me better than me medically and personally.
1	I Have A Caring Primary Physician Who I Have Known Intimately For Several Decades And To Whom I Can Communicate Very Easily.
1	I trust them to do the right things for me and have my best interests in general. They be open and straightforward about it.
-1	to explain the reasons is moot inane and asinine.  questions like this destroy the survey experience
-1	I think sometimes they see only what they want.  They ignore what I tell them in regards to symptoms.  If the symptoms do not match the tests or diagnosis they do not count.  So this is why I only trust doctors part way.
-1	I have a terrific pcp and I feel it's so easy to talk to her. I am also very strong about what is right for me, so as much as I trust her I make my own decisions.
-1	My Dr. is caring and compassionate. He will try to help people to the best of his ability. He takes time to listen and talk to his patients even when really busy.
-1	that what they are there for give us the best advice regarding our health and mental wealth that's what they studied for
-1	I think doctors for the most part are very knowledgeable and truly care about their patients, but I think that the way our healthcare is run, doctors don't have enough time to fully develop the best plan of action.
1	he knows what he is talking about tats atatdr is all that i can think of at this time isaid that it is
-1	they always wanting to try new medicines and treat you like a guinea pig, I am not willing to be one
-1	I believe people--including medical professionals--operate from their own built-in biases and those biases can result in a doctor's not offering up ALL options, choices and decisions that are out there for consideration. For example, if a doctor believes in saving lives at all costs, he's not likely to suggest hospice care to a patient who has entered or is close to entering the terminal phase of life.
-1	He spendsa gooda mount of time with me and makes me keep track of important health information and give it to him on our visits...then he really studies the info i give him.
1	I have a good relationship with my doctor. I knew him for along time and he will always tell me the truth but, will let me decide what I want to do. He is willing to answer any questions I might have and give me the honest answer.
-1	Because whenever I have had a health problem I have been treated well and achieved good results by staying healthy and stable, without having to buy or consume unnecessary medicines
-1	My current doctor says i have one problem that is not really true and sometimes contradicts what others with more knowledge would say
-1	"She answers all of my questions and gives reasons why she is advocating something that I may ""waffle' with.  She listens carefully appearing to see that I as a patient do know myself quite well."
-1	I believe most doctors do settle for medications when there are other alternatives available. Medications are very expensive, some doctors get kickbacks from sales. I believe most harsh medications actually cause worse physical reactions.
1	I chose my doctor, for good recommendations, good studies in a university that I trust and good results
1	My doctor has years of training and real live experiences.  He know more about my medical issues than I do
1	I have had him for 25 years. We work together to keep me healthy. He considers the whole person not just the malady.
-1	I have a lack of trust with my GP.   She recommends one thing while my gynecologist, neurologist, and allergist recommend other avenues 
1	she is the best out there, i know because we live in a small town and everyone knows everyone so everybody knows my doctor she is thoughtful explanatory and super nice
1	i trust him but im smart enough to research things outside of the office to make sure he is correct in what hes telling
-1	She has delivered all 5 of my babies and she didn't miss a single one she takes the time to listen to me and even called my insurance company to help me out
1	Because she has been kind and compassionate with me for many years.  She is easy to talk with and confide in.
-1	My doctor misdiagnosed me for two years. When I found out what was wrong with me he refused to listen. I hired an attorney and had him send a letter so I could get a referral to a neurologist. They agreed with my self diagnosis. Same thing happened with my GYN and my chronic problems. They could do a google search and help me but their fucking egos or laziness stops them.
-1	first of all my primary care physician doesn't show up to work on a the regular basis and also he always smells like alcohol and do not have that much knowledge in medicine.
-1	Feel doctors treat overweight patients a little differently.  Also led some by drug and insurance companies. Too many unnecessary tests.
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part, but sometimes feel he takes the easy way by throwing medication at me even if it has a warning attach to it. 
1	Cause the physician knows what he/she is talking about and is dedicated to. The physician has no axes to grind and has no other agenda than to render the best care.
-1	They are sincere and experienced, but would like to make a lot of money with my visits, which I do understand but most of the time the outcome is generated office visits.
-1	I sometimes trust and distrust doctor. I have had a bad experience when My mom passed away due to A doctor sugar coating things for my mom many years ago. He did not give her guidance or answer any questions about her illness, thus I have many trust issues with any doctor. Including dentist or a nurse. 
1	Because he tells me truthfully the best course to take and it is always right and leads me in the right direction.
-1	I trust in doctors in general because they studied during many years their carears and they are well prepared .
1	This is another young doctor with fresh eyes I went to a set of doctors for seventeen years trusted them totally until about two years ago when I had two huge tumors growing on each upper thigh and this doctor I have now discovered it.
-1	Some I trust some I don't. All depends. There's honest to God willingness to help while others just want to milk the coverage plans
-1	My first visit was her questioning me about my health in general and if I had all the necessary test up todate?
-1	I trust them to know a lot more than I do but if it sounds wrong to me I will definitely seek a second or third opinion. I will do research online also just to see if others have the same issues.
-1	Medical care has declined as insurance provision has decreased.  Fewer people are seeking the education to become a doctor because they don't make enough money - this due to the low quality of insurance and the amount paid by insurance companies; therefore the quality of doctors has gone down and most doctors are foreign and don't speak good English.
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician since I have been a long time patient of hers and she has kept me healthy all that time even though I have several problems that could make me unhealthy if not treated right.
1	Thus far I haven't had a reason to not trust him, he's done a fine job with my care as far as I can tell.
-1	I do not have medical insurance nor a PCP.  Thus, any statements relating to primary care physicians is moot.
-1	I don't trust my primary care physician very much. She is nice but doesn't know what to do with me at times when I get sick. There are very few times that she will call my specialists to ask for help or advice on how to treat me in the most effective way.
1	I trust my physician because he is very nice and kind. and I feel that he wants the best for me. He gives me no reasons to not trust him.
-1	doctors don't take time to know their patients i don't believe that have enough information about me to give me best advice or medicine
1	I feel as though i trust my primary physician because she ecplains things to me so i can understand and she always allows me to ask as many questions as i would like. And if i ask her to test me gor something she does it.
1	I will always trust my doctor because he is the best at what he does plus he very honest and open minded I can ask him anything  and hes always honest
1	Our PC is extraordinarily thorough. If I cad to criticize anything, it would be that all of his concerns share the same high priority.
1	My doctor is the bomb he listens to my and my needs. I trust him with my care. He is firm but kind and ice been seeing him for seven years.
-1	They know me better than I know myself and have always given me good advice and care. If I didn't trust them then I would probably switch to a different doctor. Trust is definitely important 
-1	easy to talk to have no medical problems that require anything extra than the usual  upkeep of yearly physical and any pre screenings that are for my age
1	I have been with this doctor for almost my whole life and they also treat other friends i know and i just trust them alot
-1	Sometimes doctors are preoccupied with administrative priorities rather than health care. It appears that the government has changed the meaning of health care
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years. I trust him implicitly to attend to my health and well being.
-1	He knows my condition and what is the best form of treatment for me, always answers my questions and addresses my concerns
-1	I don't trust my primary care doctor mostly because I feel like I'm being rushed through my appointments. Also because they tend to diagnose you with something and give you medication even when they are not completely sure if what is really wrong with you.
-1	I feel my doctor is getting ready to retire and doesn't really care about anything anymore. He just hands out pills to everyone and doesn't reall explain what they are for or what they can do to you. Time to find a new doctor that cares.
-1	I am currently between doctors, but in general, I haven't experienced any issues where a doctor seemed to dismiss my concerns or rush me.
-1	 When they make a diagnosis without hearing symptoms from me, and I feel rushed out with minimal dialogue. 
-1	I think I can trust my doctors to do the right think.  There are too many checks and balances. My doctor works as part of a team of care providers.
1	My doctor always seems to be upfront and honest with me. He provides me with the information i need to be proactive in taking care of my health. 
1	he is very dedicated and thoroughly professional hhe is also kbowledgeable and cring and always follows up on things i trust him completely
-1	I trust my doctor, because she is the only one I have seen to diagnose me correctly and treat me accordingly. She has improved my day-to-day life, while the others have only done what they find convenient. 
1	She considers information provided and what she sees. She is a known, competent authority and a worthwhile resource. That reputation has been earned over the years.
-1	my primary care physicians have never given me a reason to distrust them so i trust them until there is a reason to distrust them.
-1	I trust him because he always takes the time to do the correct test. He listens to my concerns and questions then explains everything calmly to me. 
1	If you ask a question and they don't give you a answer and just walk away makes me distrust the doctor and if they give you a answer makes me trust them.
-1	Doctor never listens to concerns and basically acts superior does not explain anything and rarely rechecks if I still have the symptoms
1	The doctor appears to be well informed and caring in regards to the patients that are scene. There are times when they appear to be rushed though.
1	Primary care physicians in general should be trusted by their patients. They are very good at what they do.
-1	For the most part, she isn't like most doctors. There have been a few times where we didn't agree on certain treatments, but in the end, we birth found something that was helpful to the both of us 
1	She is blunt, yet caring. Very thorough and answers all questions to make sure I have a good understanding
1	I trust my primary care physician, because I have been her patient for a while. She makes sure she asks me about my current condition. She listened to my concerns, and doesn't only give me one option when it comes to treatments. She also asks about my family and career.

-1	My doctor has always been very open and honest with me and she has not had an issue telling me how she feels in regards to my own health and well being.
1	First of all, he is a Kaiser doctor and we have 40 years of not good but great experience there. After 10 years how could we not love him!
-1	I have to have a cat scan in a few months for my back, and I had already gotten an X-Ray, my doctor says I should have a Cat scan, but I'm very small. I think a cat scan will be too powerful for my back and very harmful to my body, but my doctor didn't think differently. I hope when doctors make these decisions they think realistically with their patients. 
-1	Doctors are out for money and income.. They don't care about your welfare. They are not honest and care about your health.
-1	They are always in a hurry to be done and move in to the next patient I am not seenas the individual I am 
1	She spends time with me and tells me what she feels is the best treatments for me.She is caring and listens to me.

1	"Although we don't know what is totally wrong with me, he hasn't given up looking for the answers and what might help me in the meantime. Never once did he think that it was ""all in my head"" as many would have. He always takes the time to listen to me even if it goes beyond the alloted time and never makes the appt feel rushed.

If you have an additional question that is raised during their cursory assessment, they ask you to make another, separate appointment in order to address those concerns. Nurses are fat and act annoyed that the patients are interrupting their donut break. Another nurse was eating ribs at the desk and barked at me when I had a question. Doctors want to give a quick fix and usually write a prescription instead of looking at the patient holistically and taking the time to do a comprehensive assessment.

-1	I don't have a primary Doctor. After recent experience with my Mom being hospitalized for and extended period of time, and fighting hard for her life, the doctors kept misdiagnosing her until it was too late. She passed away because of this, so I don't have much trust in doctors right now.

1	"For my primary care physician I reserve time to meet with the doctor to discuss my health care plan to see if we can have a honest and open relationship in managing my health. I would not continue to see a physician that did not have time to discuss my health, ensure all my questions and concerns are addressed, and ever said to me ""you wouldn't understand or just do as I say"". Health care is a team effort between the patient, family members, and care Providers."

1	I have been seeing my doctor for about 15 years and continue to be impressed with his empathy and competence. He has been voted one of the top Internists in our city year after year and he is very well respected in the medical community.
-1	I think the vast majority of doctors have the patient's best interests at heart, but occasionally they may push for a certain treatment or medication for political reasons.

1	I would trust her with my life she has always been completely open wiyh me about everything that is wrong
-1	My primary care physician has practiced medicine in my hometown for about thirty-five years and is well respected. More over, he has been treating members of my family for most of that time. I trust him fairly implicitly.

-1	My physician takes the time to thoroughly explain procedures & health care information.  I can trust him 
1	In 2013 I moved and got a new primary care doctor.  Within a three month period I broke 4 bones in my foot and had to be hospitalized for a severe intestinal problem.  My doctor took the time to explain all options to me and followed up with me to make sure I was doing well.

-1	I trust my doctor for the most part, however I don't think doctors know everything and they should really listen to their patients views and opinions when it comes to their health and what their body is telling them. 
-1	I don't trust the medical system or any doctor for much of anything.  They very often do more harm than good.
-1	Well I do not have a specific primary care physician, so as far as having a level of trust or distrust for one, it is not possible.
1	I know my doctor well, and have considerable experience with him and his methods.I trust him to keep me informed about my health issues.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been our family doctor for years, and considering my other family members are still alive he must be doing something right.
-1	I generally trust my doctor. He, unlike many doctors, is actually interested in what he does. He is still human, and I challenge him when I feel the need. He doesn't mind, it makes him think.
-1	I have a genuine trust in doctors for the simple fact a doctor's isn't afforded mistakes. If a health care provider makes an occupational they could possibly be subjected to legal ramifications.
-1	I trust my doctor mostly but sometimes she can seem a little cocky. That concerns me because she doesn't think she is capable of mistakes.
-1	He has been my physician for several years.  I have never had a problem with his treatment plans.  He is willing to bring in a specialist when it is warranted.  I am confident in his care.
-1	I have only seen my current physicians once or twice.  All of my long time physicians have retired from practice and I now have no physician that I've known, or been treated by, for a length of time.  
-1	I trust that my primary care physician will provide me with the accurate info regarding my well being in regards with what's diagnosed.
-1	I trust my doctors for the most part; however, they are not God.  They make mistakes, get tired, and have lives like the rest of us.  I believe in second opinions and self educating.  
-1	I love my physician. He makes sure I understand everything that is going on with my health. He ask me if I have any questions, and I say no
1	he has always let me to kake right choices I have never had a reason to not trust him I have had him for a doctor for over thirty years still in about as good a shape as any year old man
-1	They push medicine at me and don't look at me as a whole person so just address symptoms as separate.
-1	I have great faith in our medical staff, resources and facilities here in the swell state of Washington.
1	he has a lot of years experience and has had his own practice for many years,and gives full explanations of medical conditions
-1	i do not really have much to say about it after all medical treatment is not an option its a nicesity
-1	I am still new to going to the doctor and entrusting them with my illnesses and overall care. I am attempting to get the doctor to understand.
-1	I just got a new doctor and she seems to looking out for my best interest. I question her sometimes but everything is explained and discussed to my satisfaction.
-1	I trust my doctor because I know she has done this for many years. She's a professional and cares about each patient. 
1	I trust the physicans i currently have because i have had positive experiences through the many years that i've been a loyal patient. And when issues arise they are always handled quickly and efficiently. 
-1	medical offices are constrained by regulations and requirements to post insurance companies, medicare 
-1	 trust my doctor because he is very knowledgable about most if not all medical information that is relevent to my medical and emotional wellbeing. if i have any questions, he explains what i need to know to make an informed decision.
-1	I trust my caregivers because they would not decieve me. They are supposed to do no harm and care about their patients
1	She has been my physician for many years and has always looked out for my best interests. I have full confidence.
-1	Because they get paid when you fill out a prescription they wrote.  The more prescriptions they write and you fill, the more they make.
-1	I believe we are all humans and humans make mistakes. So, although I trust my doctor they are not perfect.
-1	he is very free and open to talk to me about just anything I may ask, has my best interests at heart
-1	It's never occurred to me not to trust her. She seems to explain things well. I don't know how to expand on this answer - it's never something I've thought about before. 
1	shes friendly an nice to me an all her patients she does what is best for me  an i trust her a lot  we get along great 
-1	I trust my doctors because they take the time to make sure I get a reminder call for appointments, they are friendly and don't mind taking a little extra time to explain something to me if needed, I even have a doctor who constantly tells me not to worry about his fee. 
1	The main reason I trust my doctor is that I have been going to him for many years for yearly check ups and other medical attention and over time I have discovered that his diagnosis is generally correct and that he has my best interests at heart. 
-1	Too many doctors who practice western style medicine are not willing to accept the benefits traditional Chinese medicine, like acupuncture and herbs. 
1	My doctor is trained in the medical field and I am not. He also faces malpractice if he does not treat me reasonably or does something outside conventional treatments 
-1	I don't go to the doctor often and have no medical condition. I don't have a doctor I see regularly for anything so I don't really have anything to base an answer off of.
-1	Sometimes I feel like my primary care physician only wants to hurry up and move onto the next patient.
1	i trust them because I have known them for a long time and they have done very well by me, he listens to me and lets me talk and give my opinions
-1	because they just  care about how much money they can get from I have had to make the decision for like chorlesterol meds
-1	I trust most doctors but I have had a few that seemed like I was just another number and just tell you something to get you in and out quickly
-1	I do trust my doctor but not doctors in general. Many are only looking after themselves and do not have the patient's best interest at heart. I will not stay with a doctor I think is doing that.
-1	They are there to do a job and I think doctors want to help so they always try to do their best and sometimes they are wrong you have to look to yourself to help too
-1	I have not seen my PCP very often as I switched about 1 1/2 years ago and mainly have the need to see specialists.  When I have seen my PCP I feel he cared and did what he felt best and was honest with me.
-1	I trust the knowledge that doctors have to identify a problem and provide solutions, but I distrust the use/prescription of medications when they aren't necessary to solve the issue.
1	My doctor is very conscientious.  He asks me a lot of questions to get to why I feel the way I do.  He is very empathetic.  
-1	They are always rushing and not receptive to questions.  They seem to be overbooking for the money.  I think ultimately it's my responsibility to take care of myself so I don't blame them in my mind.
-1	I am neutral on how I feel about trusting my Doctor. I will listen and use my common sense or go with my gut feeling and/or research more on my own.
1	I have been going to him for many years and he has always been right about his diagnosis. If he does not know the answer to something then he will recommend I go to a specialist.
1	I really like my doctor. She is very thorough and friendly. Always has done the right thing. Very patient and listens to me. Never have doubted her.
1	i have faith in my dr.i've been seeing her for a long time & believe she has done a good job at keeping me well and healthy. she is up on all of the latest medical problems and treatments. i feel safe in her hands
-1	My doctor doesnt seem to be quick to prescribe medication, answers all my questions, is calm, doesnt seem to be in a hurry to move on to the next patient. Makes me feel confident in his ability.  
1	I like my doctor and trust him, he is caring and thoughtful of me and my needs I would not change doctors, I will continue seeing him
-1	had personally bad experiences with doctors in regards to making/performing good decisions, seems to be more out to make money than helping patients
-1	I believe doctors are generally there to help you, not hurt or deceive you. They are looking to make you feel better as that is my most people go into the medical field.
-1	Have only seen him 2x but he seems nice and  seemed to know what he he doing, more than willing to,set up appointments for me with other hwpealthcare specialists
1	he-she has my general helth and well benning in mind so I have to trust that what do for me will be the right thing for me 
1	My doctor is extremely familiar with my worries, feelings of helplessness at times and he provides enough time to listen to my concerns. He is very empathetic. 
1	I have had many Drs over the years, I have 3 right now, and I trust them all very much. They talk to me about what is being done or what I should do to do better. 
-1	"First, I want to say that it's very hard to rate the sentence ""all in all you have complete trust in your doctor"" on a sliding scale. The sentence contains an absolute, so it's not clear. Next, to sum up how much I trust my doctor, I'd say I generally trust her, and I think that she's a competent person with good intentions, but that she also has a reasonable amount of self-interest and might not be above soft-selling me something I don't really need, like botox. I don't think that she would lie to me about it, though. She has a fairly conservative point of view about prescribing medications and I appreciate that."
1	This is the person I rely on for the truth more so than anyone else besides my family. These are the people that try to keep us alive.
1	I trust my doctor b/c when I first started seeing her I was a mess and she ran labs on me and found a ton of my problems and worked hard to fix all the problems and every 6 months she runs labs on me to make sure all are in the level they need to be.
-1	I think that most doctors are basically helpful.  They do tend to be arrogant and think that they are important.  No doctor wants to be sued for malpractice, so I think they tend to over treat many medical conditions.
1	we have built a relationship, he knows what we desire and expect and all live up to the exceptions we have set
1	I trust my doctor with my healthcare needs because of his knowledge, compassion and care for my well being.
1	I trust my doctor because I've been with him for years, and through those years, I've become healthier and happier by following his advice. I was overweight and unhealthy just a couple years back, and because of a healthy routine prescribed by my doctor, I've shed pounds and am much healthier today.
1	She has been my doctor for years. She is older and has been a doctor for years. I basically like how she conducts an examination. 
-1	my doctors always explain all the side effects of all the different medications that are planned to be taken by me and they will answer all questions i have to the best of there nowledge
1	I trust my primary care physician's knowledge, in that has been able to direct me in the right path of medical care for several years. She has directed me to specialists whom I have found to be great doctors. She is very knowledgeable--a specialist, in fact--in the area of breast cancer, which is of special concern to me because of my family history. She takes plenty of time to ask and answer questions at each visit.
1	It comes from experience. he is very honest and explains everything. I don't know what else you want to know
-1	I do not have complete trust  or distrust for doctors but I feel most are more about making a buck than they are about caring for their patients.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor - overwise I would have change my doctor immediately. No reason to visit doctor I cannot trust.
-1	Doctors have operated on me and have messed their operations,therefore,I do not have much trust in doctors !!!
1	He has been my doctor through cancer and other maladies for 20 years. He is very modest and gentle. He has found problems with my health that I was not aware of, such as pneumonia.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor. I have been with the same person for 4years and she is very knowledgeable and always on point with treatment and what to do
-1	i like my doctor but sometimes i just do not know what to think about things they have help out a lot over the years
-1	It seems that physicians want to treat symptoms rather than dig to find causes and solve complex medical issues now.The latter takes more time and effort and expense and the medical industry does not favor the old diagnostic approach to medicine.Physicians are too ready to write prescriptions than to treat patients with drugs.
-1	I believe my physician mostly cares about his patients, including me. Any problems I have with him stem from his reliance on a completely helpless and unintelligent staff.
1	I have had the same physician for several years. He is patient with my many questions. He is easily accessible. 
1	I don't know, I just trust her. Maybe because she is friendly or maybe it was the time she didn't know something and consulted her colleague while I was there. I just feel that I can trust her.
1	She is very good at what she dose and she know what she dose and tell u what is wrong and is very understanding and talk to u
-1	Sometimes physicians give unnecessary treatment and sometimes they are on point with treatment with my personal experience I always recommend a second opinion 
-1	i do trust my primary care doctors thats the way it is and i do believe they are doing their best to help and assist as in our condition and they are knowledgeable enough to just do what is the best for us 
-1	I have been going to my primary care dotor now for 17 years.  I feel that he has my best interest at heart.
1	I have some very negative experiences with doctors trying to treat beyond their personal capabilities. My current doctor is great at discussing the problem, and if he does not feel totally confident in a procedure or treatment, I get a referral to a specialist. I love it.
-1	I don't feel they go the extra mile to check for any ailments I feel they are in a rush and don't check for everything they could sometimes we have to offer suggestions which is not cool 
-1	I trust him enough to provide me with the information I need to make a decision - as to agreeing with what he thinks is best for me, I am neutral.  I make my own decision after speaking with those that are close to me.
1	do not have a primary doctor, but I feel that doctors are desensitized to the health concerns of their patients
-1	I trust him but there is always that doubt that they are just guessing your diagnosed things because they are doctor
-1	Most doctors are either trying to make money or don't take the time to fix the problem. They rely on medications to make the patient feel comfortable while making him or her more sick. 
-1	Doctors tell you what is good for them financially. They may have stock in a certain type of medicine so they prescribe that medicine more often. It's always best to get a second or third opinion.
1	Well let's see. So far my Doctor hasn't led me astray yet. He has told me to lose some weight, but I think he knows that isn't going to happen anytime soon. When we have a problem, he is willing to work on it to figure out what is going on.
1	I do my research before choosing a doctor. I also go off of word of mouth and trust my doctor completely because of the people who recommended hi and my faith. 
1	Doctors take pride in their skills. I trust them to want to be right. Being dishonest would be a conflict but we all have convenience concerns. 
1	i have been with my primary care doctor for over 5 years. i trust her and i feel that i have a good means of communication wuith her plus she always takes the time to sit with me and explain any issues i may have
-1	I trust my doctor she listens to my feelings & also listens to me regarding my concerns about certain medications 
-1	i trust him we are from a small town and see him al the time. he always ask how we are doing and remembers everything
-1	I really have no reason not to trust my physican or my doctor in general. They are all comptent medical professionals
-1	I will never trust a physician because they are just doing their job as an employee and dont genuinely care about you personally. They do what they are trained is best for their career, not for you.
1	I am able to reach my  physician by e mail or phone and get a reply back in a timely manner if it is needed. They are helpful in keeping any RX's refilled and providing me with the results of my tests along with any recommendations. 
-1	Because they provide me with the best decisions for my health and body. Both physically and mentally 
-1	I feel like a couple of health issues that I have had to deal with have been belittled or downplayed when talking to my doctor
1	my  primary care physician always show interest in my concerns and totally honest in telling me about all of the different treatment options available for my condition. All in all, i completely trust my doctor's decisions on which medical treatments are best for me.
1	I think he's looking out for my best interest. Checks thourough an yet d doesn't do excess. Just the right amount
-1	My new doctors seem to be very knowledgeable and intent upon learning all about me. I am not too sure if I agree with the judgement that I should stop taking metformin (which I have been taking for over 12 years) because I am over medicating because my A1C is below 7 (6.2) and they seem more worried about my blood pressure than anything else.
-1	I feel as though doctors sometimes see too many people to really be able to focus on one person care. Also they can't know everything about each individual.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because ethey know me and my health history not to mention they also know my families health istory
-1	I trust doctors in general because I believe in the Hippocratic oath and I haven't had a negative experience that would make me distrust them. There are cases (specifically scheduled c-sections) that I think are about convenience, but for the most part, doctors are trustworthy. 
-1	He has never held back on what he thinks is best for me. He speaks plainly and bluntly about what I need to help me get over my conditions if that is something that can be done. He does not play games or go easy on my feelings he tells it like it is. I like a doctor who gets to the point and gives me the bad and good without trying to downplay how bad something is. 
-1	Over the years the doctors have done vary little to help with my disease other than take my money, give me medication that does nothing or makes me feel worse, or give me no hope at all. I have been able to do much more for myself than any doctor has
1	I have spent a lot of time over the years finding a woman's doctor oh finally on the third doctor in about six years I found a doctor that I really like. I trust her a lot and I believe that she gives me her honest opinion on things,  she will leave and go out of her way to tell me practices that used to be performed which are as widely practiced anymore. Myother main doctor is for my sleep condition. I've been going to see him for over year and I trust his guidance as well. 
1	I fully trust my physician, I've been going to him for years! He is thorough during my visits, he tries treating disorders/illnesses/conditions without medication first, then if that doesn't work he will prescribe medication. He is totally honest and informative!
1	I trust my primary doctor because she takes the time to talk to me and to listen to me. She asks me questions pertaining to the situation and is thorough in explaining what her opinion is. 
-1	I feel my doctor completes the bare minimum required of her because I have state insurance so I pat nothing out of pocket for her time, which is as short as she will make it.
1	There is a high level of mutual respect and regard between my medical team and me.  We all recognize that honest, complete  commucation is essential for them to provide me with the best care.  If I question a particular treatment, they are completely willing to discuss the pros, cons, and options for the optimal outcome.
-1	Very young dr. I am new to practice. She has me on expensive mess that I cannot afford. This causes me stress and anxiety 
1	My doctor is kind and very well informed.  He always takes the time to explain things to me carefully and has literature to support his positions.  He takes my opinions into account and doesn't ever denigrate my own research.  It's a great partnering relationship.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has never done me wrong. My old doctor was and old arrogant man that was not sympathetic to my problems and concerns so I know a good doctor when I get one.
-1	He has never given me any bad advice. He has helped me through several situations. I do trust him and do as he recommends.
-1	Doctors are just people. Some good, some not so good. I believe todays doctors are overworked and do not have enough time to spend quality time with individual patients.
1	 I trust my primary doctor. He has been my doctor for over 20 years. Even when I was away for several years he remembered me and what condition I was suffering from 15 years ago.
-1	In general most practitioners do a good job, some spend more time with you and some it's different each time you visit. Some make you feel like they are guessing while others give you assurance they know exactly what to do. 
-1	It all depends on (1) the doctor (2) the city (3) the facility (4) my personal experience. Some doctors (like the one I have now) I trust 100%. Others in the past? Skeptical.
-1	I think that I'm just a number and he just wants to me get in and out as soon as possible. I don't think that he really cares about me at all and I'm just a paycheck
1	I trust them because they are here to help us all not hurt us and for the better being of our lifes always in a positive way of life always.
-1	I don't distrust my primary care physician, but I have had a couple of bad experiences with doctors in the past.  Doctors are humans and humans make mistakes.  My last primary care physician didn't listen to my daughters symptoms and the next day, she was hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis.  I never went back to him .  (She won't either. )
-1	He is always to quick to put me on a pill. Does not want to listen to what my contribute to what is going on. Rushes me out the door.
1	Have a new doctor, she seems to understand my medical conditions and prescribes prescriptions for them. I do/have to trust her for prescribing new prescriptions, or taking some of them away when no longer useful.
-1	Sometimes I feel that certain doctors are only in it to make the bucks not to look at the person's health as a whole. 
-1	I do not have a primary care physician - I see numerous different doctors in a charity clinic setting.  Some of these doctors I trust as they have a good bedside manner and are clear in their instructions and information.  Others are lacking in bedside manner and seem cold and impersonal, with little care about explanations or answering questions or concerns.
-1	medications are mostly prescribed based off what pharmaceutical reps are pushing, right? So whatever medication I get may not be what the doctor would have preferred to give. 
-1	most doctors have so many patients to see that they take too little time thoroughly listening to your problems
1	I've been to many doctors but my current Doctor is very nice and explains everything in a Manor I can understand and is always on time and doesn't keep me waiting
1	I have been with my current primary care physician for over 10 years.  She knows me as well as my family.  She explains things if I don't understand.  She listens when I have concerns.  I trust my physician to provide care that is best for me.
-1	been with him for a long time and feel confident he is trying to do what's right and look out for my best interest as a doctor.
-1	Doctor has seen me and my family through loss, illness and family ifficulties. He has always weighed the options to get us any help or medications we have needed
1	They tell me the things that I have to do and not to do to be healthy. They don't beat around the bush, they tell me if something is wrong with me.
1	I haven't had any problems with following instructions from any of them for the last five years,and I've had a few medical procedures done.
-1	My doctor is a good doctor but rather conventional and not always open to some of my suggestions.  I am very chronically ill and in constant pain but he refuses to allow me to use medicinal cannabis although it is legal in my state.
1	I feel like my doctor provides me with all the options available for me and helps me decide on the best course of action for myself. she takes the time to explain all options I may have access to
-1	I trust my priamary care because I have seen her for many years and has always taken good care of me
-1	I believe I bring with me an army of negative people.  It has been this way for over ten years.  Without me these people get nothing.  It is difficult for me to focus on my life when so much of it revolves around other people.  Of course the only evidence to me is going from a grade a student to homeless and unemployed.  Like I set that goal for myself.  I find life gives me the opposite of what I ask for.  However due to current small successes I am beginning to change my opinion and that I believe will also change my homelessness.  That being said people who set out to help me find they now become part of this negative crowd's aggressiveness.  Who to blame but me.  There is no evidence.  It's about a person's attitude and their true intentions.  I trust my helpers to make informed decisions according to their god given abilities and people given authorities.  The second amendment.  The fifth amendment.  To defend the first.

1	My doctor has my best interest at heart and through what i have encountered this past year my doctor has showed consistently over and over that there is care and concern 
-1	Pharmaceutical companies, among others, have changed how doctors conduct their business and it has not changed to benefit the patient.

1	My primary physician always explains in great detail all information that I need to take care of any medical condition I might be having

1	He seems to be aware of my ailments and is concerned that my treatment is correct. He is listening to me and my individual issues. 
1	My doctor listens to me, anything I'm concerned about. He helps me adjust basal rates on my pump, goes over test results and explains any I might be concerned about. He understood my resistance to getting an insulin pump at first when he suggested it.

-1	I trust my primary doctor to a certain extent sometimes worry that they choose prescriptions thru firms that they get something from so push that companies pills
-1	"I have little trust in anyone. When I ""trust"" it is because I believe it is possible for there to be a better nature of a situation and person, but I believe for the most part people are liars, or truth benders, or they just don't say everything they should, even if they don't lie. It is complicated. All I know is that I do not fully trust anyone, well... I kinda... it is complicated. Anytime I fully opened up to someone and let my guard down they crushed me. So, I keep my guard up always, and trust so litle I barely trust myself, but I try to trust medical professionals as much as I can, I am getting better at it."
1	My current physician seems trustworthy and has given me good recommendations to improve my everyday health which have been working.

-1	My primary care physician is part of a large group. I feel my appointments are sometimes rushed, that I get certain tests because of age or other reasons, not because it's warranted. It feels like a 'doctor shop' without personalized attention. The specialist I see often cites outdated information, and doesn't seem to listen to my issues
-1	I feel that she is too busy , pressured to not spend enough time. She frequently refers me to a specialist so that my medical information is scattered
-1	My doctor gives you options and lets you pick what is best for you. So if he said this is the only option I would most likely believe him. Plus he would probably refer me to a specialist. So I would have a second opinion with the specialist.
1	Doctor is open, honest and explains all situations and answers my questions and concerns. Provides for all necessary tests and labs
-1	They have been my primary care doctor for years.  My doctor is careing and usually takes time to listen to me.  She has been able to help me with most problems and trusts me as a patient.  She also has been a doctor to most of my family for years and knows my history.

1	Because me and my doctor are able to go over every ingient so I will have a better understanding what each one does

-1	"I usually trust certain doctors depending on howe well they listen to me, but doctors who talk over me make me mad. My GP she patronizes me and its sooooo aggrevating. She wil also say, ""Im not your mama, so you should be doing this or thta but Im not your mama.....Im like ..look lady my mama is dead, so can you please stop bringing that up everytime I see you?

-1	I really don't put a lot of trust in doctors as there are many who will prescribe medications that may not be necessary in order to get the bonuses drug companies offer to promote their drugs.  I prefer doctors that will consider alternative or natural medication
-1	When I don't feel the doctor listens or is willing to explain I get another doctor.  My current doctor listens, answers questions and looks into my concerns.  We communicate by email and he is always certain to get back to me quickly.
-1	HE LISTENS TO ME ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING MY TYPE 2 DIABETES OR OTHER CONDITION I MAY HAVE.  IF I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING HE SAYS HE TAKES THE TIME TO ANSWER THEM RATHER THAN PUTTING ME OFF WITH A HALF ASSED ANSWER BUT RATHER GIVES A THOUGHTFUL ANSWER IN TERMS I CAN UNDERSTAND RATHER THEN SAYING THINGS I NEED A MEDICAL DICTIONARY TO UNDERSTAND.  THIS GOES FOR MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN MY UROLOGIST AND MY ENDOCRONOLOGIST

1	I just started to see my new doctor & hadn't been to a doctor in a # of years, but she seems very thorough about testing me for almost everything.
-1	I trust my doctor 0n most matters, but I feel sometimes I have to insist on being involved in my own care, and to make sure I get full answers to any concerns I have.  I do not like arrogant doctors.

-1	I trust my doctor, but i trust myself more. I know me and what's right for me better than my doctor does. 
-1	It is not that I mistrust my doctor but I do need let him make all my decisions for me.   If they prescribe me a medication I research it thoroughly before I decide to take it or not.    I am more in favor of hollistic medicine so I always look for a natural way to help my problem.   Medical doctors only want to give you more pills and I am afraid of the side effects so sometimes I do not take them and seek   a natural way of treating my problem

He wanted me to go in an ambulance and I said I couldn't afford so I went in a personal vehicle.
1	I trust my doctor as he has never led me wrong, He listens to me and isn't showing me the door for his next patient..within reason of course...He has been my primary care Doctor for 8 yrs. and he's the best one I have ever had...
-1	I  trust my pcp because i have known him and when others were questioning his treatment methods his methodology proved most correct.
-1	 I have no reason thus far not to trust his ability to treat me as a patient. He takes his time during my visit and goes over all my medicines, problems and all. Gives his opinion on things and together we decide on the best treatment plan.
1	My primary care physician is thorough and never overlooks so she has ample time to spend with her patients.

-1	I feel that they have my best interests at heart. I do not go to doctors that don't listen to what I have to say

1	Doctors are great people who you can trust. I know I trust my physician with my life. Never let me down.

-1	I'm unsure how I feel about my physician because I rarely see her. I trust her to give me good advice because that is her job.
-1	The reason I do not have trust in my doctor is because they rush through the appointment becaus ehe more peopla see means more money they make. The quality is poor.
-1	"I have had the same primary care physician for over ten years now, and he has slowly been losing my trust over the years. I have seen him often over the years and have grown tired of him telling me he can make me feel better or that I will be back to my ""old self"" soon. It never happens. I don't trust that he knows how to help me. "
-1	I've been going to the same health care provider for many years. I am very satisfied with my health care. I will most likely be there for the duration

1	So far things my doctor recommends have worked. I don't always take everything prescribed though.  She always answers all my questions 
-1	at times I feel I am not being heard and the appointments are rushed and then other times I feel like I am being referred to other doctors to have tests possibly done, when my prmary care doctor could just order the test
-1	He takes the time to listen and then to explain. He asks me questions to understand me and is most often correct.
-1	Unfortunately, I live in a town where the doctors don't care about anything but money. I have been misdiagnosed (about having a heart attack)  that could have killed me. I have a hard time trusting doctors after that.

-1	I trust my doctor to help me make decisions in regards to my emotional health and physical health. I am comfortable asking questions about things.
1	I think that doctors in general have your best interests in common and that you should trust them generally speaking to help you whenever you need it.  You should follow any and all instructions that they give you under most circumstances unless you feel you might need a second opinion from another doctor.
1	my doctor always takes the time to explain all  my options to me all what happens with each option  he is very patient with me and my questions
-1	My doctor seems to want to help treat patients but applies his personal beliefs too often and wants me to mentally overcome certain aliments or rely on God.
-1	I don't have a primary doctor so these don't really apply to me personally. I think a primary care doctor is more reliable than an error doctor because they're less rushed and spend more one on one time with patients
1	When I was recently seriously ill, he figured out what was wrong and gave me several solutions and suggestions. When I follow his orders, I feel great.
1	My pPCPis a good person and I trust her.  She is interested in me personally, I can tell, and takes her time when I am with her.  My gut feeling is always good about her.  I'm glad I found her as my PCP.
1	I trust my physician. He encourages questions and respects my preference for natural alternatives to prescribed services.
1	I trust my doctor because he gets very personal and not just all about the work. He actually makes time to have regular conversations to make you comfortable 
-1	Doctors have expertise in field of medicine, have completed training, and continue to train when new science is applicable, where I on the other hand do not have any experience in the medical field. 
-1	this is part of a doctor's education and the Hippocratic oath, the only problem I have in trust is when insurance circumstances limit what's open or if the doctor doesn't seem to be aware of costs (this has not happened for some time)
1	They have the knowledge and understand the best course of treatment for whatever is medically wrong with me.
1	I have know my primary care physician for a long time and have the utmost trust in him in treating all my health issues. 
-1	Because they are all about getting as much money as possible. And getting as many patients in and out quick as possible.
-1	I don't know him very well yet, but I think he will be a good fit to handle my complex medical needs.
-1	Cause there's no guarantee in what a physician tells you about your state of health and also rely on yourself to take of a health matter that is important to a cause or effect to see how a health matter is a concern to a individual in certain situations.
1	they dont listen to what you try to tell them, when you try to tell them how you feel and what meds you need they dont wanna try to make you feel better
-1	I trust them and they usuallt have my best interest at heart... i love doctors and believe they gerenally are good and have my best interest at heart
-1	My rheumatologist is the doctor that I trust the most. He is very knowledgeable and it is obvious that he cares about his patients. He actually save my mother's life at one point because he recognized that she had a rare condition that the other doctors had not seen before. He is very honest about treatments, side effects and possible outcomes and works very hard to find the right treatment for the individual patient.
1	I trust him because he has the knowledge and I have told him everything about me. I don't think he would give me the wrong information about any treatment he would suggest.
1	I have total trust in my primary care physician because he did extensive test during my first visit and was able to make diagnosis that other Doctors had not been able to make. They did not do any of the test that the Doctor I have now performed. That is why I have full confidence in the Doctor that I have now. 
-1	kickbacks, bribes, drug deals, side effects, over booking, arrogant about their importance, believe their own lies hate it when others done.  do not care for clients health because when they are healthy doctors and hospitals, insurance companies and drug companies do not make money from them
-1	I feel like my visits are just to get me in and out.  The last PCP I had did not ask about my condition on my 2nd visit, and ignored my intense back pain when I told her about it.
-1	They don't know anything about real health.  They mostly just make decisions based on money and convenience.
-1	they are only after money not my health care needs with out money they wouldn't give me the time of day.
1	I trust my primary care physician because we have been in a dr patient relationship for some time and have gotten to know each other pretty well she listens to me and we don't always agree but come to a workable solution 
1	has always been to the point and forth rite in dealing with me in all of my health concerns even now that I have a rare terminal condition
-1	There have been times where I left the doctor's office without a diagnosis, without any assistance in dealing with my medical issue.  When I went for a lower back pain, I left with instruction to drink lots of water, but no indication to go for physical therapy, which is what I needed.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has be caring for our family for over 30 years. we have had numerous family members goto see him and they all have had great experiences with him.
-1	I trust my doctor because they discuss every aspect of my health with me. They also answer any questions I may have. 
-1	I might trust them if they seem professional enough. But might not if they wind up  telling me or doing something to me that might not help me.
-1	All the times I have visited a doctor or had an exam or even surgery I was always treated with respect, I asked many questions, sometimes the same questions multiple times and I always got the same answer and was not steered wrong. Rarely have I had a disagreement with a doctor .
1	I taught in medical schools and know about their selection and training.  It is a time-tested process.  The quality of practicing physicians is assured by this process.
-1	I always have to call and remind my Dr. of things we already discussed.  In someways they are good, but still needs some work.  I don't like it when they screw up the Rx's or don't place the orders.
-1	He doesn't really listen to my concerns or questions, only wants to blow it off like it is nothing. i have to repeat my self a lot
-1	well, I need trust of doctor due to better criteria about some item or procedures about healt. then I feel good with this
1	I have never had a problem with anything my doctor has recommended or prescribed for me for any conditions.
1	ive had past xperiences with my physician like a family doctor.and my doctor tells me everything that i need to know about my condition.
1	He has always given me good advice and I trust him to help me make medical decisions.  Everything he has told me has worked out for the best.
1	I have been going to the same Doctor for 20+ years I have total trust in him he has always helped me whenever needed
-1	They are often too busy to give patients the time needed to thoroughly discuss patient options or concerns.
1	I feel that with all his training and years of practice he does know what is best for me and tries to help with any problems I may have.  Once in a while we don't agree but can work something out that we can both agree upon.
1	I trust my dry. Because I have had to have treatments of plasma 3 times a week for 4 weeks and 4 treatments of MeMO have been made better by listening to him and the treatments he suggested.
1	My GP lives down the street from my parents.  He goes to my church and his children are the same age I am.  He has known me for over 20 years, and is both an exceptional person and physician.
1	My doctor is a really nice guy, very competent, and is open and honest with me about my treatment and diagnoses
-1	I don't really have a relationship with my Primary Care Physician. I probably would mostly trust. I respect their knowledge.
-1	They are pressured by time to see the next patient. They have limitations from keeping up with every change in science and medicines. 
1	My doctor takes time to listen to me and takes time to explain things to me. He us very caring and very through 
1	I trust my PCP because when it comes to his patients he is very thoural. He does what is best for the patient. He also discuss a plan of care with his patients.
-1	Sometimes she will give quick fixes to a problem instead of finding a long-term answer or resolution.
1	she has been taking care of me for 10 years and I trust her completely.  She always listens and helps me with whatever is going on
1	He has been my Doctor, and my friend, for many years.  He was also my Mother and my husbands doctor.  I also knew him when he was a resident at the hospital that I worked at when he came to my floor as a student
-1	He's done well with me.. But as I watch my mom begin Alzheimer's my belief in our doctor is dying. He did a test but she passed. It was picking up a piece of paper off the floor.. hmmmmm I know it might be hard to detect... but Doctors should know more about this problem.  
1	I trust my physician because he seems very thorough with his exams and questions for me.  He listens to me and seems to have my best interests.
1	They're licensed. They know what will be best for you in terms of the medical field. They studied medicine for years compared to you that probably did not hence, why you are consulting a doctor.
1	She will spend as much time as necessary with all her patients, so you dont mind the wait, because she listens to all your concerns and will suggest a specialist for anythig out of hr expertise.
-1	I trust my doctor because they know what is best for me to be in good health. They are kind and treat me with respect. 
-1	No human is infallible, and too often people in positions of power, such as a doctor, can get a bonus for encouraging certain courses of behavior. I like to do my own, unbiased research instead of blindly following new orders. 
-1	they worry more about the general public or what people think about things a prime example to me is pain meds 
-1	I live in Racine WI. Our primary hospital was bought out by Wheaton Fransiscan. They refused to pay the best doctors what they are worth, so, hence, those doctors left town. They were replaced by doctors who got bs and cs in college. Many have a very hard to understand accent. ALL act like they are on a stopwatch
1	They have always taken great care of me & my family. My doctor has been in the family for several generations. He knows our history very well.
-1	I think doctors ca n be trusted in general. I do think they hurry you out more quickly than they should to maintain their schedule...which is wrong. I think doctors rely ro heavily on the patient to know what to ask, instead of asking the pertinent questions themselves
-1	I don't have a primary care doctor. Why not? Because I basically don't trust them, they did no good for my mom, told her it was all in her head. She had MS
1	I trust doctor she's very trusting and she's knows what my condition going to be and what medication to take and keep up to date with it
-1	They do not listen to me and I feel that they really do not care to try to understand what I am trying to tell them.  It makes me feel like I am not making sense of what is happening to me. 
1	I have a very good doctor, we have been together for over 20 years. H knows my case history and is a very good doctor
-1	I have been with my doctor for over 13 years.  He has been with me from the worst (near death) to my health as of today.  I do have a complex medical history and he will check on the computer just to see if I was in the ER or Urgent Care and will follow up with me if needed.  I feel that my doctor is going far above his help for me.  And I really agree with that.  It is not always a happy road.  We may argue about some of the treatments, but we always come to an answer to the problem.  To me, that is a very big trust in my doctor.
-1	My doctor is real friendly & will answer all of my questions. She seems to really care about her patients. 
1	never met a doctor who is as thorough or takes the time with me to male sure i understand everything going on with my condition
1	My doctor ask a lot of question and does a good job in knowing what is wrong with me or if something is going on.  Never in a hurry.  Goes over info with me.
1	This is hard because my doctor of over twenty odd years recently retired. I have only seen my new doctor a couple of times. But she was recommended by my previous doctor, so my trust is heightened. I guess it is safe to say that in general, I trust all doctors to know what they are doing.
-1	Sometimes I feel like certain doctors I have been to, just want to get you out of the room. They don't seem to be paying attention to what I am saying. 
-1	he is totally trained and professional, educated about what he does and he does it well. Seems to care about my problems and researches everything  quite well and very thouroughly. Cares about me as a patient.
-1	Previous experience in which a major medical issue was overlooked for years resulted in me not trusting doctors
-1	I trust the doctor because she seems sincere.  She has a no waste time approach and although I think she is giving me the bum's rush at times, she has never been wrong in her prognosis.
-1	I do not have 100% trust in my doctor because she just sends my blood work in the mail & never explain how I can do better I have to figure it out on my own & when she give me prescriptions she never check my paper work to even see if it has something in it that I will have allergic reaction to it or not.
-1	My GP is relatively new to the practice, so I have not had to see her very often, thus cannot rate her as totally trustworthy.  My encounters have been productive and useful.
1	I trust my doctor because he/she allows me to make decisions within my rights, but makes recommendations  that he feels would best suit my body and well being. 
1	My Dr explains the good and the bad.She's doesn't sugar coat anything. I trust her,she's easy to talk to
1	My doctor has always been honest with me and he is very humble. If he doesn't know what's wrong, he will say so and have another doctor come in for a second opinion. 
-1	I have hypothyroidism and my doctor does not like to go above what's the current dosing which I believe is what I need in order for it to be effective
1	He has never told me nothing false and is straight forward with me and my health is pretty good according to him and he never sad or did anything for me not to trust him
1	My Dr is fairly new to me so i am learning to trust her in all matters.  So far she has been on target
-1	They have put in a lot of work to get where they are in their field. They are going to make sure they are doing their job right.
1	I have an excellent doctor who always takes all the time I need at my appointments and from past experience has been very helpful in any condition I am seeing him to be treated.  Feel very comfortable and trust his decisions in my care.
-1	I trust my doctor as far as he wants the best for me. However, he is limited in what he knows. He does not want to say outright that he does not know what to do but he just doesn't know everything. There is just too much to know that no one man can grasp it all. He will suggest herbal supplements but he is not knowledgable about them. He only knows his drug options. I really only go to him when I think I know what is wrong and he can verify it with blood tests or something.
-1	I trust my doctors but you always need to have common sense when it is about your heath. I just don't take what they say ad not do any research on my own.
-1	Sometimes they are very dismissive of me and my concerns but will only care when it is convenient for them
1	They have proven to be thorough and caring in the way they handle me and my health problems, they have never given me any cause for doubt and have a good open bedside manner.
1	I trust Mt physician because they are very thorough and tell me the truth they answer my questions at all times
1	I have gone to him for years and he listens to my concerns and acts on them. He knows if I complain, there is usually something wrong. 
-1	I have been around the medical community for a long time and would trust the training of doctors more than myself or the internet. 
1	I trust my physician because he knows everything about me and he gives the correct treatment what ever you are suffer
-1	I trust my doctor to always be truthful with me and I always tell him what he needs to know. I've been going to my doctor for years and I trust him
-1	I have made substantial progress with my physician in reaching my health goals.  We have good communication between both of us
-1	I do not have any medical problems. I do not visit hospitals or doctors. I do not have a primary physician.
1	My doctor seems to care about me and my conditions. He does not rush through talking to me and actually listens to what I have to say. 
1	"My internist is always honest with me about any tests or diagnoses he provides.  He tells me options with meds, testing, surgeries, etc, then gives me the choice of how to proceed.  He never ""talks down"" to me, and explains thoroughly. He keeps good track of my health, immunizations, mental health, medications and tests.  He follows up with me after most visits to see how I'm doing."
-1	tnhey have the knowledge and training and should know what is for the best for thier patients whether they do or not
1	been with my doctor for 5 years and he's great at what he does always answers my questions and my commonlaw wife has him also a a primary physician
-1	I trust him because he listens to me and answers questions I have. he is polite and not pushy if I don't want a certain shot
-1	I believe most doctors only have the patient's best interest in mind. I just don't believe you can trust any one completely.
-1	My Doctor is so very busy that she has some helpers that see her patients. They are good at what they do I suppose, and it is easy to see them for an appointment. I do wonder if they know my health as well as my Doctor. 
-1	I knew that my physician was honest and caring when he called me at home to check on how I was doing. He is a straight talker - doesn't sugar coat anything but is still kind in delivery (even with unpleasant news). He never seems in a hurry to be done with an appointment. 
-1	"i think more than the majority of doctors care about their patients but that they are stretched in time needed to actually give the right amount of time to the care of a lot of situations and rushed. i have to trust in the doctors i have. some are better than others but the extent of what is needed to become a doctor entitles the doctor to depend on that trust and my giving it to him. if i knew what was wrong with me, i wouldn't need a doctor but i do know my body and what is going on in it and need to let him know so he knows where to start to ""fix"" me, and also follow his directions. it does make it hard to trust anyone that is in charge of your health and how you feel, live or die when they have not the time to really know their patients and sometimes therefore form clinical decisions that are not necessarily the best answer for them causing the patient to mistrust his doctor. i feel i have no trust but to try to or change doctors."
-1	I trust my doctor with my medical condition because I hope the know what they are doing and have the knowledge and tools to help me if I have test done or a sickness. If I have doubts or distrust than I will sure to make sure I get a different health provider or doctor
1	I have a long relationship with my doctor.  I have every confidence in her ability to research and diagnose conditions.  She is a very respected and knowledgeable phycisian
-1	Because if he doesn't come through with being honest, I will own him...I will sue him into oblivion, and I will have his medical license yanked.
1	my primary care physician takes time to talk to me and helps me understand what the medications she prescribes are for and how they can help me. she seems to care about my health.
-1	Doctors in general are trustworthy.  They spend a lot of time in school and in practice.  They see lots of different things that happen to people and gain knowledge from those experiences which they can draw on to diagnose ailments.
-1	I do trust most things she tells me, but feel she does not take the time to be thorough in her assessments. She always seems to be in a great hurry to be done with the exam.
-1	healthcare profession is doing the best that it can, the situation at times for them can be limiting and handcuff much of the industry.
-1	A primary care physician is something like an immediate or emergency physician. It is to which we go first and these doctors see the seriousness of the health problem
1	I have been going to my doctor for the last 26 years.  He is a fabulous doctor and I trust him in every way!!
-1	Doctors spend minimal time with their patients and don't devote honest care to them. They always seem really busy. 
-1	i trust my doctor - he has never lied to me and always is there when i need him - i can call and get an appointment the day i call
-1	I trust my Dr to a certain extent, I don't believe in taking so many different medications just to treat minor issues
-1	At the time I wasn't going to my primary doctor but I was pregnant and I guess I was taking off my mom's insurance so I couldn't make an appointment until they fixed it. Well when I finally got back on it and had an apoointment, instead of checking on the baby we just did a pregnancy test and questionnaires.  Second appointment was once I started losing him. They did a ultrasound and said he was fine. Later that day I had a huge headache and threw up the next day I was fine. That following Thursday he came out too early. When I told them my water broke they didn't try to help me. I had to take a picture in order for moves to be made. The nurse wouldn't tell me a gender. They never asked if I wanted to hold him or bury him. He was still attached to his cord and the placenta was somewhat still inside. For about 4 hours my son sat in between my legs with the placenta still inside of me. Once they finally found that type of doctor she took the placenta out and basically dropped him on the floor. I feel more should've been done that first and second appointment and both trips to the er. Then the following month they thought I had a std. Everything came back negative but no further tests on me as to why i had all the symptoms and why my son came out so early.  I had about 4 (I forgot what it's called but you get it often when you're in your 30s) last summer. Soon in August or September I had a follow up and he was a boy and there wasn't anything wrong with him. I knew that when we saw him on the ultrasound. He was alive and active. 
-1	I find that doctor rely most on what they are taught in medical school, which are mostly funded, staffed and run by pharmaceutical companies.  They tend to ignore holistic approaches that are not approved by the FDA and yet numerous studies have proven they work. 
-1	I do trust my Doctor,he is always making sure to check on everything like Blood Work and xrays or ultrasounds to get to the answer that we are seeking
1	I have been with him a long time and totally trust him with my care, medical advice, treatments and recommendations.
1	"Because my primary doctor sent me to a specialist, I have a second opinion that concurs with her conclusions and course of treatment so I trust my doctor.  When she isn't sure, she sends me to a specialist--she doesn't guess or ""wing it"".  She has lab tests performed routinely and bases decisions upon data."
1	I have been seeing my doctor for 6 years and she has always gone above and beyond for me as a patient, whether it be helping improve my illness or offering advice on other matters. Not to mention that my health has undergone tremendous improvement
-1	my dr is conservative-He does not jump to meds etc That approach is equal to mine so we are on teh same page  He is a caring man also
-1	I trust my primary physician because he listens to me when I tell him something and he gives me different options to choose from for my treatment. If I have a problem with the treatment I can always notify him and he will recommend something other treatment.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been my doctor for many years and I'm still alive. I trust none doctor to take care of me n cause he's educated and experienced. 
1	I finally found a doctor that doesn't only wants to prescribe more medicine.  He agreed with me that some to the prescriptions I was taking I did not need.  He  and I agree that there is only one that I do need.  Finally a doctor that is not a pill pusher.  
1	ive been with her and my other specialists for a long time theyve been and  seen me through several serious ailments
1	I don't know; they're honest and trustworthy and I find them believeable. I don't know what else I can say.
-1	I generally just my primary care physician, because I've had good experiences with her for the most part, but she did let me down in a big way recently and that's shaken my trust in her. I'm also having problems with another person I see, and it's making me trust medical professionals less because she's so bad.
1	i trust my doctor because he is a good hearted person very honest person my doctor is always nice and patient with me
1	I have a long relationship with my family doctor.  He is an internist in family medicine.  He looks for possible problems developing down the road and speaks freely with me.  He orders routine bloodwork and always follows up on any irregularities.  He will call on a Sunday afternoon and say I was just reviewing your chart and I think we should do.....He is board certified and makes me feel confident in his decisions.  I always do whatever further testing he asks me to do whether it be additional bloodwork, mri's, cat scans. etc.
-1	He know what wrong I dont so he nice and kind answer all of my question I! Very happy with my doctor I trust him
-1	I don't trust a doctor who rushes on everything he do he or she ask what's wrong then not even looking at the problem just say you need to lose weight that don't make sense to me
1	I think they are not qualified enough to work in the health sector, so sometimes I look for a second opinion
-1	My doctor has my best interest in mind. She is very thorough and always checks to make sure everything is ok with me. She also understands my state of mind and experiences so she is very healthy to deal with 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he always provides excellent care to his patients. He listens to your problems thoroughly before making decisions and never rushes through any treatment.
-1	I trust my doctor because they explain any thing to me .if I need further info they will obtain it for me 
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician because there is no confusion and I am comfortable all of the time. 
-1	for the most part he takes the time to listen to what I have to say and explain why he wants me to take a medication or have a test done. However he doesn't make any changes when I suggest that some medication can be stopped or reduced
1	If I can not trust my doctor I am in big trouble.  Most of the time he is correct and only has our best interest at heart.
-1	Sometimes to dis day then back from twenty years they hardly do a phiscal check. No a days there always just listen what you say and on a computer..
1	I have been seeing same doctor for many years so I trust her with all my medical issues. She has never let me down
-1	He has proven himself trustworthy and very intelligent. As a Christian he offers his services in ministry and offers a lot fee when patients don't have insurance.
1	I trust my physician because he tells me stories on how he basically knows his stuff and content and it just sounded so convincing that it made me believe he's smart
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he used to be in the group with my previous primary care physician in the past.  I didn't not have a good one a year ago and changed to someone that I trust will care for me properly.
-1	I am not sure how thorough my doctor is, but I feel confident that she will answer direct questions appropriately
1	I have had skin cancer and my PCP referred me to a specialist which resulted in the removal of a skin cancer.  He always asks if there is anything different in my physical condition that might cause problems, and is never in a big hurry to end my appointments.
-1	I trust my doctor with most things some things I research on my own especially if it is about taking a new medicine
1	I can't think of a time when I didn't trust a physician. I have had good experiences with the different doctors I have used for different medical situations throughout my life.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never done me wrong . He's delivered both of my babies . I have never had a bad experience with him . He's a loving,  caring man and I couldnt ask for a better doctor . I recommend him Dr Joseph's from spotsylvania regional. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been honest and helped me and my family in any way he could and if he couldn't he would always send us to a doctor who could
1	I have gone to my doctor for many years. He has been in practice for a long  time and is very open and honest when he speaks with me. He tells me the things I really need to hear. I trust his judgement in regards to my health.

-1	I have had the same PCP for over 20 years and he has been straight and honest with me over the years..
-1	My doctor is an internist but also leans toward holistic medicine and we are both minimalists when it comes to the use of drugs. I trust him to not prescribe medications just to placate me.

1	My primary care doctor is thorough and caring.  He never rushes my visit and always asks a number of questions about my various health issues.
1	I formerly disliked, feared, and distrusted doctors. I have recently found a new primary care physician in whom I have complete trust and great respect for. Doctor Hekman at Cleveland Clinic has completely changed my feelings about doctors. He is knowledgeable and compassionate especially regarding my being a transgender woman.
-1	INDEED I TRUST MY PHYSICIAN IT PROVIDES ME A GREAT ADVISE IN MY LIFE AND I HAVE MORE 5 YEARS EXPERIENCE WITH HIM WITH NO PROBLEMS NOT RESOLVED
-1	I get a long well with all of my Dr's, If I do not trust them I will get another Dr.I also listen to other peoples opinions on what they think of the Dr's
1	I trust my doctor for two reasons: 1) I have close family members who have been patients of his for many years all of whom highly respect and trust him, and 2) I have been his patient since moving to this town four years ago, and have never had reason to doubt or question his diagnosis, or opinions. when he makes a decision, he ALWAYS asks MY opinion of it, and if I have any questions about it. He is always willing to spend the time to listen and explain everything to my satisfaction.
-1	Sometimes she doesn't always get things right, but most of the time she does.I trust in her ability to find the best solution. 
-1	My primary care physician wasn't honest in a medical report over a small issue which causes a patient to mistrust!
-1	I think he listens to me and I trust him very much. He is thoughtful and takes the time needed to discuss conditions with me. He is a respected doctor and takes the time to answer all of my questions
-1	I dont have one. Cause I dont want one. I take care of me. No medicnes here EVER.I know what it is the best for me. A doctor dont.

-1	I trust hee because she is a specialist but i have done everything she asked me to regarding changes my diet and takon medications and gettung tests done but she never calls to check how im feeling or gets to results
-1	I give them the benefit of doubt.  They are schooled doctors and took this profession to help people. Why would I not trust?
-1	They have an education and experience that cars outweighs any medical knowledge I have so I trust them to lead me in the right directions  
1	Have had the same doctor for years and is always patient and never rushes. Has called the house even to check after a hospital release and called my husband to make sure we were settled
-1	I just do because they talk and ask me questions so they are really educated on that kind of stuff that makes me feel reassured
1	My doctor always takes his time with me. He talks about everything I need to talk about and do not need to talk about.
1	My doctor always takes the time tot talk to me.  I never feel rushed.  She will take all the time necessary.  She will answer any questions that I have very thoroughly.  Over time, she has won my trust by doing right by me.
-1	Doctor's are too tied to pharmaceutical companies so that has to be taken into account and I prefer to avoid meds whenever possible.
-1	She is helping me with my condition and she has more knowledge in that area than i do, so i trust her that she is doing the right thing.
1	My doctor takes the time to explain things to me. He gives me options and gives his honest opinion about them.
1	My primary care Dr. always takes time to LISTEN to me, and explains any medical issues to me in  terms that I understand.
-1	The last time at the physician's office my doctor gave me the same medicine that I was given at the hospital.  I went in for knee pain and unable to walk. I had the results sent to my doctor's office, but she didn't even remember looking at them. She didn't send me to get x-rays, MRI, or anything else.  Still having knee pain and very hard to walk.
-1	I really love my primary care physician. She is careful and thoughtful, but she is only human. I know she will do her best by me, but that doesn't mean she is always right.
-1	Shes nice and kind to me. She makes sure that my needs are taken care of and she listens to what I have to say and what questions I may have for her.
-1	Most docs where I live care about money, not their patients. There is very little access to a large health system in South Carolina where I reside and what we have is what we have. If you have to go to the ER it's best to go over the border to North Carolina than to go to Piedmont. 
-1	I have a general distrust for those with medical training. This is caused by a negative experience with a doctor that I had as a teenager.
-1	My care physician is the closest I can get to without having to drive almost 100 miles round trip. The clinic that my doctor is based at is always over crowded and busy so I rarely get much time with my doctor. She tries to do what she can for me but she has admitted that it has not been easy since more and more paper work has been added to her daily work and she was forced to take on more patients than she can handle. My doctor is wore out most of the time and often times I have to mention things like possible blood work that should be done or scans because she won't always think of them. She has too much on her plate and it is hurting her patients overall.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a very long time with no issues ever my routine checkups go well with everything explained to me 
-1	I had a hard time answering because I have not been to a PCP for 8 years or so because I have not been at all sick.
1	I have been with her for 20 plus years and our relationship has grown to the point that I know she will not bs me on any issue
-1	My Doctor seems very lackadaisical to me. Going through the motions while trying to act interested in what I am saying.
-1	nothing like that i can feel the importance and trust mmyself very easy so am saying that very confidiently that i can do all by myself
-1	"I trust my primary care physician because I believe that (while it is a generalization), doctors are overall very dependable. However, I also feel as though many physicians will tell patients they ""need"" certain testing, only for their own financial gain."
-1	Not all doctors let patients know all of their options as far as treatments are concerned. I try to trust my doctors because I have to. They are the ones with the MDs in ultimately should know best. I do use my own judgment at the end of the day but put trust in my doctors and what they tell me.
-1	Depending on what type of insurance you have, some doctors may give you the cheapest treatment instead of what's best.
-1	i don't trust anyone especality doctors i mean what is the worst that can happen if one of their patients dies i mean after all the have malpractice insurance and the law on their side.
1	I trust him because he always been right in diagnosis my problems if any & able to provide the correct medicine & counseling.
-1	I have seen my doctor for a long time. We have a good rapport, they're honest and clear me. In aldi very much trust my son's pediatrician, he's good at what he does. Quick to the point. 
-1	feel rushed at the doctors office so i tend to gloss over a lot of problems and hope they just go away
1	She listens to me and we have an excellent report. I think she is  caring and remembers me from previous appointments.
-1	Most doctors get paid commission on certain products. This is conflict of interest. I don't trust that
-1	some of the doctors are very trusting and some can be not as trusting and they have sometimes they kist think that its okay but i know better and i would get another opinion sometimes .
1	i trust my doctor  they know what they  are doing most doctor u can trust and u can relie  on them for medicial needs
-1	They make matters worst. They don't want patients to get well.  Money is only on their mind.  They don't fully try to understand the patients' needs.
-1	"My Doctor is extremely overbooked and is always trying to get me out of his office as soon as possible. He interrupts me constantly when I am trying to describe why I am there. He does not answer any questions I may have ""telling me to ask the nurse:."
-1	My primary care is good enough.I really rely on my heart doctor though.My primary can be dismissive,abrupt and officious.My heart doctor is gentle ,sensitive and caring.
1	I believe my physician has my best interest at heart and tries to offer the best professional help as possible.
1	I very much trust my doctors at the VA,  they have been unreal kind, right on & always right.    Everything I've had done there has been great & right on with what they say.  I'm completely happy..
-1	Doctors in the past seemed to care more, and spent more time with you, now everything has a prescription, and they don't tell you about something that will work without prescription.  And it seems as if they're not really listening anymore.
-1	i trust my doctor fully...if i didn't i would switch doctors as soon as possible.... i have had my doctor for most of my life
1	We discuss what I should be doing at my age in regards to health screenings and such be he always leaves it up to Me he gives the pros and cons , but he has no agenda other than to inform me which I like
-1	Because she does not listen to what i have to tell her . she tells me i should go see more doctors like im made of money.
1	"Very caring.  His words to me were ""I'm going to treat you like I would treat my Mama.  And I love my Mama.""  He has even called me at home after hours to make sure I am okay."
-1	I trust them but sometimes they want test that I feel are unnecessary that cost me to much money that I do not have and the test come back ok anyways
-1	i have know my doctor for many years, trust all his recommendations and scripts.i have referred friends and family to see  also.
1	I trust my doctor by telling them if something is wrong or if a medication isn't working. They are very helpful if i have a question for them
-1	I was not sick after going to my Physiciaan  I am more like dead person lot of pain and discomfort which I never had before
-1	I just recently started to see my doctor. He seems to have a good bedside manner. He spends time with me and listens and is trying to help me resolve my issue 
1	Because she looks out for my well being if i have a problem she will recommend treatment or send to a specialist.
1	I feel that they know what they are doing and really listen to my input and take that into consideration.
1	My PCP seems to be a thoughtful woman and is very good at listening to me and my concerns.  She is not assertive so might seem hesitant but I feel that is just her way.
-1	Doctors are only in business because people are or think they are sick. You go to them for one thing & immediately they want to send you for testing to see if they can find something wrong. I feel if it isn't broke don't try to fix it. There is a lot of truth in the statement what you don't know won't hurt you. Some people make themselves sick because they worry what if.
-1	I feel like drs in general go the easy route. Also, I feel they prescribe more medicine than is necessary and it causes harm, and I don't like that feeling. 
-1	In the past I have been misdiagnosed three times finally I found a nice doctor who tested me for Lyme disease and it came back positive being misdiagnosed made it worse and very hard to eliminate.
-1	He took me off a dangerous medication without out weening me off without caring about side effects of quitting cold turkey I.lost weight I can't sleep my anxiety spiked up I'm.jittery
1	my doctor always seems to know how to treat me well I wouldn't go to anyone else unless referred to by my regular doctor
-1	I mostly trust my doctor. However, I've only been seeing this particular doctor for 5 months. I think doctors, for the most part, intend and try to do the best for their patients. I also think that sometimes, other things, like scheduling, unforeseen emergencies and whatever get in the way. When these things happen, doctors just do what they can and maybe don't spend as much time with their patients as they should. 
1	My doctor seems to have a genuine interest in my well being. I am open and honest with him which I feel is rare in patient-doctor relationships. I don't see any reason for him to be dishonest with me. He takes time to know my needs and problems so he can effectively treat them.
-1	too rushed, not enough time for appointment because they are running behind all day. too many patients.
-1	I often trust what doctors are telling me because most of the time, they are right. I believe that most doctors in America are well trained in medicine, so I would expect them to be very helpful and/or professional.
-1	I have a long term history with the medical practice and have had good experiences.  I have trained with several of the medical professionals and have trust in them.
-1	Usually my doctor has been spot on with any diagnosis and knows her stuff. Just wish she was a little  more  personable  and not rushed.
-1	I think there are high quality people in the healthcare professional and some that are not of average or less as providers. I judge by my interactions with each individual.
-1	I typically trust doctors who have a lot of experience. I trust my doctor to know the best treatments for me, but I don't always expect my doctor to know everything about me. Sometimes, doctors don't believe what I have to say if it is strange or abnormal. 
1	I jave changed doctors several times in order to find my cuuent one.  She listens and doesn't just push pills.
-1	I believe that most doctors have the patients best interest at heart and they want to help them get better and give them good medical advice
-1	I do not think that doctors much care any more. I think they are short on time and just need to earn the dough. 
1	because i feel we have a great relationship beyond patient and dr. i feel he is my friend looking out for my health and well being
1	though I've only been seeing this dr for a short time, she is thorough and compassionate takes her time with me at my appointments
-1	yes i love my primary care physician and my insurance through my company it helps keep my health together
1	I trust my doctor in every way when he tells me what I need to do and when to do it and I have total trust in him
1	I have known this doctor for 32 years he has always been caring and honest with me and my whole family 
-1	I have been going to my primary care care phycisian for many years. He has helped my husband and I through several problems. I had one problem that he could not solve and he kept sending me to different specialists. After 3 years finally found the one in Dallas that immediately knew what my problem was. After open heart surgery he found a problem my husband had that the heart surgeon and heart doctor had missed. So yes I completely trust my family doctor. 
-1	Doctors are practicing physicians and to me that means they are still using us as experiments to see what will work and what will not work.  There are to many side effects for the drugs on the market to be prescribed for anyone there are more side affects than cure and the doctor knows this but yet they prescribe these medication for people what ever happened to using more natural products like the olden days.
-1	My primary care physician didn't thoroughly investigate my son's condition when I brought him in. She just assumed it was the Flu because of the season. My son was later diagnosed  with a Pneumonia.
1	My doctor has demonstrated thoroughness for many years, and stays on top of my needs and/or issues. 
1	I have had my oncologist for the last 5-6 years and I trust his opinion and I trust his treatment for me I have cancer my life is in his hands so I trust them
1	My doctor takes the time to explain options to my condition and never tells me what option I have to take.  She recommends what she thinks is the best option, but has no problem if I select another option. 
-1	been wit and hah him for 35 years he has helped me with so many health problemsand never steered me wrong
1	I trust my doctor as she listens to my concerns and addresses them with testing and the specialist I need. I have became better health wise since being under this doctors care
-1	I dont have a primary care dr because of insurance reason but i do tryst drs however i feel they dont help everyone 
-1	In all honesty, I do not trust my doctor at all. It seems as if most doctors in general mostly just care about their own convenience and making money. Even though the job itself is to help people, to them it's still just a job to them at the end of the day. 
1	of course i trust my doctor i have chosen him  because of his good fame and he always give me the right treatment.
-1	i trust my pcp because i have not had a reason not to when it comes important things in my life that could meen life; or death.i do get nervous when it comes to something major though.
1	I have been seeing the same physicians for over 30 years. I have complete trust in them and am comfortable that they treat my family as well. I would be very disappointed if I had to find another physican(s).
1	I'm lucky that I have not had to go to see my doctor often. I see a nurse practitioner and feel that see is totally competent and I trust her to give me the right diagnosis.   
-1	My doctor seems to have a thorough plan for my various ailments and seems open to any questions that I have.  I don't feel rushed by him during the appointments.  He is personable.
-1	Mostly I trust my doctor, although she is relatively new for me.  Initially, I did not feel that she listened well enough to what I was saying, but my latest visit with her felt much more complete and comfortable.
1	I have complete trust in my doctor because of how he has treated me in the past with being ill also I've known the doctor for years 
1	I trust my Rheumatologist and my Nephrologists because they got me on the right treatments to steady my condition to were I am more balanced mentally and physically.  
-1	I feel like they are doing the best they can, but are overworked and quality care is diminished, that does not mean that I distrust my doctor by any means, I just know mistakes can be made because they're only human.
-1	good experience in the past and a relationship of several years; i trust they are educated and continue to update their knowledge
1	I known my doctor for over 10 yrs and they will go over my meds and tell me if it's unhealthy and who is better and make sure I'm happy or not
1	stop asking for such long answers to these questions   my doctor never steered me wrong  blah blah blah
1	My doctor has a great reputation with his patients.  He's been a great doctor and has treatment effectively when other doctors have not been successful.  He makes sure I understand everything before leaving his office.
-1	Physicians, doctors, pharmaceutical industries and pharmacists are not trustworthy. They work together in their individualistic pursyits. The patient is not primary goal, their money being pocketed is. 
-1	I have no problems so far. I have been with my doctor for a little over 2 yrs now. I think he does a good job and would recommend him, and have. 
-1	I am just a person the Doctor puts my name in the computer.  What happened to the good ole days when the Dr. Looks at me instead of the screen.
-1	I do trust doctors. The only thing I disagree with is if you call with a question they say go to the ER or doctor immediately. that is not always the case.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that she truly cares about my well being.  If a medication is too expensive/not covered by my health insurance, she will suggest a generic alternative that works just the same and saves me money.
-1	I believe that I trust doctors in general because they have more knowledge that pertains to the situation that I might find myself in. They have endured the proper schooling and training required that qualifies them to make diagnoses, and give medical advice. They are professionals for a reason. 
-1	I didn't trust many of my previous Dr's.  I felt they gave me lip service and didn't really retake an interest in me. I now have a new medical person who seems to care.
-1	I do not have a primary doctor at this time, just lost my health insurance and moved to another state, but my previous doctor was ace all the way.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she has never done me wrong. They have gone above and beyond to help me, and get the proper care I need.
1	Because they are well trained and experienced in their field, and they know more about my health than I don.
1	I have never had any reason not to trust what my Doctor tells me. He has always been very straight with me about everything.
-1	To rushed with dealing with too many other clients every day of their lives also tyhey do not really carte since they all drive BMW;s every day..
1	She does not pretend to know everything. She considers my ideas and opinions. When it comes to my health we act as a team.
-1	I have been dealing with my doctor for a very long time, over 30 years. We had many different discussions on multiple ailments, concerns, sickness, cures and how I feel. We always discuss how each cure, symptons, sickness and feelings and he has been thorough discussing what he feels that I need to do, actions that need to be done and when I have been sick he comes up with different suggestions that will assist or cure what ailes me. 
-1	The only reason I go to my doctor for a yearly wellness check up is because I have to in order to have my prescription birth control refilled. I don't particularly like my doctor and sometimes I feel like she doesn't know what she's talking about.
1	My doctor is amazing. He has several degrees and is one of a handful of Holistic doctors in Minnesota. He is beyond smart, compassionate and honest. I've seen many doctors over the years, but this doctor is my favorite and only one I will ever see again.
-1	I have been seeing him for a couple years and he has helped me. When I didn't know what was wrong he did and he also helped point me to someone else who tried to help me.
-1	I would not patronize a doctor in whom I didn't have trust.  That's counterintuitive.  Why would I go to a professional, then discount his advice/opinion.
-1	I trust them because they always give me the right medicines and treatments for any problems I have and go through. They are always there when I need her
1	All doctor miss things on some patients that they deal wit they can't catch everything so if u smart enough to know something is still wrong even tho ur doctor told u that everything was ok u all ways go to a higher physician that can assist u better
-1	I know he does what is good for me hes been in practice for years sometimes he does things weird but in the end he is right
-1	I don't have a regular doctor anymore due to no insurance and the clinic we were seeing closed. Most doctors I've experienced blame any and all of my health issues on my being overweight. Unfortunately, this has left many conditions undiagnosed for years, some of which actually contributed to my overweightness.
-1	I trust my doctor because he is truthful, he is always right in the diagnosis because he does all the necessary checks and he is also the family doctor
-1	I have found doctors are more interested in shoving pills down a patients throat than actually addressing issues that are causing the problems in the first place.
-1	My primary physician has a good bedside manor and takes time to listen and explain things.  She does not rush me.  She seems to have a good understanding of my health concerns.
-1	I have never had a reason not to trust anything my doctor has told me.She's always very thorough and honest
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician but I also like to back up her information with what I can learn from trusted medical websites. I have only been with this primary for a year so I think we are still learning to trust each other. It can take some time to become really comfortable with each other.
1	She's never disappointed me. Every time I go to her, she's right about what's wrong. And the long term treatments help also. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I feel she is very open and he honest with me. I also trust her because she is very relatable. 
1	She has been my primary care physician for a good many years and she has shared with me a great deal of her own personal information insofar as it is relatable to things that I have shared with her
-1	I do not have a pcp, although  it rust that doctors do the best they can; unfortunately they do not know everything.
1	Cause he never told me something that was wrong I have a lot of trust for my doctor until I am proving wrong I have high trust for my doctors 
1	I have now been with my particular Doctor for over 10 years.  He is the best and most concerned Doctor that I have ever had in my life time.  He watched over my health and concerns with loving kindness.  I trust his decisions for my  health Concerns completely.  
-1	i read a lot, so a dr. would really have to explain why i might need more medication or might need a procedure before i decide to go with her advice
-1	I trust them, but I also like to form my own opinion based on my knowledge and experience. Sometimes doctors are not familiar with your entire history so I think it is up to patients to advocate for their own best interests as much as they can. 
1	I trust my primary physician based upon the relationship that we have developed since I began seeing him.I can trust him.
1	I have recently acquired a new physician.  He is young and on the cutting edge.  He cares and is very attentive.
1	Everything my doctor has done for me has turned out real well so i trust him completely. He explanins things to me so i can understand them and also lets me know what we are going to do in the long run for my treatment.
1	My doctor has a great track record.  He cared for my mother and for me.  Wouldn't give him up for the world.  He has stayed true to himself and others!
1	I don't have. A primary care physician. But previous ones have been very trustworthy and have my best interest in mind
1	I have been with  the same doctor for quite sometime now I have full trust in him and his staff has well has the hospital that he works for , I have never had any doubts with him
1	I have never had a reason to distrust her. She has always been forward with me about all my illnesses. If one medication doesn't work, she has a lot more that she can tell me about. I always ask about possible side-effects and she always tells me.
-1	I trust my doctor as he has good reputation with patients,and i have found him to be quite honest,and straightforward in my treatments.
-1	my doctor gave me blood pressure meds that i almost died from, when i told her that it has an adverse effect on african americans she said she did not know about that, even though it was all over the paper.
-1	I really love this idea, and I think it's really good, and interesting, this also shows a great variety of many things, and I personally think this is super interesting, and really shows a lot of information, and things.
1	I have had the same doctor for more than 10 years & he has helped me allot.  I can tell him I have a weird pain & he figures it out quickly.  
1	I think my doctor has a great deal of compassion and caring for all her patients...I know how she interacts with me and other patients and it shows she is a trustworthy doctor to all her patients.
-1	My primary care physician spends time with me in my appointments and explains every little detail about the procedures or treatments that I may be going through. She never rushes and she always takes time for my questions. 
1	Well, this doesn't seem like a very good question to me. But I think that one has to trust their doctor or find another one to deal with. So what can I say. that is about it, about that........
1	I am comfortable with her. She answers my questions in a language I understand. I don't like to take medication, so we discuss how to do things in a natural way.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is never in a hurry to get to her next patient.  She makes sure you fully understand all of your options 
-1	I'm not sure if I trust the Doctor.  Now a days, he checks things off on the computer, while asking me questions.  I can do that!  Is the system good or is the doctor??? I don't know!  ...not sure!!!
-1	I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have been dealing with it for years, but I don't believe my primary care physician has helped me control it. They don't always listen to my concerns with taking certain medications.
-1	My doctor often says things like I think you have ......  Without any tests or proof I know I should find another doctor
1	I trust my primary care doctor because when I talk to her she gives me her opinion and with my medical back ground I know that she has my best interest at heart. I know she cares and can tell by the way she responds to me
-1	I like his speech with me . It is full of love and cer toward me . He is very special in his way of speaking and learning
-1	I believe my primary doctor knows me well enough to know I want honest answers and the real bottom line, and so he does not sugar coat anything 
-1	I think I would distrust a doctor because they aren't involved in their patients health and they aren't prepared. 
-1	I trust doctors because they know what they are talking about and you can rely on them to keep your best interest at heart. 
-1	I have no reason not to trust my primary care doctor.  If I have a problem, I can ask my doctor anything.
1	He listens to me and we discuss the findings, treatments, and plan options. He is always been right, but I'm also a good historian of symptoms.
-1	Overall, I trust my primary physician but I don't think they always want to commit to a detailed answer.
-1	i trust my primary physician because they really help the sick and they how to help every one they see
-1	I think doctors are more interested in making money through prescriptions than the well being of their patients. They often are too quick to prescribe medication with bad side effects, or are uninformed about what would be best for the patient. Sometimes they prescribe medication that would react badly with other medication that the person is taking. Because of this I have to take what they say with a grain of salt. It's better safe than sorry so I trust myself first. Plus doctors might forget some of what they learned in school.  I saw one of my doctors looking up the answer to their question online
1	My doctor spends 45 minutes every time I go see him. It is much needed. We talk about my medications and if I am on track 
-1	I do not have a primary care physician so I am unable to fully complete this section.  I do trust doctors in general and rely on them if I should ever need to use a medical service.
1	he or she spent the time to do the hours for whatever good/bad reason to get the degree and then try to keep up, which maybe nerar imposssible
1	I have been going to the same primary care physician for years.  I've never had a problem or reason to not trust him with my care.
-1	I generally trust my physician because usually he will explain everything to me before any decisions are made. I think that they are knowledgeable and know what the fix should be. 
-1	My past experience has demonstrated my confidence in my Doctor and his recommendations. His history of tests, advice and goals have proven correct.
-1	my promary doctor is very thoghell when notices the blood test he sends me to a specialist for further testing
-1	I don't think doctors are not taught enough about health.  I prefer to trust myself when it comes to my health.  Doctors only like perscriptions for health. 
1	caring and thorough and has really helped my husband and all his medical issues always quick to respond
1	I've been with the same primary physician for 20yrs, I trust her and depend on her. She always has my best interest at heart.
1	She takes times to be thorough ad suggest what I need. Always have confidencein what she does even though sometimes it is not something I want to do.
1	I just found a new PCP, because my old one was grossly overweight and seemed to not treat  patients as individuals; she wasn't always this way; I know she has some personal problems.  She was wrong about some side effects I was having, and wouldn't listen to me.  My new PCP is very thorough, is a good listener, and is helping co-ordinate my care with several specialists, after an unexpected hospitalization.
-1	my primary physician is new to me, so I dont have a built in relationship with her yet.  She's new to medicine, and that makes me think she is up on the newest medical trends but may also lack experience of knowledge.
1	I trust my primary doctor because she takes the time to talk to me and explain things so I can understand
1	Doctors in general, I feel, are usually professional and honest and I would trust them in diagnosing whatever issue I'm having.
-1	When it comes to protecting your physical health, being able to communicate with your doctor openly and without reservation is essential. When you have a primary care physician that you trust, you are more likely to discuss any health concerns that you have, ask questions about your treatment options, and comply with your doctorâs medical recommendations
1	My doctor is thorough and honest with me, and discuuses every current issue if any, and reviews all issues in the past...so very happy with my care from my primary physician...
1	She has always helped me out.  If she doesn't have the answer she sends me to a specialist.  She makes time to listen.
1	My doctor knows my body as much as I do, maybe more. He knows my existing condition, and past history. If we try a cure for something and it dosen t work, then after awhile, we will try something else.
-1	Seems nice and listens to me she reminds me of me physically so I can relate to her.  She is a female so it's nice that we can discuss colon topics 
-1	She does a good job in keeping up with my care and treatment. I feel comfortable in confiding in her with all my problems and medical needs.
-1	I believe that most doctors sincerely care about their patients. A doctor should care about his/her reputation. I do not think doctors wake wanting a malpractice lawsuit. He/She will do their best unless there is lack of knowledge.
-1	My primary care physician is very easy to talk to and have discussions about any particular problem.  He is almost like a family friend.  We can talk about non-medical things, as well.
1	My doctor has always helped me in any medical decisions I may have to make. I trust my doctor and she helps me in anyway she can
-1	I respect the intellect of medical advisory of physicians however I have faith greater than any man. I trust that people are in me path of life for a reason whether it's a doctor teacher etc. Subconsciously only believing in faith as my provider of knowledge.
-1	I ask about medicines I see advertised on TV if they would help. And he will sometimes say lest try it. Are if another doctor orders medicine for me he acts like it was his idea. I haven't found a doctor I truly trust.
-1	He has always been honest with me. He gives the expression that he undetstands and cares about how i feel. 
1	My PCP has done nothing but good in my eyes. He always does whats best for me. I switched doctors and my current doctor reduced the dosage of metformin form 2500 a day to 2000 a day during my first visit because it was an unsafe dose. My previous doctor did not know that.
-1	I don't feel that my doctor has the time to spend with me on a one on one basis because of too many patients.  I also feel that when I ask the doctor to give me a certain test because other family members have a certain condition there should be no reason why I shouldn't be tested to catch an early diagnosis. 
-1	I have been with her for years , and always be honest and truthfully with me on very thing . i want to anything or ask anything ,she will take the time to explain everything to me .
1	I had a near fatal stroke in 2012. After nearly 3 months in various local hospitals, I had to pick a primary care physician since I never really had one.  I picked my current doctor and haven't regretted it one bit.
-1	She's always been helpful and willing to explain things to me. I haven't run into any issues as of yet
1	I don't have a pcp at this time.  However, while I have some good doctors and some not so good doctors, most of the time I have had exceptional care from my pcps in the past.
-1	I feel that doctors have a person's best interest at heart. I sense see that in the emergency room,  people seem to have the same diagnosis. 
-1	I trust my doctor enough, but I still can't fully trust everythig they say wehn it comes tp payment information and everything else I need to know. The overall feeling of not knowing everything is what keeps me from completely trusting them.
-1	I do not currently have a primary care physician, however, I trust most doctors to be caring and competent while I am proactive in my own care and research treatment options and ask questions of my physician.
-1	My primary care Dr seems to think I'm capable of more physical activity than I really am. My orthopedic surgeon knows exactly what I can do and is proud of my accomplishments.
-1	He listens to my questions and concerns and then tells me what he feels concerning them.  I feel he gives me his undivided attention.
1	I have known my physician for over thirty seven years as I worked around him at the local hospital where we both worked .He is very informed of each and every health issue I have and if I need a specialist he is very forth coming in recommending one on my behalf
1	I have been with her for years and have never know her to put me off or not listen. She listens to what I have to say and goes with me. Her medications are spot on and she has checked my record before we have an appointment so we do have to play 20 questions.
1	It has taken me several years to develop positive relationships with all my physicians.  If a doctor does not meet my needs I look for someone who is a better fit.
-1	Doctors in general have to work to gain my trust-I have had very bad experiences in the past with doctors, so I would say that I am wary anytime I see a doctor.
1	I trust my doctor completely.  We have a long history of him helping me when I was seriously ill.  He has literally saved my life several times.
-1	I am neural. I neither trust nor distrust my doctor, however I put the most trust in myself and my family. They know me better.
1	I trust my doctor because he has always been honest.  He has never mislead at any doctor's appointment.
-1	I generally trust doctors. They're educated, but I also know they're human and can have biases that may sway the education or logic.
1	"She is ""new"" since my doctor left  and I had to find another.  She is earnest, thorough and explains what is need to know,"
-1	I trust my doctors for the most part. I don't however completely trust medical science or drug manufacturers. Medical science just doesn't seem to have all the answers where many diseases are concerned and drug manufacturers seem to be more interested in profits than life.
-1	My doctor has never given me advice or medical care or information that turned out to be wrong or incorrect
-1	I do not trust my primary care physician, but I do trust my specialist.  My PCP seems to be in a hurry and the practice is inflexible, and pushing tests/vaccinations I'm not interested in.  
1	was very close to my last primary care physician who has unfortunately retired but he set me up with his primary care physician who is great and I go to a great hospital with an excellent reputation. I feel like I can articulate any issues and questions necessary
1	He knows me well and even asks me if I have researched something to enable us to better understand a subject
-1	I trust my doctor's assesments completely although I often feel he knows more than he is willing to share with me
1	I trust my doctor. She always tries to do what is best for me and addresses any of my concerns. She also listens to me and let's me explain any symptoms I've been having.
1	I believe that the Veterans Hospital has the best Doctors and Nurses and they have been treating me very well for over 30 years
1	My provider is thorough, is patient, has a good way of explaining things. She has a solid education and training and has not been wrong in diagnosing my health problems. 
-1	i have no response to this question because i feel every dr are sworn to be honest to every patient 
1	She listens to me, repeats back to me my concerns and has given me no reason not to trust her. She takes the time necessary to understand my needs and questions
1	my doctor is honest with me. She gives me the advise I need. If I have a problem, I can rely on my doctor to give me the answers I need and require, I have a lot of failh in my doctor.
-1	I do not visit them enough, but from the doctors i've visted, they were always pretty honest when it came to my health.
1	I trust my physician because she genuinely cares about what is best for me and she always advises me to take extra precautions just in case because you can never be too careful.
-1	I trust my primary care physician moderately. I have so many health issues on going it is hard for her to keep up with what is going on. I went to have knee replacement surgery in February. Ended up having my ankle fused instead. Apparently I was walking on a broken foot and ankle for over a year. It was aggravating my knee issues. 
1	my primary doctor has all my my health in good hands and she works to keep me on the right track. she is truly successfully keeping her pentions in good health 
-1	I don't trust doctors because their not trustworthy I always trust my gut instinct. And I don't know why I have to type so much
-1	I have certain problems diagnosed and my Doctor has me come back multiple times to try new medicines instead of listening to what works for me. 
1	I have known and used the same primary care physician for over 30 years. I have high confidence in my Dr. based upon many years of interaction.
1	they are nice  and help you when  you   have  diabetes or when you are sick  and they are nice and special and caring
-1	He is relaxed, personable and most importantly, approachable.  These attributes make him trustworthy and reliable.
1	I trust my doctor because she is always honest and trustworthy and helps me in any situation that I need her opinion or advice.
1	"My PCP goes to great lengths to ask me in-depth questions whenever I go for my checkups; I'm rarely ill.  It's obvious that she's reviewed my history before I'm ushered into her office; she inquires about occurrences in my personal life as well as about my medical issues.  Most importantly, she actually listens to me and respects my opinions and wishes where medical options are concerned; she won't attempt to persuade me if I say I don't want to risk a med because of its potential side effects - she takes me seriously, unlike some doctors I've had in the past.  She's not got a ""cookie cutter"" all-knowing attitude."
1	I have been with him for a long time. He is honest and direct. He doesn't beat around the bush. I trust him immensely
-1	They could be lying to me in order for me to spend more money with them.  They could fake that I have an illness, only to steal more money from me later on.
-1	i trust my doctor the are very good and care about my needs and questions.i see him twice a year and do tests
-1	My Doctor is very caring despite the short time I have with her during check-ups and I trust her judgement. She always answers my questions and does her best to give suggestions. I trust her judgement but I also do my own research on what is best for my condition so I can be sure that it is the right decision. 
1	I have been going to my doctor for years and have not had any problems. She tells me exactly what I need to do and why
1	I feel totally confident with my doctor since it tells me clearly that it is what I have explains to me how the disease is and how it will cure me according to the treatment given to me
-1	My husband has a situation going on right now when it could be a bacteria (using a certain medication) or it could be an autoimmune issue.  It is all new to us and it seems that the doctor's sense of urgency is just not there .. probably because he has seen it all before where we would like more info, more tests ... more or different meds.
-1	I think they are prone to subscribing meds for everything versus trying something else. They don't take into consideration long term effects.
1	My primary care physician has been a faithful friend and advocate for me. She spends time finding out about my illness and she spends lots of time with me.
-1	My primary care physician as taken care of my family for years my mother and her mother both see the same primary physician 
1	I've been with my doctor for a long and he understand my illnesses and treats with the utmost care. He always makes my health and wellbeing first priority. 
1	I   guess   all   I  can   say   is   that   the   guy   working   on   you  went    to  school   a  long  time   before  he   got   where   he   is   today   so   I  want   to   trust  him   or   her   completely , my   life   is   in   his   hands  on  Earth  but   ultimately ,  we   are   all   in   GODS   hands  and  when   HE   calls   us ,  its  time
-1	I trust my doctor because she seems to care about me - and listen to me when I talk. I have never had a problem talking to my doctor.
-1	I trust them because they went through years of intense schooling to get where they are. That means they know more than me seeing as they are the expert. However I will still do my own research
1	I have been going to my doctor for years & he is honest & straight forward about telling me what is wrong.
-1	I have not been with my primary care physician very long. I was with my last doctor for 22 years and trusted her extremely. She was very thorough and took great care of me. My current doctor is not as thorough and does not prescribe medications, just ginger tea for everything and his blend of vitamins. So I'm not sure how I feel about him just yet.
1	I would not be using the doctor if I did not have complete trust.  I have been with this doctor for 15+ years and she knows my history very well.  She has always explained things really well, especially when something out of the ordinary occurred,  When there was a problem, she found it quickly and was quick to act and resolve the problem.
-1	I do not have a primary doctor and do not trust western medicine.  Drugs that are legal are also harmful to people.
1	The only doctor I see is my dentist.  I HATE going to the dentist, and refused to go for decades.  Pain overrides fear to a point so I went.  I still get a nervous wreck when I go; but I trust him.   So far he has been very nice and careful.  He even gave me a free filling.
1	I was diagnosed with breast cancer 17 years ago.  I followed my doctors suggestions regarding treatment & medication and am cancer free and have been for quite a while.  The doctor discussed and explained every in great detail
1	My PCP is a doctor for the right reasons. He cares. He has never tried to rush me out or not believe me in describing issues I had.
-1	I had little choice in who s my primary care physician, limited by my insurance.  He has a large caseload and cannot spend the proper time.  Also, he is careless and has often prescribed inappropriate medication that would have harmed me if taken.  Generally shoddy medical practice
-1	I trust him because he is a good person and he has never been wrong in the past. About none of my medical history he is the best.
-1	Because they are in the business of making money and the more sick I am and dependent upon the medication they are giving me, the better for them. I do not believe they truly want me to get well.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician.  I am in reasonably good health with very little by way of health issues.  The last time I needed medical care I was able to go to the local urgent care office.
-1	I feel I must trust a physician.  If I feel something doesn't sound right about treatment, I would question the physician to find out pros and cons.
1	My doctor visits are follow up type that makes it easy to communicate with him any problems that I may be experiencing.my doctor asks me questions as well as I ask him questions.we have open communication which is best for my conditions
-1	I trust the doctors I see enough to keep going to them. I like the health system that I use I think they have really great nurses and doctors and a great reputable hospital. So I will trust them more than distrust
-1	i trust my doctor in y health care because he or she she know what they are doing that is all i have to say
1	He does everything he can to make me healthy!  He provides all my needs and is always there to help!
-1	Distrust as he's not always forthcoming. Had a recent incident which resulted in x-ray and he deliberately misdiagnosed it. Protecting someone.
-1	Some doctors tend to be lazy. Not all doctors can be trusted just because they are doctors. You have to trust them obviously because who else can you trust.
1	she seems to remember all the tiny details of my case. she seems genuinely interested in helping me to feel my best.
1	Ive been going to my doctor for over 2 years and feel very confident when i see her. She makes me feel welcome and cared about
-1	I trust my physician because I have been seeing him for quite a few years now! As er say bedside manners in a dr is a must! Someone who shows you they care & what's best for you!
-1	My doctor tends to think clinically as opposed to holistic. That is, she would rather have take another drug rather than finding a solution that might be more healthy without side effects. 
-1	I don't usually trust doctors to treat patients as individuals, but instead use a one size fits all approach, by which I mean over-issuing prescription medications instead of offering alternative solutions for curing and/or managing health conditions.
1	Doctor dont tell u everything they just trying to get paid just want u to take different medications
-1	My dr. Is ok but I'm not getting anywhere with her I feel like shot all the time and tell her how I feel and it seems like it goes in one ear and out the other without stoping
1	I trust my Dr completely, his communication with me is always good and I have complete confidence in his communication.
-1	Sometimes I feel my doctor does everything by textbook without looking at the whole picture.  For example, she was going completely by BMI without looking at my body type.  I have a LOT of muscle as I work out often.  After examining me she agreed with me.  
1	I have a great trust in my doctor.  He lets me know how things are and if any changes need to be made he explains how and why.
-1	He has prescribed me a medication that could have caused serious harm due to an interaction with another medication I was on, which he knew I was taking. He has also prescribed me a medication that could have prevented me from having more children and did not mention this. He is also not as knowledgeable about my condition as he should be given that he specializes in the area. He works at an office that has incompetent staff across the board. I would use another office if my insurance allowed me to, but unfortunately they are the only option. 
-1	I like my primary care physician, but I don't ever fully trust my healthcare to any one individual. Humans are fallible. I take my physician's advice, but I will separately do my own research and, ultimately, decide for myself and talk it over with my physician. If I disagree with them entirely, I will seek out a doctor that will oversee my care in the best way I see fit. 
-1	When I had a life threatening illness my doctor made sure they monitored my condition  every step of the way.
-1	I DISTRUST SOME DOCTORS THAT I SEE, BECAUSE THAY DON'T TELL THE TRUTH AND I FIND OUT FOR MY SELF AND LET THEM KNOW ABOUT IT.
-1	I like him a lot and think he is good and means well, but he is always in a hurry and lookingâat the computer too much. I think he is overbooked.
-1	"She doesnt take the time to figure out my treatment optionsb she just goes with the first thing she knows. If she doesnt know of an alternative, she says its something i ""have to do"" regardless of negative side effects I've already experienced on that course of treatment. In my own personal reaearch i often discover multiple other avenues of treatment thay may work better for me, but she is unwilling to listen to my concerns."
1	been going to my doctor for 40 years never had any promplems he doeas everyb thing he can to see I get the care I need to stay healthy
-1	I do not have a primary care physician at this time , but my husband and i are in the process of finding one and also going to have physicals done .
1	I have been going to the same Dr for several years and we know each other very well.  If I disagree with him I will tell him, and he knows it.
-1	I've known my doctor for over twelve years. He is well educated and respected by all who know him. He has been in practice for over twenty-five years and is tops in the midwest.
-1	my doctor always listens to what I have to say.  If i have a problem I make sure to let my doctor know.
-1	My Doctor spends a lot of time listening to me which makes me feel as though she truly wants the best for me. However, now and then she writes referrals or orders tests that I never hear about again and had nothing to do with my complaints.
1	My doctor and I have a very strong friendship as well as doctor/patient relationship. She listens to my opinions and thoughts and we make my health decisions together.
1	They are the experts in knowing your conditions and how to treat the conditions. Knowledgeable doctors are the best in knowing what is wrong with you they have to keep up to date with all the medical conditions that are coming up in the world today.
1	She has always been open with me about her feelings and suspicions as well as the eventual official diagnosis. She treats me with respect, and, even though she knows more than me, she doesn't talk down to me when she explains things.
-1	I had a bad doctor, ended up almost dying because we (doctor and I) ignored my health. After getting out of icu, I changed my doctor and my attitude regarding my health. I an now back on track with a doctor who listens and makes me listen! 
-1	My doctor is very nice, she tends to be very caring straightforward, she never holds back information from me. She tends to be worried when I tell her something is wron
1	I've had my current doctor for three years now and he is the best doctor I've ever had. He is thorough in his assessments and is totally trustworthy.
1	My primary physician always gives options for care and leaves the decision up to me after explanations as to why he would suggest one option would be more beneficial than other.
-1	I mostly trust the doctor.   I believe with how the current healthcare system is, that there are unnecessary tests being done to give them extra money.
-1	i have a new dr so i trust her in a general way, don;t really know her. i do trust most dr.s Have had some good ones.
1	I cannot imagine any physician not having a patients best interest.  There are many avenues to go if that is not the case.  
-1	I just started with a new facility for my medical care.  The two doctors I have seen there so far seem to be very nice and helpful.  This is a walk in place, where you see whichever doctor is there, you don't need an appointment.
1	I feel that I can talk to my physician about anything and ask any questions relating to my health or how I feel.
-1	I really don't go to the doctors, but when I did in the past they always treated me with compassion, and patience. 
1	Very knowledgeable. Works for an excellent health system. Great bedside manner and caring. Takes the time to hear and address my concerns.  I don't feel rushed during my appointment.
1	My doctor has been reliable and honest with me.  She does not hesitate to question me when I have not followed her advice
-1	I see a do and not an md because a do treats the whole body and not just the symptoms.  I also see an acupuncturist on a regular basis.
-1	I know that doctors are busy and cannot know the details of every case. So asking questions to get more information can help. I don't think it is intentional, just impossible to have another person who rarely sees me to know what will be best for my life in some situations. 
1	I trust my doctorsâ because they know how to take care of me, take care of my needs and give me the right medicines and care.
-1	I should be able to trust my Dr. I have no reason not to trust them. I have had no problems with any of the Dr.'s I have seen.
-1	She hasn't given me any reason not to trust her. She gives me plenty of her time, answers my questions, is friendly.
-1	my doctor is very through in way he does, he has me come every three months for a check up and to get my meds refilled and every 6 months he does my yearly and checks my blood, urine and checks my prostate
1	I have been with my PCP for several years and I have grown to have more and more trust for him. Since Doctors are people too they can make mistakes or have errors in judgement. The one that graduates at the bottom of their class still gets the same credentials as one who graduates at the top.
-1	First off with my current Dr. I have researched that individual, and have spoken with people that have this particular Dr. as their Primary Care Physician. I check out the reviews online by individuals, and as well as the PCP's background information.
1	I have had my physicial for many years and she is always receptive and explains everything to me in depth. I feel that I could reach out to her whenever needed.
1	My doctor is very thorough, he always listens to everything that I have to say. He also makes sure that no stone is left unturned when it comes to my health.
-1	Sometimes people just look out for their own well being more than others no matter what profession. Also plenty of doctors have been wrong in diagnosing issues I'm having. They mask everything with medicine instead of treating the root cause. 
-1	"Primary care physicians usually are very straight forward with the facts and available treatments, but most are in and out types. Diagnosing the problem quickly without digging very deep into the situation, giving the usual treatment that has worked well for ""most others"" and not thinking whether or not the treatment would be best for you. "
1	I feel my doctor has my best interest in mind and treats me with dignity and respect at all times. I have no complaints about my treatment.
-1	Doctors only care about shoving pills and expensive treatments at their patients.  They care about money and not how to fix issues with patients. 
-1	Trust him because he will find the right medication instead of just giv g one and hoping it will eventually work. He also wants the right dosage and will keep checking to make sure they work
1	i totally trust everyone of my doctors i know that they thinking more about me and my health problems
-1	I personally have had bad experiences with doctors, NPs not listening to what I am telling them. Doctors are constrained by a broken healthcare system, insurance system, so they cannot spend the time with patients, even if they have good intentions. the federal gov. is meddling in the doctor/patient relationship. 
-1	My primary care physcian always seems to care about. He always wants to make sure I'm telling him everything that is bothering me . Mentalliy and physically.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician anymore. I don't really get sick. I just kinda play things by ear and go from there.
1	She explains all my medications are for and what any procedure is for and why. I have trust in her. I can get appointment in between my regular appointments if needed without any problems.
-1	None i trust my doctor pretty well I have been going through the same doctor for years and I'm treated pretty good so far 
1	My primary care person is actually a NP that i have been seeing for years. She gets me, my actual PCP supervises her but does not get me and i am not fond of her bedside manner.
1	He never jumps to conclusions, he will talk to me about what ever it is and do tests if that's what is needed. 
1	I have 4 very close drs that have been actively in my life one for 15 yrs  another for 14 and the other two i believe now 4 yrs. They know my body better than i do. I completely trust all 4 to any descisions may may conclude
-1	I don't trust them as much as I use tro. They do not take the time to learn about you and listen to your concerns it is a joke.
1	He has helped with some of my medical issues when other doctors didn't. He listens well to everything I say and makes you feel comfortable. 
-1	I don't necessarily distrust my physician, but the medical field in general. I don't discredit their knowledge, but don't trust their motives. It's all about money to most medical practices.
1	Doctors and nurses ppl must have full trust in and clinic and hospitals along with billing and paper work 
-1	doctors are paid by number of tests and other billable transactions they can perform on patient.  so they are only interested in increasing the number of tests and unnesessary operations for no health benefit.  need single payer health care
-1	I have had great doctors and I have had bad doctors. It takes research and checking them out before you trust a doctor.
-1	i would hope i can trust my physician, nobody really knows someone 100% so sometimes there is room for doubt
1	I have bene going to him since I was 16 and he has always given me good advice and medicane to amek me better when I have been sick
1	I had a serious medical problem two years ago and my primary care doctor has been great with all the following up that has to be done and have explained everything to me the time.
-1	They don't give me options for any medications or treatments. They also don't go in depth about explaining all of them to me. They only explain the one thing they want me to try.
1	My doctor doesn't try to pressure or shame me into doing anything or taking any medication that he feels I need if I object. He respects my opinion.
1	My doctor allows me to ask questions and help decide the right path for my physical and mental well being
1	I can depend on my provider. I trust that my provider will steer me in the right direction. My provider has never given me at reason to have trust.
-1	I can't really say weather or not I trust my doctor because its usually always different. That's what I think I usually want a 1st 2nd and sometimes 3rd opinion 
1	He takes the time to listen to me thoroughly.  He gives me advice that makes sense and has been proven to be valid and true in the past.  He cares about me (remembers things I have mentioned), and seems genuinely please when things are going well for me.  During one crisis I had about 5 years ago, he called me a few days later to make certain I was all right.
-1	I like him and have known him for 30 years. Not sure I trust him completely but he's pretty good. Needs to spend more than 10 mins. with each person...
-1	He seems to know what he is doing and I rarely see him for anything outside of being sick which I rarely am
1	I have been with my doctor for 15 years.  She is awesome and has made me feel completely comfortable with all of my health care questions and needs.  I travel almost an hour to see her as her practice moved.  I have no qualms about driving that distance because I know I am getting superior health care.
-1	I see a nurse practitioner in a clinic and he always takes time with me, never seems in a rush. Willing to get things tested if I wish, if it's not an urgent matter. 
1	In my lifetime of 79 years I have had no reason to distrust my doctors. I have done research into my choice of physicians and am therefore confident that they are trustworthy.
-1	I do not even have a primary care physician. I have not seen a doctor in years. I am in good health and do not need to visit a physician for any problems. 
-1	Doctors today spend too little time with each patient because they're in a rush to get to the next one. Doctors also hand out prescriptions for medications based on the added income they make for doing so. Its very difficult to rely on and trust the medical community anymore.
-1	Doctors are in it for the money from the health care industry. Doctors do not listen to their patients.  All they want to do is write scripts and not solve problems holistically.
-1	I think that for the most part that doctors do look out for you and want the best for you but I also thing that life gets in the way sometimes and maybe they just want to shuffle you out of the office so they can go home.
1	SHE IS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL RELAXED AND TAKES THE TIME TO ANSWER ALL MY CONCERNS. SHE IS ALSO REACHABLE WHEN I CALL.
-1	I just feel at times I am more of a # than a patient. In and out quickly without always listening to me. I. The past I have had to go to the doctor 3 or 4 times for the same issue before that issue is actually dealt with. That sucks to me.
-1	I think most doctors are trying their best to provide good care but you really need to be your own advocate when it comes to your health. If something  doesn't  feel right or you are not getting better, get a second or even third opinion. 
-1	I trust that he knows what he is doing and that he wants whats best for me and my health. Ive also have never had a problem with my doctor.
1	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because I have been seeing him for a few years of my life. It's been enough time for me to gain my trust.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing my doctor since I was 3 and he has never disappointed me 
-1	they do not listen or read my chart when I tell them something, Its like I tell them and they look at me as if I have two heads
-1	I trust my Primary because we hve been going to him for years as a family and he cares for each of us as if we are his own family. I feel I can talk to him about most anything.
-1	She has always been earnest with me about whatever I when to see her about. She has never beat around the bush when it comes to my health.
-1	I have learned that it is best to watch out for yourself  with the medical field.   Find out all you can about any treatments they suggest.
-1	he takes the time to listen and explore options with me. he listens thoroughly and consults when necessary
-1	doctors dont seem to care like they used to.  They rush thru the appts just to make that money.  They dont listen nor do they act like they care about what you are saying.  
-1	i don't know my primary physician well enough as I never used him more than once a year so I really can't say.  Now that I'm older, I'll use him more
-1	I had a procedure done approximately 1 year ago. It could have been done in office with just a numbing shot. Oh no, the doctor wanted me in the OR with a local . I finally talked her into a spinal  just to shut her up. I am still angry and upset over the bill and the doctor not listening to me
-1	I trust them because I feel like they know what they are doing and how to approach a certain problem. I also trust them because previous treatment have turned out to be good for my problems 
1	He has always took time to listen to my concerns or questions, makes sure he answers and acknowledges everything I say or ask. He always makes sure I know how to contact him via the offices site and e-mail if I have any further questions or concerns.
1	I believe in my doctor and she very thorough and I have confidence in her.  Whenever I hav had a problem she has always been right.  She is very cautious
-1	My doctor is pretty good at being very diligent and listening to me and answering all my questions and exploring all treatment options.
-1	It seems that it depends on what mood she is in..maybe in a hurry at times and doesn't appear to be thorough
1	The reason I trust primary care physician is because because they always explain test, results and procedures in a way that I can understand exactly was is happenings
-1	I don't have a regular primary doctor due to not having health insurance so I see a general based on income doctor when I'm sick.   
-1	I know you lying. I was just aBout to make sure you have to be a good girl. She said she was going to move up there for the summer. I was just aBout to get married. The only way to get my own place in the bed . U can be found in the bed and breakfast in the bed  
-1	he is considerate and open with helping me with my illnesses almost always right and usually gives me choices
-1	I don't necessarily distrust them, but overall they just want the salary and some of them are being paid by pharmaceutical companies for certain drugs 
1	My doctor knows me and understands me.  He cares and is very educated.  He never talks down to me and talks in words that I can understand.
-1	I think doctors try to push too many drugs and don't give alternative and lifestyle treatments that would be better.
-1	I basically go to the doctors once a year and always listen and ask questions of my doctor.  We usually have a good conversation about different things and I walk away learning a new thing or two.
-1	I do trust him, but he is a GP and usually sends me to other people to really do a good physical.  Many things he has me do have all come out clear, yet I have spent a great deal of money doing all of his tests.
-1	My doctor is a good doctor, but her staff is not very responsive to patients needs. She doesn't understand my personal problems as well as she should.
-1	I have not been with my primary care physician for a long time so I can't say that I fully trust him at this time.
-1	i trust her because she always listens to me and helps me out all the time makes sure that i feel safe and any test i want done or need done she does it i like it its nice 
-1	I trust my primary care physician to try to do what is best for me. However I realize he may be constrained by insurance restrictions or influence by drug manufactures.
-1	I often feel the doctor chooses treatments based on my level of insurance coverage rather than what might be best for me. I often feel the doctor is more interested in prescribing drugs for which the pharmaceutical reps have given incentives, even though I might not need them.
1	My primary care physician does not make recommendations lightly and explains decisions carefully. He listens to my concerns.
1	I see a resident doctor that practices in a family clinic.  My doctor is supervised by experienced physicians.  I trust my doctor because she listens well.  She has supervision regarding her treatment decisions.  In addition, I have net some of her supervisors
-1	I don't really feel either, i don't know them enough but they do help if i need it.  they can guide me but don't just give me all the answers, and they have ok ratings.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been the whole family doctor and has been treating me since birth also has answered all questions i've ever had bout me and my family members
-1	I don't know how you feel better soon to be the best for you and your mom is the best ot your life for the rest is just the way I can see the point in time for me today 
1	Because I've been seeing him for years and I haven't had a any problems, He's good and professional 
-1	All doctors treat you for symptoms you dont need medical attention for. They get a kick from certain medications, so they convince you to take it. We have proven it. A doctor told (Ã) to take (said medication), and (+) didnt take it, and after 6 months, there was no difference.     I only take mine when I need to.
-1	I trust her and ask questions as I need to about health issues or concerns. I can ask questions about different medications or choices that I have   
1	My doctor listens to me and explains test results clearly. If I have any questions he takes the time to answer them. He doesn't rush through anything.
-1	I ask a lot of questions about my health and usually am given the straight facts by my doctor. If I don't get the best answers I always ask for a second opinion. My doctor has been very upfront and completely honest with me on anything that we discuss.
1	"I've dealt with a heart issue since I was 8 yrs old. Had a major ""episode"" almost 3 years ago & my current PCP has been very open about theories, treatments, test results & options. He has listened to my questions/concerns as well as let me participate in my care as far as refusing or suggesting a similar or different course."
-1	My Dr. doesn't isten . He just gets in and out as fast as he can. I don't think he even really cares I am just more money to him. Ireally get upset. I wish he would take more time to pinpoint what is going on.
1	I have a great relationship with my doctor.  I trust him completely for my care.  He does a great job.  I would listen to his advice and suggestions. 
1	She listens to what I have to say and asks questions rather than jump to conclusions.  She also checks up with me yo see if the treatment we decided on us working or not, or hiw a consult with another doctor went.  She has never been dismissive of any issue I've gone to her with.  I feel that she honestly cares for my health.  
-1	I do not completely trust my doctors because I don't have a primary care physician and I see different doctors when I go to the doctor.
1	It is his job to give his patients the best care and treatment. If not, he could be sued, and could potentially lose his license 
1	I one-hundred percent trust my primary care physician as well as all of the employees at the practice I visit. He has done an excellent job at helping me maintain my health this fas. 
1	I feel like I can trust my doctor because he sees you as a person and not just getting some kind of money benefit from his patients and cares for each one no matter who they are or the financial differences. He shows respect and trays to make everyone comftorable and like a friend.
-1	I trust my doctor because I've had the same doctor since I've been born. I have the same doctor that helped my mom give birth to me 
-1	They don't always take my concerns into account. They are in a hurry to get me out of the office a lot of the time 
1	He is friendly and really interested in what you have to say and is never hurried when speaking and treating me,   He diagnosed my wife's condition just by looking at her after several other doctors had no idea what her medical problem was.
-1	I recently had to switch primaries and she isn't as easy to talk to nor as thorough. I always feel rushed when I see her
1	Have been a patient for 18 years, he has never steered me wrong yet. He is very dedicated and thorough with me, taking his time with me at my scheduled appointments. I even have his cell phone number in case of an emergency.
-1	My PCP is associated with a family practice facility that trains family practice physicians.  He is attentive and represents what I would expect of a family practice physician.
-1	Doctors are good for diagnoses, but prescribing medication is one thing I do not trust doctors in this area. I believe medications are prescribed for the doctors benefit, not the patient.
1	He knows a lot more than I do. With over twenty years of schooling who am I to dispute what is told, I do some reaseaech but for the most part believe in my doctor. I can always get second opinions of not totally sure. 
1	I trust her because she is a very good peron.  She tries to do her best at all times.  The small lack of confidence I  might have relates to her overlooking something or being pressed for time.
-1	I feel like my primary care doctor has a lot to accomplish by stating what might be wrong with me but also feel like they are just doing their job 
1	I trust my mental and physical doctors as they seem very concerned and helpful, even tho I may not agree with them., I feel they are straight forward with me and my problems
-1	I haven't been seeing him long enough to completey trust him.  I had a doctor before him who I thoroughly trusted but she left.
-1	I have had alot of experience in dealing with doctors because I took care of my ageing parents. I do know that sometimes doctors do whats easy for them and they look at the ageing elderly as if their life is almost over anyway. For that reason and others I dont truely trust every word my doctor tells me. I get second opinions first.
1	My doctor usually takes plenty of time to talk about my concerns; I almost never feel rushed. She is kind, concerned and considerate
-1	I trust doctors to a point. However I feel that they do not always listen and just generalize your condition. They lump you in with other patients they have experience with
1	I've been going to see him a long time and he tells me the truth...even when it's hard to hear.  He never spares my feelings and always shoots straight with me.  I really appreciate it and trust everything he says.
-1	I guess I was always raised to have the utmost respect and trust in my primary doctor. they have never given me any reason to distrust them. I feel very comfortable with their opinion on all things .
-1	I trust them a little but often feel they want to rush to get to next patient and not focus on me 100%  or learn all there is about my situation
-1	My primary care physician seems inexperienced and doesn't give an educated opinion of my symptoms. She doesn't ask many questions of give helpful solutions to my medical problems.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She seems to know her stuff and has a good bedside manner. She is always there to answer any questions or concerns that I may have.  
1	because he has not steered me wrong and has treated for years. Furthermore, he has sent to me to several specialist who were both professional and excellent doctors as well. He carefully explains any medication changes that he makes and why he is making them, and he listens to me.
1	I recently switched physicians and have found a truly remarkable one who actually listens to me and works with me
1	Because honesty trusworthy, down to earth easy to speak to and explains in a eay to understand. Easy to lean from
1	My doctor has never given me false or misleading information. He's always been straight forward with me, even when he knows there are things I should change but probably won't. 
-1	I trust her because I know that she listens to me and what I have to say. However I don't think that she agrees with my diagnosis of Fibromyalgia, which was diagnosed long before she became my doctor, and so I feel she does not really believe the pain that I am in. She also seems to be always looking for another reason for my pains. Which I have been through numerous times with other doctors. So I don't always trust her to believe me. 
1	There should be a general patient to doctor relationshipâ, to where I can trust them and to where they can trust me. If I can not trust this doctor I have to find one I can trust. Mistrust can result in my life ending so I prefer to go to a doctor I can trust with my life.
1	When I was 41 yr. old I had a severe asthma episode.  I had never had asthma before and I almost died.  The Dr. the ER called in saved my life then and I had him as my doctor for many years and had me on meds that controlled the asthma.  More recently I have had other doctors and have been treated well; have had questions answered; been given meds that did what they were supposed to do.
-1	My doctor just hurries through the appointment and does not really listen to me especially about woman problems and he just does not understand or know how to fix them.
-1	I generally trust doctors, but also have some degree of skepticism and will ask questions of medical providers until satisfied with the answers I have received.
-1	i view my doctor a partner in giving me the best advice from their professional point of view, but at the end it's really my decision to make
-1	My doctor is friendly and sincere, but more and more she seems a bit hurried in getting me in and out. I still generally trust her, but would appreciate more time or discussion
-1	Doctors are only as knowledgeable as they are taught and what is told to them by the pharmacy industry. 
-1	I someti,es feel that my best interests are not met. I feel like the dr is doing things that require me to have to spend more versus dealing with the issue at hand.
-1	My primary care physician is very intelligent and knowledgeable.  However their are conditions that he does not know the details of and when questioned he dismisses concern.  He is not likely to discuss emotional reactions to anything.  That is fine with me but he has patients that are upset about that aspect.  He is very clinical.  He trusts lab tests for most everything.  I trust him but wish her was a little more curious about symptoms.  It is possibly an age thing as he is ready to retire.
1	I have been with my primary care physician for almost 20 years.  He discusses everything with me and utilizes my input into treatment plans.
-1	I trust my doctor to do his job and explain my medical options. It's not his job to decide for me, so I wouldn't take his recommendations automatically.
1	He's a great guy that truly wants me to be as healthy as I can. I swear he wants me to live to 150, happily, healthy, and active.
-1	My doctor explains my condition with good verbal skills and help me understand his medications and the way to take them and how to use them.
-1	I feel like my doctor is quick to prescribe something for my condition without fully testing me or suggesting natural methods or cures. 
-1	For the most part, I feel that they are most knowlegeable about medicine. I have no reason not to trust their judgement for most health information.
1	He takes time with me, listens to me and is very responsive and honest.  He is caring and personable, easy to talk to.  
1	I have been with my primary care doctor for 11 years.  I trust his decisions where my healthy is concerned and he has been right on.
-1	My doctor is new so I don't really know her that well.  I will however put trust into her degree. She belongs to a good insurance organization also. 
-1	I trust that they know what they're doing, but sometimes it seems they are trying to rush you in and out because they have other people to treat 
-1	He is local and easy to get a appointment and he takes time to listen to me and knows my history and plans my treatment according ly
1	My doctor thoroughly explains procedures and options I may have, helping me make the best choice.  She patiently answers all my questions.  She consults with specialists I see to be sure that her treatment will not interfere with theirs.
-1	I trust that my doctor tries to do well by me.  However, I think sometimes she is in too big a hurry or is distracted.  I can not trust her completely because she is only human and can make mistakes.  I have to take responsibility for my own health.
1	I trust him completely.  He has never given me reason not to trust him.  He takes as much time as needed with me when I visit.
-1	my main dr is a va dr. I trust her for the present time. sometimes I feel that she is just searching for a problem and a cure. but overall I am pleased with what she has done.
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because she is so thorough at each visit.  She really listens to me intently.  I never feel like she is in a hurry.  After she addresses what issues I came for, she always ask how I have been.
-1	My primary care physician is a local p/a but is not afraid to refer me to specialists in larger cities as necessary
-1	In the 1950's a medical career was a vocation of helping others despite the fact that it paid much more in respect than money. By the late 1960's medical school had become a hard, but sure way to wealth. Too many are focused on the payoff today. 
1	I trust my doctor because he listens and is open to what I have to say or suggest. He also is very good at explaining things and various options available for whatever I may need. (for example: medication options) 
-1	I trust my primary doctor, due to a length of time with him and believe he is honest . I would hope my doctor is honest with myself, and all his patients, when it comes to my health and others health.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to her for a while and she has always taken good care of me and always been honest and upfront with me about things.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been a patient for over 30 years. I respect my doctor in providing good care towards me.
-1	for the most part I trust my various drs, and follow their recommendations. however when it comes to taking prescription medications, I am reluctant to add any to the ones I already take, and feel that sometimes drs are too ready to pull out the rx pad.
1	Good communication is a must with your doctor. Mine is a very relaxed and sincere man.  He gives me his attention and takes his time to make sure everything is clear and that I have no questions.  He explains everything fully and has a game plan for how to proceed forward, and I love that about him.
-1	i trust my doctor because he has never been wrong or told me anything just to get money out of me, he is a very honest and caring doctor
1	I have had my primary doctor for 26 years and he always does what is in my best interest. He always explains why he is giving me the prescription,
-1	i have only met my primary care physician once. i do not tend to trust most people so doctors are no exception to that rule.
-1	I think most doctors are in it just for the money I take their advice with a grain of salt and research stuff on my own...I have been given wrong advice often and wrong diagnosis more then once
1	I trust my doctor because I have not found anything to distrust them about. I understand what he tells me and it always seems to fit with what diagnosis he has for me. I make sure to look up things and learn about them and nothing has ever raised my suspicions that my doctor is wrong or way of base.
1	My primary care physician has never done anything to cause me to distrust him. Every time I've needed assistance I've been met with high quality service and solutions.
-1	They are self serving like all humans, which means they can't be trusted. This is true for any given example involving humans and trust. However, individuals can be trusted. The problem is there are too many doctors and not enough caring people. Doctors want to line their pockets in gold and caring people want to actually help. Unfortunately, there are little to no caring people left in this world. Doctors sign up knowing the work will he hard, then when they actually see it is difficult, they just give up and turn into worthless meat sacks like everyone else. They commit themselves to a life a servitude then do nothing of the sort. They are profoundly hypocritical in most aspects, and far too lazy to truth know how to, or be able, to help. Doctors are worthless in our society. Until I actually see one personally that is willing to deal with the rabble and listen to my personal, legitimate problems as just that, I will never trust, nor respect those morons. 
-1	because i trust my primary care physician and i have complete trust in my doctor. My doctor is totally honest
1	I trust my doctor thouroughly. She let's me know what works and doesn't work. She is truly intetested in me as a patient and her nurses have called after a sick visit to see how I'm doing. She's awesome. 
-1	for the most part I trust some of my doctors.  I don't have a primary care physician but I have other doctors I see regularly.
1	I trust her, but so far she's been fine. I was diagnosed with Diabetes 5 years ago, and then my doctor retired and I started with this doctor. I lost 55 pounds on my own and she took me lots of my meds including Alendronate because I was on it for 10 years. My osteoporosis didn't get better, but stayed the same then I hurt my back and they found two fractures, so she put me back on it. She also doesn't check for A1C because no diabetes anymore. So I trust her, but really doesn't check a lot of things.
-1	Somties we must make hard decisions and know what is best for our health and i dont think a physician has all the awnsers
1	I sometimes research my doctor's suggestion.  It seems like when I do, I ask him more questions.  I do not disagree with him very much.
-1	I strongly consider their opionions but dont necessarily trust them. Some doctors force their bias on patients amd are sometimes inpatient and rude. 
1	because everytime i have went in to see him for anything he has always been concerned and always explains everything i ask him
1	I've known him since I was a kid. He's been my family and personal doctor for over 30 years and I trust him. He's helped me through quite a few issues and struggles.
-1	I do not trust doctors at all it seems there thing is to give a pill for a pill and this side effect will outweigh this side effect
1	Because he was my student in high school; I know him well; we have a strong bond and I know that he would not tell me to do anything that he wouldn't tell his own parents.
-1	he tells me everything needed for each visit why and the whats in very detailed and common English which is very easy to under stand
-1	My primary care doctor has a good bedside manner,she's very thorough when she explains everything to me.She tells me what she thinks I need or don't need for my care.
-1	My doctor only sees me as an obese ugly woman and only wants to get to the next patient.  Doesn't see me as a person but only $$$ signs
1	My doctor  is a do.She is there first do primary care doctor I have had. She is  more holistic in her approach to patient care. I like that.
-1	I've been with my doctor for 10 years and I trust her and I'm very healthy person so I tend to only see her once a year 
-1	The doctors I see now are always open and up front with me about the treatment I am receiving. Because of this, I trust their judgement in making a diagnosis and the possible treatment(s).
-1	She spends more than 5 minutes during appts and seems to listen when I have problems or issues that need addresses
-1	I trust my PCP as I have been seeing her more than ten years and she has helped me through a number of illnesses, chronic and other. 
1	I have been with my doctor for a long time. If he doesn't know the answer to my question he will find out for me. He is very caring and attentive towards me about my problems.
1	I have know my doctor for a long time. I trust what he does. He looks after my best intrests and takes care of me. 
-1	I think a lot of doctors these days, especially young ones, are not that concerned with taking the time need to solve a medical problem. They want to take the easy course, get paid and move on to the next patient.
-1	they have always been honest with me and take care of me all i have to do is call them and they will work me in
-1	I don't have a regular physician at the moment but when I do I stick with one who I feel is great at their job
-1	I trust that my doctor has my best interests at heart. I have often had many questions and my doctor always had time to answer them and give me as many options as I needed to make health decisions.
1	I trust my doctor a lot because she's the one with the degree and not me. She knows what she's doing and I trust her because she hasn't given me a reason not to.
-1	I have been going to my family practice for over ten years. I am very comfortable with the doctors, nurses, and aides working there. They take the time needed with me, listen to all my concerns and answer all my questions, and will offer me additional options if need be.
1	 All my doctors have always given me competent information and competent care. I trust them very much.
-1	These days I feel that doctors care (with some exceptions) more about their bottom line than their patients.  Not so long ago I believed everything that my doctors would tell me but not any longer.  I was particularly miffed when a former orthopedist had no clue as to how to help me after I fractured my hip and got really upset when I sought a second opinion and had the other doctor operate on me.
-1	I tend to trust my physician inasmuch as he knows me for nearly 30 years and I know him well enough to know when I'm getting short shrift.
-1	It seems to me that most if not all doters are working for pharmsudical companies to try new drugs on unsuspecting patients,which seldom works on individual people rather than the majority
1	I go to my GP with a concern about something, and even if she doesn't think that is what is happening, she will still follow through in checking herself, or else she will give me a referral to a physician that can give me peace.  Every specialist I have from her referrals has been just as interested, and just as careful to handle my concerns as my primary.
1	I've seen the same person for several years and we have developed a rapport with each other. I trust her to tell me the truth.
-1	I go in his office and he asks me how I am doing and looks at the lap top to see what is going on and says a few words and then says I will see you in 6 months. I keep him just for my medications.
1	My previous Doctor took time to explain everything to me. I never felt rushed. He knew my medical condition and always provided me with the latest and best treatment for me. 
1	He is the best in his field! He's very caring and has a great bedside manner. He's open and honest with me. He talks through things with me and I can page him when/if I need him. 
-1	M doctor is big on test results but not as good as chatting about life. He is getting better. I talk with him more each time, and tell him what I need.
-1	I don't necessarily trust physician's opinions a hundred percent of the time because they can be wrong like anyone else. One physician is just one person's opinion. 
-1	I live in a unsafe environment very sure that with the president. We can't trust anybody because it has come to that decision when it's one for all and all for ine
-1	I trust him because he's a good guy and he's kind and smart. I really like him a lot and he's good. Nothing else
1	Relates well personally and spends time talking and suggesting best care.  History of experience in their medical speciality.
1	So far nothing has happened to encourage me to distrust my primary care physician.  To be honest, there are very few primary care physician's that I have ever distrusted.
-1	I have many issues because of my Lupus diagnosis. Therefore I listen to my Doctor as well as listen to my body. I believe that my being well informed helps my relationship with my doctor.
-1	I trust my doctor based on her reputation and referrals.  but have not been with them long enough to build that trust on a long term basis.
-1	I do not see a primary care physician. I prefer holistic medicine, ie. natural or herbal medications, essential oils & studying changes in diet to aid in healing the body naturally. Our bodies were created to heal themselves. The use of synthetic medications tend to cause other physical side effects. They focus on the symptoms rather than the root problem causing the symptoms.
-1	I trust my doctor because its his job to know how to treat his patients but i think he could be more thorough and listen more.
1	I have only been going to him for 6 months but his dad has been a doctor in town for 30 years. He seems to be caring, knowledgeable and a good listener.
-1	my doctor is head of Neurology at a very large and well known teaching hospital in Alabama. My doctor has operated on my brain and I can still walk and talk but I am blind and deaf on my right side. I would rather be blind/deaf on one side than be paralyzed. I had a brain tumor and one doctor wanted to remove 100% which would have resulted in me being paralyzed. Thanks to my Mom's knowledge, I switched hospitals and neurosurgeons and I am not paralyzed. I do have 20% of tumor wrapped around my brainstem but 80% of tumor was removed by my current doctor
1	I have had the same primary care dr for 30 years. His background is much like mine and he is excellent.i trust him implicitly.
-1	The Primary Care Physician I have right now I trust very much, but she is leaving her practice and has not informed any patience as of yet. I am afraid of finding a new one Because my previous physican gave me a hard time helping me manage a medical condition
1	i trust my LNP greatly, she recently listened to me and wrote me a RX for an Ultrasound. We discovered my gall bladder was full of sludge(pre stone condition) , I now cann look forward to finally some relief. 
1	I trust my care provider she has been very understanding and very helpful with my needs she has also called my house with different concerns which is unusual for doctors to do nowadays
1	He is extremely careful and asks many questions. He has always been very inquisitive and helped me understand my thyroid problem.
-1	he knows what is best for me  they care about what happens to people because of their health. Doctors care I believe
1	    I trust my family doctor completely because he is thorough and complete in ALL of his medical dealings with me. He answers my questions and asks me questions too. If I need a specialist, he knows which ones are better than average and will tell me who to see.
1	I recently had a serious leg injury and surgery and she has been in contact with me almost daily to check on me and make sure I have what I need to get better.  She also makes sure that I am doing the things I need to do for the rehab of my knee and wrist to get full function back.
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part and he does spend time with me when I have questions.  If he does not have answers to my questions about a specific problem, he would send me to a specialist.
-1	I trust my doctor in regards to being thorough with my medical needs but he has hundreds of patients so sometimes it feels like I'm not getting his total attention.
1	I trust my doctor because he discusses things candidly and in ways I can understand. He always answers any questions and takes my wants into consideration. He is open to exploring any treatments that might benefit me and is honest about side effects and reasons why or why not something may be a good idea. 
-1	I don't trust doctors because when I had my son they gave me to much blood pressure meds, which cause my blood pressure to drop uncomtrolably with out stoping so much to the point where I need oxygen 
1	I trust my primary care physicians because they are honest & upfront with me. They don't tell me what I want to hear.
1	My physician takes his time in examining any problems mental or physically. He will provide accurate detailed information to in which once after the visit, you're more aware of your body especially on things that you didn't know.
-1	Because every Dr I been too has mix diagnosed me,missed broken ribs,an tell u anything an think u are drug seeking. But don't care if you are actually in pain or sick
-1	I think she has so many patients so I feel like a number. I also thinl she wants to prescribe certain medications. I assume rhere are kickbacks 
-1	I do trust what the doctor has to say almost all the time. If it is something pricey and serious, I will get a second opinion.
1	My primary care physician spends a lot of time with me.  He has even come in on his day off to see me.  He listens to my opinions, respects them, and is open in discussing issues with me.
1	he is willing to work with me and try other ways instead of adding more medicine that would be more harmful then helpful
1	I basically trust doctors because they have more knowledge than I do. I do not completely trust anyone.  If my doctor says or suggests something I do not agree on I will question her. If I ever feel I can't trust my doctor I will find a new doctor
1	My doctors are very aware of my physical circumstances and listen to any objections I have. We agree together as to what is needed. If I have an objection, they willingly listen to me and change things.
1	this is a get one for me.being going for a long time.i like very much.he is the best one for me.that is why i go to him.
1	we have had a close realationship for the past 8 years and he spends the time nessecary to make sure i understand all my opitions when it comes to any problems i have and the treatments available for me
-1	I generally trust medical professionals, but I know that they are also humans with their own self-interests.
-1	I am neutral about whether I trust or distrust doctors because there are many factors involved. You sometimes have to see different doctors and the circumstances are different for each one. 
1	I have been with him for over 10 years and we have developed a trust. If I had to find a new doctor, I would have a hard time finding one that I have the same kinds of relationship with.
1	In addition to a primary care physician, I also have many specialists and sub-specialists.  I find my primary-care physician works well with these other doctors to ensure positive outcomes.
-1	i trust him because he's a physicaian in the professional and medical field,he,s never steered me in the wrong direction that i can prove if anything to prove he is a kindhearted peson and really cares about his patients
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for 13 years, we have the same medical condition so we have a great repore.
-1	My primary is kind and caring.  She is also educated and thorough in her practices.  She makes me and my opinions matter.
-1	My doctor has a lot of patients so she has to see them all she might miss something I need medically 
-1	i have little trust in doctors.I have had to fire them because of their care less and evil verbal abuse.When give detailed testing procedures I had to refuse the action as it was a sure failure and would spread the current infection.I was offered perscriptions that were incorrect.I knew what would work but the doctor did not know for one month.Had I not been able to deal with the infection I would lost a life.
1	I have been with them for years and they have a great practice and have never made me second guess anything that they have done. I actually need to go back.
-1	He does take the time to pay attention to me and answer my questions.  He is about ready to retire and I am saddened about that.  These EHR mandates are a source of trouble for him
-1	I have been with my doctor fer a lot of years as well as he was my fathers doctor. He is more then competent as well as being a trusted source of medical needs and advice.
1	I have no reason not to trust my physicians. They have always given me information that is thorough and thoughtful.
-1	I've known him a long time and he usually answers all of my questions honestly and truthfully. He is always available when I need him.
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I don't feel like I can trust any doctor after previous experiences with bad doctors. However, I feel like my doctor genuinely wants to help me and cares about what happens to me, I just don't think they always tell me what my best option of treatment is all the time, etc.
-1	To be honest, I haven't been to a primary care physician in many many year.  If I did go see one, I would have a great deal of trust. 
-1	My primary care doctor has changed 3 times in the last year.  I totally trust my gynecologist and cardiologist.  Sometimes doctors want to charge insurance companies for additional testing.  Sometimes they don't want to tell you that you should maybe see a different specialist.

1	always trust my doctor all the time and he totally helps me take care of myself and my family all the time

1	I completely trust my primary care because I left his practice for 1 year many years ago and I got very sick. And the new doctor could not help me.. I went back to him and stayed and told him I would not leave again. It been over 25 years.
-1	Often times its feels as if the primary care physicians, allergists, and other doctors will sometimes make things worse than what they really are at the time. Sometimes it is like they want the patient to spend more money out of pocket and constantly come back for nothing.

-1	I feel that my doctor is completely up front and honest in all aspects that I deal with him. he has a very good reputation.

-1	I have been having some health issues and they are not really sure what is wrong with me.  We are testing multiple theories but it is frustrating 
-1	Doctors like my primary care physician are mostly thinking about the pharmaceutical companies and the bonuses they get while masking the problems and side effects as care to their patients.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because my mother used the same one. Also, my physician is caring, kind and considerate to me when I visit. 
1	i have a long term relationship with my doctor and can talk frankly with him. we un derstand each other and he knows my history very well

1	I hadn't seen a doctor in many years when I found my current one, and she has always been upfront and forthright with me about my medical conditions, She has helped me get used to the medications I have to take, always explains why I'm getting them and always answers all my questions to my satisfaction
1	I started going to a new doctor since we moved. He is very gentle & kind. I had to have tests done, it didn't take long for him to call me with the results. 
-1	I think he has my best interests at heart, although he appears to be overworked with the number of patients he sees (Veterans Admin).
-1	Just started going to this doctor and haven't established a relationship between us yet.Therefore I need to get a feel for my new primary care physician
-1	My doctor does not always take time when I see him.  He hardly spends time with me. That is all I have to say.
1	I have been told by another doctor that my doctor is one of the best in his field, which is a great complement. When one course of action comes to a halt, he always has another course of action to take.
1	She is knowledgeable about medical issues in general and thorough in individual treatment plans. She also very caring and personable which puts me at ease.
1	Doctors are humans, and make mistakes.   Patients are individuals, and not a one fit works for all of us.   What may work perfectly for others, may be an awful thing for me.   
-1	My doctor was going to give Zoloft to my husband for anxiety knowing that he has heart problems. She also wants me on pain management and I don't want to do that. 
1	Doctor  John Smith in Springfield is my doctor. He is the kindest and considerate person I have ever had as a doctor. The one I had before was Jane Doe, she was mean rude and could care less about me. She should never have become a doctor. She hates people, I was not the only person that she mistreated.
-1	I have moved to colo. So I have not found a primary doctor yet. The doctor I had in Michigan I completely trusted. They helped me control my asthma. 
1	I'm neutral about some docters and physicians. They can tell you what they think is goo for you but then things can turn out to be bad for you. For instant my wife had high blood pressure. Her blood pressure is always high and she is on medication. They have switched her medicine about 4 times saying that the next one will help, which neither one has helped. I don't that everything they say and everything they supply to you. 
1	He just makes me feel like he cares a lot about me.  He is very caring and attentive to any of my concerns.
-1	I don't have a regular doctor at all I don't have health insurance so if I get sick or something I have to go to the emergency room
-1	I believe sometimes a doctor will persuade you into what they think should happen or their beliefs. They don't always look at it as your way of thinking just what they've been taught and learned. They also aren't alway as compassionate about and undertanding about the way you feel they do things every day and some doctors loose their passion for their work and it becomes just a pay check.
-1	"I believe that doctors in general are not always up front with patients concerning medical conditions. Too often doctors try to "" sugar coat"" the facts, when in reality, most would rather NOT be given false information and false hope"
1	My doctor is ethical is her behavior. I have witnessed her bedside manner and he skills in action. Her patients and colleagues admire her. 
-1	I trust my doctor to give me the best advice about my health. I also feel most doctors are somewhat out to make a extra buck.

1	My Doctor, OBGYN, has been my doctor for over 15 years and he's the best. He diagnosed my cancer and re moved it as well. I've been cancer free for 5 years. 
-1	The medical field as a whole is unreliable and the drug industry is completely untrustworthy which makes the doc harder to trust because drug reps coerce them into pushing their drugs even tho another drug would be much bettet

-1	i believe s9ome doctors do care of about, but others just want money and want to get you in and out. its good to always get different opinions
-1	They too are not perfect and sometimes have a chance of not getting it right. But for the most part i trust their judgement
-1	I feel like I can't trust my primary care physicians completely because sometimes I feel like they do what is more convenient for them and don't put my needs as a patient first which is what I believe should happen, they don't tell all the side effects to a medication and some may not even know all the side effects. It's best in my opinion to go out and do my own research before trying anything just because I feel like most doctors really at the end of the day care about making money more than their patients health
1	Sometimes they can be telling you the truth. But sometimes they can be telling you lie. So you have to reach it frist.
1	I trust my doctor because when he is with me he is force on me, he listen to what I am saying and take action about what I am saying. 
1	I have never had a problem with my doctor.  They explain my medications and recommend new ones if never.  To date they have been right on the button and I don't have mother negative about them.
-1	Presently, I don't have health insurance  but it depends on my health needs. Or if, success has been accomplished after first visit. It depends what type doctor, too. I have issues & experienced certain problems related to my health for being neutral. Those experiences effect how I think, & causes some doubt about whether I am getting proper care. I know, I am responsible for my well-being, my understanding about why my body malfunction but need the assistance of others when in need. If, a medication is producing ill effects or too much is given. When, I am in control, I stop immediately & I don't take. Once the wrong thing has been administered it maybe to late. We all have our needs, & we may have same things. But body function differently when taken, the understanding.

1	He has not been wrong about anything yet. Therefore I will continue to trust him. If there was ever an instance where he was wrong then maybe we will start to have trust issues.
1	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because he takes the time to listen to my questions and the information that I share regarding how I am feeling.  He is very concerned and elicits my input when attempting to understand my health concers.
-1	I don't trust a lot of doctors. Not all doctors in medical field are there for patient health, just money for lining their pockets. Not for well being of patients.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she's confident and sure in what she's saying no feeling as if she lost or don't know what to do

-1	 I have been going to the same care physician since I was a little kid. I just most recently stopped going to them because I am now too old. So I always trusted his judgment because I have pretty much known him my whole life.  I also trust my new doctor because he is a doctor and that is his job 
-1	I don't trust them because They only prescribe medication as treatment and only see you briefly. I trust them because they know more than me and they are supposed to be concerned about my health 
-1	I feel like all doctors are there first for the income and second for the health of the people. It's kind of hard to tell whether or not a doctor really cares about your well being or they just tell you anything to get you out of the way.
1	i trust mine because she knows her stuff and she has progressed my health much more than before. she has the knowledge to tell me truthfully whats right  from whats wrong
-1	My doctor appears to be genuinely concerned about my well-being based on their mannerism. They are always open to suggestions and takes the time and effort to answer my questions and clear up any confusions I might have.
-1	I have trust to a certain extent, in doctors generally...never been misdiagnosed or anything. I have sought out second opinions. Most doctors encouraged you do do so, if they are trustworthy.
-1	I generally trust doctors to offer their best insights based on their knowledge and experience, which far surpasses mine as it relates to general health concerns. So I am open-minded enough to entertain any advice they offer. However, I'm also assertive enough to make my own thoughts and questions known so that together, hopefully, we determine the best plan for my personal health. 
1	I trust my doctor because he knows all the right meds I should be on and what I should do and not do . He always answers all my questions I have and makes sure I am always okay .

-1	I am not in trust with doctors cause they're always changing doctors everyday is not getting close to any doctor if themes a new one the next time u go.
-1	It's easy to communicate with my doctor and he talks to me using words I would understand and if neededâ I would be able to to tell it to someone else
-1	Some doctors are good and some are not so good. They are just in it for the money. I really wish there were better doctors. 
-1	In general all human beings (including physicians) share a margin of error potential.  Therefore, I do not blindly place explicit trust in any person.  It is important for all consumers who are able to act as their own advocate to assume this responsibility. Second opinions and thorough research should be considerations used to influence these personal decisions.
1	I have had the same doctor since i was little. My kids go to the same doctor. I trust the Urgent care centers in case of emergency

1	She is always listening to me and showing concerns when I talk to her about what's going on in my life whether it's about my mental or physical health.
-1	They've invested a lot of time and money to stand where they're standing. why wasted that time if you cant be trusted because in the long run your going to get exposed.
-1	I do have a primary care doctor, and generally I trust his advice but sometimes doubt that he is giving me all the information I need about certain situations.
-1	in 1998 a Dr said I had breast cancer.  He cut my breast off and took out 11 lymphnodes   He got the records mixed up and gave me surgery for someone with stage 4 cancer.  I now have immune system problems and lymphodemia.  He gave me 5 years to live.  Before this the Dr was always right.  I approach Dr's like I do Medicine, with caution.  Only if I really, really need it.  
-1	With all the schooling and expenses doctors have to pay in medical school I would hope they enjoy what they are doing. I trust my doctor because that is their profession and I feel comfortable with their decisions 
1	I trust my doctor because when I tell her what problems im having she'll tell me what medication could be the problem and have me reduce it or take me off of it and i no longer have that problem 
-1	I mostly trust my PCP. The only bad thing is I feel rushed. Which also makes me feel like she doesn't care. But she does try to find me help through other doctors or whatever is wrong with me. She does ask me questions that I don't even think to ask her. She seems to want to cure me quickly .
-1	I have not been given any reason not to trust my physician. She is willing to hear my concerns and prescribe necessary medication based on her assessment of what is wrong.
-1	I think that with any doctor I will have some distrust from their patients, because its a money making business. I think that how much income a doctor generates definitely has an impact on the amount care that the doctor provides. I personally often have these distrusting feelings but I also have no problem asking questions for clarification.  I will object to something that I disagree with and I will go else where for treatment.

-1	Well doctors are humans as well, and they make mistakes, which is why I have a general neutral stance when it comes to doctors. I believe they do what's right for the most part, but it's possible they're forgetful as well.
-1	I trust my doctor because she's always looking out for me and she now also is my child's doctor and I trust her completely with him as I do myself.

1	I went through a few doctors before my current doctor. So I have a lot of confidence in both my doctors, I have to see a neurologist and my primary doctor.  The first neurologist actually admitted to me that she didn't know much about my condition so therefore I had no confidence in her at all.
-1	I trust my doctor to an extend, but I think it's always important to do research on conditions for yourself and God third party medical opinions as well.
-1	I kinda both distrust and trust. But the reason why i distrust is because i feel like they dont want to actually look into the problem. its like they have to diagnois you with something even its wrong. and then on to the next person. its like they have so many people that they dont really care about whats happening with you.

-1	I trust them with as much information technology provides for them.However,I believe they are not God and his has the last say over my life
-1	Some doctors do care about their patient's welfare, however other doctors just see dollar signs on the patient's forehead and are just working for money to go on vacations. 
-1	They are honest and helpful. In a human level they give you tips on what is right for you.i feel they break down the good and the bad of your health situation in a way that makes you think. Other times they try to hard or not enough to be on your side. You can tell if you trust or distrust by personality.

1	HE IS KIND AND HELPFUL AND BEEN WITH HIM FOR OVER 15 YEARS. I HAVE TO SAY I'M STICKING WITH HIM.I GENERALLY FOUND DOCTORS TO BE DELIGENT AND TRUSTHWORTHY IN THEIR PROFESSION. MOST PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT THIS FACT I BELIEVE.
-1	I trust my condition but some of my condition can't just be cured it will take alot of money to fix all the problems I have and the work that's cut out for me
-1	I rarely go to the doctor, so it is hard to answer this question. I mean what else am I suppose to say in this

-1	I trust my doctor to s point but when I'm recommended medicines that I know I don't need I feel as if I can't trust him.
-1	There are some doctors that will go out of there way to help a patient and then there are some that are of no help at all. I have encountered both in my lifetime especially when it comes to dealing with my children's health issues. 
-1	I believe they attended school for a certain amount of time to learn the knowledge needed to assist patience with their needs in a daily basis 
-1	My doctor is very caring, and makes me feel confident about treatments he suggests.  When you go in you feel more like a family member than a patient.  He doesn't rush he is thorough and he can't get answers he'll refer you somewhere that can

1	I trust in there ability to give the correct information because doctors are right on the spot with listening to you an getting you the things you need to make you feel better 
-1	I do not have a strong amount of trust in any doctor. Doctors often lie or leave out information pertaining to medical information, in order to make their money. For example, doctors are aware of how dangerous kemo and radiation are, but they continue to sale it to patients.

-1	I trust my primary care due to the years of experience, references and relationship that is trusted and have been known to deliver sound results and recommendations
-1	On more than one occasion, just to be sure, I have sought second options and been told different than the what my doctor has said. Sometimes something as simple as a google search and bringing new questions to the doctor based on said google search has changed my doctors opinion or suggestions for treatment. 
1	My doctor is confident and knowledgeable. He listens intently and compassionately. Doesn't prescribe a lot of unnecessary testing. Has been right on the mark with his diagnoses so far.

-1	I don't have full trust in my PCP due to an incident with my husband.  6 weeks after his office visit they notify him that he needs to have an ultrasound on his kidneys because his cortizone levels were high and they thought his kidneys were failing.....6 WEEKS LATER THEY NOTIFY HIM THEY FEEL HIS KIDNEYS ARE FAILING.  Then 3 months later the office contacts him about whether he had this other test done (can't recall the specific test) of which he informed him that NO ONE made him aware he needed this done.  3 months they wait to see if he had it done!!!  I call it negligent or they have to many patients and can't keep up with their responsibilities.
-1	I trust my doctor because she wants to help me and she cares about me.  She also takes the time to listen to me and does not rush my visit.

1	I have been going to her for many years.  I have been through several medication conditions within those years and she has alway been thorough, patient and understanding and making sure I got the best possible treatment.  
-1	I don't trust the medical system at all and never will. It would be extremely foolish to trust them.
-1	sometimes i feel like they don't want to help you, or they just don't care about the patients. sometimes as well we just don't want to trust someone we don't want to trust so i guess that is why they don't trust. when we do its because we believe that they are credible
-1	It depends on the doctor you have. You need to get to know your doctors personality and character so you can determine your level of trust. I feel my new doctor is thorough and attentive to my needs. I have a high level of trust in his ability and concern.

-1	It appears they are more concerned about what they think is convenient for them. I wish to be in control of what is best for me.

-1	I have been with my physician for over a year and she has been very helpful. Always open to questions I have and takes time to explain things to me when I need her to.
-1	Because they have a knowledge of natural, alternative medicine. They look at the whole person not just the symptoms.

-1	Ibdint go to the doctor often only recently started to see a therapist. That is the only time which is staring out to be twice per week.
-1	I feel like they care more about the business of making people sick and medicine.  Rather than the person whose coming for help. I also have been told that I was too big and lazy. I'm 5ft 7.5 inches tall and only weighed 160 pounds.

1	i like so much visit to doctor because him is a person excelent. in all moment the docot speak trust

-1	I believe that being sick is what keeps the doctors in business and the more side effects to the medicine the more sick you'll be and the more prescription will have to be prescribed. That isn't all doctors but I do believe it is the majority. 
-1	Never insisted I get blood work done though I see him just once a year. When I told him about a past ailment, he was vague in informing me of what could have been wrong. Not sure if this was to protect the doctors I' d seen for that matter because they belonged to the same practice. 
-1	My doctor wants the best for his patients. He tries to look into matters before he give you an answer. He checks. Things out,he do serveral tests before saying what the problem really is.

Most doctors nowadays are heavily influenced by pharmaceutical companies as well and I am not into taking meds.
-1	I trust my doctor because she takes the time to talk to me to understand what my symptoms are and determine what the course of treatment should be.
-1	I can see through pushes some doctors make when it comes to medications and the financial benefit to them, but overall I do trust them and believe they have my best interest at heart.
1	Because the doctors that I have are really good at what they. They explain what needs to be explained and whatever questions I need them to be explained they take care of that.
1	i would never have complete total trust in a doctor. i have to look things up myself, i have to be able to confirm or deny
-1	I trust my primary care physician but doctors are humans and can make mistakes. I haven't personally had a bad experience but people shouldn't put complete faith in medical professionals.
-1	They are my doctor for a reason, they know what they are doing and I understand everything, and they know what to do when I am sick and need help.
1	I trust my primary care physician mainly because of how thorough she is when it comes to my overall health and wellbeing. I feel that she hasn't done anything so far to make me start to distrust her.

-1	It is the first ethical responsibility of health care givers to provide or refer patients to others in order for them to receive the best treatment possible . It is also their responsibility to give the most up to date care to patients 
-1	It is not that I have no Trish is doctors just I am squrimess around needles. I just am not a fan of going.
-1	I beleive that sometimes doctors get in a routine and just give you the basics. They dont take into consideration your situation at the time
1	I trust my doctor he is upfront and blunt about things. He doesn't hold back anything. He always answers my questions
-1	Doctors do practice nothing is a hundred percent so they can say something that is wrong and we have to pay for it
-1	I can't really say because ive changed doctors but she listened to what I had to say and made sure I was ok
1	I have never had any reason to mistrust my primary care physician or any other healthcare provider that I have ever used in my life.
1	First you have to find an excellent doctor - and there are many. Then put your faith in him or her. i have no primary care physician but the specialists i have seen for any problems i have had have been excellent.

1	We build a  trusting and  reliable  relations between us. I been with my doctor now for 15 years, so that how we build our relationship between us.
1	I have been going to him long enough to know I can trust him. When he was having me go to the hospital by the time I got there my room was already assigned to me.
-1	"My doctor has made huge mistakes on forms like making me get shots for school he thought were required when the form actually said I was excluded. He also signed below the signature line which was odd. He says contradicting things like ""inside your ears it looks PERFECT"" than says I""m suffering from inner ear inflammation. "
1	I think they know best that is why I trust them. For them it's not only about a job but also saving lives
-1	I think that my doctor is a decent person whom wants to make sure his patients lead a very healthy life. His job is more than a pay check. He's doing an excellent job by providing the necessary help to his patients.
1	I've always been taught to never completely trust anyone who makes a living off of you, because at the end of the day, the want to make the most money possible.
1	my dr does not sugar coat things he just tells it the way it is , having a cronic condition that has little possible cure can cause him to get discouraged but i have out lived all predictions 
1	I trust them because the stuff they usually tell me works or is true. Also ,I've been going to this doctor for a while.
-1	The reason I cant trust my primary physician on a regular day to day daily basis is because to me it seems a lot of them are simply in it for the check. I also feel like my primary physician looks at everything from a book perspective, and the truth is no matter what schooling no book can tell you everything about real life, especially when dealing with a real life person. I feel a lot of providers just see us as a number or a insurance claim, they aren't understanding enough to realize that some things are just life not everything can be explained via a book.

-1	I don't think doctors know what they think they know. I have multiple disabilities, and at least one is an orphan - no known good treatments.  The ones for the standard form don't work well if at all.  And the ones they won't give me are the only things that ever did any good!

1	I trust my primary care physician because she is thorough and explains options and listens to me. She is also great about communicating with me between visits

-1	I dropped my primary care because I did not trust him.  The people that worked with him were incompetent and he did not want to hear that they gave me the wrong information.  I have had extremely bad care for my father from a doctor in a rehab.  I have a very hard time trusting any doctor.
1	He gives an exam which is thorough, goes over all the results, suggests things, allows me to express my opinion and does not make me feel inadequate when I express myself by the way, check your spelling be4 fwding ques.  it is extrOvert not extrAvert

1	I have had no negative or bad experiences with the care I have received from my primary physician.  I do not seek medical attention very often. I sometimes research on the internet conditions and  symptoms about diagnoses 
1	She made me take my shoes and socks off. No other doctor has. She also gave me the straight answer on if I were diabetic.  I need medication. 
1	I have know my doctor for 14 years and trust him totally.  His office is very close and feel confident in discussing any topic.
-1	My primary care doctor is good and does seek out the tests and medicines he thinks I need; but his idea of health and life is different than mine.  I don't think he is into natural and spiritual healing.
-1	I trust my doctor because they are real with me.  They dont lie and beat around the bush.  They are really nice understanding and knowledgeable.
-1	I trust my doctor because he helped me a lot with my past medical issues. He always explain everything to me.
1	The doctors that I have are all outstanding physicians in their fields.  They listen to me and we work as a team in coming up with my health care plan.

I trust her because she has shown that my health is of important concern to her.

-1	Experience with her treatment has given me confidence in her care. I can't say I have complete trust in anyone.
1	They could be lying at any point making up fake illnesses that I could possibly have.  This would be so they make more money off me
-1	I do trust my former PCP, The new one at the VA seems to be very untrustworthy; as she comes to conclusions without efficient data, and that send up flags. For my newest psychiatrist at the VA; he too jumped to a conclusion in only one meeting(today), therefore I don't trust him either. especially when he is not paying attention to detail such as body language and whatnot. Nor did he want my 5 plus yrs of documentation from my former psychiatrist.

1	I've had many doctors over my lifetime. My current doctor is the best one I've ever had. He is honest, thorough and truly cares about his patients. He is a gem. I fully trust in his judgment.
-1	It's not that I distrust my physician...I go to a free clinic and some things/meds are limited.  Doctors . in general, sometimes push certain products I  guess.
-1	Thanks for Your time and consideration for any inconvenience caused and thank goodness for your loss or not but it will be a little more time to get my hands
-1	I do not think they spend enough time with me and listen to what I am saying.  Some times I leave my appointment feeling frustrated.
-1	I don't always believe that I can trust physicians in general. I believe that some of them care more about marketing certain products or services and they try to sell it to you, without being honest about the products and it's side effects etc. 
-1	A doctor has enough experience and knowledge to give advice. The quality and design of the feature has value.
1	My doctor has always been honest and upfront with me and he shows he cares. I couldn't ask for more from him.
-1	I don't trust in chemical drugs ,I believe in Nature's cures but I just don't trust anyone knowledgeable to know but yet with the audacity gives you chemicals. 
-1	what is the purpose of doctors making me healthy there is more money in people being sick black black black black 
-1	I currently don't have a primary physician. But the one I had was pretty good, caring and efficient. 
-1	Doctor now a days don't act concern I at all  always in s hurry and don't listen my doctor prescribed me meds and my other doctor asked why was I taking two meds that shouldn't go together. I was so mad.
1	I trust my doctor because I had her for years. And she tries to make sure that everthing is done for me.
1	My primary care physician always shows up clean and prepared to attend to me. the look kind and take time to explain stuff to me so I know theyre trustworthy .

-1	I trust my physician because I have had the same physician for years. I also feel that he gives solid advice and guides me to making proper medical decisions
-1	Because they get payed by the amount of prescriptions they give. They are sponsored by companies and hospitals 
1	They are always honest and polite explain it so that I understand it im very happy with my doctors. They are very trusting nice and not rude
1	I have had the same physician since birth he has always been honest and open with myself and my parents. When we need referrals to other Dr.'s he gives us the best one he knows and follows up with that Dr. to make sure they are all on the same page with my treatments if any are needed.
1	I trust my doctor because he check on medicines that are best for me. He listens and provide the prescription that are best for me. 
1	I trust their knowledge and that they will tell me what is good for me. I do not think they would lie.
-1	When the physician is new I trust them because there brain is fresh from studying and learning new stuff , but sometimes I feel like they might be a little bit nervous and they might make a mistake , for explain giving me the wrong drugs.
-1	He's been my doctor for over 20 years. He's not the most organized and he makes mistakes but he has a good bedside manner and he cares about my health. 
-1	Some Doctor you can Trust and it some u can not Trust they will tell u one thing and it might be some else
-1	Most of the time, I feel my doctor is under qualified or is just there to make a buck.  Sometimes I have ongoing medical issues that I mention to my doctor,  and the issues get overlooked or played down as if nothing is wrong. 
-1	 I feel like it they can learn more about their  position  but like some just give you a quick answer  I feel like some doesn't listen to what you going  going through
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been her patient for years and years and she hadn't let me down and don't think she will regrading my health. 
-1	They are guided by big pharma and their paychecks. Why else would there be advertisements on TV about something a doctor should be prescribing?
-1	Doctors in general I feel can be trusted. If anything, their reputation is on the line, and in any field, reputation is key.
-1	Because he is a very good physician and he has been honest and trust worthy in the past, so I have no reason not to trust him, and so far he has been right with the medical issues with me.
-1	I feel that, similar to lawyers, medical professionals will sometimes look to profit instead of wanting the best service for their customer. For example, a few years ago my dentist suggested braces, which would've been an extra 4,000 dollars. I refused, and my teeth are still perfectly healthy.
1	She listens to my concerns and gives options and realistic goals and expectations. She makes wonderful referrals and explains everything in great detail. 
-1	At this current time I do not have a primary doctor. The reason being is that there is nothing going on with me. As me trusting or distrusting a doctor that's neither here or there because I trust in a higher power 
1	it took me a while to find the right doctor, but after almost 3 year I think I have finally found a doctor that I can truly trust.
-1	I trust doctors to the extent that I believe that they are knowledgeable about the specific issue being addressed. Not all doctors are well-informed, nor do they have expertise in all areas. 
-1	He's has been my doctor for as long as I can remember, when he retires I will have to find a new one
-1	I trust her because she truly does full exams to see whats really wrong with me. So I trust her completely for future examinations.
1	Doctors in general know what they are doing.  So I trust them in making decisions for me.  I like when a doctor shows empathy for me or any other patient.  
-1	I trust my physician because they just wants what is best for me. They are honest to me about my options. 
-1	I feel like I'm just another dollar to my doctor not a person needing help. When I see her she's always busy with other things that she can't fully put her focus on me 
-1	You and she is the best mother I know I love you I have to work out at work today and she came the same way as I did am I just woke and my soul and my aunt was the best same way with god me to god I am a god and I am not going through it and god god bless god and god bless I god bless god you bless god you god and she is god god and I am not god working with you god god and god I am not god bless you she is god bless you god god bless her and she bless you and god bless you she said the 
-1	I feel like doctors are just in and out of the room so fast and I don't feel like they actually care about your situation they just need to hurry and get to the next patient.
-1	I don't really like going to the doctor at all.  I'm not sure that I personally like my pcp at the moment
-1	My primary care doctor usually takes all the time I need to understand what is going on with me and to answer any questions I have.
-1	Been going to him for many years and have great confidence in him and the information he give me.   have a trusting relationship with him.
-1	CONSECUENT PORTFOLIO SOLUTION OF ESTIMATING SIMPLE CONTRARY OF THE INSPIRED PROSPECT SECURITY INPUT ACCOUNT RIGHT
-1	They don't really go over every possible option that could be wrong. They don't consider everything and are not thorough 
-1	I don't have a primary doctor because the ones I went to weren't that great and I feel that they didn't understand me or didn't believe me and my condition and made me feel like I was lying
1	What ever she tells me always works. I have never had any problems trusting my Doctor and any of the other Doctors I have ever seen.
1	My primary care physician has always been great. She is very personable and honest. She reccomends nothing but the best for me. I am very thankful to have found a doctor like her
1	I believe my doctor is taking care of my needs and is there when I need them. I have trust in my doctor.
-1	I don't trust ANY physician. They're in the pockets of big pharma and push possibly harmful or unnecessary drugs for personal gain. Money is their bottom line.
1	I have been exposed to very well trained doctors. I usually only visit medical centers that have top-notch doctors. As a result, I trust all of past and current primary care physicians.
-1	My doctor is very trusting. She is transparent and completely open. I am able to ask her anything and she will give me the truth whether it's good or bad. I feel confident when I see her for treatment. 
-1	I don't feel like it is intellegant to trust any one 100 percent with your health because of so much malpractice 
-1	I trust my doctor because I have had the same doctor for years and we have a good reltionship and I don't know what else to say about this
1	he always takes his time with me, gives me advice and then leaves it up to me.  Great be side matter.
-1	I trust her education and experience, but she and other doctors spends so little time with patients that I feel it's hard for them to know each patient.
1	he takes good care of me and if any thing is wrong with me he will sit and explain my options to me and we can decide what form of actions to take
1	I finally found a PCP who listens to me and knows I know more about my condition than he does. I will listen to his advice about other medical issues that I know little about 
1	my personal physician has known me for 50 years and has never steered me wrong. He doesn't over medicate and I have total confidence that anything he suggests is worth listening to.
1	My doctor is a very good and honest man.  He is about 35 and has a modern view about many things.  He explains everything in detail and ask many questions about me and my conditions.  He is very knowledgeable about family medicine because that is what he studied in medical school.  I could not ask for a better doctor.  He also treats my entire family the same way.
1	I feel completely confident in my health care professional. He is very trustworthy and I have never had any issues talking to him about any of my medical problems.

-1	My doctor always makes sure to look over everything and run multiple tests if needed. He's very concerned about how you're feeling and finding an answer. On the other hand, one of the nurse practitioners likes things that are convenient for her and usually comes up with a diagnosis without further investigation. Overall I trust my doctor but not the other staff.
-1	I trust the doctor to run blood work that is needed and shots that are needed. I trust the doctor will give me the right medications with the right dose.
1	I've been to doctors in the past that didn't listen, didn't ask questions, didn't explain conditions or medications thoroughly, and always acted like they were in a rush and had something more important to do. My current doctor is the exact opposite of what I've described.
-1	Sometimes doctors omit information because I did not ask them directly about it. They also tend to rush the process of care and are bound by hospital rules which may prohibit preventitive procedures without compelling evidence. 
1	highly trained professional that knows their jobs.always put,s their patients first,and provide high quality care

I also don't feel like I was examined like I should have been. The doctor would just look at me and tell me what she thought it was without any examination. 
-1	I do not have complete trust in my doctor as they need to make money first, and care about people less than they should. They want to help others but also can't do the cheapest options.

-1	I do believe the dr gives you right diagnosis sometime Spme0 you need a second opinion they do miss the mark
-1	I would have to say that I somewhat trust my primary care physician. Its not that he isn't a nice guy its just that he doesn't really listen to what I might want or need. Its always him thinking he knows best because he is the doctor, but in all actuality I know my body better then he does. Sometimes I feel like he isn't telling me everything I need to know because he might not like what I have to say.
-1	I believe in my doctors. And I love my doctors because I play football and they take care of my needs And you need to trust your family and doctors.

-1	"I went to court for disability, and found out my medical professionals think I am ""faking it."" I feel betrayed, judged, and misled. "
1	I trust my doctor because i have been seeing her for  a while now and i haven't had any issues and she helps me out every time..
1	My PCP is a Nurse Practitioner that I have known for many years.  She is knowledgeable about my conditions and keeps up to date with treatments.  What she does not know, she will find out and get the info to me.
-1	I find it to be the most useful and helpful when i am able to explain all the things that i need and make sure the doctor knows what i need.
1	I have worked as a nurse with my PCP and have the greatest respect for her as a physician and as a person. BTW, she makes for a lousy patient!
-1	I don't believe that she necessarily gives me all treatment options, and if I decline treatment(eg, hormone replacement therapy for menopause), she gets quite huffy. 
-1	The reason that I trust my primary care doctor is the he tells specifically what I need to do to take care of my health
-1	They do their best for the most pRt but tend to follow the medical script, though are mostly well-intentioned and kind.
-1	My doctor spends the needed amount of time with me, responds to my emails and asks appropriate questions.  My doctor is aware of needed procedures and tests that may be needed.  She listens and is not anxious about her time.
-1	i trust very few of my doctors... they just never seem to care enough to hear what is wrong with me so in turn i just stop going to the doctors because its a waste of money and time to go to a doctor that fails you then you lose the ambition to get get help because no one cares.... 
-1	i trust medical professionals in general because i understand the job and pressures associated with the profession.
-1	I dont' trust the medical system at all, prefer natural remedies wherever possible.  A doctor is a last resort.
1	has great bedside manners, very detailed, very orgainized and easy to talk to. has exceptionally good personnel around him.
-1	I dont have one. My choicce.I have to much knowledge about health that most medical staff cant handle me. 
1	I have never had any issues with my doc. They are always straight forward and are very helpful when I need it.
-1	it is just a normal thing to do.  I have never had a reason to not true a doctor with a diagnosis they know what they are doing
1	i trust my doctor very much because why wouldnt i trust my doctor i would trust my doctor all the time because they are there foor me all the time. 
-1	Been Seeing Him For 7 Years... Has Kept Me Going The Older I Get...Has Political Views That Cause Me Stress And Irritation...
1	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for years . He is always correct and helps with any problems I may have .
-1	well he is older and I worry he is not up to date. he seems to prescrine new meds not sure if its for exchange for gifts
-1	I trust my doctor because he is highly trained in his field. But distrust him because most doctors are in the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies.
1	Comfortable with my doctor and would do whatever he says that is needed, he is the one with the knowledge.
-1	I had my fourth sinus surgery in December of 2016, It left me with permanent nerve damage, and the doctor does not think he is at fault. I have been to multiple specialists and no one can find a way to alleviate the constant pain.
-1	She does just an ok job. I would change doctors if I gound a better one in my insurance scope. I am looking.
-1	For most of my life I have neither had nor needed a PCP.  My Medicare Advantage plan required one so I recently contacted a doctor and set up the necessary steps to have him as my PCP.  First meeting impressions and results were good but without a long-term relationship I cannot rate my level of trust/distrust
-1	I have beem referred to my doctor and have been under his care for years. His experience and staff make me feel very comfortable.
-1	I feel that my primary care physician knows more than me apparently about health issues and what needs to be done to fix the issues so I trust in their judgement and advice
-1	i have been with my family doctor  for years he knows our family history and has been in practice for twenty years  
1	Our primary care physician goes out of her way to make our visit worthwhile and listens, answers questions throughly and honestly.
-1	My primary care physician always seems to be in a hurry and I don't like how he refers me to a specialist for just about everything. 
-1	you have to put faith in them. they went to lots of schooling to make sure they can help you when you need it.
-1	It seems as if now the doctors are in it for the money and how many patients can be seen. The patent can't get straight answers.
-1	i have seen my primary care doctor for years now and i feel she has the best interest of me in her mind
1	My doctor is always very thorough and does not leave the room until all of my questions have been answered
-1	they know better than me about stuff, because i'm still a student...so. and i'm not studying their field, either...
-1	I think he just doesn't listen to me.  I think he already thinks he knows what's wrong and what needs to happen.
-1	i dont trust doctor at all. i do not beelieve a word they say. they are all the time lying making huge errors and other flakey stuff
-1	they are worried about volume of parietns and receiving the money UCR payments because  my doctor is always late to my appointments
-1	I have been going to this same doctor for quite a few years and have always received good care and his manner is thoughtful pleasant and unhurried
1	I've changed doctors when communications were not what I felt were necessary.  My current doctor clearly explains what he feels I need to know and answers any questions I have.  I sometimes follow-up with emails that inquire further and he answers on a timely basis.
1	THEY DO SEEM TO CARE FOR YOU BUT SOMETIMES IT BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU NEED A QUICK APPOINTMENT BUT THEY ARE TOO BUSY TO SEE YOU IMMEDIATELY BUT MUST WAIT FOR A LATTER APPOINTMENT 
1	I have a long term relationship and have found my doctor to be knowledgeable and accurate in the situations I have been in
1	he is always honest about he's work and he cares for he's patients he always comes to work 100 percent ready to get the day started
-1	For the most part I do trust her, but often she does not let me explain sufficiently and take my feelings into account. There is an old saying among doctors that says, if you want to know what is wrong with a patient, just listen to them.... they can tell you.
-1	I trust that my doctor is giving me the information and providing me with the tests and medicine necessary to treat the problems i have
1	I feel that my PCP has my best interest in mind any time she makes a decision on what medication or treatments are beneficial for me.  I feel that she does not make a quick decision on it either.  I feel that she takes a lot of time to think it out as to what is best for me.
1	My Dr is very young and the new Drs do things differently than the old drs.  They are much more attentive than the old drs.  They also ask more questions which prompts me to explain more.
1	She is a great person and professional, can not trust her. Everyone I know who is cared for by him, blindly trust in his decisions;
-1	They are pill pushers Take oaths to push medication  Vaccinations are money and they push those Over helming how much insurance rules over them also 
1	I like my doctor a lot. He's so fucking hot and is very thoughtful & intelligent. I want to see him without his shirt on.
-1	It really depends on the doctor.  I have had doctors who are mostly concerned about other things than me.  Then I have had some that seem like they are only interested in me.
-1	I don't have much of a choice - I have to trust him - he's the one with the medical degree.  I generally don't put much faith since medicine used to be a profession and is now a business but there are no alternatives.  it is what it is
-1	I have had doctors run exorbitant, unnecessary tests on me to pad their own bills. So no, I don't have the greatest trust in doctors. The last physical I had cost $1700 because the doctor was running test after test. 
-1	I trust my primary care provider, I just wish I could see the same doctor every time I go.  Due to the fact that where I go is a medical practice, I rarely get to see the same doctor. 
-1	I had a primary physician I completely trusted. He always initiated thoughts that I had before I could state them, he spoke to me as a person and did what he could to maximize what insurance allowed, and did more. Current physician is nothing compared to him.
-1	my nervious are primary reason why im like that tho, in test and quizz is were im more nervious and nonpasient, and I try to get som help 
1	I trust doctors 100%  Occasionally one physician will allow his physician assistant to speak with me I do not like this and let physician assistant know no offense I prefer to speak with my doctor
1	I have known my doctor for a long time outside of the doctors office. She is a family friend and I have complete trust in her decisions and what she says.
1	a doctor is experienced at problem solving and can help my medical need. doctors' have years of practice in the medical field and years of learned skills in a medical class room. he isn't dumb
-1	I trust that he is able to go over all options of treatment for me.  He is also available to go over details in the event i need him off hours
-1	we can come to a neutral agreement when its comes to my health and well being. He listen to my concerns and address them to my needs
-1	I trust him sometimes and other times its hard to trust him because one time he prescribed me the wrong medication if I were to have taken it I could've been really sick
1	For the most part I have never had a bad experience with my doctor. She always seems helpful and honest about what's going on with me.
-1	Most doctors dont examine you on a machine you go. There is no one on one communication. The doctor only spends five to eight mintueds with you.

-1	Dr has been around for years and tries to make me understand what's going on with my health and inform me
1	He is suppose to be my adviser for the best possible medical and physical health I can achieve.  So I should trust his judgement on the topic of my medical and physical health.

1	this is general-doctors have been nice to me and let me know what to expect in way of treatment or if it was something that would take time to heal-they have been right more often than not
-1	It's not that I trust or distrust my primary care physician I'm just a very anxious and nervous type of person.

-1	I trust or distrust my primary care physician because he trusts me as well and cares for me like no other doctor does 
-1	I trust my primary care physician to an extent. She is very caring but not very attentive to things going on with me and my son all the time.

-1	I do not currently have a primary care physician, and although I am confident in the abilities and knowledge of doctors in general, I am hesitant to put my complete trust into anyone.  I like to explore various options and opportunities, and I know that doctors do not always have the answer.
-1	I completely trust my Primary Care physician, but also understand that she see many people, so I ultimately have to do some of my own research and decide what is truly right for me as far as treatments are concerned.
1	I have had the same physician for more than ten years.  He knows me personally and is very aware of my medical and a lot of my personal history. He has never steered me wrong in medical treatments or information.
1	Because not only do they care for me, they ask when the pain last occurred and to rate it on a scale. They have more than one way to solving from the most risky to the less.
-1	Well when I first met my doctor 2 years ago he is adding me head to toe tell me you don't things I need to do things I shouldn't do for the first month and now it's just pills pills pills pills to cure one paying the Cure that pain is almost like a pill Pusher and I don't like medicine all the time there's a lot of Earthly things that you can do besides taking medicine all the time so my concern with the doctor is maybe I should change doctors I don't know then I spend maybe a few minutes with you but I understand they have a lot of patience but it just in and out of the door when you want to ask a question it's like okay what else do you need not very concern so maybe I should change doctors that's
