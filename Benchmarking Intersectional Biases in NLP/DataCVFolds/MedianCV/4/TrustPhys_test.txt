1	I have been with my primary care physician for almost 20 years.  He discusses everything with me and utilizes my input into treatment plans.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a family friend and has been looking after us for most of my life.
-1	Its been a mixed bag for me some doctors are really good at what they do and others not so much, its been 5050 for me so far. its rather difficult and finding a good doctor has been inconsistent 
1	My doctor is calm and collected and very sympathetic. She seems to care about me as a patient so I trust her.
-1	I have a hard time trusting doctors because they are always busy. If you do not have a serious medical condition they will not take their time with you because they have more important things to do. For that reason, I do not always believe that a doctor is doing all they can for me.
-1	I trust my doctor because he does not beat around the bush. He tells me when I need to address something or if I am over reacting. He also tells me to not be afraid to get a second opinion. That he is only human and that he wants me to feel comfortable and if that means getting another doctor's opinion then so be it. 
1	I trust my medical staff to tell me what is wrong or right. They take the time to explain the information to me and ask me if I have any questions.
-1	i trust my doctor - he has never lied to me and always is there when i need him - i can call and get an appointment the day i call
-1	I was on a medication for 7 years that I really did not need. I did some of my own research and asked my doctor about it, and she took me off of it. Ever since, I have had trouble trusting her. 
-1	I've never been given a reason to distrust a doctor I've seen. I've always been given information and had my questions answered in a reasonable manner. 
-1	Sometimes doctors omit information because I did not ask them directly about it. They also tend to rush the process of care and are bound by hospital rules which may prohibit preventitive procedures without compelling evidence. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because i have been dealing with them for a while and they showed and prove to me that if i just eat differently and exercise a little more i can lose weight and become healthy and i did.
-1	I have been in a situation before that could have been life threatening and he made a decision and did a procedure that saved my life
-1	My doctor seems to be a caring and considerate doctor. I belive he really cares about his patients. And gives them the best care possible. He has a positive attitude alsi.
-1	My primary care physician has asked me to spell and remind her of the me of my rare condition each of the last four times I have seen her. She has often forgotten or ignored problems I was having. She seems overbooked and scattered. 
1	My primary doctor always takes the necessary time to explain the test results and ohysical examination so that I fully understand the visit.
1	My doctor is very thorough and intelligent.  He has always communicated directly to me and his decisions about my treatment have been right on target.
1	I think I could trust my primary care physician to give me the care I need. I don't have one currently but I should probably find one. I would prefer a female doctor so I can talk honestly about my needs and concerns without feeling like I am being treated like it's 'all in my head'.
1	I trust my PCP because he seems to care about my health.  He takes time to understand my questions and give me advise.
1	This doctor is a colleague and friend of the family. He was once my pediatrician and pediatrician to my younger sister that is now 25. He is also the pediatrician to my children as well. I can always go to him for a second opinion if needed. 
1	Cause he never told me something that was wrong I have a lot of trust for my doctor until I am proving wrong I have high trust for my doctors 
-1	They are guided by big pharma and their paychecks. Why else would there be advertisements on TV about something a doctor should be prescribing?
-1	I do a LOT of research on my own, because I suffer from chronic conditions. When I see a doctor, they don't always mention all of the options available. The docs are double and triple booked in 15 minute time slots, so they don't have a lot of time with each patient. They hardly have the time to fully discuss EVERYTHING that's going on and maybe connect some dots that could be connected. 
-1	At the moment I don't have a primary care physician. In the past, I've had doctors who have dismissed concerns that turned into real problems.
-1	To many doctors only have book smarts. if  something isnt a  text  book case they dont believe in thinking out side the  box  
-1	I like my physician for yearly check ups...but have not had a thorough examination from her after 2 years.  I have very few reasons to see her outside that, but I did disagree with her on one Rx and told her I would not take it. She was fair and said it was my decision, but I am free to question if I don't agree with her. 
1	The reason I trust him is because he know what I doesn't that's the reason I go is to see what's wrong with me
-1	Is open to talking with me, never makes me feel rushed.  Listens to my concerns about potential treatments.  Keeps a level head, and is persoble...not a robot.
-1	I feel that many doctors are overworked and don't necessarily care about wellbeing of patients.  They are also at the mercy of insurance and pharmaceutical companies.  It is a sad day, because I remember when it was the other way around and doctors did what was best for their clients.
1	I feel that my doctor-patient relationship is well established and she feels comfortable telling me things even if I won't agree with them. She is aware I will ask questions and I will always be respectful even if I disagree with her recommendation. 
-1	doctors are usually trustworthy because they are worried of lawsuits of being disbarred.  most are good at their jobs also
-1	They are highly educated so I trust them, however, anyone can have a bad day where they don't do their jobs well.  Doctors are no exception to these rules.  They some times are going to make bad calls and so I can't 100% trust any doctor.
-1	I find that they are all about the bottom line. They often either ignore your complaints, don't take into consideration the HUMAN with feelings behind the symptoms, or worse, they go on a great zebra hunt when a horse is staring them in the face, more to cover their asses against malpractice than for the patient's welfare. If you are not attractive and/or young, healthcare declines.  I can figure out what is wrong with me faster on google than I can by going to the doctor and BE RIGHT.
-1	She hasn't steered me wrong yet. I may not always agree with treatment but I know she has my best interests in the forefront. 
1	My primary physician does there job very well.If theres something out of there range they go get another hand to make sure i get the  best help needed in that situation 
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he has been seeing people in my family for over 40 years. Most of my immediate family go to the same doctor and he is very persoble and a straight shooter. He does not beat around the bush when he needs to tell you something.
-1	I have had hard to diagnosis conditions in the past and because I go to a large HMO where the doctors have a huge client load, I feel that there is no way that a doctor can adequately diagnosis this type of condition. After a doctor's appointment, I often combine research that I've done online with what they say or prescribe. 
1	I do not really have much distrust in the my primary care physician. I feel like he does a great job in being honest and transparent.
-1	I like my primary care physician, but I have a certain amount of distrust in doctor's generally and don't trust medications at all. I always prefer to try a drug free option first, and doctor's often aren't on board with that point of view. 
1	For the most part, I trust my primary care physician. I've seen doctor's before where they felt almost robotic in dealing with me. No emotion whatsoever and looked to have one foot out the door already. My current primary care physician is none of those things. It actually feels like he cares about my well being. He remembers things from my persol life in previous conversations and brings it up when I see him, like a human being. He takes the time to deal with me, which I like.
1	I trust him b/c he has proven that he cares and wants to find out what is wrong with me no matter what.  
1	He is friendly and really interested in what you have to say and is never hurried when speaking and treating me,   He diagnosed my wife's condition just by looking at her after several other doctors had no idea what her medical problem was.
-1	doctors and hospitals are greedy and profit-driven and are no longer dedicated towards helping patients
1	I have always had trust in my primary physician.  He has a great bed-side manner and is very personable and explains things very well.  My father was a physician and I am able to relate to him because of this.  I also know that he his telling me the truth that I need to hear as this is the same things that I heard from my father.  I respect his years of service in the industry as well as he has practiced his trade for over 20 years.  I also trust the people that recommended this physician to me.
-1	I feel they are under tremendous pressure to move quickly from patient to patient as well as keep costs low and use certain prescription vendors.
-1	Because they went to school and studied hard to be what they are, and they are required to know what they are doing
-1	There hasn't be a major illness I've had to deal with in my life or my family members life.
-1	In general I trust my doctor, that being said I know that s/he has a heavy case load and i may not get all the attention i need. Also I know that insurance, HMO's and pharma influences decision making/medical advice i receive
1	He has been in the healthcare profession for quite some time and is very knowledgeable. He is well respected in the community
1	I generally trust my doctor since I switched to him after having a bad experience with a previous doctor, and my current doctor was very honest in giving me new treatment options. He is very good at communication and seems to listen very closely and with interest in what I say. 
1	I trust them because I know along with experience and schooling they have the know how to take care of me. I have not had a negative experience yet with my doctor so no reason to distrust them.
1	I have seen my current doctor for several years now. he has always listened to my concerns and has worked with me in finding the best treatment that iI need.
-1	I trust my PCP as I have been seeing her more than ten years and she has helped me through a number of illnesses, chronic and other. 
1	I have been with my family Dr. for almost 20 years now. I know that he has my best interest at heart. 
-1	I have issues with my primary care physician.  I scheduled sick visits (reluctantly, because it is so expensive) only to come out of the office with more questions than I started with.  Recently I went in for issues with my hands and I knew the diagnosis the doctor gave me was completely off the mark.  He spent very little time examining me.
-1	I have had the same physician for more than 30 years. Also he is the same physician for all my family members.
-1	I feel like they rush through my concerns and questions.  Explanations can be in excess or too little. I havenât found a Dr. I really like in awhile.
-1	 I have been going to the same care physician since I was a little kid. I just most recently stopped going to them because I am now too old. So I always trusted his judgment because I have pretty much known him my whole life.  I also trust my new doctor because he is a doctor and that is his job 
1	I've been going to him for quite some time now. We've developed a good relationship. He's frank and honest and that's exactly what I expect.
1	I have had a wonderful primary Dr. the last 5 yrs. He looks me in the eyes when I talk and it makes me feel that he is truly hearing me. He asks my opinion on treatment when it's an option. 
-1	I just started with a new facility for my medical care.  The two doctors I have seen there so far seem to be very nice and helpful.  This is a walk in place, where you see whichever doctor is there, you don't need an appointment.
1	I have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. Whenever something felt wrong with my person and I reached out to her for help I was satisfied with what she told me. She has not given me reason to believe my health isn't her utmost priority.
-1	I have had a longstanding relationship with my primary physician. He is knowable, experienced, intelligent and open. I feel comfortable discussing my health with my doctor as he is patient, kind and wise. I do, on occasion disagree with my physician and in most cases feel comfortable letting him know of and why I might disagree with him. Some times I may not speak up, and I guess that goes somewhat under the category of distrust but all in all I do trust my doctor. As far as other doctors are concerned, my trust level is on a case to case basis.
-1	I trust my doctor's assesments completely although I often feel he knows more than he is willing to share with me
1	I usually trust my doctor since she is a health care expert.  However, if I need surgery, which is very serious I always try to get a second opinion.  Also, if I am diagnosed with something I always get a second opinion.
1	I trust my primary care because he hasn't ever done anything wrong. He gives me the utmost care and isn't ever in a rush. But to say I completely trust him would say I don't trust my own hunches. I know when something is wrong with my body so I can't put all trust in him. He's great at what he does but he can only do so much.
-1	Doctors in general are pretty untrustworthy I think. I think part of my reasoning for that comes from knowing that they push samples on people for their own profit and that they're really overworked and don't have time to really hear you. I saw a video recently about a bunch of people who saw multiple doctors and every doctor was brushing them aside and saying it was nothing when really it was ovarian cysts and split nerves and doctors just didn't take the time to care. So I think I've always felt this way but that recent video kinda watered the seed that was already planted in my head so to speak. 
-1	"My doctor seems to provide a lot of information and entertain any questions, even if they don't see particularly well thought-out or ""smart"""
-1	I trust most doctors because I do not believe they have ulterior motives. I know a lot of people think that the medical field is a sham, and doctors are only interesting in making a buck off sick people, but I genuinely believe that most doctors are good, honest, hard working people. If we did not have trustworthy doctors, there would be a lot more issues in the world than there currently are. There are also a lot of things in place to keep doctors ethical. It is a huge part of the profession. I doubt people who spend years of their life competing to be the best have any desire to be untrustworthy or scam people. 
-1	I have have known her for many years! She is very good at her job and care about me as her patient. She as a physician has been practicing for quite some time.
-1	I think that a doctor can make mistakes and sometimes it is easier to hide it from the patient. I have family members that work in a hospital and I already heard many stories that makes me worried about it.
1	I hadn't seen a doctor in many years when I found my current one, and she has always been upfront and forthright with me about my medical conditions, She has helped me get used to the medications I have to take, always explains why I'm getting them and always answers all my questions to my satisfaction
1	I trust my doctor because he is very knowledgeable in his job and knows what he is doing and what is best for me to do and take.
-1	For a majority of my checkups they have constantly been meager issues that normally do not require a giant leap of faith. They are there and paid to help people I do not see how there's any opportunity to be malicious of any sort considering they're paid well, receive salary and must have some sort of love for their career path. Not to mention every single time I've ever gone to visit my primary care physician they have always assisted me no matter what and been effective each time.
1	I trust my doctor because he has built a repore with me. My doctor is very thoughtful, he makes sure he has done all he can and has looked at every aspect of my health
1	I feel a general trust in doctors because hopefully they are doing their job to help people. 
-1	i see a nurse practitioner which was new for me. i think it's a red state thing. or maybe it's the future. anyway the practitioner was able to refer me to a specialist
-1	In terms of situations that aren't serious sometimes it would seem as though doctors may give a patient the runaround in order to make more money or help out other doctors or institutions.
1	My PCP gives me plenty of time so that I can ask and get answers to questions. She listens attentively, takes notes, and reviews old notes, so I know she is attuned to my case at hand.
-1	I,ve been going to doctors all my life.I,m pretty sure while He is checking me out I,m checking  them.My doctor goes by tests .them go by that. and I feel like he takes good care of me & he listens. I take to him about my needs,& he helps me through it if possible
1	I trust my doctor because has years of experience in the field. He has been my doctor for over 10 years and would never steer me in the wrong direction. We have a great rapport. 
-1	I mostly trust my primary care physician, because I have been seeing this doctor consistently, and I haven't croaked yet.  For the most part, I believe this doctor has my best interests at heart.  However, as a general rule, I do not trust anyone completely.
-1	i dont trust a doctor more than i trust myself.  they can only give me guidance but dont have the authority to make decisions regarding my health.
-1	I am neutral about trusting physicians because I make decisions based on my own thoughts and beliefs
-1	My doctor just rushes through things, but i think she always goes with the best choice
1	I trust them because usually the input they give me to treat my illnesses and such often work. They also usually have products on them that I could instantly try.
1	He seems direct about my choices. He has good eye contact and is calm, not holding back information. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he's young like myself and I think that he has my best interest at heart. He gets the times that we live in and he knows that many times you don't need a doctor you just need to trust yourself and body and exercise good judgement to ensure that I live as long as I possibly can. With the help of God of course.
-1	Sometimes when I get a second opinion or third, my primary doctor is wrong. I want to get various opinions and facts before I make my own informed decision.
-1	I normally trust them as I have high hopes and respect to them.I know if they were fooling me because I can somehow sense it. And i always asked my sister about it.
-1	I trust most doctors to do what's right, but I also believe that they've been taught to treat illnesses instead of trying to avoid being sick in the first place. So I believe there are tests done to people that might not be totally necessary in the first place. That's just what they're taught. 
1	We communicate well discuss any and everything. She honest open and very much in demand in her field. 
1	I think they are not qualified enough to work in the health sector, so sometimes I look for a second opinion
-1	i do trust my primary care doctors thats the way it is and i do believe they are doing their best to help and assist as in our condition and they are knowledgeable enough to just do what is the best for us 
1	I trust my physician because he is a Christian. He is always up beat and nice to me. He knows my health condition and treats me accordingly. 
-1	I distrust doctors based on experience of them misdiagnosing me and telling me my issues are imagined. If they dont know about a rare disease they tend to often want to dismiss you. 
-1	I am woman who has given birth twice, i know what it is like to have a doctor want to induce labor because he will be on vacation on your due date. I have had nurses deny me crutches because they didn't believe my pain level. everyone is human, just because you work in the medical industry does not make you infallible.
-1	In general I trust doctors and the science that backs their field. That being said they are human, and for any serious diagnosis I would want an independent second opinion.
-1	I do not have a PCP but I do see a dermatologist. I also used to work with this person so I have seen him give numerous patients medical advice including myself. I feel that after years of practice he is very knowledgeable about what he is doing and I trust the way he treats myself and others. I feel that the longer you are in practice the more knowledgeable you become. 
-1	I trust my doctor enough, but I still can't fully trust everythig they say wehn it comes tp payment information and everything else I need to know. The overall feeling of not knowing everything is what keeps me from completely trusting them.
1	He is honest and upfront. He listens to my needs and answers any questions I may have without making me feel rushed
-1	I trust my doctor, but realize there is only one miracle worker. She does tend to prescribe medications freely, and I don't agree with taking a pill for everything.  She knows when I will not take certain medicines and why.  Leaves the door open if not 100% needed.
1	I have had the same doctor for over ten years and she has always gotten the diagnosis right the first time. I have complete trust in her and we can talk about anything. She always spends time with me and answers my questions.
1	I trust my doctors because the prescribed medication is working well for me. THey take the time to talk with me about my condition and explain my treatment plan to me.  They give me copies of my treatment plan so that I can read and understand thoroughly what is wrong with me.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor for the most part because I develop an relationship with this person for a couple of years now. I know when I need something urgently, they will always be there when I go for help for me and my family.
1	He does everything he can to make me healthy!  He provides all my needs and is always there to help!
1	My doctor tells me all of the options I have, even if they don't benefit him.
1	I trust my doctor because of the right way he has steered me. He always answers all of my questions and have good bedside manner.
-1	I don't have a regular doctor at all I don't have health insurance so if I get sick or something I have to go to the emergency room
1	My doctor is trained in the medical field and I am not. He also faces malpractice if he does not treat me reasonably or does something outside conventional treatments 
-1	Distrust as he's not always forthcoming. Had a recent incident which resulted in x-ray and he deliberately misdiagnosed it. Protecting someone.
-1	I think sometimes doctors get more money-minded than how they care for their patients. They have a tendency to sugarcoat whats wrong with a patient. I prefer that they are open and honest with me when it comes to mine and my familys health.
-1	I don't trust anyone I don't know. Now if they were family and I knew them well then yeah. But anyone I don't know 
-1	They prescribe a pill for whatever ails you and they don't have time to search for the real cause of disease. Too many prescription drugs prescribed for 1-sentence diagnoses 
1	Physicians are in their career for a reason and a lot of trust is involved when they are helping patients out. There is a relationship that builds
-1	I have a nurse practitioner and trust her and doctors in general. However, I think it's important to educate ourselves on our condition and possible treatments. Doctors and care providers may overlook some possibilities. We have to keep in mind that they are seeing many patients and we have our own health, and maybe our family's, to look after.  
1	My primary care physician has taken care of my family for years and is pretty trustworthy. She's also very open about how her decision process works. So I'm fairly confident in her.
-1	I believe my doctor as well as the majority of doctors do keep my best interest in mind. To be in such a field shows and proves that they care about people's well being in general. I feel it is more of the patient who do not follow through with doing what is right for them
-1	I get a general vibe off my instincts on how I feel I should feel about it. There are some doctors that I trust and some I do not on that alone. 
-1	They have all the training and experience to make these types of decisions. Granted there are still some things that a lot of people don't know
-1	Doctors or primary care physicians often rush their patients. A visit is too quick to get to the bottom of one's needs. 
1	My doctor has never steered me wrong before when I've come in with any issues, and he has always seemed very genuine, understanding, and honest. He always makes sure I understand everything and makes sure I know I can always follow up with him about anything if ever necessary. 
-1	I trust y dr to help me decide whats right for me. She has never steered me wrong and makes sure I'm doing what I need to do
-1	Been Seeing Him For 7 Years... Has Kept Me Going The Older I Get...Has Political Views That Cause Me Stress And Irritation...
-1	My primary care physician sometimes did not respond to my request about different treatment options. She swayed me into a specific option without asking my opinion. My friends got a certain treatment option but she did not even let me ask for that,
1	I have found them to be educated, compassionate, trluly concerned, and have my best interests at heart. They take the time to answer my questions and allay my concerns.
-1	He is always to quick to put me on a pill. Does not want to listen to what my contribute to what is going on. Rushes me out the door.
-1	I have never been very close with any of my physicians, and I have had several miserable experiences with medical bureaucracy/billing, so I am more apt to view my exchange with a physician as a business exchange. 
1	My primary care physician is also my mother's primary care physician and has been since I was 7. He became mine when I was 18 and before that point would ask my mother about how I was doing. He is also a rheumatologist and I have rheumatoid arthritis and have since I was 11. He remembers extremely minor details and things about me and my health without having to look through my file every time I visit. He is extremely busy but always takes time to follow up and is very thorough. He is willing to recommend I take a treatment that he cannot provide and is genuinely interested in keeping me in the best health possible.
1	"My PCP goes to great lengths to ask me in-depth questions whenever I go for my checkups; I'm rarely ill.  It's obvious that she's reviewed my history before I'm ushered into her office; she inquires about occurrences in my personal life as well as about my medical issues.  Most importantly, she actually listens to me and respects my opinions and wishes where medical options are concerned; she won't attempt to persuade me if I say I don't want to risk a med because of its potential side effects - she takes me seriously, unlike some doctors I've had in the past.  She's not got a ""cookie cutter"" all-knowing attitude."
-1	I trust her because I have known her for 20 years, and she has always taken care of me and done the best she could to give me options and explanations 
-1	more than likely I trust the doctor to do what they know to do. I trust there education ability. the judgment of the people that hired them to do their job. what I don't trust is take any medication they prescribe to me to take. if they don't give me understanding. if the visit feels rushed
-1	I do not have a personal opinion on how trustworthy my primary is. I assume if they would like to continue in their profession, then they will obviously be trustworthy. Then again this is America haha
-1	I haven't been to my primary care doctor in years. I sometimes feel like doctors over prescribe and over medicalize everything, when there could be more simple solutions. For example, there is proof of doctors over prescribing antibiotics when it isn't necessary.
1	To me no matter what position a person holds it be wise to weigh the trust and distrust. It depends on if I've known my doctor for more than a year to genuinely trust her.
-1	"I've been through 3 primaries in the past 4 months, trying to get diagnosed and treated for hypothyroidism. None has been a great experience; the first one was very hard to reach, the second ignored my question about additional tests (I left a message with the receptionist and never got a return call), and the third, while explaining one part about how insurance works that the other two should have done (they all knew I'd been out of the ""system"" for more than 20 years), also ignored a question I left with a receptionist. I'm not sure whether I will stay with her. At this point I feel like there is no such thing as a good PCP."
-1	anyone who has spoken to a health professiol knows they don't know everything. more often than not, they have no opinion about some new drug or treatment you are going to ask them about because in fact, you have done more recent research and are probably talking about something that has yet to be in widespread use. they will rely on things that have worked in the past and give the same answers they always give rather than go out of their way. speaking for myself, I don't have a regular routine so I may never see them again and they know it
1	I feel completely confident in my health care professional. He is very trustworthy and I have never had any issues talking to him about any of my medical problems. 
-1	I trust a physician to truly want wha tis best, but I do not trust that they will pick the best solution instead of prescirbing the easiest pharmaceutical drug or highest paying one.
-1	Because they is here to help you and take care of you you should be able to trust yoir doctor or any other doctor 
-1	I do trust my doctor for most things but I do believe that doctors do not take people serious unless they can see actual signs themselves. Seems like most doctors send patients back home for a month to see if the symptoms go away or get worse. When most patients come in they have actually already been suffering from the problem for a long time but just waited to see the doctor. I do understand that some patients are lying to the doctor just to get medications or other things. It just seems like the patients really have to convinince the doctor that they really have these problems. I know it has to be hard for the doctors as well because they have to make sure they do not mistreat a patient even if that is what the patient wants. Of course, we have all heard about the few dirty doctors that have lied to patients about have cancer or other illnesses just to profit off the insurance money. We can't forgot about the many drug seeking patients that only want pain pills. That makes it hard on the people who are actually in pain or have cronic pain and really do need pain pills daily. 
-1	I have a new doctor. I am still learning about him. He is older and I trust him but I also pay attention. 
-1	Doctors are humans too and sometimes they might be limited or bound by other things like insurance, law (like they can't insist/suggest rather strongly on doing something when you don't want to) etc. Doctors can make mistake and that's why you always need your second opinion (or even third sometimes).
1	Doctor takes the time to explore any and all problems. Gives the benefit of his knowledge. Never hurries an exam.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician. I sometimes go off of family/friends opinions of a doctor that I am seeing. In general I'm not sure that I trust doctors completely. I think that sometimes they aren't as thorough as they could be because they are trying to get you out of the office so that they can move on to the next patient.
-1	Has a personal caring disposition with me at That is very important to me and my health has a knowledge of getting me to where I am health wise 
-1	my doctor gave me blood pressure meds that i almost died from, when i told her that it has an adverse effect on african americans she said she did not know about that, even though it was all over the paper.
1	I have been with my primary care doctor for more than 8 years. I have also had 2 major medical situations and he has guided me through out the processes. 
-1	My doctor is very open and explains everything and is always there if i need help in anyway. Every time I have a question m doctor gets back to me quickly.
1	My newest doctor is very good.  He takes the time with me to sit in the office after my physical and address any concerns.  This is the first time I have had a doctor that takes enough time with me.  I really do trust him and he explains things to me thoroughly
-1	I've only seen her a couple times but she seems really nice but I'm not sure how thorough she is. They are busy so who know how much they actually think about each patient
-1	"I do trust medical professional to do the right thing or at least provide the correct treatment to their patients, however, I feel that it is very easy in this day and age for a doctor to overlook things (or not want to look into issues further because they are ""sure"" that's not what it is) I also think that doctors tend to over diagnose and test for things they don't necessarily need to in order to receive more money from the insurance companies."
-1	I do not have a stable primary care physician at this time.  With doctors in the past it generally seems as if they are just handling another number in line and waiting to get through to the next person and the person after that.  They generally don't seem to listen very well.  
-1	I don't currently have a primary care physician at the moment, though I have had a few over the years. I've generally had good experiences, but I also take modern medicine on the whole with a grain of salt. The doctors themselves I trust and believe to be good people doing what they feel is in my best interest. But I think the profession on a whole is quicker to treat symptoms than address causes, and put figurative band-aids on things by prescribing pharmaceuticals to address most things. I've persolly solved some of my own medical issues through my own research and by simply applying that knowledge to take better care of myself through nutrition and exercise. I don't think those basic things are offered up and encouraged often enough - but that may be just as much a reflection on our quick-fix society itself who wants a fast and easy way out of a problem rather than putting work in themselves. So in that case doctors are often doing what their customers want.
-1	I distrust my primary physician because i don't think he took the time to really get to know me as a person and not just his patient
1	I trust my Primary care physician, because Iam still alive. My always shows patience and kindness while staying professional
-1	This would be doctors in general. While I had a few doctors I trusted completely (in another state), I currently don't have that trust established here. I don't like to fight what is the right type of birth control pill to take (one phase or several phases) and then getting a prescription for the wrong type anyway and having another battle.  That was only one instance and one doctor (who is no longer my doctor). I had other issues where I had to take a stand to make sure that my preferred treatment was even considered.  I am not talking about altertive remedies, but established treatments.
-1	Giving me information about my laboratory results in a broad way and explains every detauls whats going on with my condition
-1	I have had way too many bad doctors in the past. I literally had a doctor look at my mom when I was 5 and tell her it wasn't if I got cancer due to my family history, it was when (while I was sitting there). After that, I started having anxiety about going to doctors and my health. I was severely overweight and another doctor told me to run and eat less. I wasn't physically capable of running. My knees were damaged. I have never been able to trust a doctor to look out for my health. 
1	ive had past xperiences with my physician like a family doctor.and my doctor tells me everything that i need to know about my condition.
-1	They have never given me a reason not to trust them and everything they've ever done for me worked out well. I also generally agree with the treatment or advice they give me too.
1	I have just never had any problems. I've been seeing the same doctor for years and years. I feel like there is no reason to not trust her.
-1	Well in general I do not trust people. But overall I trust what he is saying. I will get a prescription if I must on his recommendation. I will go see him from time to time to check up. But I don't believe everything sometimes I take my own advice as well.
-1	I trust doctors cause they know what may or may not be wrong with me and how to fix it. But doctors are expensive especially if you don't have insurance to cover the medical bills. I myself may not go because of the expenses.
-1	I do not have a doctor so it is hard for me to answer these questions they do not apply to me fully at this moment
-1	He doesn't have a deep understanding of some issues, like mental health, but has some standard medications and advice that he shares. Even though there's some areas he could be better in, he's not one of those stubborn primary care doctors that have it in their heads that they know everything.
1	I love all the doctors i am seen by. I trust in them the best situation and treat for anything I'm treated for.
-1	 i trust or distrust your primary care physician because he is good and stuff like that and its easy to talk to them openly about everything you need to talk to a doctor about in a situation
-1	I had a primary physician I completely trusted. He always initiated thoughts that I had before I could state them, he spoke to me as a person and did what he could to maximize what insurance allowed, and did more. Current physician is nothing compared to him.
-1	They seem to worry about other issues when I go to see them. I went for a sore throat and end up getting a test for something else.
1	I feel that doctors are generally trustworthy as if they're not, then what is the point of them chosing their profession if they just want to scam people?
1	I have had skin cancer and my PCP referred me to a specialist which resulted in the removal of a skin cancer.  He always asks if there is anything different in my physical condition that might cause problems, and is never in a big hurry to end my appointments.
-1	I trust my Dr. but I also research my options on my own. I believe the Dr. acts in my best interest but still may not know what is best for me. Is is always better to be informed.
1	I have a holistic doctor, who is a trained MD and oriental medicine practitioner. I trust her guidance and follow her instructions, but I don't ignore my own intuition if it conflicts with what she says.
1	For the most part, I put a great deal of trust in my doctors.  I listen to their diagnosis and try to ask relevant questions until I have a good understanding of the condition and subsequent treatment plan.  I do however try to verify on my own and if I do have more questions, I do not hesitate to get a second opinion from another reputable health care provider.  I have, however, not had a bad experience with the various doctors that I have sought treatment from. 
-1	The reason why I trust my physician is because I don't think she will lead me wrong. If so, then leading me or giving me the wrong medical treatment is not only a bad decision but it can cost law suits.
1	been going to my doctor for 40 years never had any promplems he doeas everyb thing he can to see I get the care I need to stay healthy
-1	My PCP usually addresses all of my concerns, and will triage them accordingly. He's also cared for me during some more recent, complicated health issues, so I trust he knows my health concerns just as well as I do.
1	I trust my doctor she is always listening and gets to the bottom of it or she keeps trying! The office is also friendly and supportive.
-1	i think doctors have a general sense of care about the patient that over exceeds any kind of selfishness they may have 
-1	I trust my doctor because she explains everything in depth and uses terms that are understandable. Also she is very comforting and has a good bedside manner.
-1	he is considerate and open with helping me with my illnesses almost always right and usually gives me choices
-1	The doctors ive seen lately come in the room like a tornado .they are always in a huge hurry theres no way they can properly diagnose patients 
1	I trust my doctor because she is always honest with me and I have never had a reason to not trust her. She is good at her job and a very nice person, so it is easy to trust her and her opinion
-1	I believe doctors in general are well-trained, but even they make mistakes at times. I am not sure of the accuracy of that specific doctor.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that she truly cares about my well being.  If a medication is too expensive/not covered by my health insurance, she will suggest a generic alternative that works just the same and saves me money.
1	I trust my primary care physician because because she is imformative when it comes to my over all health,because i can tell she cares about her patients and she makes sure i follow up on everthing i have to do to stay healthy, she explains in full details about my meds, easy to talk to thats why i trust her as my primary care physician
-1	I feel that my primary doctor is very trustworthy but is quick in the amount of time he allots to my visits. I would like a doctor to spend all necessary amount of time with me to explain everything and answer all of my questions.
-1	I have had plenty of experiences with doctors where they don't even seem to exam whatever concern you have, they just brush it off or prescribe something so that they can get on with their day. Rather than really looking into something, i think they'd rather just treat everything as if its routine even if it isn't. Add on the fact that I can walk into a doctor's office and see a cutout of a pharmaceutical that they are being paid to push and it makes me feel like they're here to be salesmen instead of helping.
1	I trust my primary care physician because they have not given me any reason to not trust them.  I believe in the basic trust of professiols that I interact with.  If I didn't trust them I wouldn't go to them for treatment.
1	My doctor is honest and takes what I say into consideration instead of having God complex like a lot of doctors seem too.
1	I've known my physician for over 25 years. She is smart, thorough and compassionate. She is an excellent medical professional and I recommend her to others quite often. 
1	He has not given me, at this time, no reason to not trust him. I do not have much to say I am a person of few words. 
-1	I just got a new doctor and she seems to looking out for my best interest. I question her sometimes but everything is explained and discussed to my satisfaction.
-1	I think he listens to me and I trust him very much. He is thoughtful and takes the time needed to discuss conditions with me. He is a respected doctor and takes the time to answer all of my questions
-1	I don't trust in chemical drugs ,I believe in Nature's cures but I just don't trust anyone knowledgeable to know but yet with the audacity gives you chemicals. 
-1	If you can't trust your Doctor, who can you trust? Even if you have some misgivings, it doesn't hurt to go get a second or even third opinion to allay some of your fears. It's not like Doctor's really have an incentive to lie to their own patients.
-1	My PCP is too nonchalant about my medical conditions and has ignored my high blood pressure in multiple appointments. He is also fat and diabetic, so...
-1	Sometimes I feel that there are other options  to be taken in my care. Some medicine I think that are prescribed have too many side affects. The doctor doesn't listen to the way I tell him how they make me feel.
1	I have no reason not to trust my physicians. They have always given me information that is thorough and thoughtful.
-1	Don't have a physician and primary care. Or doctor to trust or distrust in a general care need in general
-1	Sometimes doctors can be wrong. I trust them but when ever I have big doubts I'll try to get a second opinion, just in case.
-1	I feel that she wants the best for me however, trying different medications with no foreseeable outcome has been rough. She hears me but doesn't give me the drug in which would benefit me most. She has the best intentions in trying the safest method however it seems to be a bit stunted.
1	I have had no problems with my doctors recommendations to date. Everything my doctor has suggested has been to my positive benefit. And if I have a problem my doctor is always willing to talk about alternatives.
1	Because he sit and carefully ask me if O understand everything he has told me.He does things expect a doctor to do instead of just seeing me and rushing me out of his office like some doctors do.
1	I trust her because she has always told me the exactly how she felt about any situation. She answers all questions the way she sees fit and now just because it would be what I want to hear. She is straight forward with anything she tells me. She also has never told me wrong and has helped me a lot.
-1	I think in the USA Doctors have to worry too much about the bottom line, that is if people do not have high levels of insurance they will not receive all options available to them since they are unable to pay for them. 
-1	I have been to many different doctors and a lot of them have told me that there have been things wrong with me that there were proven to not be. I was diagnosed with something then I went to a specialist that completely disproved the other doctors diagnosis. In my belief the doctor who originally diagnosed me was just trying to get more money from me and have me pay for treatment for a problem that I didnt even have.
-1	I don't have a PCP, so I'm just going based on random visits I have. Doctors seem rushed and unwilling to challenge anything other than their first assessment. 
-1	I'm in between PCPs (switched insurance based on marriage). I answered the questions based on my last one, who was a resident, fresh out of med school. She would take a lot of time to talk with me about issues, but more for herself/understanding things. She referred me to a dermatologist for an issue I still have, and I completely mistrusted the derm because he wanted me on 4 medications for something simple, even after I told him none of them worked in the past. This made me not want to trust my old PCP in her referral judgement.
-1	I cant say whether or not if i trust or distrust my  doctor. In all honesty it depends upon the situation at hand.
1	I have been going to my primary care doctor a long time and usually what she recommends turns out to be very helpful.
1	I don't have any specific reasons, I think I am just inclined to believe what my doctor is saying is accurate. I almost never doubt my doctor, or any doctors I have seen.
-1	I have a doctor that will really listen to me and will sit an evaluate my situation and symptoms with me while explaining everything.  She is great at making me feel like she really cares and tries so hard to do what's best for me and figure out the best treatment plan for me. 
1	I have a very nice woman as my primary doctor. I can trust anything she tells me to do or take.
1	I think he is great. He takes great care of me. He makes sure I do what I need to to feel better. He always listens
1	I trust my doctor because she has a lot of experience in her field. I have tried the advice given to me and have seen improvements in my health
-1	Sometimes I feel like they do not really compassionate about helping people but instead try to milk the insurance
1	My doctor is good because he is older and experienced. He is not overly persoble or chatty, so I don't feel a closeness with him. That is okay to me, as long as he is doing a thorough job. I know he has a lot of patients, so I never feel like I am getting extremely persolized attention, but he is a pro.
1	I trust my primary care physician because the last time I had a medical question to ask, I recognized his answers weren't just answers that benefitted either himself or someone he had close ties to. He informed me of options he that he personally told me he didn't agree with but made sure to say to me he understood my decision is not his yet he wanted me to understand the full picture. He didn't have to do that but he did and with a situation like that made me trust he had my best interest at heart.
-1	I do not have a primary physician and I have been to a few different ones that have not felt right. 
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because in the past they regularly suggest things that aren't necessary, but that are extremely expensive. They seem to have no understanding that not everyone can afford anything they want. They act like money is no object. I don't think they're looking out for my best interest.
-1	I don't have full trust in my PCP due to an incident with my husband.  6 weeks after his office visit they notify him that he needs to have an ultrasound on his kidneys because his cortizone levels were high and they thought his kidneys were failing.....6 WEEKS LATER THEY NOTIFY HIM THEY FEEL HIS KIDNEYS ARE FAILING.  Then 3 months later the office contacts him about whether he had this other test done (can't recall the specific test) of which he informed him that NO ONE made him aware he needed this done.  3 months they wait to see if he had it done!!!  I call it negligent or they have to many patients and can't keep up with their responsibilities.
-1	My doctor has my best interest in mind. She is very thorough and always checks to make sure everything is ok with me. She also understands my state of mind and experiences so she is very healthy to deal with 
-1	She listens to what I say, she remembers or has notes about my concerns from previous visits (such as disdain for taking drugs).  Sometimes I wish she was a bit more firm with me about things like my weight, etc.
1	She is laid back and doesn't get worked up about stuff that isn't important.  She let's me know to relax and not worry. 
1	The biggest reason I trust my primary care physician is because she has not given me a reason to distrust her. Her advice and treatments are well explained and they work. 
1	She takes the time to listen to my problems, provides thorough exams and refers me to others if it's outside of her expertise.
1	I had a serious medical problem two years ago and my primary care doctor has been great with all the following up that has to be done and have explained everything to me the time.
-1	I trust my doctor to an extent. They seem very passionate and wonderful whenever I am a patient, but it's hard to get in touch with them. They don't always have great follow through and they always seem rushed. 
1	I trust my Dr completely, his communication with me is always good and I have complete confidence in his communication.
1	I believe in giving my doctor all the information so as to get the best treatment options.  I trust that my doctor has my best interest at heart and feel she would not purposfully give me bad advice.
-1	I trust my doctor because he gives me options. He also tells me I don't have to do anything I don't want. So with that being said I really trust my doctor. Alot of doctors just tells you what needs to be done so they can collect the pay and mobe right on to the next patient.  My doctor takes his time and make sure I'm comfortable with the decision that I come up with or he tell me how much time I have to decide on decision. 
1	I trust my doctor since they have the ability to know and they have the perspective to know whats going on
-1	i read my medical documents, and they are two-faced, call my condition fake, reason that I lost my disability.  
1	Doctors are there for you, regardless of the golfing and high salaries.  Because if they fail, there will be lawsuits - which will cost hospitals lots of money and reputation.
1	My doctor I have know for almost 20 years, he is always been friendly and trusting and I have never once had an issue with my care. He always has been honest and helped me through anything I have come across. He always makes me feel like I am a priority.
-1	I've been using the same primary care physician for years, so there's a familiarity there. He understands my needs and the ways in which I prefer to address possible medical issues. 
-1	Because they a medicaldegree and you have to put some trust into them . Putting your heLth in someones hand you just have to pray and keep the faith they know what they are doing
1	My doctor is caring and kind. She cares about the quality of life I have and experience. She's thorough and professional. She cares about me as an individual. She explains.
-1	I don't think MDs know all of the options for treatment and, therefore, always recommend the options that they are most familiar with or have the latest buzz in jourls or commercials or get the best meals from the local sales representative. They are human and they habits and are easily influenced.
1	I usually trust my primary care physician as I am taking treatment with her for a long time and she is a good friend of me and she used to give a good treatment and guide me in good manner.
1	My Dr. is very good, caring, and is one of the better ones the local Free Clinic in my community has.  My first confidence in her was also boosted a little when after a first medical appointment I also had needed to get a perscription refilled for anxiety/depression and found that the psychiatric nurse I see at a Human Development Center my community has not only knew her but said that she felt that I was in good hands having been put in the physician's hands then proceeded to tell me a little about her background, experience, etc.  She also had suspected pre-diabetes in me, we did the blood test which proved right and I started following her reccomendations and feel much better.  She is also very humble- I went to thank her after an appointment using the title Dr., and her last me.  She immediately corrected me, thanked me for thinking that and said that she was only a P.A. and would prefer use of her first me.
1	I've been to doctors in the past that didn't listen, didn't ask questions, didn't explain conditions or medications thoroughly, and always acted like they were in a rush and had something more important to do. My current doctor is the exact opposite of what I've described.
1	My doctor helped cure the problems I had with my neck and shoulder for over a year and listened to everything I said and was very helpful in getting everything done. It was better than seeing other doctors I had seen before.
1	My doctor explains most things clearly to me. He genuinely shows he cares and checks up on me outside of the office. Quick to answer my concerns as well.
-1	Some Doctors care about their patients and other Doctors care about their wallet. There are so many sick patients out here that needs help but their not getting it.
1	I always trust my doctor because there is no reason not to. She went to many years of school to do what she does, and she took an oath. She looks out for my health.
-1	I think doctors try to push too many drugs and don't give alternative and lifestyle treatments that would be better.
-1	I feel that my doctor is completely up front and honest in all aspects that I deal with him. he has a very good reputation.
-1	I trusted my doctor because she qas trying to help me  with my pain without medication. I believed she had my best interest at heary
-1	I believe that doctors are trained to be trustworthy and have taken an oath to put their patient's interest above all. Of course, there are some doctors who fail at patient interaction in any number of ways, but I believe them to be the minority.
1	It comes from experience. he is very honest and explains everything. I don't know what else you want to know
-1	Because she is thorough. I have been going from doctor to doctor before I find this one about medical problems. She was the only one that ordered tests and found my problem, which was a spil cord tumor.
-1	I feel as if some times my doctor is not listening to my whole story. I try to say something and it is sometimes disregarded when I believe it would be important to take into consideration.
-1	I have issues sometimes with the doctor's staff doing things to make my treatment more difficult. They sometimes do things against my doctor's orders.
1	I trust my doctor because I know they aren't going to tell me wrong they have a phd so I know they Aren't going to tell me wrong 
-1	i live in a very small town i broke my wrist and was told it was healed after 3 months wearing a cast it was still broken no one here could properly identify the fracture i drove 3 hours to a specialist did an xray and said so yea your wrist is broken and now it's detioriated since its been so long (i walked around with a broken wrist 5 more months before going to a specialist it was hell) so yea i have no faith in medical professiols especially ones in my small secluded town
1	I trust my physician because he has never steered me in the wrong direction. Every time I had a medical condition he has been able to properly diagnosis it and come up with a treatment option. He always offered multiple treatment options that I could take.
-1	There are times when find that my doctor did treat or evaluate me properly. So i feel like i can't completely trust them . 
-1	They have many years of training, and I do not. That's the long and short of it, really. I trust them.
-1	i dont even understand that question either. i am tired of these people over here. they are out of control. i dont think they have any original thoughts in their head.
-1	I recently encounter a medical situation in which most of the problem was created by doctors non-expertise in that area. 
-1	It's always wise to get a second opinion or look for more information. Doctors are not perfect and cannot know every single bit of medical information in the world. There may be newer treatments or updated diagnoses. Also, some doctors are kind of in bed with the pharmaceutical industry and might recommend a drug just to increase sales. This is not necessarily common, but not unheard of either.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She is thorough and always asks me the right questions. She takes the time with me that expect and answers all my questions and handles all of my concerns. She has a great reputation.
1	I've been  with this Dr since grade school  he's very  good  and honest person  I trust him with my life
-1	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE I HAVE GONE TO HIM FOR MANY YEARS.  I CAN ASK QUESTIONS AND HE ALWAYS EXPLAINS THING ADN TAKES GOOD CARE OF ME.
1	My doctor is kind and thoughtful.  When I go for a check up, we review what transpired at the last physical.  She gives me a complete check up and we discuss meds.
-1	because it is in his own best interest to what would best for me. This what he has trained for and has taken an oath to do what is best for his clients. so I believe he would do what is best for men.
-1	I have several friends in the medical profession and the horror stories they have told me, as well as the life or death situations some of my less healthy friends have had to suffer because of poor care at a hospital, has tainted my view of the profession. Medical Error. Overwork, Carelessness, Corporate Pressure, Ignorance. It's all a big problem. 
-1	My doctor has consistently demonstrated a high level of knowledge and empathy to me when i talk with them about any health conditions. I dont feel like they judge me or take prejudice with me 
-1	I think most of them try what's best for a patient. They might not be right, but their heart's in it. I think they make mistakes, but as long as they're not too stubborn to change what they're doing.
-1	I feel about average about these things. I think there are goo physicians but I also think some don't take things seriously. 
-1	The physician I had been seeing for the last several years left the area, and I only recently saw a new doctor. I have usually had female doctors in the past, but my new doctor is male. He is also my husband's doctor, and my husband likes him, so I decided to give him a try. I've only seen him once, but we got along very well. He took his time, asked questions and patiently allowed me to ask any questions I had. I liked him but it may take time for me to trust him as much as I did my former physician.
-1	I don't really trust doctors because they work with insurance companies to benefit their pockets instead of their patients. This can cause serious malpractice and misdiagnosis.
1	So far things my doctor recommends have worked. I don't always take everything prescribed though.  She always answers all my questions 
-1	I have taken pre-med courses and have a friend who is a doctor.  Sometimes I think that's why I'm not as blindly confident when it comes to healthcare in general.  Doctor's make mistakes.  It is up to me ultimately to make the decisions about my own healthcare, given a doctor's guidance.
1	I've had my PCP for a while and he is probably the most down to earth doctor that I've come across. Always explains things throughly, always gives options.
-1	I feel like they see so many patients in a given day, that they do not remember you on a personal level, therefore they do not really have a clue what you're really going through.  I trust what they think based on ME having to point out every single little symptom I experience.  
1	My doctor seems to have a genuine interest in my well being. I am open and honest with him which I feel is rare in patient-doctor relationships. I don't see any reason for him to be dishonest with me. He takes time to know my needs and problems so he can effectively treat them.
-1	Some time it feels they dont  believe you what you telling. Or they seems like they so busy  and have not much time for you and spending much time with computer not with the patient. 
-1	I feel like most mainstream doctors are in trained to only treat symptoms and not cure and heal the body as a whole. Big Pharma is a huge business and many of those doctors get incentives for keeping people coming in. Holistic doctors would be concerned with treating and curing ( and maybe  few doctors).
-1	I trust him because he always takes the time to do the correct test. He listens to my concerns and questions then explains everything calmly to me. 
-1	I trust doctors because they know what they are talking about and you can rely on them to keep your best interest at heart. 
1	I have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I have been with my primary care physician for almost my entire life, so we have had plenty of time to develop a good rapport and a good relationship. I trust her with my concerns and with explaining things to me so I can understand them
-1	I have gotten a new primary care physician in the past year and she has been more thorough and careful than any doctor I've had previously.  My past PCP rushed through appointments and gave me prescriptions without much concern.  My new PCP is careful to suggest medications and tries to find if altertive therapies may work better and to ensure that I am really getting something I need.  
-1	I trust my doctor because I've never been given a reason not to. They are the medical professiols with years of training and education and I should defer to their recommendations unless they give me a reason not to trust them.
1	He is always warm and welcoming, very professional but he smiles enough to not make me nervous. The top reason I'm happy with him though, is because he actually treats me when I am ill, before I had him I ended up with shingles, and my current doctor (back then) told me that I'd have to tough it out. I switched to him immediately and he got me the medication I needed, he even had his office call me to see how I was feeling. 
1	he knows what he is talking about tats atatdr is all that i can think of at this time isaid that it is
-1	I like my doctor.  She took me on as a patient even though she was not accepting new patients.  She helped me through a very difficult time.  She listens to what I have to say and especially how I feel.
-1	I do not completely trust my doctors because I don't have a primary care physician and I see different doctors when I go to the doctor.
-1	I think my doctor is knowledgeable however I sometimes feel rushed during appointments.  My doctor answers my questions but I feel like he doesn't want to take the time to thoroughly answer everything.
-1	I am a very critical person. So I am always looking for more information than what is given. It has nothing to do with my doctor being a bad doctor, and more with my inquisitive disposition. 
1	He just makes me feel like he cares a lot about me.  He is very caring and attentive to any of my concerns.
1	Iâve been seeing Dr Lewis for 11 years. Heâs very direct and to the point but also understanding and has compassion for what he does. 
1	I have had the swam PCP for nine years and I always feel like she pays attention to my symptoms if I have any and normally takes what I say seriously. She is very attentive, and caring. My entire family sees her and she is the same way with each one of them. 
1	I trust my doctor because she has been my primary care physician for many years. She has never steered me wrong. I have confidence in her abilities because even though she has been with me for many years, she has been a doctor many years before that. She is very knowledgeable and she is very kind. We know each other well and I trust her completely. I feel very comfortable with her. 
1	I finally found a PCP who listens to me and knows I know more about my condition than he does. I will listen to his advice about other medical issues that I know little about 
1	MY DOCTOR IS ALL OF THE ABOVE. I HAVE A NICE RE PORE WITH MY DOCTOR AND THE STAFF, WHERE HIS OFFICE IS LOCATED!!
1	He is very knowledgeable. He listens to my concerns. He tried to help me understand and breaks things down for me 
1	I have no reason not to trust my primary physician . He has always seemed concerned and knowledgeable, always making sure my needs have been taken care of.  
1	In addition to a primary care physician, I also have many specialists and sub-specialists.  I find my primary-care physician works well with these other doctors to ensure positive outcomes.
1	I trust my doctor because I have known him for years, and he has cared for me the to the best of his ability.
-1	She has disregarded my concerns about genetic problems in my family that I show symptoms of having.  She believes that I'm lying when I talk about back or knee pains.
-1	They spend so little time with patients that it's very tough to get to know a person's individual lifestyle and complete health profile. There is a lot of pressure to see many patients in a day which burdens doctors and leads them to rushed decisions.
-1	I think some physicians knows what they doing while some makes some mistakes...but all in all they are ok
-1	"I've had a bad history with doctors. They tend to condescend to me, to pick on me for my weight until I get compulsive and self-destructive about my eating habits, and give me drugs that wreak lasting havoc on my system and then just shrug it off (""Oh, well, that doesn't happen to most people.""). This one seems good, like he actually listens, but I'm still wary."
-1	Previous experience in which a major medical issue was overlooked for years resulted in me not trusting doctors
-1	While doctors are educated in their field, they are still human and are capable of making mistakes. Some of them are more interested in their wallet than in you. Some of them have varying degrees of experience. Some of them are just better at specific conditions and not so good at others. Doctors are still just people and suffer the faults of people.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is very straight forward with me and objectively tells me about my health situation good or bad.
-1	I trust my primary physician because he seems to have my best interest at hand. he listens to my opinions and when I questions his decisions and explains why
-1	I just switched to a new PCP after a move. I have a very pleasant visit with my new doctor and I felt he was honest, listened to my concerns and friendly. 
1	I have a very good doctor who listens and is caring.Also spends a lot of time explaining things.She also offers suggestions and is easy to get an appointment with.
1	I feel that even though doctors are busy and rushed, and can't always possibly have enough time in the day, or in general, to give you the individualized attention you seek, they still know you depend on them. They value the importance you place on them and what they can provide, and they have a moral code that they abide by to make sure they give the best care possible. I know that doctors are also capable of making mistakes, and some doctors are better than others, but it would be an impossible task oftentimes to be able to find a doctor that would be able to give you the best individualized care and information possible in a manageable timeframe. It often feels like it's not necessary, either, as in most cases, with most people's problems, most doctors will suffice.
-1	I don't distrust doctors I'm an optimist and.like to.loom at the bright side of things . knowing that they are given the knowledge to perform their job
1	I have been with my primary care physician for a long period of time.  I have gained a healthy relationship and trust level with her. She has always giving me straight-forward advice and information. Whenever I've asked of side effects or possible outcomes she has always giving me the knowledge and confidence the positive effect greatly out way the negative.
1	i trust my doctor because i have had her for years and whatever treatment she gives me always makes me better and i always do my study on a person medical or non medical background
1	She was recommended to me by a friend i trust. She listens to my concerns and addresses them. She is warm, sympathetic, and seems very intelligent and competent.
-1	My primary care physician has many many other patients and very little time, is constrained from making definitive statements, and is affected by the pharmaceutical companies they receive benefits from, their insurance, my insurance, and their own social personal and religious biases.
1	He has been my primary care physician for my entire life. He has never let me down in the past so I have no reason to expect him to in the future. He is a reliable person overall.
1	I trust my doctor since i feel like they are just looking for what is best for me
1	I have been treating with my doctor for more than 10 years. Everything he tells me or recommends has helped my overall health.
1	I trust them because they have always been straightforward with me. There is  no reason to question them so I don't.
-1	I trust the GYN I have, she takes her time and sits to answer my questions and chat. I never feel rushed or neglected by her. I have been to doctors in the past though that spend minimal time with you and it doesn't feel like they actually care about you.
1	I have complete faith in my doctor's abilities and believe that my well-being is at the top of their interests. I feel there is no reason to mistrust my doctor.
-1	I trust my primary doctor, due to a length of time with him and believe he is honest . I would hope my doctor is honest with myself, and all his patients, when it comes to my health and others health.
1	For me, it is because I was his office nurse for 28 years, so I know him very well.  He is a good doctor.  I did not always agree with everything he said, but as a patient or as an employee, we could still work it out.
-1	I trust my doctors because they have been there for me and have helped me find medical conditions that I didn't know existed and without them something bad could have happened.
1	I trust my doctor because, she always seems to have my best interest at heart when every i go to see my doctor for something she always go in to deep questioning into what is the problems i am having, and when she prescribe a diagnosis and or medication she always take the time explain everything i needs to know she never rushes with her patients. 
-1	Are usually trust my doctors about 80% you can truly trust them 100% because some doctors do make mistakes and thatâs why itâs always a good to always ask a lot of questions and if you have any doubts get a second
-1	I feel like my primary care doctor has a lot to accomplish by stating what might be wrong with me but also feel like they are just doing their job 
-1	well, you baited a lot of negative opinions about primary care. Also, I have issue with your question which assumes that primary care is bad. It's not. People like it. It can make you a comfortable living, and can be extremely rewarding just like any other specialty.
-1	I think doctors for the most part are very knowledgeable and truly care about their patients, but I think that the way our healthcare is run, doctors don't have enough time to fully develop the best plan of action.
-1	It is not that I do not trust my doctor as much as I am aware that he is human, has a lot on his plate and is therefore subject to error.  I do believe in getting a second option when I don't believe that a concern is been met.
1	I don't know how to treat my self so I would not try and my doctor when to school for it so I listing to what my doctor say.
-1	I usually choose a primary care physician with lots of experience. I based my trust off of his experience and user review online.
-1	I recently had to switch primaries and she isn't as easy to talk to nor as thorough. I always feel rushed when I see her
1	I trust my doctor mainly because he has very good listening skills and is attentive to my needs and concerns. He is most easy to talk to and never attempts to talk over my head. Even though he is a young physician, I feel most comfortable with him. I do not usually get stressed out when I go to my physician. I can't say that I really look forward to getting and sick and needing my physician's care, but at the same time, I do not dread having to schedule a visit with him.
-1	My doctor and I disagree about pain management.  I would rather live with some pain and not be on pharmaceuticals, and he thinks it makes more sense to take pharmaceuticals to reduce (but not eliminate pain) despite negative side effects.  I think many doctors don't understand what it really means to manage a chronic pain problem.  Taking pills everyday is not everyone's first choice.
-1	I've only seen my PCP a handful of times and during the times I visited her, I was sick somewhat mentally so I am unable to remember the first few times I've seen her. I've seen her briefly since then but she never did much to help me, just sent me to see other people. 
-1	My doctor misdiagnosed me for two years. When I found out what was wrong with me he refused to listen. I hired an attorney and had him send a letter so I could get a referral to a neurologist. They agreed with my self diagnosis. Same thing happened with my GYN and my chronic problems. They could do a google search and help me but their fucking egos or laziness stops them.
-1	"I don't trust my primary care physician because she didn't listen to me when I told her the things which were bothering the most. Instead she arranged expensive tests simply because I'm of an age where I need them and should have them first to rule out things before moving on to the things I am most concerned about. I understand that logic, but when a person is in pain and can pinpoint exactly where that pain is, this information shouldn't be ""put off"" in lieu of routine procedures, no matter if you are due for them or not. "
-1	Cause there's no guarantee in what a physician tells you about your state of health and also rely on yourself to take of a health matter that is important to a cause or effect to see how a health matter is a concern to a individual in certain situations.
-1	I think the doctors that I have seen lately , let their degreesâ get in the way of understanding their patients needs, they are quick to offer solutions withoutâ all of the facts..not sure I trust many doctors
-1	I trust them somewhat. They do want the best for their patients. They are also in the pockets of medical industry. They at there to make money too. They may not have the best information and think they are experts because of their education. 
1	I completely trust my primary care physician. She is a kind, considerate and thorough doctor who shows genuine concern for her patients.
-1	It's the same thing or it's something different all the time it's like you wanna believe then again you don't wann believe because you don't know if it's genuine or not 
-1	I am in the process of switching physicians so this is not a question I can answer right now. I had been with my doctor for years, but seem to have lost all faith and trust in him
1	myself and my doctor have developed a great relationship and I trust him. until he gave me information to believe otherwise i will continue to trust him.
1	My physician has always been very open about what she thinks I should do about any condition that I am curious about at the time.  She has always been very thorough in her explanation of things and questions me as to whether I have any questions at all.
-1	I do not have a primary care doctor. Generally I have some trust in doctors as I respect the title but I also know doctors can be overworked so it is natural at times for them to work for there convienance. Most doctors nowadays are heavily influenced by pharmaceutical companies as well and I am not into taking meds.
-1	I mostly trust my doctor to give me the right advice and do what is best for me rather than just what is more convenient for him. 
1	there have been times in the past I thought the doctor was not taking my high cholesterol as serious as they should.  However,  I changed my diet and worked out and brought  my level down without medicine so I am glad I did not rely on the drugs. 
-1	Sometimes it feels as if they just want to get through with you and onto the next patient.
-1	It's not my primary care physician in particular that I distrust, It's the fact that doctors are people too and anybody can get lazy and careless at times in their profession or simply be having a bad day. I mildly mistrust all doctors until I have reasonable proof not to do so. There are problems with how the medical field is run in this country and I'm sure there are doctors out there that disgree with things they must comply to on a daily basis which can be disheartening in the longrun. Most doctors have the ability to be great, but I believe it's harder than it has to be. Overall though, I do trust my doctor because I have faith in the decision I made to choose them as my pcp based on my experience with them. 
1	My doctor listens well. He all test needed. Though I think he may have to many patients. At times I feel rushed.
1	I trust her because she is a very honest person. I have her cell number and she is always abvailable.
1	My doctor is a great listener. I never feel rushed or as though I am keeping him from his other patients. He takes time to answer any questions I have and is always kind and pleasant.
1	I have had he same primary physician for 9 years and I trust him with my life because we have formed a bond and I know he cares about me and my well being
-1	After multiple tests, a doctor decided that all my issues were a result of stress and that there was nothing they could do or suggest for me.
-1	I trust my doctor because they are more knowledgeable than I am but I do not give them complete trust until I read and understand the options myself and am able to agree or disagree with them. 
1	My primary physician is a friend who I have known since he was in medical school. He researches constantly and was top of his class for good reason. He knows my health history and respects my personal wants regarding medical care. He also takes time to listen to patients, not just myself, and is always willing to do extra work if need be. 
-1	I know doctors just want to push pills most of the time. I have been fortunate to find a doctor who would rather treat me with something natural first before going to extreme measures. I have had doctors int he past who just want to prescribe something and want you to stick to it no matter what.
-1	Like i previously stated i feel that physicians dont listen or care about me but only the masses and fixing a large number of people and not specifically me. So personally i feel alone and afraid because i am the only one interested in my health and well being.
-1	They are petitioned by pharmaceutical companies to pimp drugs. They don't give you solutions outside of giving you lots of drugs.
1	Because he tells me truthfully the best course to take and it is always right and leads me in the right direction.
1	Because they have good heart and care alot to help people and check there health to make sure there healthy and wants people to live longer and have happy family and friends and have a careersâ they want and doctor save people life because they care about people and there not sick and just want us to live longer and have a Happy life and having fun with family and friends too and we are human being and do want to live longer and have family and friends too 
-1	I tend to be trusting of my primary care physician because he seems very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. It seems like he is genuinely interested in trying to help people. Not just get them in an out.
1	I trust my doctor because she explains everything I. Depth. For me she makes I clear and she gives me options.
1	I've changed doctors when communications were not what I felt were necessary.  My current doctor clearly explains what he feels I need to know and answers any questions I have.  I sometimes follow-up with emails that inquire further and he answers on a timely basis.
1	I have never had an experience with my current primary care physician that would make me question my trust in them.  They have always been helpful, receptive and caring.
-1	I trust my primary physician because he has been my physician for years and he has never told me anything that wasn't right nor treated me in a bad manner.
-1	Doctors are rushed, constrained by my insurance (or lack thereof) and are only human so I have a hard time trusting physicians. I usually put my trust in them though because I don't trust myself either. 
-1	I don't think doctors get to where they are by being selfish and always looking out for themselves. Also, I believe people have an inherent good in them. So even if a doctor is having a bad day or something to that extent, I still think they will do their best to be helpful, answer questions, and get their patients back to normal health or to where they want to be health wise.
1	My doctor holds nothing back from me she explains all options in detail and lets me make the final decision
-1	I generally trust doctors. They're educated, but I also know they're human and can have biases that may sway the education or logic.
-1	He has been my family doctor for many years. He has seen us through many health crisises. He is very  good at referring us when he feels we need specialists.
1	I trust my primary care physician mainly because of how thorough she is when it comes to my overall health and wellbeing. I feel that she hasn't done anything so far to make me start to distrust her.
-1	i would hope i can trust my physician, nobody really knows someone 100% so sometimes there is room for doubt
-1	I've never really had a reason not to trust my physician. They have always given me what I've needed to feel better and have always been thorough and clear. They make things convenient for me.
-1	He listens to my questions and concerns and then tells me what he feels concerning them.  I feel he gives me his undivided attention.
-1	I trust my primary care physician and/all doctors I have selected because I have found them to be competent professionals whom are interested in my general well being and health.
-1	I trust my physician in general medical information, such as if I have the flu or strep throat or something like that. But if it was a serious medical diagnosis I would probably want to get a second opinion to make sure that they were onto something.
-1	I have trust to a certain extent, in doctors generally...never been misdiagnosed or anything. I have sought out second opinions. Most doctors encouraged you do do so, if they are trustworthy.
1	I have had my doctor for a while now and have been to him many times.  He has always been kind, gentle, intelligent, and informative.  I think that he really cares about his patients and me specifically so I trust what he has to say.
-1	I distrust western medicine in general. I feel it is a business more than anything else these days. I also feel it is ignorant about the conscious ture of the universe.
-1	My doctor spends a lot of time with each and every one of her patients. She takes time to get to know them and socialize with them and to explain options and treatments 
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because I have been with him for years, and we have developed a very realistic relationship. He has always been very honest with me in regards to my health, even if he knows it's not something I want to hear, and he portrays how much he cares during our visits. 
-1	A doctor is only one person, and sometimes people make mistakes. It's also impossible for one person to have all the relevant information about an issue. My doctor is competent and I like her, but I always do my own research to verify what she's saying. I like to get multiple opinions, so even if my issues aren't serious enough to seek out a second opinion in person, I'll at least do my research.
-1	Just switched to a new doctor and do not know her well enough to trust or distrust her. I need to get to know her better to make a call on this.
1	When I switched doctors, my new doctor helped me get help for a rash that I've had for four months immediately.
1	I have no reason to distrust doctors and I'm fairly confident that if my doctor did not have my best interests, and the best interests of all his patients in mind, he would not have chosen to be a doctor.
-1	I trust doctors in general. But when it come to me personally that where we seem to have problems
-1	While I don't currently have a primary care physician, in the past I have had pretty good doctors. For the most part, I trust them. However, I take some of what they prescribe or suggest with a little grain of salt. Doctors don't take all of the body's systems into account or preventative care when diagnosing or prescribing. They are taught medicine; not nutrition or other tural ways to heal.
1	I trust my primary care physician because of how long i've known him. he's always welcoming and calming and i've he's always been honest with me and answered all of my questions.
-1	In general, the medical profession is run by corporations and pharmacy companies who are as interested in a profit as they are anything else.  Individual doctors and other medical personal may be more interested in a patient's care, but the institutions themselves are a different matter.  A government intervention is doing nothing to make it any better.
-1	i always follow  our   family doctor because he is updated the lated treatment and medicines etc
1	They have more knowledge and experience than I do so I do trust what they have to say. They took an oath to protect their patients and I believe that most try to follow trough on that oath. 
1	My doctor listens to my concerns without trying to push certain medications or treatment when do not benefit me in the long run.
-1	Sometimes the information is bleak and not easily understood. sometimes i feel like i dont get the treatment or answers that i need.
-1	I trust my doctor because she was someone my mom trusted. My mom had her for years and later recommended her to me. She was instrumental in referring my mom to a doctor who diagnosed her as BRCA1+. So we ended up trusting her. My mom has since passed from BRCA1+-related cancer, but this doctor even called her after my mom was termil, just to say hello and see how she was doing.
-1	in the past she has misdiagnosed me when i was having pain problems, but most of the time she has been very thorough and good
-1	My husband and I have the same doctor.  She always does and suggests many solutions to any problem we are experiencing.  The always trouble shoots are issues, and suggest tests.  I feel that she genuinely cares about her patients.
-1	I don't have a regular physician at the moment but when I do I stick with one who I feel is great at their job
1	This is another young doctor with fresh eyes I went to a set of doctors for seventeen years trusted them totally until about two years ago when I had two huge tumors growing on each upper thigh and this doctor I have now discovered it.
1	The primary care doctor that I have now is the doctor I went to for my second opinion. He seemed to care about what was wrong with me. Explained what he thought was wrong and proceeded to have me do tests. Which is more than the previous doctor I went to had me do.
-1	I trust that my doctor is giving me the information and providing me with the tests and medicine necessary to treat the problems i have
-1	Some doctors do care about their patient's welfare, however other doctors just see dollar signs on the patient's forehead and are just working for money to go on vacations. 
-1	I think that nowadays, most doctors are about the money that they want to make and they will give you the treatment that cost the most even if a cheaper alternative is available.
1	I my doctor has delivered two of my kids and before my kids I was seeing the same doctor, he is a very good doctor 
1	...he is young, discusses his research findings & current opinions, not his personal ones, seeks my input, answers my questions and solicits options, recites what he is documenting, shares printouts w/me of what he has documented & discusses OUR plans. However, he does rely on computers more than I prefer & at times, selections within the computer are not available to address my actual concerns; for example, pain in forearm-nurse only found elbow pain in computer so entered that-PCP discussed elbow pain-redirected to discuss pain in forearm-he kept discussing elbow pain so offered options for that-I declined option for elbow pain & redirected discussion to pain in forearm to no avail, asked perhaps muscle?-ignored/dismissed/discounted? documented tennis elbow & that I declined tennis elbow splint which I did...oh well, another appointment next month to address pain in forearm, partially researched it, found muscle termed brachial-radialis (sp), more to do so am prepared for discussion on next appointment, takes a team to 'git 'er did'! Oh, pain in forearm was only one of other concerns for office visit (monthly weight loss management regime f/u, feeling of something in throat when swallowing, unlike history of swollen tonsils (US ordered), recent pain in forearm when lifting heavy objects). Thank you ~
1	Although I do generally trust my doctor there are times when I feel I am seen as a patient and other times when I feel I am seen like one more hurdle the doctor has to get through before his work day is done. Sometimes it seems it is a quick examination and a treatment and throw me out the door. 
-1	There have been times where my doctor has been wrong. But I do have two specialists that often go the extra mile for me and I feel I can trust. 
-1	I used to hae a primary doctor that I completely trusted. Now, he is retired,so I do not trust doctors so much!
-1	It took me a long time to find a doctor that I trust, but trustworthy doctors are out there. Just like any group of people - there are good and there are bad.
1	My doctor can relate to me and anybody else for that matter. She listens to me and my concerns and make sure that I have little to no worries. 
-1	I someti,es feel that my best interests are not met. I feel like the dr is doing things that require me to have to spend more versus dealing with the issue at hand.
1	With one notable exception, all the doctors that I have dealt with have been professiol, if a bit brusque. For the most part though, I've never gotten any bad advice or diagnosis, so I can't really complain about the bedside manner if they tend to do the job well.
-1	I like my primary physician but she often seems rushed. I'm sure she is honest but not always sure she's thinking very much about what I tell her.
1	I'm not an expert. I defer to my doctor because they are far more qualified to tell me about my health than I am. 
-1	I do not trust doctors in general because I believe they are trained to treat symptoms and not to get to the root of the problem, which, is often related to lifestyle or environment. I feel that sickness is very politically fraught, and that a doctor who was truly honoring the Hippocratic Oath would be obligated to be politically active and to advocate for improved environmental and economic conditions for the poor. Essentially, I feel that doctors and the medical establishment have a vested interest in maintaining people in a state if illness which requires ongoing treatment, rather than helping people become optimally healthy and teaching them how to improve and maintain their own health. 
1	My doctor has been very good these past three years in helping with my health issues. I received referrals to help with two issues. My doctor prescribed medicine for my needs. My doctor also stressed the urgency of taking my medicine.
-1	I believe in my doctor because I have to. It's the way we've built our society to be. Everyone is an expert in something and I simply have to trust that my doctor is the expert in what he does. 
1	I have full trust in my PCP. I have never in all the years I have been seeing her had one issue. She always makes me feel comfortable and answers all questions and concerns I have. She doesn't always take drastic measures but takes things slow to get to a solution. 
1	I have been with him for a long time. He is honest and direct. He doesn't beat around the bush. I trust him immensely
-1	Well, because unfortunately doctoring is a profession, and legal practice if you will. Therefore, there is a certain amount of accountability and responsibility that they must exercise, therefore I may come second to that.
-1	I have only been to this doctor for 2 physicals and I have not had any serious problems so it is hard to judge whether I trust her completely. She seems nice enough and she doesn't force me to do things that I disagree with her about so she seems okay. For instance I have osteoporosis and I have found a very good supplement which is used to treat osteoporosis in Japan and the doctor wanted me to take prescription meds and I refused because of the side effects. She allowed me to go the course I prefer at my own risk. We will see what will happen when the stakes are higher as far as having a more serious health problem ( which I hope does not happen any time soon). 
1	I've little choice in the matter really. My trust would have to be in the institutions that educated the idividual(s).
1	My doctors know that I have a medical degree and know that they can not sugar coat things with me. I prefer to know the truth and will make the best decisions when the facts are presented. I respect them and they respect me.
-1	I have seen many doctors that seem rushed when doing their jobs.
-1	I believe doctors will sometimes skip over something in a hurry to get to the next patient. I do not have any severe illness, but if I did, I would not take the word about care from my primary I would seek out a 2nd and maybe even a third opinion from a specialist.
-1	I do not trust anyone off the bat you have to earn that trust is not free in this world it has to be proven
-1	They push medicine at me and don't look at me as a whole person so just address symptoms as separate.
-1	Most doctors have a good chance to be able for the rest and a few years back I had a good time with the idea of a new person who is a member of the team. 
1	My PC is through, clear on treatment, listens and works in partnership with me in controlling and treating my medical condition(s)
1	My primary care physician seems very thorough. I think he pays attention and he knows his stuff - he seems to know what he's talking about.
-1	Some doctors don't listen to my needs and concerns.  Many doctors act as if they are impervious to my pain.  Doctors have a tendency not to explain enough about the diagnosis or why they picked the prescription drug they prescribed.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician, but base my answers on the experiences I have had with various medical professionals. I have had some negative experiences with medical professionals where I feel they did not give me any valuable advice or services, but I was stuck with a large bill. One example was an experience where I went to a doctor for a birth control prescription. I was told I could not be prescribed the medicine without having my blood drawn, something I have never heard before. A nurse attempted to draw my blood unsuccessfully before asking that I visit a phlebotomist. I got stuck with a bill for an unsuccessful appointment, which generally is covered under my insurance as preventative care. Instead of going to the phlebotomist, I went to another doctor and got what I needed, all included by my insurance.
1	I chose my doctor, for good recommendations, good studies in a university that I trust and good results
-1	"I sometimes feel doctors prescribe way too much medication - pushing the latest drug of choice, which may or may not be a good choice for me.  I prefer to research drugs before using them and would prefer a doctor that would respect when I say ""No that isn't suitable for me - find something else"".  but too many doctors prefer the ""take this pill"" solution."
-1	I believe most doctors a trustworthy and are in that profession because they truly want to help patients which equates to them being trustworthy.
1	I do trust my primary care physician because they are a person who I've been seeing for several years now, and whenever any health problems arise, the solutions provided by said physician are very effective in solving these problems.
1	I trust my primary care doctors because he has always been straight with me. He listens to me and answers all of my questions. If he doesn't know he finds out and tells me later.
1	you go to the doctor for help and in most cases you get it.  they are educated healers an if the fit is right between the two of you there is an easy trust
-1	I currently don't have a primary care doctor so it's hard for me to answer this question. When I do have a problem I will go to an expres clinic and I've had good and bad experiences. More good than bad. I try to put my trust in doctors but sometimes they are worried about getting people in and out of the room like cattle. 
-1	Physicians no longer care about their patients. It's about whatever metric the health system that owns their practice. They typically overbook. They don't care about keeping patients waiting. If you have an additional question that is raised during their cursory assessment, they ask you to make another, separate appointment in order to address those concerns. Nurses are fat and act annoyed that the patients are interrupting their donut break. Another nurse was eating ribs at the desk and barked at me when I had a question. Doctors want to give a quick fix and usually write a prescription instead of looking at the patient holistically and taking the time to do a comprehensive assessment. 
-1	I trust my position because they treat me as if I were their family members. They actually care what I need and what is best for me they ask a lot of questions so that they can figure out the best solutions for me and the best treatment. And often sometimes emotionally there for me during bad times. Great doctor I couldn't ask for anyone better
-1	I don't trust medical doctors very much. The reason is because I feel that there is constantly contradictory medical advice and I think that many of the practicing doctors were taught information that is now old and they are stuck in their ways. I would much rather have a young doctor than an old one because old doctors are mostly ignorant to advances in science and how to treat illness before it comes on.
1	I trust my physician because I know that they will do what I ask. They are very trustworthy and I know they will do everything they can to help me
-1	"I am a skeptical person in general.  I feel that for the most part I can trust my doctor, but sometimes people forget that doctors are people too.  I work in a hospital and have heard doctors and nurses talking ""off the record.""  These kind of experiences can really change the way a person views healthcare."
-1	I feel like I am just a person who trust anyone easily. In the moment, I ain't thinking about anyone messing with me
-1	I have been going to the same Doctor since I was a child, they care but they also don't make any money off me if I'm dead
-1	I just recently started to see my doctor. He seems to have a good bedside manner. He spends time with me and listens and is trying to help me resolve my issue 
-1	I wouldn't say I trust or distrust doctors in general. I just believe that they can be wrong or inaccurate at times.
-1	I trust my physician because they are a medical authority and have dedicated their life work to understanding medicine.
-1	I distrust my PCP because doctor's today have to think first about appeasing insurance providers and covered procedures in a health insurance policy as opposed to what is best for the patient. As a result of this I don't think my Doctor's word can be trusted.
-1	I trust the doctor because that is his job.  I have never been given any indication that he was unable to perform his duties.  I would hope that I would be given the same courtesy.
-1	No human is infallible, and too often people in positions of power, such as a doctor, can get a bonus for encouraging certain courses of behavior. I like to do my own, unbiased research instead of blindly following new orders. 
-1	I distrust my primary care physician because one time when me and my sister both went for a check-up, he prescribed both of us potassium pills. I was living on campus for college at the time and had a completely different diet than my sister back at home. It was strange that all of a sudden, we both had low potassium. I ended up not taking mine because mine were huge pills that were a capsule, and I have a hard time swallowing pills. I just ate a couple bananas for a few days. He never prescribed them to us again.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician - I see numerous different doctors in a charity clinic setting.  Some of these doctors I trust as they have a good bedside manner and are clear in their instructions and information.  Others are lacking in bedside manner and seem cold and impersonal, with little care about explanations or answering questions or concerns.
1	She has been my doctor for the last 11 years, and as soon as I met her I trusted her.  She was warm and caring and took time to listen to me.  She is extremely thorough and such a great doctor. 
-1	I trust most doctors I go to I normally go off of their attitudes, I dont like a doctor that doesnt show compassion or caring, thats how I rate a doctor.
1	I think my doctor really cares about his patients, as all should. I've never once even gotten a slight implication that my doctor wasn't doing what was best for me.
-1	I have had bad experiences in the past with doctors and i have learned what to look out for when it comes to bad care.
-1	I trust them but sometimes they want test that I feel are unnecessary that cost me to much money that I do not have and the test come back ok anyways
-1	Doctors can be wrong, I have been in scerios where I have gotten multiple diagnoses from  multiple doctors upon getting a second, and third opinion.
-1	I have never had major health problem. My doctor has done well in yearly physical exams and I think she will be good if I have a major health issue 
1	I trust my doctor because he has always given me good advice. I have never felt the need to get a second opinion. He takes his time and is thorough.
-1	I've changed doctors twice in fourteen years yet my current Dr looks out for me in that using non conventional treatment. He's least likely to prescribe meds . 
-1	I distrust my doctor because he is always in a hurry when I see him. I feel like nothing but a number to him during most visits. 
1	goes in depth with our discussions, goes the extra step when preliminary tests are not within the appropriate range, explains actions and my consent before adjusting meds or recommending actions
1	I have been going to the same doctor for years now in a great clinic my kids and wife go to as well.  We really like it there and it eels like a whole team of care rather then one doctor.  
-1	Too many doctors follow a set of rules and protocol. They are not open to altertive medicine and would sooner give you medicine than try and treat things turally. They have too much at stake with the pharmaceutical companies.  
1	I trust my PCP because he always explains in depth why he prescribes a drug or treatment. He takes the time to listen to my symptoms and does a thorough exam.
-1	Sometimes it seems like doctors are mechanics, trumping up small issues to make you spend countless money. 
-1	I wouldn't completely trust my primary care physician or any doctor for that matter. While I have respect for their level of knowledge and expertise doctors are still just people and capable of making mistakes. 
1	My doctor spends time with me and also is thorough  He is good with making patients feel comfortable and also it detailed
1	He takes the time to listen to me thoroughly.  He gives me advice that makes sense and has been proven to be valid and true in the past.  He cares about me (remembers things I have mentioned), and seems genuinely please when things are going well for me.  During one crisis I had about 5 years ago, he called me a few days later to make certain I was all right.
1	I trust my doctor because I have never been led astray. I have never had a negative experience with my doctor. I have no reason to doubt my doctor's competence or motives and have had good outcomes.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician but I also like to back up her information with what I can learn from trusted medical websites. I have only been with this primary for a year so I think we are still learning to trust each other. It can take some time to become really comfortable with each other.
1	based upon past experiences, I believe he is thorough and has my needs at heart.  If I have questions, he answers without hesitation.  We discuss the issues.  I never feel rushed.
-1	I trust my primary doctor because he have treated my diseases for a few years without any significant errors. He treated nicely and friendly. He gave me a lot advice and suggestions on my health condition.  
-1	You can't always believe everything the doctor says in terms of options sometimes they are just looking for the money
1	My doctor actually takes the time to listen and ask questions and not just talk over me or assume 
1	I trust my doctor because he is the family doctor. My parents go to see him and he takes excellent care of them. Just with things ive seen him for, he has earned my trust.
-1	I trust and do not trust primary care physicians. I trust them because they are the experts at what they do and then I don't trust them because I know they will say anything to charge and get more money out of you.
1	He has never done anything to make me not trust him. I've always received good care from him.
-1	i trust my primary care doctor. he has never sugar coated anything at all. he calls it as it is. when i was borderline diabetic. he told me what i needed to do to rathcet back. he dignosed my anixety and depression
1	I feel that although most physicians have a high degree of integrity, I would contend that one is ultimately responsible for one's own well being. That said, not all heath care professiols are beyond scrutiny. I myself have experienced one such doctor who was self serving and egregious in the care of his patients. 
-1	Cool place travel Work plies greatest fits more money more problem  can I can cool sweet just trust ruggr treat
1	"I trust my doctor because he is very direct and ""no-nonsense"".  He explains things very clearly and presents me with options."
-1	They take oaths I disagree with I know pharmaceutical sales reps who tell me info about drug pushing To many politics with insurance 
-1	i don't see my primary care physician too often. he's a decent guy, but i think he's more interested in sending me off for tests than anything else. he doesn't seem to know that much himself, it's always more tests.
-1	For the most part, I trust physicians but I do believe in getting a second opinion where treatment for cronic health issues are concerned. I saw both of my grandparents almost die because of a doctor who was more concerned with his bottom line than caring for what they needed. They were heavily over medicated and taking medicine they did not need. They were both in need of a pacemaker but he would not refer them to a cardiologist. The family had to take over and get them to different doctors so that they could have a healthy life instead of slowly wasting away.
1	My old doctor is retiring and the last few times I have had the doctor that will replace her when she retires. He is young but seems competent. I haven't really seen him so often as to really build any kind of relationship with him yet. 
-1	My physician is not perfect, but nobody is. Despite this limitation, I can trust him to competently assess my situation and recommend appropriate actions. My doctor respects my intellect and will discuss the medical situation with me so that I understand and buy into treatment options. Although he is trained in standard care protocols, which are short-sighted remedy-based approaches, I can evaluate the alternative options myself and competently discuss them with my physician. 
1	I have an excellent PA who has consistently steered me in the right direction with the treatment of my health and I believe he listens and understands my concerns.
1	I don't know; they're honest and trustworthy and I find them believeable. I don't know what else I can say.
-1	I trust the doctor sometimes because most of the times doctors miss treat you most of the tiime so I don't trust none really
-1	My current physician is relatively new to me, so these questions are a bit difficult to answer. Overall, I feel my doctor has been very sympathetic and has taken my concerns seriously. She has ordered appropriate diagnostics and I feel that she has spent an appropriate amount of time asking follow-up questions. In my experience over the past decade, I have noticed many doctors spending less time with patients. I think the doctor/patient relationship, in general, suffers due to insurance regulations and company policies.
-1	I trust my personal care provider most of the time. She errs on the side of caution. Some doctors at hospital are terrible at listening to complaints and refuse to consider the underlying pain when they hear the word cancer.
-1	I do think that doctors for the most part have your best well-being in mind, but I'm skeptical that sometimes they may be guided by less savory interests (pharmaceuticals).
1	I have known my primary doctor for about a year. In this year, I feel I can trust her to want what is best for me. She is very understanding and allows me to question her and even decide (e.g.) not to take a preventative medicine she has suggested. She makes me feel I am listened to and respected.
1	He works in a small town and is well-known in the community. He has a high reputation to uphold. 
-1	typically it is best to trust your instincts. if the doc seems good trust him
1	We have built a relationship over the years. He knows my conditions and understands my thoughts and concerns about them. He wants me to be happy and healthy 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never done me wrong . He's delivered both of my babies . I have never had a bad experience with him . He's a loving,  caring man and I couldnt ask for a better doctor . I recommend him Dr Joseph's from spotsylvania regional. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has a good education and asks me plenty of questions. I have never had a problem with him.
-1	I trust because he has valued me in a correct way and I consider him to be a capable person since he has experience and many patients have been valued by him and I feel satisfied with this
-1	In the past four years I have been given a misdiagnosis three times because doctors failed to ask the appropriate questions or perform a simple bloodtest.  I spent months in excruciating pain while doctors scratched their heads and did nothing but prescribe medications that did not help and in fact made me feel even worse while my fingers were literally dying.  I could get a shower without literally screaming and curling up in a fetal position afterward.  There is no painkiller that can help that level of pain.  I am quite certain that if they had bothered to check my thyroid levels that I would not have endured a level of misery that makes one question what quality of life is worth living.  I have no trust in the competence of doctors because most are apathetic due in large part to the healthcare system itself.
-1	When it comes to doctors in general I will trust their ability to identify a problem. What I do not trust is the ability to prescribe a solution to a problem.  Most doctors solution to most problems is by prescribing a drug even when a problem can be resolved with simple diet and exercise. This is the main reason why I will not trust what the doctor prescribes  but will trust his diagnosis.
-1	"i don't trust someone that i can't understand. i don't appreciate being ""talked over"" because i am not understanding what they are saying. i will not go back to that doctor, unless i absolutely have to because i care about my life and well being more than some stranger with a diploma does. when i find a doctor that treats me like the intelligent human being that i am, i am more willing to listen and discuss my concerns with them. if not, they are plenty of doctors that i will go to until i find one willing to co-operate with me."
-1	My doctor is pretty straight forward is sensitive but to the point.  I must trust he only has my best interest at heart
-1	i believe that doctors  are in the of making money, because if they cure people no one will come to see them
-1	He's fine.  I generally trust him or I wouldn't go to him. He's honest but that doesn't mean he knows everything or is up to date on the latest treatments.  He's not afraid to refer me to a specialist, which I appreciate.
-1	I think most doctors have good intentions. Why spend all that time in school just to mess people up? 
1	I trust my doctor a lot.  Like me, she is a woman, so I know that she has gone through some of the same things as I have.  She spends a lot of time with me and really explains everything.
-1	He is the new young doctor at the clinic I go to. Straight out of residency. A few times he has had to consult with the other doctor there. I take this as a good sign. I know he will never give a bad diagnosis or advice
-1	I  have  never had a  bad  experience  with  my   doctor   I  trust  him   completelyif  you  don't  trust  your  doctor  you  shout  not  go to  him
1	My doctor always takes his time to explain to me what is going on with my health. He is very caring and listens to my concerns.
1	My doctor spends a good amount of time in the room with me, 15 to 20 minutes or more, talking with me about any issue that I am having. She listens to what I have to say and does what ever tests are needed with out hesitation. She also felt a lump in my breast that turned out to be breast cancer.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I believe that they want the best for me. They will not tell me to do something that is not good for me.
-1	sometimes people have other things on their mind.  they see a lot of patients and might not be feeling good that day. they might not be as informed on new things out in the medical field. they may have been last in their class. there are many things that  can cause mistakes to be made. they are only human also
-1	in this day and age many physicians are more beholden to outside interests such as insurance and drug companies than they are to their patients.
-1	I feel that my primary care physician knows more than me apparently about health issues and what needs to be done to fix the issues so I trust in their judgement and advice
-1	My primary care doctor is a group of doctors on the base. And sometimes they switch which one will see me for whatever the appointment is for. 
1	I don't have a primary care physician, but I trust doctors in general. I believe that they are extremely knowledgable in their field, and took on the job because they have the desire to help people. Therefore, I would say that I am very trusting of their advice.
1	ive been with her and my other specialists for a long time theyve been and  seen me through several serious ailments
1	The doctor i choose would be the best in his or her field to help make a person better. I made sure they special specialist and know the ins-and-outs about what the condition of the patient and make sure they run a lot of test
-1	I have had the same doctor for 15 years, and he has never steered me wrong yet.  He always treated my grandma and continuously worked to help her as she had dementia and Alzheimer.
-1	I trust my pcp because anytime I am in need of an emergency check up etc. I can always be squeezed in the schedule without an appt. I really think that the physician cares about the patients he doesn't just talk about things he shows it as well.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing her for over five years and she has never given me information I have found to be false.  She discusses health issues with me and takes my concerns into consideration
1	he always answers all of my questions, explaining things in a way that i as a non-medical person, can comprehend.
-1	I have known my doctor for ten years. He has always been honest and patient with me. He was my doctor through my pregnancies also.
-1	In general, I would say I trust doctors since they are the professionals and they know what they are doing. Being able to become a doctor would imply that you are well educated in that area and have an adequate understanding.
1	I trust him because he has the knowledge and I have told him everything about me. I don't think he would give me the wrong information about any treatment he would suggest.
-1	They seem to be a bit judgemental about who they are treating.  I have seen it over and over again, and it's unfortunate to see.
-1	Presently, I don't have health insurance  but it depends on my health needs. Or if, success has been accomplished after first visit. It depends what type doctor, too. I have issues & experienced certain problems related to my health for being neutral. Those experiences effect how I think, & causes some doubt about whether I am getting proper care. I know, I am responsible for my well-being, my understanding about why my body malfunction but need the assistance of others when in need. If, a medication is producing ill effects or too much is given. When, I am in control, I stop immediately & I don't take. Once the wrong thing has been administered it maybe to late. We all have our needs, & we may have same things. But body function differently when taken, the understanding.
1	My doctor talks to me like a friend instead of a patient. If he needs to prescribe a medicine, he talks to me on my level of understanding about the pros and cons and tells me about his success or lack thereof with his other patients. He is very honest and open about what I do and do not need to change in reference to my lifestyle. Most importantly, if he doesn't have an answer, he is not afraid to tell me he doesn't know and needs to refer me to a specialist. That most of all is why I trust him so much - that he is willing to admit he doesn't know something or admit someone else may have a better solution.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for almost 20 years now. He knows me and I feel like I am at home there. I can come to him with any problem at all and he knows what to do. He has never let me down once. He know when we can speed through and exam but if I have any questions or need to talk he will stay with me as long as I need him to explain or talk to me.
1	My doctor always spends a good amount of time talking to me when I go for a visit and answers all my questions thoroughly.
1	I found from my past experiences that my primary care physician treatment opinions are best for my good health. As the result I have full trust in my primary care physician.
1	I just generally trust the profession.  I believe that almost all doctors are primarily concerned with the well being and proper treatment of their patients.  There may be exceptions to that general rule but there would have to be irrefutable evidence to that effect to make me doubt the sincerity if not the competence of any physician.
-1	Usually my doctor has been spot on with any diagnosis and knows her stuff. Just wish she was a little  more  personable  and not rushed.
-1	I trust doctors in general because most of them are probably good people. I believe they chose to be doctors to take of and help people. However, there are still unethical and potentially dangerous doctors out there. So, I think it is always important to trust your gut when you get the feeling that something isn't right and seek out a second opinion.
1	I've been going to him since I was fourteen, and he's seen everyone in my family for years. He asks about how we're doing, he makes sure we know exactly what's going on, and he is one of our friends. 
1	I trust  my primary care physician because I have seen her for years and she is actively involved while I'm at my appointments. If I have a question she takes her time to find out the answer if its not something she can immediately answer and gets back to me about it. She also spent more time training for her profession than me. 
-1	McCoy costs classic dO didn't call drops Church's a shift discuss does Alex flex for Eric Alex emits ask us will mark hasn't DJs Emma anonymous donor I am so happy to hear that you are 3
-1	My pop suggests non prescription processes initially. Fights email, he may opt for writing a prescription.ifi have a questionable side effect from a specific med., he will stop fora few days, possibly terry before changing medication. All in combination with healthy diet and excercise
-1	Sometimes doctors recommend certain medications because they get a percentage of the revenue and I dont like it because they could probably recommend something cheaper to you but they just want to make money
-1	I feel like doctors  have to ear n your trust.  My doctor has not done that as of yet.  Sometimes he speaks to me in a very condescending manner and I just don't like that.  I also feel like he doesn't ask me alot of questions, and just gives me a diagnosis without getting to the meat and potatoes.
1	I trust her because she is extremely personable, takes her time to really understand ALL my symptoms. She discussed different options and different ways of handling everything and gives me a set of difference choices based on my needs. She even seeks out sheaper medications due to my low income
1	I go through great lengths to pick a doctor. I get recommendations, read reviews, etc. This makes me pretty confident from the outset. I prefer women Doctors, which adds another strand of confidence. When I first meet with a doctor, this gives me my final vote of confidence. Whatever the doctor shows me on the first visit, I assume is who they are. Because, usually on that visit, they are on their best behavior. If they rush and don't have time, then I will not stay with that doctor.
-1	Most of the time I feel rushed.I honestly feel as though all he wants to do is push pills as a solution for every problem.  He does a lots of tests but no real follow up to see how I feel after each visit to see if there is really any change in my condition. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has always asked me for my opinion and how I feel about doing something. He always give me options. He tells me what I need and when or if I don't need something. 
-1	I wouldn't trust a doctor 100%, I would seek a 2nd opinion if there was ever a serious matter. 
-1	My prenatal care experience did not always fully inform and in some areas misinformed or sometimes gave bad recommendations.  
1	I feel like I can trust my doctor because he sees you as a person and not just getting some kind of money benefit from his patients and cares for each one no matter who they are or the financial differences. He shows respect and trays to make everyone comftorable and like a friend.
-1	medical offices are constrained by regulations and requirements to post insurance companies, medicare 
-1	I really love my primary care physician. She is careful and thoughtful, but she is only human. I know she will do her best by me, but that doesn't mean she is always right.
1	Everything my doctor has done for me has turned out real well so i trust him completely. He explanins things to me so i can understand them and also lets me know what we are going to do in the long run for my treatment.
-1	I do have a lot of trust in my physician as he has always been there for me, he tries very hard to get me n to see him in case of an emergency, and he has even called me at home to check on me, after I have seen him.
1	I trust my doctor because I am able to question him about any procedure, or medications and get an answer and information.  I am given options and information to make appropriate decisions.  So with that it's a given to always be truthful about what I tell him about my care, side affects if any.
1	I have only been going to him for 6 months but his dad has been a doctor in town for 30 years. He seems to be caring, knowledgeable and a good listener.
-1	"I don't have a primary care physician. I don't go to doctors much and have had mixed results. Different doctors have told me that strep is nothing to worry about and others have been ""upset"" that I didn't come in sooner. "
1	My last physician I really didn't care for her to much. She was not professional enough for me. She took to long and to get to see me but when she did see me I wasn't there long at all. Her office was to small and she constantly had drug reps there. I know that she was very busy but I think she needs to learn how to schedule her patients and not have them sitting for hours just to see her. She has a very important role and she has a very nice staff but I think her office could be ran better than that.
-1	My primary physician seems hurried to prescribe antibiotics over anything, and she does not like writing referrals to specialists or running tests, like the flu.  In the past Ive had to insist on seeing a specialist.
-1	I have been to my doctor, been waiting in the waiting room and seen him talking to a friend. When my doctor notices that he has patient's waiting he gets angry and tells them they could look for other doctors.  I also don't trust him as he does not do thorough exams.  He simply refills my prescription every year without checking anything.
1	My doctor has never forced anything on me. He has  always had my best interest, my family , my health.
-1	I dont have a primary physician byt the two that i have been to really cares for thier patients. And will do everything in thier power to make sure you're ok.
1	I trust my doctor because we have built up a solid report, where she listens to and respects my feelings and does not trivialize them.
-1	I feel like the physician is more oriented towards actions that would bring the hospital more revenues and comfort.  The physician does not seem to truly listen to all that I have to say and makes judgments and diagnoses before fully understanding the problems.
-1	I don't really trust my primary care physician because he doesn't tend to remember information from visit to visit and he seems quick to throw a medication at any complaint without considering other options.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to understand what is the problem. He also listens to me before he speaks on the issue. In the end he is thoughtful and goes with what i as a patient am comfortable with.
-1	I feel that my primary care physician is adequate. He does listen and try to help with my medical issues. However he also refuses to try new procedures and treatments that might help me.
-1	I believe my primary doctor knows me well enough to know I want honest answers and the real bottom line, and so he does not sugar coat anything 
-1	I don't trust the medical system or any doctor for much of anything.  They very often do more harm than good.
-1	I've only seen my PCP twice, and trust takes times to build. I like my Dr. Very much, and believe that I will trust him in time. He has a good bedside manner and appears to genuinely care about me . 
-1	Dr Barbie seems competent for the most part but sometimes she ignores information that I give her because it's inconvenient. Once I persist she usually comes through but why do I have to justify legitimate concerns?  If I had any doctors that weren't as arrogant, I'd change, but I haven't. At least, she prescribes what I need instead of forcing me to stair step through options that don't work
-1	I have had many bad doctors. I use a mouth guard during the day for stress, and doctors have treated me like a mental patient. Many doctors have refused to treat my infections because they have treated me before. My immune system is bad. I have had doctors call the police on me and lie, saying I hear voices and want to die. I never told anyone that. A majority of them have been bad. 
-1	My current doctor says i have one problem that is not really true and sometimes contradicts what others with more knowledge would say
-1	I don't trust any human to take care of me.  We all make mistakes and I refuse for their mistakes to be made on me.  The most a doctor can do is tell me what they believe is wrong but it's up to me to fix it.
1	Track record. I've never had an issue with my doctors of the past ten years. They give the best insight too 
1	My primary physician is extremely thorough. When I go in for office visits I feel like I am the only patient seen that day. The doctor constantly ask if I have any other questions or concerns and takes time to answer me
1	I don't know, I just trust her. Maybe because she is friendly or maybe it was the time she didn't know something and consulted her colleague while I was there. I just feel that I can trust her.
1	I trust my doctor because she is trustworthy. I've never been giving a reason not to trust her. I don't like going to the doctor that often tho but I trust her
-1	My primary care doctor has been my doctor for 20 years and has seen me and my husband and my children and I trust him completely.
-1	I do not really trust or distruct my primary care physician because they can only be in it for the money
-1	theres no way you can trust or distrust your primary care physician unless there was an appropriate plays going on
1	My trust my physician because I just do. They know what they're doing and I've been going to the physician ever since I was a child so there's no distrust with my physican
-1	I trust they'll do just enough to keep me alive long enough to bleed my pockets
-1	I feel that doctors only want to run a lot of tests to make money or over fear of being sued. Doctors are normally very busy and rushed and do not give patients the time and care that they should. I am distrusting of doctors.
-1	I trust my primary care physician but sometimes they are so quick in seeing me that I worry about not getting all the care I actually need.
1	This is the person I rely on for the truth more so than anyone else besides my family. These are the people that try to keep us alive.
-1	I feel that my PCF is a kind person and has intentions to help yet does not want to realty invest in the thought and process needed to truly uncover my medical issues. Specifically my secondary infertility issues. I have seen her twice and she can't seem to ever move things along in the process and sort it out. I am extremely discouraged by her lack of urgency.  
1	I really like my doctor. I can always depend on her. She goes out of her way to help me and her other patients. She calls me herself without having a nurse do it. She explains things to me and also gives me educational materials.
-1	I would have faith and hope that as a trained physician they are both skilled and have the knowledge and upkeep in the medical field. They do this as a living, doctors/nurses and physicians, so I should put at least some trust into their job that they are evaluating me and my health properly.
-1	My doctor acts like a know it all.  It seems like they are in a rush most of the time.  They could be more thoughtful and considerate.
-1	I did quite a bit of research before I finally selected my doctor.  She has very good reviews from other parents, and works for a very reputable institution, Johns Hopkins.  Most of my interactions with her have been extremely positive and she has given me no reason not to trust her judgment.  My one concern is that she seems to be extremely busy, and probably feels pressure not to spend much more than 15 minutes with any of her patients.
-1	I know he does what is good for me hes been in practice for years sometimes he does things weird but in the end he is right
1	he has always been honest about everything I have asked or had concerns about responsed to all my needs and truly cares about the welfare of me
-1	They tend to be short with me, talk down to me, and disregard what I am saying.  I once had to switch doctors because I informed her that I had a low tolerance for medication and she laughed.
1	I trust my primary care Doctor to take the best care of me. Primary Care Doctors take as an oath to provide the best care. Primary Care Doctors want a good reputation. Primary Care Doctors have great mal practice insurance.
1	My doctor always takes his time with me. He talks about everything I need to talk about and do not need to talk about.
-1	I have lost over 90% of my sense of smell due to a deviated septum I was born with and has gotten continually worse. It has changed how my voice sounds, makes it difficult to breathe through my nose at times, gives me sinus headaches and makes it hard to chew. After get a cat scan I was told by my doctor it was nothing more than allergies and prescribed flowze. Lost all my trust only adding to the multiple reoccurrences of bad doctor stories I've had.
1	She is knowledgeable and up to date on the latest research. She is caring and attentive as well. 
-1	He tries to help me. He also gets met the only prescription that I need full time. He is pretty helpful.
1	I do trust my Doctor, I do not think he has ill intentions, and I believe he wishes to provide me with the best care possible.
1	I trus' my physicians because I'm convinced that he is there for his patience. He has good bedside manner and has been in business a long time
-1	There's no reason I have for not trusting or distrusting my primary care physician that I can think of right now but I'm sure if I did I wouldn't continue to see that person about my health. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because they do give me all the information I need to maintain good health and that all depends on me doing my due diligence and ask all the questions I should be asking about my health.  She's never late when I arrive wait times are no longer than 15 minutes and she does listen. My only blip is when they couldn't tell why I suffered the emergency, but it's not like she doesn't want me to know...right now they just don't have the answer.   
-1	Sometimes my doctors can be in such a rush I simply get a nod and they would try and attend me as quick as possible to get even more patients in. Half the time I end up having to go back because he didn't feel like listening to my problem so it wasn't tended to and I end up getting worse.
1	My doctor is up on medical issues and tries to explain everything in a patient-friendly way.  He always goes over all the options and helps me decide based on my needs and desires instead of ordering me to do something.  He is not tied to any particular treatment and is open to different approaches.  He is experienced and not just out of med school, which makes me feel a little more secure--he has seen a lot over the years which gives him a great perspective on what does and doesn't work.
-1	I completely trust my physician. The main reason why I completely trust my physician is because I have been going to the same physician for ten years now. I feel like my physician knows exactly how to treat my symptoms. 
1	My primary care physician has always had my best interest in mind.  He is always willing to answer my questions or concerns regardless of time.  I feel we have a good relationship and can count on him to provide the best health care. 
-1	I compeletly trust my primary care physician because he has been my provider for over 20 years and always had went above and beyond to provide the best care possible for his patients
-1	the last few doctors i have seen are quick and dismissive and none has got it right.   I was sent home to get dandruff shampoo when it is excema.  i was sent home with a surgeons number when i had a gall bladder attack that i have managed on my own
1	he takes the time and effort to explain all health issues. He never seems to be in a big hurry to move onto the next patient
-1	The physicians ive had generally rush through the procedures, and care little for my thoughts. I have never had a severe condition but it would worry me if i ever did
-1	I have to that's who I go to and chose if I feel that the trust is not there then I will should change I don't fully put my trust in just a doctor them selves I have to trust me as well
-1	Sometimes they seem to intentionally downplay the effects of a medication, in order to get me to agree to try it, even though I have tried it in the past with very negative results
-1	It all depends on (1) the doctor (2) the city (3) the facility (4) my personal experience. Some doctors (like the one I have now) I trust 100%. Others in the past? Skeptical.
1	He prescribed medicine that he believed to be helpful, and made sure that I get enough information to use it properly. My doctor cared enough about my condition such that simple follow-up sessions were free. He likes to listen when I ask questions, and makes sure to explain them properly. 
1	I don't feel like he pushes medication on me, which is a fear I have regarding most doctors. I don't want a doctor who is in the pocket of Big Pharma. 
1	I trust my primary doctor because she takes the time to talk to me and explain things so I can understand
-1	i trust my doctor because he has never been wrong or told me anything just to get money out of me, he is a very honest and caring doctor
-1	I trust my PCP and one other doctor. Following that, I usually trust male docs I donât know if he doesnât jump into the examination and gives me time to feel him out. Talks a bit, etc. I canât trust women doctors. :( (Personal history). To be fair, I donât have a feeling that most are not in it for the right reason, not as a business venue.
1	I have built up trust with my doctor because I know that they are being honest with me. I have been going to them for a long time and they always seem to have my better care in mind.
1	I have known my primary care physician for awhile and he is a family friend. I believe that he does everything he can to make sure I am getting the best treatment possible.  Not only for me, but for my whole family since he is all of their doctors.  He seems to take his time and is always available for questions.
1	I trust my primary physician based on how he has helped me in the past. He is always thorough and I went through other doctors before sticking with him. He always explains the options and when possible, we decide things together.
1	MOST PHYSICIANS, DOCTORS,ETC ARE EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE PROFESSIONAL IN MEDICAL FIELD WHICH HAS THE MOST VERY BEST UNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT THE VARIOUS NEEDS OF MEDICAL HEALTHCARE.
1	"I've dealt with a heart issue since I was 8 yrs old. Had a major ""episode"" almost 3 years ago & my current PCP has been very open about theories, treatments, test results & options. He has listened to my questions/concerns as well as let me participate in my care as far as refusing or suggesting a similar or different course."
-1	I've known my doctor for over twelve years. He is well educated and respected by all who know him. He has been in practice for over twenty-five years and is tops in the midwest.
-1	They have an education and experience that cars outweighs any medical knowledge I have so I trust them to lead me in the right directions  
-1	From my last couple experiences with my doctor I feel that they have my best interests in mind and that they are trying to help me, but I feel they are overworked and sometimes don't have enough time to get to know me.
1	I trust my doctor because she takes time to really listen to me and when something isn't working or doesn't feel right, she will try a different approach.
-1	I think that most doctors are basically helpful.  They do tend to be arrogant and think that they are important.  No doctor wants to be sued for malpractice, so I think they tend to over treat many medical conditions.
-1	I believe most doctors only have the patient's best interest in mind. I just don't believe you can trust any one completely.
-1	She was one of the first one listen to my full range of symptoms and treat all if them, not just one or two.
-1	I trust doctors to a certain extent because each individual case is different and the patients needs have to match with the doctor's orders.
-1	I wouldn't have complete trust in anyone over decisions regarding my health.  I think it's important to verify things and get second opinions to make sure I have as much information as possible.
-1	I do not feel the doctors are very careful in doing exams. Sometimes they did not make the right dignosis.
-1	Experience with her treatment has given me confidence in her care. I can't say I have complete trust in anyone.
-1	It is mostly about making money in the grand scheme of things so it makes it hard to trust. I know that some are there to help people, but it doesn't help the corporate mindset of it in the long run. I wish I trusted my doctors more but sometimes you even question the diagnosis of some conditions.
-1	I think doctors are doing their best according to their training. Few have any training or knowledge about altertive or tural remedies. I wish they did. 
-1	I do trust my doctor because he/she knows best.  Or shall I say doctors are more knowledgeable than me about medical terms.  If I won't trust the doctor how will I be treated.  I always believe that prevention is better that cure.  Only doctors knows it.
1	I have a long and trusting relationship with my doctor, who treats me with respect and factors in my demographics regarding decisions. She is thorough and caring and knowledgeable. We make decisions jointly as partners, with my doctor supplying all the technical information for me to make informed decisions. 
1	I really like my doctor. She takes the time out of her day to explain all my options to me, go over results with me and explains every step we need to take to move forward. She is smart and patient
-1	Most doctors dont examine you on a machine you go. There is no one on one communication. The doctor only spends five to eight mintueds with you.
1	I trust my doctor because he shows genuine care for me. He goes above and beyond and he gives me all options to consider when i have to choose
1	I trust my doctor because she always lets me know the truth. Even though she tries to make me feel comfortable, she gives me the negative effects and tells me the truth about what can happen to me if I don't take care of myself.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician.  I am in reasonably good health with very little by way of health issues.  The last time I needed medical care I was able to go to the local urgent care office.
-1	I trust doctors, if not to know what's best for me all the time, at least to have a much better shot at it than I do. But I don't necessarily trust them to have the same priorities I do. That doesn't even necessarily mean that I don't trust them to put my health as the top priority - sometimes that's not MY top priority. I'm still kind of ticked off at a doctor who ordered $1000 worth of blood tests for PCOS, which it turned out I don't even have and which was nowhere close to his specialty (he was a psychiatrist!). Yes, there was a small chance I had PCOS. Yes, if I had had it, there would have been a small chance of heart problems (all the other symptoms were things I considered either no big deal like hair, or actually beneficial, like amenorrhea and infertility). But good God, $1000! Insurance wouldn't even cover it! I could NOT convince that man that I was poor. So I no longer trust him to make decisions for me, because we don't see eye-to-eye about what's important.
-1	I'm not a very trusting person in general which is why I answered as I did, but I trust my pcp as much as I trust as anyone. 
1	I have had the same doctor for several years and have had no problems. I know what all my conditions are and she explains everything I need to know
-1	Sometimes they are in a hurry to get to the next patient and make quick, sp judgments that do not apply.  Sometimes they are much more interested in what insurance plan you have than your well being.
1	I do trust doctors in general but it's hard to find a doctor who truly cares. For example, I used to go to the doctor and I always felt rushed because he had million patients waiting in the waiting area. He is a good doctor but I like when I have enough time to tell about my problems or what I feel or my concerns and he just didn't really have time to listen. I found another doctor who is amazing. He has a small office and not a lot of patience because he really takes his time and really cares. You can call him on his personal phone number and he will answer and will try to help
1	I expect most doctors, especially ones I have carefully chosen to see, to be an expert in their field, to know what they are talking about. Most people go into situations thinking this about doctors. I am generally trusting of the doctors that I see, unless they give me reasons to not think this.
-1	I trust that they know what they're doing, but sometimes it seems they are trying to rush you in and out because they have other people to treat 
1	I have worked with for many years and found his advice to be very good and has helped be get over various health issues in a reasonable time by following it.
1	I generally trust doctors in telling me what's wrong with me based on my symptoms.  My trust wavers however when it comes to being prescribed medications.  I feel sometimes doctors prescribe stuff that isn't needed in order to make money off that prescription.
1	My doctor has a great track record.  He cared for my mother and for me.  Wouldn't give him up for the world.  He has stayed true to himself and others!
1	She has done a great job for 20 years and takes her time to explain things.  She listens to my concerns and has good advise
-1	I believe in my doctors. And I love my doctors because I play football and they take care of my needs And you need to trust your family and doctors.
-1	Based on his performance and advice throughout the years. I feel confident in his decisions.
-1	I trust my physician because she always looks at me when communicating and she always asks questions about how I'm feeling.  I feel that she gives me a sense of trust and I could tell her anything.  She is a very thorough and caring physician. 
1	I have never had a reason to distrust her. She has always been forward with me about all my illnesses. If one medication doesn't work, she has a lot more that she can tell me about. I always ask about possible side-effects and she always tells me.
1	I trust them to the fullest extent they are very well trained have went to college and always looking out for the best with their patients I would never have a reason to not trust my doctor they are recommended by other people I know and deal with alot people 
1	highly trained professional that knows their jobs.always put,s their patients first,and provide high quality care
-1	My doctor has never tried to push any medications on me. He is more likely to send me home and tell me to give it a few days than he is to prescribe a treatment. He's a no nonsense kind of guy.
-1	I have a rare illness that my Physician had never heard of, so his choices in my care have not always been the right choices. I do see a specialist that I trust a bit more, but overall I am very discouraged with most of my healthcare providers due to their lack of knowledge or willingness to educate themselves on my conditions. 
-1	It's hard to trust a doctor these days with the amount of money that is involved it's more about money than people I'm afraid.   
1	I trust my primary care physician because I really think he acts in my best interests.  He is trained and more knowledgeable than I am in these areas and so I put my trust in him. 
-1	I feel my doctor is not concerned about me I have health insurance and he is getting paid. I get feel he does not want to touch me.  I am just another number he is rushing out to see the next person
1	I trust my doctor based on his personality and how he talks to me.  If I didn't like him or didn't trust him I would, and have, changed doctors.  
-1	I don't have much to say. Doctors get the job done. Insurance should be free. Healthcare shouldn't be a privilege. 
-1	Because they get paid when you fill out a prescription they wrote.  The more prescriptions they write and you fill, the more they make.
-1	I would have to say the reason is they do not call you if blood work or urine comes back as bad unless you go back in a week or so later.  Why can they not just call and give one results over the phone especially when you live far away from a doctors office to begin with.
1	I am the type of person that will trust a person until they give me a reason to not trust them.  Simply put, my physician has never given me a reason to not trust them. 
1	My MD has a proven record of being a phenomenal physician. My MD has been in the medical field for many years going for people from generation to the next generation. 
1	I HAVE COMPLETE TRUST IN MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. HE IS KIND  AND IS ALWAYS OUT FOR MY GOOD BEING  MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN ANSWERS ALL MY QUESTIONS AND IS VERY HONEST.
-1	They could be lying to me in order for me to spend more money with them.  They could fake that I have an illness, only to steal more money from me later on.
1	My doctor is a DO, so I already feel that the philosophical underpinnings of his education are more patient focused than illness focused. He listens carefully to what I tell him, and responds point by point to my statements. He trusts in my personal medical judgement as far as my chronic conditions.
-1	The doctors I see now are always open and up front with me about the treatment I am receiving. Because of this, I trust their judgement in making a diagnosis and the possible treatment(s).
1	What ever she tells me always works. I have never had any problems trusting my Doctor and any of the other Doctors I have ever seen.
-1	I don't fully trust doctors in general because I've had bad experiences with them in the past. I feel like the process to become a doctor 1lpeople who actually care from completing it, and a lot of doctors I've met are self centered and see patients as puzzles instead of real people.
1	I trust my doctor, but I'm also interested in doing my own research, asking questions, and ensuring that I understand the reasoning behind the choices made.
-1	I changed to a new doctor last year. I have only seen him once. He seems professional and capable. On the whole, doctors have treated me effectively. But I still feel I need to ask lots of questions to make sure I understand what they are doing.
1	I have had the same doctor since i was little. My kids go to the same doctor. I trust the Urgent care centers in case of emergency
-1	I don't necessarily distrust my physician, but the medical field in general. I don't discredit their knowledge, but don't trust their motives. It's all about money to most medical practices.
-1	I sometimes trust doctors about certain things, but overall I'm a bit suspicious of healthcare providers in general. I've got friends and family who work in the healthcare industry and they talk about all sorts of shady, crappy things that go on. In addition to the fraud I hear about in the news, and my own negative experiences with doctors, it's difficult for me to take everything they say at face value.
-1	I often feel as if they are already thinking of the next patient. It is usually a hurried experience.
-1	"Never know if they're just pushing what they get paid to push, pills and medications.  Results are hidden in their words of ""care""...never really know what they say unless you research it more."
-1	I generally trust them to do what is right and make me feel better in the end, although sometimes they only give me one option for moving forward, when I often feel like there are probably many options I have, but they just aren't telling me about it.  I think they only tell me the one that they think is right or best.
-1	I trust the doctors I see enough to keep going to them. I like the health system that I use I think they have really great nurses and doctors and a great reputable hospital. So I will trust them more than distrust
-1	I don't trust a doctor who rushes on everything he do he or she ask what's wrong then not even looking at the problem just say you need to lose weight that don't make sense to me
-1	I mean, overall I have trust.  That doesn't mean I wouldn't look for a second opinion on something life changing.  I always felt that most all Dr's know more then I do about these things.  I don't like it when they seem more interested in pushing a particular pill my way to mask rather then to look for ways to fix any certain condition.
1	I trust my primary doctors because they are the profession and it would be wrong of me to not trust them. Most of them knows what they are doing and enjoy what they do to make people better 
1	I can relate to my doctor with some challenges that we've faced with our kids.  He is my son's doctor also (Family Practice). He gets it.  He is very professiol but could not hide his frustration with the school system for special needs children.  It really helped me to not feel alone especially with a doctor who is so understanding.  He has such a good bedside manner.  He really does care about my son and I as his patients.  I truly feel that he gives his best advice and I would trust him with any health concern that I have.
-1	I trust my primary physician to an extent. I feel that my physician is too busy to really give me a thorough exam and is super quick to keep moving. I feel that there is no way there can always be a right diagnosis
1	I trust my primary care physician very much and the nurse practitioner, my therapist, and the people that I have seen for my health in general. They are all skilled and very knowledgeable, and seem like they truly care for me. If I have extra questions, which I pretty much always do, they always take extra time out to talk things over with me thoroughly. 
-1	My doctor wants the best for his patients. He tries to look into matters before he give you an answer. He checks. Things out,he do serveral tests before saying what the problem really is.
1	My doctor is non- judgmental and honest. She even shares stories about her in college so she seems relatable.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been the whole family doctor and has been treating me since birth also has answered all questions i've ever had bout me and my family members
1	I trust my primary care doctor because they're usually there if I need them. They also ask other questions even if it's not regarding to what I came in for.
1	Initially I have complete trust in my doctors.  Some have lost trust.  Some have gained a lot.  I tend to trust the doctors with the most education.  Trust is very important to accurately give all the personal information required.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I've known him since I was a child. He's been my doctor for my whole life and I trust him. He's made great decisions for me and has almost always been right in regard to my medical issues. We are very close and he is very intelligent and has a wonderful bed side manner.
1	I really like my current doctor.  He's younger than me, which is a little weird, but he is very open minded, more so than me.  He always gives me different  altertives  on how to treat myself 
1	I trust my doctor because I have had a long-term relationship with her and she know my health history and the issues that concern me.  
-1	I have known him my whole life so he is honest with me. But I don't feel that comfortable enough tot trust him completely because we are different genders
-1	From past experience I have time is more important to doctors than a thorough check up. They d do a quick and tell you to come back if your health doesn't improve
-1	Most doctors really want to help. Though there might be some out there that don't want to help. Those are the kind that are in it for the money. But most doctors can be trusted
-1	Because of Accidents in y Life, I have had to deal with a lot of different kinds of Dr's and I have seen how Good and How Bad they can Really be
1	I trust my doctor because in the past she has encouraged me to seek a second opinion, she has done what she could to avoid surgical procedures (even though eventually it had to be done), and she always gives the most minimally invasive options.
1	He is someone who is honest. When I have a question, I dont hesitate to ask and he is clear with his answers. 
-1	I trust them as much as I should. What that means is if they are clearly pushing a prescription for something I don't think I need, I distrust them. If they are actively pushing minimal treatment I trust them more because I think that my health is their priority opposed to making money by seeing me over and over again or by prescribing more drugs.
-1	My husband has a situation going on right now when it could be a bacteria (using a certain medication) or it could be an autoimmune issue.  It is all new to us and it seems that the doctor's sense of urgency is just not there .. probably because he has seen it all before where we would like more info, more tests ... more or different meds.
-1	I do get the impression that the doctor is trying to get through his visit with me as fast as possible. I understand that they need to do this to make a living, and I know the realities of insurance reimbursement and the way they are paid. Still, it means that I am suspicious of my doctor's motives and I don't really fully trust them. I know they are looking out for their interests before they are necessarily looking out for mine.
1	She takes the time to read about my cases and issues before we meet.  We generally has several solution to the problem at hand....but to be honest with you I am very healthy for my age, so I only go to the doctor for an annual check up at this time in my life.
1	My doctor is a blunt and give it to you like it is! I love that fact about him he does not sugar coat anything and tell me what I need to hear; not what I want to hear. I understand his boldness and the way he breaks things down so I have a clear understanding.
-1	I think my doctor is smart and knows what they are doing.
-1	I was not sick after going to my Physiciaan  I am more like dead person lot of pain and discomfort which I never had before
1	I trust my doctor completely.  She is very up to date on things and knows how to explain in my language.
1	I trust my PC because I have been with him for years. He has no steered me wrong in all the years that I have known him.
-1	 I think my pcp is honest about the treatments she is aware of, but being a general practitioner she has to rely on specialists for certain conditions. I trust her decision in treatment unless I have found other information that needs to be discussed first.
-1	EVERY altercation I have had with a doctor, I have felt like they aren't really listening to me. They will look at their clip board and nod their head and stuff, but not actually hear what I'm saying. If they ask me a question and I don't answer it the way they think, they will say I'm lying. I dislike Doctors so much because they ALL just do the bare minimum and don't treat people like humans, but as another task before lunch break. 
-1	I don't see a doctor regularly. In fact, I haven't been to the doctor in 8 years. The reason for this is because the doctor seemed overly concerned with herself, made me feel horrible about myself, recommended a method of birth control that caused damage, didn't give adequate information about the medicine and was overall in a bad mood the whole time. After that visit I had a reduction in funds so I was not able to find a better doctor. Without health insurance, that is difficult. So I just never went back.
-1	Sometimes I feel the doctors are only going to do as much as they need to cover the basics. For instance, if a patient only have medicaid or medicare the doctors will not suggest better treatment options that are available because the health care doesn't cover it. This practice is done without regard to the patient being able to fund the treatment in another capacity. This same treatment is the opposite for those with private healthcare. 
1	my doctor spends most of the office visit listening to me and explaining his answers to me. he also explains why he recommends certain tests and the outcomes of those tests
-1	I dont distrust my doctor i just always keep in the back.of my head that my doctor is only human and can make mistakes
1	He listens very well and addresses all my concerns. He knows me and what I'm like, so he can tell when something is wrong. He really cares about his patients and takes the time to listen.
-1	 Again, I'm sure overall my doctor is a good physician,  but i feel like if my opinion does not match with his,  it becomes a battle of wills rather than a helpful exchange.  And of course I don't always get as much time as I would like with him,  but more with the nurse,  which makes it seem I funny really matter to him. 
1	I have been with my doctor 3 years. He spends more than enough time going through things he thinks I should know. He answers my questions and will explain them where I can understand. I am able to email him with questions and he or his nurse will respond within a day. I receive updates on my health and tests. If he feels I need additiol tests done, he or his nurse will email or call me directly and explain why. 
-1	I trust my doctor because she genuinely seems like a good person, based on my past interactions with her. Though, between you and me, I wish she'd check my man parts during physicals like my old male doctor did.
1	I trust my primary care physician because they only can give you test results and treat you for the problem, and if you don't trust them you can get a second opinion,
-1	I have not been to a doctor in over 15 years, so I do not fully trust doctors, but that's not why I haven't been, I just know that unless its something very strange or a broken bone, most things go away with just taking care of yourself, good nutrition and staying hydrated works for me. I havent even used over the counter medicine at all in over 10 years. 
1	Doctors are in a profession to heal people so I would think that in general that they would care about people. And I'd trust them because I think that they want to give the best treatment either due to common human decency or pride in one's profession to do the best work.
1	She takes her time with me. She listens to what I say and even to my suggestions for treatment  If she does not know something she gets more info for me. She is totally honest with me.
1	I've been going to her office for a few years now and I'm always impressed by her high intelligence, her warmth, her competence and professiolism and the way she is always calm, attentive, quick and relaxed at the same time. And she is also greatly regarded in the profession - she has won many awards, which definitely inspires confidence.
-1	My doctor always tells it like it is and is completely trustworthy and down to earth. She knows that money is an issue and tries to make things as easy on me as possible
-1	I don't know my doctor all that well, but I believe her sincerity, and that she cares about how I am/feel.
1	I've seen the same person for several years and we have developed a rapport with each other. I trust her to tell me the truth.
1	Because i have been going to him for over 5 years and he has always been good to me he listen to me and he would never put me on anything that he wouldn't put his family on
1	I've been seeing my doctor for years now and I trust my doctor. My doctor knows almost everything about me and my conditions. She is honest and straight forward to me about my conditions.
1	She is dependable and caring, Her husband performed my surgery and she has maintained my health since then she has been very honest about my progress,even when its not necessarily what I wanted to hear
1	has great bedside manners, very detailed, very orgainized and easy to talk to. has exceptionally good personnel around him.
-1	I trust the doctors to do what is best for me and to provide access to the right treatments, but I wish that everything is laid out and simplified.  I would like to just be told of the long term survival rates instead of having to wonder.  I hold myself back from that because i don't want to know.
-1	I neither trust or distrust doctors. They seem to be in between when it seems like the really care about their patients or not. I don't see them too often, so I don't know alot about them.
1	I trust my doctor because he has taken great care of me in past meetings. My doctor connects with me on a personal/relatable level, which is a great quality to have. 
-1	my appendix had burst and my dr couldnt diagnose it
-1	I do not trust any human being completely. Everyone can be trusted to a certain point. I can't put too much trust in anyone that's getting paid. I only have complete and total trust in God. No one else will ever earn that.
-1	a lot of time it is just a simple fix for many of the doctors because I do believe that some of them are in the wrong profession for the wrong reasons.
1	I can talk and ask her anything and I feel confident that everything we discuss stays between the two of us
1	I trust my doctor to some extent where she is trying to give me medicine and helping me stay healthy but at the same time my total belief is in God.
-1	In general, as doctors have years of training to understand medical knowledge and how to apply it, I trust their judgement.
-1	unfortunately I have to say that most physicians I have seen firsthand didnât give me the most trusting feeling, although I can't say I wasn't cared for but I feel a lack on the care system. As mentioned before, most prescriptions are given based on symptoms and 'guesses' and not on facts, or exams. I do give attention and value to what my primarily physician says but I never see situations as a one way street so I do my research. And sincerely get disappointed if I look for help and medical guidance and am told that nothing is wrong without any testing done. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She seems to know her stuff and has a good bedside manner. She is always there to answer any questions or concerns that I may have.  
1	Because not only do they care for me, they ask when the pain last occurred and to rate it on a scale. They have more than one way to solving from the most risky to the less.
-1	It's their job and usually their calling, so I trust them inasmuch as it makes sense. They're still fallible human beings and I don't mind seeking second opinions. 
-1	"I have a new PCP so I don't totally trust her yet. She seemed to just gloss over any ""problems"" that I addressed with her during our first encounter. "
1	"In the past, I did not trust doctors much due to some bad experiences with being brushed off and accused of ""looking for attention"".  I have since dealt with two very nice doctors, both of which were easy to deal with and took me seriously.  They talk to me and help me through issues, explaining everything as necessary.  "
1	I have brain tumors. That diagnosis came totally out of the blue and I was devastated. I ended up with the best doctor, and he saved my life. And he also made me understand that things would be okay. He moved away to teach not long ago, and I've saved his last voicemail to me just because hearing him always makes me feel better about life.
-1	They have gotten prominent degrees and I have good reason to trust them.
1	I've been lucky enough to have a female doctor who understands my female health related issues.  I trust this person for the most part.  I understand that people are not perfect.  
-1	I think most doctors do what they think is right and its not always up to date. I live in a rural community so they don't always stay current.
-1	they do not listen or read my chart when I tell them something, Its like I tell them and they look at me as if I have two heads
-1	I  don't like a doctor guessing what my medical problem might be. I trust a doctor that will run several test to find out  the problem to ensure that an appropriate diagnosis is made.
1	I trust my doctor. She always tries to do what is best for me and addresses any of my concerns. She also listens to me and let's me explain any symptoms I've been having.
-1	I distrust my pcp because he once delayed giving me test results for months when they were available and I contacted him over and over for them.
-1	I rarely go to the doctor, and in fact, don't really have one that I would call my primary.  When I do go, though, it is usually for a specific issue, sickness, or injury and I always have the feeling the doctor just wants to get me in and out so he or she can get on to the next one.  I rarely feel like they have my best interest at heart.
-1	The primary care doctor can't possibly know everything there is to know and keep up with all of the current research. I am also concerned about the conflict of interest between doctors and drug companies. My friend who is a nurse told me she's attended several pharmaceutical company dinners. And the FDA has approved medicines that were upproved years later for being dangerous.
-1	I don't understand the question clearly. I don't know what to write so I wrote this down. Please explain to me more.
1	I trust them for the most part because they know what they're doing and generally want me to get better. The only thing I dont trust about my doctor is the brands of prescription medicine they push because I know some medication gives them bonuses while others don't so I have to research the medications myself to see which is right for me
-1	I believe my doctor is looking out for my best interest, that being said he is only human and is prone to making mistakes like everyone else. But deep down I do think he cares about my well-being.
-1	cant really say without having a doctorso how can i answer that it would be like playing a guessing game but guess in life it goes both ways
-1	Physicians, doctors, pharmaceutical industries and pharmacists are not trustworthy. They work together in their individualistic pursyits. The patient is not primary goal, their money being pocketed is. 
-1	My doctor is an internist but also leans toward holistic medicine and we are both minimalists when it comes to the use of drugs. I trust him to not prescribe medications just to placate me.
1	I have been going to her for many years.  I have been through several medication conditions within those years and she has alway been thorough, patient and understanding and making sure I got the best possible treatment.  
1	I trust them because they are supposed to be the experts.  If i go to a doctor and i feel like their diagnosis isn't right, I will go get another opinion.  I trust them until they give me a reason not to.
1	I'd be dead without her. Always having my best of interest and making sure I'm fine, physically and mentally 
1	I trust my doctor. He really seems to care and treats me like family.
-1	In general, I trust my primary care physician. I think she is trying her best to provide good medical care to meet my  needs.  However, I think sometimes she may not listen to my point of view and may instead rely on her own experiences and training too much, as opposed to seeing what may work uniquely for me as an individual.  However, I do feel like she cares and does a thorough job overall.
-1	I am lucky to have a great Dr. In the past, I have not. She listens. She knows me. She also has chronic pain, so that helps in her understanding.
-1	I trust my Doctor but I like to do some research on my own, sometimes I might get a second opinion to be more confident.
-1	The doctor that I have seen does not have a lot of time to see me and does not (because she cannot) remember information about me. She relies on her notes, which I don't find accurate to the information I give her, even when I have corrected her. For example, she had written down that I started birth control a month later than I had. She also changes her mind about my treatment very often and doesn't seem sure about what's necessary or helpful to me.
-1	I basically go to the doctors once a year and always listen and ask questions of my doctor.  We usually have a good conversation about different things and I walk away learning a new thing or two.
-1	It's my life, it's not my doctor's life. It's his job. Even if he has every intention of doing the best by me, that doesn't mean he's capable or doing that does it. Doctor's don't know everything, and it's my body and health and I have to live with it.
-1	I like my doctor. She is very thorough in some areas but a little cavalier in others. I've had to come back twice because she said something wasn't important and it turned out to be more serious.
1	I trust my doctor because I have read reviews about him. I also trust him because I myself have checked up on the internet the treatment and procedures that he has suggested or prescribed. 
1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR COMPLETELY.   IT IS VERY EASY TO TALK TO HER AND TO SEE THAT SHE IS A VERY INTELLIGENT PERSON.  SHE HAS NEVER BEEN WRONG WITH ME AND I HAVE LEARNED VERY MUCH FROM DURING THE FEW YRS I HAVE BEEN SEEING HER ABOUT MY HEALTH ISSUES
-1	I trust my doctor up to a degree in somethings, but I like to research the benitfit before I try it, that seeing when the cause or affect that will happen
1	I feel that my PCP has my best interest in mind any time she makes a decision on what medication or treatments are beneficial for me.  I feel that she does not make a quick decision on it either.  I feel that she takes a lot of time to think it out as to what is best for me.
-1	They didn't go to school that long and learn nothing
-1	I trust my primary care physician because ethey know me and my health history not to mention they also know my families health istory
-1	I trust my physician because I haven't had an issue with them yet and they been accurate so far. I feel I can trust my physician with providing me with information I need to know and understand. 
1	I trust my primary care physician fully because he is a very good doctor. I have been seeing him since I was a child and he has always given me the best care and been right about his diagnosis on the first try. He is nice and good at communication and making sure I fully understand everything and am comfortable
1	Doctors have gone through enough school to know whay is best for me. I can try to learn every thing I need to know about my health but I trust my doctor to I'd it for me.
-1	I think there is a mindset is medicine today that you need to get the patient in and out quickly. You have to consider what insurance will pay for when running tests. Doctors rarely get to know you well enough to have a complete understanding of your life and finding out what underlying causes may be contributing to what's wrong with you.
1	It's somewhat hard to explain, but I usually don't have a reason to distrust a doctor unless there's a reason to such as reputation or if someone didn't have the best experience with a doctor or doctors. 
-1	doctors are too busy seeing people that they have trouble keeping up with the new things that are being learned.
-1	I feel like doctors are fallible.  Doctors are just people with extensive training and the body is such a difficult and complex machine.  I don't blame my doctors for not being accurate 100% of the time, but I think that it helps to keep an open mind and trust what my body is telling me. 
-1	I trust them to know a lot more than I do but if it sounds wrong to me I will definitely seek a second or third opinion. I will do research online also just to see if others have the same issues.
-1	I think it varies from doctor to doctor. I had one doctor whom was vary vague with me. While I liked her and trusted her, she really didn't give me any additiol info when I was diagnosed with a heart murmur. She knew I was a smoker but didn't suggest any lifestyle changes. My second doctor told me that smoking would make it worse and I should have quit a long time ago. So it's really hard to trust doctors when one will say something and another won't mention other important information that you might want to be aware of.
1	I trust my doctor because he knows a lot more than me. He has vast experience, I have none.
-1	I trust him because he is a good person and he has never been wrong in the past. About none of my medical history he is the best.
-1	I've had 2 doctors in my life give me bad information.  So, I'm a little weary. I had one the was obviously getting paid to prescribe a certain pill and he pushed it hard on me.  When I got my second opinion the Doctor told me I didn't need pills.  I do think Doctors know way more than me but I'm cautious now with them. 
1	I trust doctors that take time to go over any questions I have in detail. They are not rushing out of the room to get to the next appointment. They see me as a human and not a dollar sign or bottom line.
1	She is very good at what she dose and she know what she dose and tell u what is wrong and is very understanding and talk to u
1	I trust my primary care physician. I've known my doctor for years and haven't had a bad experience dealing with the doctor or doctor's office in general. The information I've been given thus far has been correct and helpful. Therefore, until I have a bad experience, my trust is secure.
1	the advise given to me so far has proven to be right on target as to fixing a few minor problems , results have been very good, feeling much better
-1	I trust my doctor because he has never led me astray. He seems genuine in his concern for my health and the methods I need to use to fix whatever ailment I have. 
-1	Very young dr. I am new to practice. She has me on expensive mess that I cannot afford. This causes me stress and anxiety 
1	He gives an exam which is thorough, goes over all the results, suggests things, allows me to express my opinion and does not make me feel inadequate when I express myself by the way, check your spelling be4 fwding ques.  it is extrOvert not extrAvert
-1	I think most of them are just after your money and don't really care about you as an individual and i think that's wrong
-1	I have trust in my physician because they usually provide the right details for me and they thoroughly look into why I feel sick or whatever it may be. I trust their information and they rely to me the appropriate things I need to recover. Reason I put faith in them is because every time I went to them for help, they did their job well. 
1	My doctor is knowledgeable and seems to know what he's talking about. He has practiced for many years and comes highly recommended.
1	I feel like since my doctors have gone to medical school, they're no dummies. I have a good report with my doctors to where they give me the good and the bad. 
-1	I get a new doctor each time so it's hard to build trust. They don't necessarily know my medical history so it's hard to trust them.
-1	My doctor has proven a lot of times that he tries to treat me the best possible way available and I tend to trust him because of it. 
-1	I believe my physician mostly cares about his patients, including me. Any problems I have with him stem from his reliance on a completely helpless and unintelligent staff.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because of the way that talk to me and ask me if I understand what I need to do and if I am satisfied about the results of my health. 
-1	A number of statements which people have used to describe themselves are given below. Read each statement and then select the response option to the t.
1	I trust my doctor because he discusses things candidly and in ways I can understand. He always answers any questions and takes my wants into consideration. He is open to exploring any treatments that might benefit me and is honest about side effects and reasons why or why not something may be a good idea. 
1	he does what is best for me and understands that I need time to digest the information to make fully good choices
1	They haven't let me down yet. I trust them because every time i went to them with a problem, they always took care of it. They always manage to give me what i need to fix my problem without any negative side effects
-1	Because every Dr I been too has mix diagnosed me,missed broken ribs,an tell u anything an think u are drug seeking. But don't care if you are actually in pain or sick
1	My care has been extensive, satisfactory, informative and tailored to my and my health conditions thus far.  My doctors make sure I have all I need my medicine, information, care, treatment, tests, annual care.
1	I trust my Primary Care Physician because she actually knows her job. She treats her patients as if they are her own family. She can look at me and know what questions to ask.
1	I rust my primary care physician because I have always received sound medical care, and advice.  The care I have received have made my health better.
1	my personal physician has known me for 50 years and has never steered me wrong. He doesn't over medicate and I have total confidence that anything he suggests is worth listening to.
1	Very competent. Annual physicals are conversational regarding my overall health. This includes my physical assessment, lifestyle, diet, exercise, etc.
-1	Some doctor's are in it for the money and some doctors really do care. I believe insurance has a lot to do with it to.  I feel doctors, don't like dealing with uncovered patients.  I believe if we had universal insurance, Doctor's would be more understanding, if there wasn't a price tag attached to every person.  If every Doctor could look at every person, the same, and treat each person accordingly healthcare would be in a better light. I think the health care field needs to have guidelines securely in place pertaining to ethic's and morals.  I think it would make a great differences.
-1	My doctor tends to diagnose most problems as the same thing so I don't always agree with all he says.
-1	doctors don't take time to know their patients i don't believe that have enough information about me to give me best advice or medicine
-1	I do not have a primary doctor at this time, just lost my health insurance and moved to another state, but my previous doctor was ace all the way.
-1	I trust my doctor because he does not judge me when I bring health issues to him. He is always very thorough in suggesting treatments. He does a good job explaining WHY I am having the symptoms  I am. 
1	I trust my doctor because she has been my doctor for 24 years.
1	I trust my physician because she gives me all my options and tells me the pros and cons before we do anything.  She is available when I need her for anything and always makes room for me.
1	i have the up-most trust when it come to my doctor he has always been straight forward about my health and any treatment that he think i my need 
1	I have a very good doctor, we have been together for over 20 years. H knows my case history and is a very good doctor
-1	Some doctors are not very thorough or as careful as they should be and therefore cannot be trusted with my life
1	I just started seeing a new doctor so I suppose I don't know enough to completely trust her yet, but she's already much better than my previous doctor. She's very friendly and treats me more like an equal than like a patient she has authority over. She's easy to talk to and joke around with, and seems like she wants what's best for me even if she has to go out of her way to do it.
-1	i don't really go to the doctor that often as i am very healthy generally.  I don't feel any mistrust in my doctor but have little interaction at this time.  I would go if I needed help.
-1	I trust my doctor as far as he wants the best for me. However, he is limited in what he knows. He does not want to say outright that he does not know what to do but he just doesn't know everything. There is just too much to know that no one man can grasp it all. He will suggest herbal supplements but he is not knowledgable about them. He only knows his drug options. I really only go to him when I think I know what is wrong and he can verify it with blood tests or something.
1	Well I have known him for a long time and he is a good guy. He has never made a serious mistake in regards to helping me so I have great trust in him. He is also always quite nice. 
1	Because he answers all the questions that I ask, and gives me other altertives if needed.
-1	I feel like doctors usually try to do what is best but sometimes they are really busy. Also, sometimes they might recommend a certain treatment because they might get a kickback from a drug company.
1	I tust my physician.He always takes plenty of time to examine me and talk to me about all my conditions. He also always ask how my medicines are working.Explains any new medications that may be available to try.
-1	I do not always trust physicians anymore.  I feel that money and profits are he incentive behind all medical care, and often treatments may be given that do not even help or are sure to fail just to collect the money.  I am beginning to wonder if things like cancer are just big money makers for doctors and hospitals, and there really is no desire for a cure.  I feel that now, more than ever, doctors are not curing people, they just are creating customers that have to come back repeatedly.  Every prescription drug has so many side affects, that other things go wrong with a person, and the doctor is profiting by prescribing certain drugs.  I could be wrong, but I am starting to feel this way.
1	caring and thorough and has really helped my husband and all his medical issues always quick to respond
-1	They are often too busy to give patients the time needed to thoroughly discuss patient options or concerns.
-1	i trust him because i depend on him to tell me all the right things and to diagnosed me right so i can get the proper treatment
-1	I feel like they are doing the best they can, but are overworked and quality care is diminished, that does not mean that I distrust my doctor by any means, I just know mistakes can be made because they're only human.
-1	i trust some doctors. Not all doctors. everybody is not honest and trustworthy. Some nurses are very nice but not all
1	He has been our family physician forever, I trust him to make decisions that positively affect our family. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been her patient for years and years and she hadn't let me down and don't think she will regrading my health. 
1	My doctor never seems to be hurried and answers all of my questions in depth.
-1	I feel my doctor is knowledgeable and genially concerned with my health and well being. He is a caring person and isn't worried about how much money he can make.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been with her for years . She knows me very well .She can tell when i'm uncomformable about something she recommends and we talk about it sometimes we compromise .
1	I trust him because I never feel rushed or pressured when I go in for a visit. The nurses seem to also care a lot and help where and when they can. My doctor also tries to make himself available outside of the office, which is really nice.
-1	I feel that my current doctor is thorough and genuinely cares about my well-being. She looks at all aspects of my health, from my weight to my internal health.
-1	I think that a lot of doctors would rather have you get on some medication that might help you some, but would cause side effects that would make you have to continue going to the doctor, rather than really emphasize the importance of changing the things that people eat, so I don't trust them too much in that regard.
-1	"I am not willing to allow a physician to ""put me on"" a batch of drugs that have  adverse side affects so I am not the type of patient most doctors want.  I will listen to their reasons for the recommendations and then weigh what I may know about a drug and whether my symptoms are bad enough to take the risk of the side effects.  "
1	I believe my doctor take the time to give the most important information and take time to explain things to me. And will route me to additiol sources so I trust her over all.
1	never met a doctor who is as thorough or takes the time with me to male sure i understand everything going on with my condition
-1	My doctor is very knowledgeable and thorough but I still feel more comfortable researching and getting second opinions. I don't trust anyone blindly. 
-1	He has prescribed me a medication that could have caused serious harm due to an interaction with another medication I was on, which he knew I was taking. He has also prescribed me a medication that could have prevented me from having more children and did not mention this. He is also not as knowledgeable about my condition as he should be given that he specializes in the area. He works at an office that has incompetent staff across the board. I would use another office if my insurance allowed me to, but unfortunately they are the only option. 
-1	I trust her to do what is right for me but I'm not afraid to ask for a second opinion if I need to (thankfully I've never had to do that). She hasn't let me down yet so I have trust in her. 
-1	I have only seen my new primary care doctor once.  She was thorough in her questions and seemed very involved in my health care with recommendations for action and followup.  (Of interest, I had also seen a dermatologist about the same time... that physician/assistant seemed to actually be grossed out by me and responded with a lot of 'i really dont know what to tell you' and with no recommended treatment, and the clinic calling me with the wrong information only to have to call me back and tell me they made a mistake.)   Truly, I think going to the doctor is a crap shoot as to whether or not you will get someone that cares and doesn't treat you like someone they just need to move through the system.
-1	I trust most doctors but I have had a few that seemed like I was just another number and just tell you something to get you in and out quickly
-1	Having a myriad of experiences with physicians as a result of my background, I can say with absolutely certainty that physicians are predisposed to engaging in bad behavior and ebled by society's misconception of all physicians as a group as being compassiote, competent, ethical, trustworthy etc. Having seen shockingly horrifying and abhorrent displays of bad behavior by physicians, there is no way I have any trust in physicians as a group as they are one of the most self-serving, selfish, manipulative, and uncaring people I have come across. This is not to say that all physicians are like this, however, it is important that people drop their false notion of physicians being equivalent to saints so that patients are better equipped to deal with wily, deceptive physicians and are more motivated to be active when seeking healthcare/engaging with physicians. 
-1	I do not trust doctors at all it seems there thing is to give a pill for a pill and this side effect will outweigh this side effect
-1	I trust him because he has taken care of the sickness I have had and my family has had.  I do sometimes have trouble understanding what the nurses call me back about for diagnosis
1	I feel that my doctor has my trust because she is always willing to provide me with information as well as make sure I understand everything before I leave, she takes the time to show compassion for me.
-1	"I know that my doctor is at the mercy of insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. He doesn't have time to invest in talking to me, he has to electronically chart my case in detail to kickstart the billing process, and he often does that in front of me. His waiting room has pens, clocks, and other knickknacks branded to pharmaceuticals, and his exam room has branded ""informational"" posters, all of which are badges of bias. "
-1	to be honest I have really never trusted doctors  but the doctor I have I trust him sometimes I have my doubts about him but he really seems to know what he is doing and I guess I trust him more than I would any other doctor 
-1	Because some are sneaky and are just trying to get as much money out of you as they can which is evil and should not be aloud 
1	I trust what my doctor says about a medical condition. I have found that what I read about a given condition was in agreement with what the doctor said about the condition. I trust what my doctor says about a specialist to see. For example, if my doctor recommends a specialist doctor, I know it will be someone who is excellent. I have checked the patient reviews for a recommended specialist and found out that the reviews were consistent with what my doctor had said about the specialist.
-1	Sometimes I feel like certain doctors I have been to, just want to get you out of the room. They don't seem to be paying attention to what I am saying. 
-1	I sometimes feel doctors are overbooked and a result hurry too much with each patient. I also feel that sometimes they are a bit too confident in what they think and dont explore other options well enough just to be safe.
-1	I don't think she is that great of a doctor. I wouldn't mind changing to another one if I could find one that's better.
1	I would not be using the doctor if I did not have complete trust.  I have been with this doctor for 15+ years and she knows my history very well.  She has always explained things really well, especially when something out of the ordinary occurred,  When there was a problem, she found it quickly and was quick to act and resolve the problem.
-1	"In my most recent visit, he dressed me down for not having had a mammogram or Pap smear in a few years...he was right. Time just slipped away from me. I was irritated that he wanted a blood test for my estrogen levels, but he gave me a good reason: he wanted to know whether I was getting the right dosage in my estradiol pills (prescribed by a different doctor). All in all, he seemed pretty straight forward and not into ""woo""."
-1	It is natural for people to try and get as much money as possible. This applies to doctors because certain procedures that might be unnecessary are sometimes ordered so that the doctor can bill you or your insurance more than he typically could. I have good insurance so I do not mind having extra tests performed because it is not costing me anything and i am getting thorough examinations 
-1	I think that doctors are people to so they can make errors.  I trust my doctor but still use apps such as WebMD so I can get a sense of what might be the problem before going to the doctor.
-1	My primary care Dr seems to think I'm capable of more physical activity than I really am. My orthopedic surgeon knows exactly what I can do and is proud of my accomplishments.
1	She's never disappointed me. Every time I go to her, she's right about what's wrong. And the long term treatments help also. 
1	I trust my physician because I have known him for years. We used to work side by side in the hospital. I know without a doubt that he will tell me things honestly even if it goes against what his normal protocols are. I am fortunate to have this relationship with him.
1	I am between doctors right now, but my last doctor was very patient, knowledgeable and concerned about any problems or conditions I brought to him.  He would  asked question about my symptoms and suggest remedies for me to consider.  
1	Most of my experiences with doctors have been positive ones.  The exceptions are with two doctors I saw (one time each), who were employed by hotels I work at.  These positions are given to the lowest bidders, and both doctors were somewhat hostile and incompetent.
-1	Their willingness to explain my medical diagnosis thoroughly, but in understanding terms makes me trust my pcp. 
-1	I have been around the medical community for a long time and would trust the training of doctors more than myself or the internet. 
1	The reason I got a lot of trust n my doctor is because he goes step by step to explain each n everything he is doing to me or what was done
1	She is very knowledgeable and experienced.  My Dr. is also very honest and open when she communicates with you. She treats you like a person. 
-1	I do not have a pcp, although  it rust that doctors do the best they can; unfortunately they do not know everything.
-1	I do not trust many doctors in general which is why I don't go to the doctor very often. I believe that many doctors are just sellers of drugs and make way too much money in royalties for talking people in to taking certain drugs.
-1	My regular doctor is great. She is not always available however, and then I question the replacements. 
-1	I trust that most doctors are just trying to be helpful but I still double check things with my grandmother since she's a nurse
1	My doctor is very transparent with me, I am only 20 years old so he warns me all the time about certain diseases people my age tend to catch. He is also very interested in our lives like our studies and sports, and that makes me feel more welcomed by him.
-1	"I trust my doctor cause she went to school.. I would think she knew what she was taking about. Sometimes I feel like she rushes to get patients like me ""in and out"" just to get paid.. she doesn't really look into symptoms "
-1	Again, I think that the main reason is my inability to 'self-diagnose' and communicate my concerns with them. There is also something of a mistrust of the system within which they work as there are so many constraints upon doctors due to insurance coding and coverage. It seems to interfere with their ability to offer care.
-1	I feel like people have flaws just like physicians do. Your doctor is not good at everything therefore could be wrong about things. It is always good to get another opinion
1	I trust my doctor because I feel he knows much more about medical care than I.  If he doesn't have an answer to a medical problem he will send me to another doctor that can help me.
-1	Before my doctor's office was so busy it was hard to get an appointment and it was never the same doctor. I have a new doctor now and he seems more detailed but I felt rushed again. 
-1	i do not really have much to say about it after all medical treatment is not an option its a nicesity
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has the education and experience to make the right decisions pertaining to my health
-1	they never call as needed or when i ask them to disreragrd my messages all together. never return my calls

I don't think the PCP totally knows whats going on with my case because they have to work and think quickly and each patient in unique and treatment should be individualized.

1	HE IS KIND AND HELPFUL AND BEEN WITH HIM FOR OVER 15 YEARS. I HAVE TO SAY I'M STICKING WITH HIM.I GENERALLY FOUND DOCTORS TO BE DELIGENT AND TRUSTHWORTHY IN THEIR PROFESSION. MOST PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT THIS FACT I BELIEVE.

1	My doctor takes all the time I need him to take to explain everything I want or need to know in great detail.  He respects the fact that I do not like taking pills, and is willing to work with me on lowering my dosages to the minimum effective dose for my condition.  He explains all my options thoroughly, and does not let me leave the office until he is sure I understand them.  He will also squeeze me in immediately if there is a sudden worsening of my condition.  
-1	To be honest, I haven't been to a primary care physician in many many year.  If I did go see one, I would have a great deal of trust.

My GP has increased medications to a level that is harmful due to my illness, or prescribed meds or treatments that contradict or react with my other meds. He also put me on three medications to lower my blood pressure at once, which caused my bp to drop so low so quickly that I had seizures.
-1	I sometimes get the feeling the doctor is thinking more about what the insurance company will pay for rather that what is best.

1	I trust my doctor completely because he has saved my life in the past and helped me to better myself.
1	He knows a lot more than I do. With over twenty years of schooling who am I to dispute what is told, I do some reaseaech but for the most part believe in my doctor. I can always get second opinions of not totally sure. 
-1	I've only been to her one time but she was very nice and listen to what I said but didn't seem to do much of an examination but it was just an initial first time visit
-1	I feel like it's a treadmill these days. The doctor listens to you the customer about your problems and try to give you a quick bandaid fix to your problems and most of the time, just tell you to wait a few days for your immune system to take care of it. I trust their authority most of the time, but feel like there's some hidden information not given as well.
-1	I trust and sometimes don't. I trust them because I've been going there for a long time now and they check to see exactly what is wrong then when I don't feel good in a couple of days after going I don't trust what they said was wrong.

1	I trust my doctor's decisions because my doctors are trained professionals and they know what they are doing. My doctor is super nice and kind and takes time with me when I don't understand something about my health or my wellbeing. My doctor is irreplaceable to me.
1	Other members of my family see the same primary care physician as me, and she noticed a serious medical issue affecting my mother before any other doctor.
1	I trust my doctor because he tells me exactly what I have, why I have what I have, and how to correct my condition. He does not try to push medications on me but looks for natural solutions if possible.

1	He is looking out for my well-being running the best test for my conditions prescribing the medicines that's going to improve my condition.
1	I trust my primary care physician implicitly.  If I did not trust her, I would find another doctor.  My doctor is caring and always takes the time to discuss all of my questions about my health.  She is not an alarmist.  She always remains calm and is not upsetting regardless of the health issues that are needed to be dealt with.   
1	I generally trust skilled professionals across the board. I assume someone who was intelligent and hardworking enough to fulfill the obligations of becoming a practicing physician would uphold the integrity of the position.
1	My doctor seems to genuinely care about her job. She seems worried and really listening when I am telling her my problems. Then I can tell she is thinking hard and trying to help me to a solution.
-1	I always find that I have to do more research about different treatments for any ailments I might have.  I don't find that my doctor spends enough time talking to me about choices of medications or options for treatments.  I always feel rushed and that my doctor is not confident enough to recommend any treatments or anything to me regarding my health.
-1	My doctor is open with me and generally is able to answer all of my questions.  Though I feel like the doctor is always in a rush and doesn't explain things as fully as possible.
-1	I do not visit them enough, but from the doctors i've visted, they were always pretty honest when it came to my health.
1	Ive been going to my doctor for over 10 years. He has gained my trust. He explains everthing so that i can understand

1	I Trust my primary care physician because I have a personal relationship with her and besides my Having my health at heart she has my Best interest as well and she cares a lot for me and my kids! She gives great medical advice and personal advice as well ! 
-1	Again working in the medical field I see things that worry me and make me more cautious.  Such as, a Dr that delivers too many c sections because he has plans for the weekend and doesn't want to get called in. Or a doctor that doesnt explain appropriately to the patient, or even worse doesn't even see the patient and provides service thru only looking at a chart. 
-1	I trust my doctors because when problems came about, they gave me my options and also gave me time to think about what I wanted to do about the whole situation I like that my doctors were real with me. And had the time that I needed

-1	My primary care physician has practiced medicine in my hometown for about thirty-five years and is well respected. More over, he has been treating members of my family for most of that time. I trust him fairly implicitly.
-1	They make matters worst. They don't want patients to get well.  Money is only on their mind.  They don't fully try to understand the patients' needs.
1	I made sure to get friends opinions and also to do online research when choosing my doctor. She has an amazing bedside manner and makes me feel at ease. She does not over react and also does not under react.  I think there are some doctors that can come across as condescending and she is not like that at all.  It takes a special doctor to be able to answer your questions without making you feel like stupid!
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for serveral years and he explains any problems I have to me in detail.  He describes and goes over every decision made and we decide on treatment option together.  
-1	I donât think some physicians are open enough to modern medicine or understand the muscles and skeletal systems in the body or how we can hold so much internally. Some are more open minded then others.
1	I trust him because I understand everything that he explain all procedures  thoroughly    Always available 
-1	I trust my physician.  They are licensed and educated
-1	I generally trust my doctor but I feel like with the workload they have that sometimes I need to be responsible in following through or asking the right questions in order to make sure I get the right help.
1	he has always been correct with diagnosis, takes all the time I need when I see him, does testing when its needed , calls when any test results come back from the lab
1	I have no negative feelings or connotations toward my primary doctor. I trust in his treatments and diagnosis
-1	I have some trust in my primary care physician but would hesitate to have full trust unless I have gone through many more health issues to see her response/care to them. I do tend to do independent research on the health issues so that i have some comparison to her response & care of the problem. So, mostly, i feel like she has been truthful and has provided adequate care. 
1	I have had the same physician for a number of  years, so he knows me very well, and i trust the things that he tells me in regards to my health and well being
1	I completely trust my primary care physician; he is compassionate and cares about my over-all health. 
1	I trust my doctor because they're always helpful and open with me, they take the time to answer any questions. My doctor has also returned emails and chats in my medical portal, so I have more trust in them.
-1	I haven't had an experience where my doctor was wrong.  They are experts in their field and usually know what they are doing.
-1	I do not think that doctors much care any more. I think they are short on time and just need to earn the dough. 
-1	I do not really like my doctor but it is hard to change to a new one. I live in a small town. I trust many doctors though because they have a lot to lose so they tend to try very hard to do their best.
-1	I have never had one regular primary care physician as I have moved around a lot. My experiences have varied from one doctor to another. They are all individual human beings with different persolities and flaws.
1	My doctor seems very knowledgeable in his field. He takes time and doesn't rush. Not glued to his laptop. So far he has been right with any diagnosis.
1	They seem very educated and experienced. They have also worked with a variety of patients who have had complications, so they are qualified to make decisions. If I ask them a question regarding something I am hesitant about, they will give an educated response as to why they are doing what they're doing.
1	I trust my PCP because she paid attention to the fact that I had a goiter, when no one else would, and she's treating my hypothyroidism, when no one else took it seriously.
1	My PCP has invested time in understanding my medical history and general health.  She is thorough and careful in explanations, such that I believe I have sufficient information to make necessary decisions.  She takes a whole-system approach to health, and will check in with my preferences for, e.g., pharmaceutical vs. alternative treatment for an illness or injury.
1	do not have a primary doctor, but I feel that doctors are desensitized to the health concerns of their patients
1	My physician is always honest without being judgmental.  She tells me steps I can take, but understands when these steps are difficult to fit into my life.  She also is happy if changes are made as small steps or trying to complete one healthy change at a time, rather than expect me to completely alter my lifestyle.
1	Because I have a good doctor I trustHer she is good and works with meWhat more do you want me to say that's all I can say
-1	Have been seeing the same doctor for longer than I can remember....knows my entire family
1	I trust my doctor becauseâ I know without any doubt in my mind he knows what he is doing and I trust him to be my doctor because I know he cares for me.
-1	My primary physician is fine.  But after my health catastrophe experience, where I had one of the TOP DOCs in the country and refused to do what he recommended, to my everlasting satisfaction, while my wife stood beside and cried, begging me to do what he told me to, I don't trust doctors further than I can throw them.
1	I totally trust my physician because she spends time and talks to me on various subjects and tells me what are all the pros and cons of various disorders. She is straightforward so I guess I am lucky. Whatever I expect from my doctor I am getting from her, be it anything even if I am hesitant she makes sure I am taken care of and I am in good hands
-1	I have not been with my primary care physician for a long time so I can't say that I fully trust him at this time.
1	he has been there for me and he alway s tells you the truth and does not sugarcode any thing.you can reach him anyrime
1	I trust that my doctor is giving me all the information to the best of her ability, and wants to help me make the best decisions possible. However, she is human, and busy, and human health is complicated and constantly evolving. I do not expect her to know everything. 
-1	I try to avoid going to my doctor unless it's absolutely necessary.  I don't trust them because I have anxiety and depression and it makes trust almost impossible for me.  I realize that this is all on me but I just find it not possible for me.  I would like very much to do it.  I know they're not going to lie to me but I still find that I just don't trust any of them.
-1	I understand that doctors go to school and years of experience but sometimes they can still be wrong. So I do not put my trust in doctors but I put my trust in God.
-1	doctors are human and make mistakes. they are capable of misdiagnosing conditions, prescribing the wrong medicaions. they use staff that overbook patients so that you don't see a doctor. they over prescribe medications ,they push samples that you don't want to try because big pharma gives them perks for doing this practice whether the medication is right for you or not.
-1	I really dont trust them because they never give natural remedies. They always go straight to medicine which is not good for your body. 
1	My doctor  is a do.She is there first do primary care doctor I have had. She is  more holistic in her approach to patient care. I like that.
-1	Sometimes I feel as though doctors diagnose without actually running the necessary tests. It took two doctors to let me know that I had acid reflux and needed prescription medication. 
-1	My doctor is straight and,tell you what,you need to do to maintain. He is always calm and never rush you in and out. Make sure that you exercise and take your medicine 
1	I trust my doctor because she tells me things I don't want to hear. She will also tell me altertive methods to getting better and not just shoving pills down my throat.
-1	I trust my primary doctor because he takes the time out to talk to and get to know each patient and ask questions that you can't answer with yes or no
-1	I have a physician that is not bothered by all my questions that I ask or bothered when I ask for alternative options available to me.  He explains everything in a way that I can understand and make a logical decision.
1	I have known this person for a few years now, and I trust his judgement. I have felt that he is interested me as a person, not just a chart. I feel I could talk to this person about anything going on in my body.
-1	I believe that my doctor can be a bit hasty sometimes when its a busy day but I still trust his knowledge.  Consultations seem a bit short, but all in all I am typically out the door with a prescription that will  help me feel better and they always do.  I think when and if there is something of greater concern than a common cold,  he'll be more likely to spend more time to explain the condition and treatment.
-1	Being given conflicting information then the denial, can never simply admit being human and making a mistake
1	I think that he holds himself to high standards and has always showed me respect and understands me and is compassionate. He has never gave me any reason for me to not trust him. He is always honest and straight forward with me, and that is how I prefer it.
-1	I think they have a good knowledge of medical things. Sometimes they might do what is safer than more effective
-1	I trust my doctor because I've been with her a few years, and she helps me with everything, all my health needs. She's very thorough and asks me questions to really understand my concerns. I do feel like all doctors push medications and sometimes I feel like some of the medications I'm supposed to take can make situations worst or the misunderstand my needs prior to providing me with a medication. 
1	although trust has inherent as well as instrumental value for patients, clinicians, and healthcare institutions, trust can be misplaced, and distrust can be unjustified. Thus, if a physician reveals truthfully to a patient how s/he is paid, trust in the physician may diminish as a result of this trustworthy behavior.
1	She is knowledgeable, thorough, and rated a top doctor in our area.  Therefore I trust her to recommend proper treatments, medications, and procedures that I may need.  She is also good at answering  my questions and keeping he records of my past visits.;;
-1	my doctor is head of Neurology at a very large and well known teaching hospital in Alabama. My doctor has operated on my brain and I can still walk and talk but I am blind and deaf on my right side. I would rather be blind/deaf on one side than be paralyzed. I had a brain tumor and one doctor wanted to remove 100% which would have resulted in me being paralyzed. Thanks to my Mom's knowledge, I switched hospitals and neurosurgeons and I am not paralyzed. I do have 20% of tumor wrapped around my brainstem but 80% of tumor was removed by my current doctor
1	I trust her because she is a strong female. Currently she serves in the Army National Guard and just got home from overseas. She is as tough as they come and listens well. I am a little intimidated to tell her things in relation to myself at times because she is so strong. Overall, she knows my home situation and understands being a full time caretaker is a hard job. She makes referrals when necessary and only lets me try meds that she knows will not make me too tired to care for my family member. I don't feel like a number when I see her. Nice office staff helps too!
1	I trust my primary care physician. He makes sure that he does a good job and you are at the appropriate weight.
1	i totally trust everyone of my doctors i know that they thinking more about me and my health problems
-1	Because I have a lot of experience in care physicians giving me the wrong treatment, tests, and medications.  I have suffered a lot of negative side effects because of doctors not believing me. Doctors in my are do not have the knowledge to help me how I need to be helped. They are not willing to individualize their treatments according to individuality and differences. This made me skeptical over a lot of doctors.
-1	I trust doctors in general because they have a deeper understanding of the things I don't know about my body.  For example, I have chronic heartburn and I trust that my doctor can share information about which treatment is best for me.
1	I have been through a surgery with him and have had good results. He openly shares the good and the bad and the tough things.
1	I've been going to my primary care doctor for years and she hasn't given me any reason to not trust her.  To the contrary, she lets me know that she is going to do what she thinks should be done, regardless if I like it or not.
-1	I believe a doctor can treat me of my illness when am able to tell them what my problems are and also when they are able to diagnose my sickness 
1	I think he is competent and knows what he is doing. He will be honest with me and let me know what the situation is. If something is out of his realm then he will refer me to a proper specialist.
-1	Doctors cut corners. I know because I am one, and I have done so. So I wouldn't be surprised if my physician made mistakes because of that. 
1	I one-hundred percent trust my primary care physician as well as all of the employees at the practice I visit. He has done an excellent job at helping me maintain my health this fas. 
1	Have a new doctor, she seems to understand my medical conditions and prescribes prescriptions for them. I do/have to trust her for prescribing new prescriptions, or taking some of them away when no longer useful.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with her for years. She always genuinely cares for me.
-1	i do not trust anyone now days. to many things go wrong and to much sueing going on these days. doctors seem like they just want your money more than your well being
1	The reasons why I trust and distrust them a little because health care for profit can get in the way
1	I trust her because she listens and discusses with me any health issues or concerns I may have. 
-1	I feel that they don't totally tell me.everything honestly. They are more worried bout money and the pharmaceutical company.  
-1	I feel that she is too busy , pressured to not spend enough time. She frequently refers me to a specialist so that my medical information is scattered
-1	I think in general most physicians have their patients' best interest in mind.  They are dedicated to providing quality care.  However, some doctors may be more concerned with profits and payments from drug industries so it is important to ask questions.  
-1	I trust no one, so therefore I  will ask alot of questions.  I think everyone should get a second opinion; or ask questions until you get all questions answered .
-1	I trust my primary care doctor.  She has never given me something I don't understand and has always explained things carefully and thoroughly.  I understand enough about my diet and lifestyle to know if she gives me a medication that I probably need it.
1	She spends a good deal of time with me during my appointments.  I never feel rushed, and she appears to genuinely listen when I ask her a question.  I'm also able to carry on a constructive dialogue with her, where I share my own opinions.
1	I feel totally confident with my doctor since it tells me clearly that it is what I have explains to me how the disease is and how it will cure me according to the treatment given to me
-1	"I believe that most doctors are educated in their field, but have their own expert ""opinion"" when it comes to certain topics. For example, I had an allergist suggest to me that I shouldn't nurse my daughter past a certain age due to her dairy and egg allergy."
-1	I trust my doctor because they went to school and they are the experts. They know biologically what's going on more than I do and can give a name and diagnosis to my guy feeling 
1	"I trust my doctor to make the right decisions for my persol health.  I have never felt that I was ""putting out"" my doctor by my needs or questions. "
-1	I feel that my primary care doctor often does not have nor take the time to listen to me thoroughly or allow me to ask in-depth questions.  Therefore, I cannot trust that the decisions that he makes for me is thoroughly informed. 
1	Have been seeing them for a long time , and have a lot of confidence in them .When something works I tend to leave my t alone 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he always does what's best for me and explains my problems and questions thoroughly. 
-1	My care physician is the closest I can get to without having to drive almost 100 miles round trip. The clinic that my doctor is based at is always over crowded and busy so I rarely get much time with my doctor. She tries to do what she can for me but she has admitted that it has not been easy since more and more paper work has been added to her daily work and she was forced to take on more patients than she can handle. My doctor is wore out most of the time and often times I have to mention things like possible blood work that should be done or scans because she won't always think of them. She has too much on her plate and it is hurting her patients overall.
-1	I generally trust my doctor.  I know he is looking out for my best interest.  I typically try to avoid the need for any medications to take regularly, and I do believe there are problems with certain medications that are pushed on patients.   
-1	I trust the information provided by my doctor. She is very thorough and ensures I do not leave with questions. I sometimes wonder if she doesn't provide me with all the information regarding my health if she deems it irrelevant. I do find myself frustrated with waiting as that does make me seem as it's more to accommodate the doctor vs. the patient. 
1	I trust my primary care physician, because he is careful with me and medication (I'm very sensitive to medications).  He understands when I do not want to continue on a certain medication (because of the side effects I have read about or have been told about by other medical professionals).  He spends time with me discussing my health issues and immediately responds when I send him a message via my health portal.  He remembers my health record and seems to know my past history even though he has hundreds of patients.
-1	I trust my doctor because they have never been wrong in my treatment and refer me to other if they don't know
-1	I generally trust him, but I don't completely trust everything they evaluate. He is just a person with his own biases after all. but I generally think of him as credible
1	I have a high trust with my primary care physician because I have been going to the same physician for a long time. If there is something I do not understand I can ask for more clarity on the matter. Long term relation with my physician have helped me secure my trust in all the things my physician say, and I can tell that my physician cares deeply about me.
-1	I know they get kickbacks for prescribing certain medications from companies and so they do in fact go out of their way to prescribe them when the might not be the best medication for the ailment or might even be harmful or just plain not need medication at all.  The can put their bottom line first which is never good for the patient.  This is not always the case of course but it happens way more than it should (of course it should never happen at all)
1	My doctor knows me and understands me.  He cares and is very educated.  He never talks down to me and talks in words that I can understand.
-1	It seems as though doctors are more concerned about money, rather than being completely focused on patient health. 
-1	I trust that my primary care physician is providing me with all of the information that I need in order to get proper care for my health condition. 
1	My primary care physician was able to correctly diagnose a rare inner ear condition that I have.
1	I've been with my primary care physician for several years, and we have a good relationship. I feel like my physician is open and forthcoming with me, and I feel like I can be as well in return.
-1	I trust that the Dr believes he is being thorough. The PCP gives basic care and refers you to specialists who I believe try to help.  I don't trust any Dr.  I have been to so many for a chronic condition that I don't have total faith in any of them.
-1	I have confidence and trust in my PCM, but I also have to weigh his recommendations against my own philosophy of life, and compare his diagnosis to what I research online form other experts in the field.
1	My doctor gives me no reason not to trust them. They always make time for me even when they are busy. The health of their patients is their number one priority. 
-1	My illnesses seem to be getting worse.  I tell her everything that goes on with me.  She doesn't seem to help me as needed.
-1	I trust my doctor because they have never given me a reason not to. I have been seeing the same primary care physician for about six years now and they always address all the questions I have and spend a fair amount of time with me. I have always felt well taken care of.
-1	"Sometimes I'll get different feedback from a different provider of mine that makes me question who is right or who is wrong. Or I'll bring up something I read online or heard from others with similar conditions and the physician will say ""Yes, that is an option."" I don't like to have to be the one to bring up other things."
1	My doctor seems very trustworthy and every time I go to her she gives me great advice and seems as if she cares. I go mainly for womanly checks and she does a great job making sure I'm comfortable.
1	I trust her because she answers all of my questions whether they're dumb or not. She goes through each problem I'm having thoroughly and breaks it down for me so I understand what she's saying. 
1	My doctor is a great physician who cares for me, talks to me and always puts my health as a top priority. He asks questions, let's me talk and dialogues with me about any concern that either he or I have. 
-1	Distrust, new doctor, don't know much about them. Trust, makes me feel comfortable feels like they listen to my consernes. 
-1	My primary care doctor knows both of my parents and is a very blunt person in general. I do not shirk from getting the information I want so I am not scared too ask questions.
-1	I generally just my primary care physician, because I've had good experiences with her for the most part, but she did let me down in a big way recently and that's shaken my trust in her. I'm also having problems with another person I see, and it's making me trust medical professionals less because she's so bad.
1	My doctor always seems very concerned whenever I come in with a serious problem.  He listens to me & tells me what I need to know & do & is always very cordial & understanding.  
1	I trust them because they committed to very many years of schooling to do what they do. They're trained in their profession and do it nearly every day which quickly builds experience. The most experience I have is Google searches so I have no choice but to put my trust in them.
1	I put complete trust in my doctor because he has been my doctor for many many years. He knows all about my health and medical needs. He is straight forward with me. He has never lied to me to benefit himself.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is knowledgeable in his field. While I try to gain understanding through probing, I ultimately defer to his knowledge in coming to certain conclusions. Past experience has taught me that he is usually right, so that's another reason I generally trust him.
-1	Some times it's as if some doctors need someone to experiment on. Some don't even know how to diagnose correctly. Very skeptical about making appointments or even going to the emergency room because of it.
-1	He has never held back on what he thinks is best for me. He speaks plainly and bluntly about what I need to help me get over my conditions if that is something that can be done. He does not play games or go easy on my feelings he tells it like it is. I like a doctor who gets to the point and gives me the bad and good without trying to downplay how bad something is. 
1	My provider is thorough, is patient, has a good way of explaining things. She has a solid education and training and has not been wrong in diagnosing my health problems. 
-1	I trust them because they are usually accurate that's why. And they will or will not give you the medical attention you need
1	this is a get one for me.being going for a long time.i like very much.he is the best one for me.that is why i go to him.
-1	The only reason why I have some distrust in my physician is because she is quick to prescribe medications sometimes and isn't the best at explaining all the side effects and that makes me not trust her to the highest extent. She is pretty good overall thats the only issue I have with her. 
-1	He's not sure what will work for me, though he means well. It may have worked for others but there's no guarantee it will work for me.
-1	when visiting with him he spends a great deal of time explaining and going over all my questions and advises me of all the wrong things I do and tries to have me correct them
-1	Since it's the doctor's job, and they are more knowledgeable in the field of health, I have to trust them, even if I think if their decision is a little questionable. I can ask them questions on why they recommend something, but they have more expertise in the field than me.
-1	Because Doctors do care about my health and for my whole body to feel much better.Sometimes Doctors don't care or didn't do a good job when it comes to asking so many questions and Got me upset, about something.that's awkward.Doctor's are there to find out what's going on with my health and to learn about me getting the help I need.
-1	I have been with my doctor for many years, he has done a great job taking care of me. I have no reason to mistrust him or suspect some hidden motives.
1	they are professional doctor have been to a college and know about the human. theyexpience on a regular basic. bt we know for a fact that god know the human body than we do. men dont have knowledge all knowledge from our creator and our lord jesus christ
-1	I think he has my best interests at heart, although he appears to be overworked with the number of patients he sees (Veterans Admin).
-1	I don't have complete trust in them.  They are so busy and trying so hard to get patients in and out I don't feel they totally are dedicated to providing me with the best care. 
-1	Doctors are trustworthy due to their years of experience and training for actual situations when the time comes to be on the floor.
-1	I generally trust what the doctor says.  Sometimes I have doubts because I spend so little time actually talking to them I feel like they dont have a complete picture of me and my problem.
-1	My experience with doctors has always been that they tend to treat or guess rather than actually putting thought into the process of healthcare. 
-1	they have given me good advice so far and my conditions are under control currently.  they have not given a reason not to trust them
1	my doctor has really been great for me in the past. Him and his office have treated me spectacularly through a number of different situations that have arose. I haven't ever felt rushed or uncared for after seeing him.
1	I trust him because he seems to know what he's doing. So far he's been right.So I trust him.
-1	I trust my physician because I don't feel like he's trying to oversell me to get more from my insurance. His answers and explations are quite clear. 
1	I've had the same doctor for the last three years. He seems pretty thorough and accomplishes everything that needs to be done during my visits. He's brought up tests I could do if I wanted to but doesn't push them on me.
-1	In general regards to doctors as a whole, I feel that they are very rushed and dishonest. They do not take the time to answer all my questions and make sure I feel comfortable or am fully informed about any decisions being made.
-1	i don't know my primary physician well enough as I never used him more than once a year so I really can't say.  Now that I'm older, I'll use him more
-1	I live in Racine WI. Our primary hospital was bought out by Wheaton Fransiscan. They refused to pay the best doctors what they are worth, so, hence, those doctors left town. They were replaced by doctors who got bs and cs in college. Many have a very hard to understand accent. ALL act like they are on a stopwatch
1	The first time I went to see my primary care physician he spent a lot of time with me getting to know about my problems. He sat down, looked concerned, and wanted to know more information so that he could help me. He also listens to me when I have a different medication request and he is very easy to work with.
-1	I don't care for my doctor much. I hadn't been to a doctor in 10 years. Before that I had a bad experience with my doctor. Recently I've also had a bad experience. Just more medical bills for them to prescribe me crap. Basically a 100 version of a drug that I could get for $1 over the counter,.
1	I have been going to him long enough to know I can trust him. When he was having me go to the hospital by the time I got there my room was already assigned to me.
-1	I don't have a physician at the moment, however, when I did, I found him to be arrogant  and condescending and very ready to ignore my concerns if they didn't  agree with his way of thinking.
-1	I trust my doctor most of the time. Sometimes I wish she would show a little more compassion but she is a very busy doctor so I overlook it. There are times I wish she would consider different treatments or at least give a referral. All together I do trust her opinion and judgement. 
1	I feel that my doctor does not have any reason to lie about something. I also know a few things myself and can tell by my doctor's body language. I am able to research the doctor's advice myself and compare it.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has always been open and honest with me. She listens to me carefully and is gentle and kind and patient with me. She's fairly young as well, which I like. She's not judgmental of me
-1	I feel my doctor completes the bare minimum required of her because I have state insurance so I pat nothing out of pocket for her time, which is as short as she will make it.
-1	I always trusted my doctor because they always know how my health is at good level when they check it and that's why I always like my doctor.
-1	I think doctor's are overworked and don't ave time to create caring relationships with their patients
-1	I dont really have a primary doctor at this time. So I generally believe that doctors are trustworthy, to what degree, however, is debatable.
-1	I have certain problems diagnosed and my Doctor has me come back multiple times to try new medicines instead of listening to what works for me. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he is thorough and caring and asks a lot of questions and persists in a considerate manners even when I seem hesitant and uncomfortable. He is friendly and calm. 
1	I   guess   all   I  can   say   is   that   the   guy   working   on   you  went    to  school   a  long  time   before  he   got   where   he   is   today   so   I  want   to   trust  him   or   her   completely , my   life   is   in   his   hands  on  Earth  but   ultimately ,  we   are   all   in   GODS   hands  and  when   HE   calls   us ,  its  time
-1	They are honest and helpful. In a human level they give you tips on what is right for you.i feel they break down the good and the bad of your health situation in a way that makes you think. Other times they try to hard or not enough to be on your side. You can tell if you trust or distrust by personality.
1	I've had the same doctor for most of my adult life. Any issues I've brought up he treated or ran tests to find out what was going on. He's always taken action on anything I brought up and is great at communicating and returning phone calls. I wouldn't extend blanket trust to all doctors just because they are doctors but i would give them the benefit of the doubt
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a professiol and knows what he's talking about. He's never led me wrong so far.
-1	Most of the time, doctors do what is easy, or less expensive. Not caring about how miserable I may be. I have met very few doctors that understand that I have lived in my body my whole life, not them.
1	i've known my MD for about 11 years and she's never given me any reason but trust her judgment. I feel that she cares about her patients plus I hear the same from all her other patients, many of them are friends of mine
1	I have had bad doctors in the past, I like the relationship i have with this doctor now, I totally trust him, not everyone graduates is good at their job but mine is, at least with me
-1	When i have a doctor's appointment i make sure to write down the name of the medicine that im taking
1	because they always call and tell honest answers and medications. they explain every details step by step
1	I find that my doctor is straight with her/his clients and does their job well at keeping you as healthy as possible
1	In general, I trust doctors to be highly skilled and highly knowledgeable in their practice. I do believe they genuinely care about helping others and want to look out for the best interests of their patients.
1	I trust my physician because he is thorough and explaining the information about what is going on me and my health. Second, he listens to my concerns related to my health. Also, my doctor can be trusted when it comes to making decisions related to my health.
-1	To an extent I trust my physician but it seems as if she is always rushed and just trying to get people in and out as quick as possible. Somethings that seem worrisome to me are just dismissed and not thoroughly explained.
1	I get a very strong impression that my doctor is looking out for my best interests and she is very knowledgeable about my conditions. 
-1	My doctor is often in a hurry because he has many patients to see. I always trust he uses his best judgement. I think he makes honest decisions.
1	He is a family doctor. He been In the family for twenty years. He is always right with his diagnosis and treats my family according he feels like a family member .
1	I know my primary care physician outside of the office, and I know what kind of person he is. I trust his judgments for my medical care because I know he is a good person who truly cares about other people and wants what is best for them. I know his family, and how he treats and cares for them. It puts me at ease when I am dealing with him in a professiol capacity.
1	My doctor is always patient and thorough with me, even though most of my problems are mental and not physical and I have another doctor to handle the mental stuff. Even when she's running behind she spends the full time with me
1	I trust my doctor because she is very understanding and knows me really well. She is almost like my friend and is really nice to me.
1	We selected our primary care physician based on a recommendation from our daughter after we moved. We have been completely satisfied with the family practice (my wife and I have different doctors in the practice). From day one, I got along well with my physician. We bonded, I think, partly because I was teaching at his alma mater (after retiring from my full-time position elsewhere). He will lay out various treatment options in a fair and unbiased way and leave the decision to me. Have never ever felt rushed. He takes the time that is necessary and we also toss in a discussion of sports, which is fun and makes me feel very comfortable (especially compared to some snooty specialists I have met over the years).
1	I have been working with her for a while so we've built up some level of trust. She seems very involved and concerned in my well being every time I meet with her. We go over all aspects of my care each time we meet, and she truly tries to help me solve the issues at hand. 
1	My primary care physician is the primary care physician for my grandparents, parents, aunt and uncle, brother, and cousins, and my cousin's wife was a nurse in my physician's office for several years. I've known him for more than twenty years, and my parents have known him for longer. He's always done his best with all of us, and he's always been kind and funny. I have no reason not to trust him.
1	He makes me help safe when I talk to him. I trust in this ability to give me anwsers when every I feel hopeless.
-1	I trust my doctor but i always wonder if there is anything the doctor might not be telling me just so i dont worry
-1	My primary care doctor is new to me, so Iâll answer about doctors in general. I have a lot of experience with doctors, and for the most part I think they are honest and trustworthy. But I know that in a busy clinic that has a lot very ill patients, there is  a lot of shuffling of priorities. One day you may have the doctorâs full attention, other days you may not. Also, Iâve had enough errors in my treatment over the years (none fatal) to know that doctors and nurses are not infallible. They prescribe the wrong dosage, or donât fully investigate drug interactions, etc.
1	My doctor is trustworthy and has helped me with many issues with my health. I feel very comfortable speaking openly to my doctor when it comes to any new health concerns. 
-1	I like my new primary care doc very much but had really negative experiences with docs for way too long when I lived in another state. I am extremely cautious about all medications and am generally skeptical so I do my due diligence with all doctors and treatments they recommend. Right now I am dealing with some significant side effects from meds Rx'd in the late '90s and at that time absolutely no one told me the long term effects until a dentist did years afterward. So although I like my current pcp, I don't let down my guard and just accept everything they say as the complete story.
-1	I know most doctors are in this career for themselves and they'll prescribe high paying medications to profit. There are plenty of times when a doctor tries to rush the patient so they can go from one to the next without a proper diagnosis.
-1	There is changes to history spying something about Obama nh court so A bomb attack japanese and destroy all freedom of information Cuba in history spying
-1	Although I tend to trust my doctor, I am also a little bit skeptical.  Having worked with many different doctors I know there are many that think they know everything or are influenced by pharmaceutical companies and won't listen to the patient's ideas or won't take the patient seriously because they're the doctor and know better.  
1	I trust my doctor because she's honest and I feel that she care about me and my family. Ive been going to her for several years
-1	I have always had a good experience with my PCP. She's about my age, which makes me sometimes wish that she had a bit more experience. She always listens to what I have to say although sometimes I feel like she is a bit rushed and just wants to wrap up the appointment. I've never had anything serious come up that she had to treat me for. 
-1	I trust my doctors in general, however sometimes it seems like it would be easy for them to just prescribe medications to treat ailments rather than getting down to the root cause of the problem.
-1	She listens to my issues and concerns and we are able to have discussions about them and likes that i go on web md to further understand things
1	My doctor is a caring person. My my doctor is very good at getting to the bottom of what is going on. I trust my doctor.
-1	I do not think sometimes they are getting the whole picture when you only spend a few minutes with them every three months. All in all I trust my doctor only a little bit.
-1	I don't en general trust very many doctors, too often they are misdiagnosing or diagnosing based on getting paid from drug companies. I don't want unnecessary treatments or drugs. 
1	She is very caring and listens to everything I have to say and takes a lot of time doesn't rush with my appointment
-1	Sometimes I feel like the doctor doesn't believe me when I say I have a problem and she makes excuses as to why I couldn't have this issue because of my age etc. She doesn't even try to find out if there is an underlying issue and just thinks I want drugs which makes it hard for me to get treated for things. 
1	My doctors have always been the type of people to relay a sense of trust. Not only in their ability to explain what is happening to me, but in their demeanor.
-1	I trust her, though sometimes I think she rushes me through because I am very healthy.  However, on the whole, if I had a serious problem, I would absolutely trust her to give me the all the options and detail risks and concerns.
-1	i trust my doctor with the upmost respect as long as i provide him with details on what is going on with my body and he/she can elaborate on my health
1	Have had the same doctor for years and is always patient and never rushes. Has called the house even to check after a hospital release and called my husband to make sure we were settled
1	I have a new primary care doctor and have only seen her twice but she knows my medical history and is able to suggest medical treatments or testing regarding my condition. 
1	i trust my doctor because he is a good hearted person very honest person my doctor is always nice and patient with me
1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel like she really listens to me. She is thorough and willing to explore different treatments in order to find the best one for me. I never feel like she is rushing me to move on to other patients.
-1	I feel like doctors always rush through appointments. I feel like a lot of times they act like I'm making it up.
-1	I trust him because he talks to me like he really cares. He does everything with a computer so he is always looking at the screen to compare how I am at his visit and how I was at last visit. He keeps tabs on anything that has changed, he has warmed up personality wise over the years which is nice.
1	Doctors in general know what they are doing.  So I trust them in making decisions for me.  I like when a doctor shows empathy for me or any other patient.  
1	I trust my primary care physician because he always listens to me and my concerns.  They have always been good at diagnosing and treating my illnesses.  They also make sure my prescriptions are always available for refills if necessary.
-1	It is the first ethical responsibility of health care givers to provide or refer patients to others in order for them to receive the best treatment possible . It is also their responsibility to give the most up to date care to patients 
-1	"I haven't seen a doctor in over a year; I had to have stitches in my arm due to an accident. I'll use that experience to explain here. The doctor I saw was very trustworthy, in my view. The first thing he did when he saw me - before he even said a word to me - was put on gloves and poke/prod a lipoma near my eye. I had seen my doctor about it years previous so I knew it wasn't anything to be concerned with, but having a doctor who goes ""hey, this guy is here for stitches.. but I'm going to take a brief moment and check out this other thing that I'm not even going to put on the record"" really made me feel as if he was looking out for me. I really appreciated that. When we got to looking at my arm, he explained how I was lucky because if the cut had been just a small amount deeper I'd need surgery (of course today I couldn't use the terminology that he did, but at the time I fully understood everything he was saying -- if you're a redditor, it was very ELI5). However, when speaking with my normal doctors.. sometimes it seemed as if they weren't really paying attention to what I was saying. For example, when I was in the military I told my primary care physician that it didn't matter what time I would lay down, I could not go to sleep. His response to me was ""go to bed earlier"". He eventually sent me to see the base psych and I was given medications that helped."
-1	I have had doctors run exorbitant, unnecessary tests on me to pad their own bills. So no, I don't have the greatest trust in doctors. The last physical I had cost $1700 because the doctor was running test after test. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because so the medicines which have been prescribed have helped me tremendously. They continue to help me as long as I take them properly.
-1	I trust my doctor to a certain point. Sometime I feel like he is just going with the flow and other times I feel like he is actually concerned 
-1	I think doctors are packing too many patients into a day. It leaves them without the time or inclination to look too deeply into patients' medical issues. 
-1	I trust most doctors if they aren't rushing and really want to talk and find out what's going on with me.
1	She is attentive,caring and willing to take time to explain and answer any and all questions. She understands that I am wary of medications or procedures that tend to have negative effects and is willing to work with me to find alternatives.
1	I trust my physician because he has a degree and knows better than me what i need to do to be healthy. I trust that the information he gives me is accurate. i trust him also because he answers any questions i have and explains whenever needed.
-1	My doctor is friendly and sincere, but more and more she seems a bit hurried in getting me in and out. I still generally trust her, but would appreciate more time or discussion
-1	I trust them be cause the work hard and they do there work carefully unlike some doctors I don't know them but I have trust in doctors us long as they fix the problem.
1	I trust my doctor to provide me with the best care that is in the scope of his capability.  If I have a problem that is outside the scope of his responsibility I trust him to recommend another competent person.
1	I trust my doctor because he has always been honest.  He has never mislead at any doctor's appointment.
1	My doctor has been in the  family for over ten years we have a good relationship and i trust him and all his associates
-1	I trust that for the most part my doctor is open and honest about everything, but on the other hand it never hurts to get a second opinion about things involving my health. I trust that my doctor has no reason to lie to me or not give me all the information I need but sometimes things can be overlooked. 
-1	Because she does not listen to what i have to tell her . she tells me i should go see more doctors like im made of money.
1	I feel that my doctor gives me straightforward information.  I'm given my options and allowed to choose my preference unless my doctor feels that one treatment is more needed than another.  
-1	While I do think that the current health care system puts too much importance on volume of patients seen per day, overall, doctors want to contribute to healing their patients and making sure they are as healthy as possible.
-1	He doesn't spend much time with me and it seems like he is just trying to get me out of the door as fast as he can.
-1	I feel to believe, my primary care physician, is good at what they does. I feel confident, when it comes to advise from them.
-1	I have a hard time trusting a person I believe Trust is a strong word to use I don't trust or distress a person I tried to go off what I feel
-1	I currently don't have a primary physician. I am currently searching for one with my mother. It is a bit of a struggle
1	My primary care person is actually a NP that i have been seeing for years. She gets me, my actual PCP supervises her but does not get me and i am not fond of her bedside manner.
1	I've only been seeing my doctor for about 6 months, but so far he has helped my take care of my health needs by referring me to specialists and prescribing medication which has helped me. He has also ordered tests to make sure nothing is wrong with me. He talks to me like a person and not just a patient, he understands my needs an listens to what I have to say.
1	Dr Hassan is very honest with me, he tells me straight up what I need to do. My OBGYN has saved my life 2 times on the operation table. I love her much!
-1	He has always been straight forward.  When something serious has arisen, he has no problem forwarding me on to a specialist for care.  He is quick to respond when I need an appointment.  Sometimes, he is a bit distracted, but then again aren't we all.  Now, you say in the medical world that is not to be, but when he has been this way, it has not been regarding anything really serious and just seemed in a hurry.
-1	Thanks for Your time and consideration for any inconvenience caused and thank goodness for your loss or not but it will be a little more time to get my hands
-1	I trust that my primary care physician is knowledgeable but sometimes wonder if she has ulterior motives when she is always trying to push medications on me which I do not think I need. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable about my conditions.  She's also a great listener and asks me thorough questions to get to the bottom of things.  I've never had a problem with her, nor have I been given any reason  not to trust her.  She gets my input before all procedures.
-1	While there may be those in the field who truly want to help others, the bottom line is that people will look after themselves one way or another. I don't trust anyone. Doctors are no exception.
-1	Doctors today have a lot on their plate. As a result, they are squeezed into a role which makes them sometimes unapproachable. That means they have to rush through appointments to get as many in as possible. As a result, they are not able to spend the time they need with each patient, assess their needs, and prescribe the right treatment. If a doctor takes the time to assess and communicate with me concerning my medical needs and condition, then I trust him or her. I figure that they know more about medicine than I do, and they are willing to take the time to find out what I really need, medically.
-1	My doctor is kind and knowledgeable but sometimes rushes me out if she has lots of appointments on any given day.
-1	I don't believe that she necessarily gives me all treatment options, and if I decline treatment(eg, hormone replacement therapy for menopause), she gets quite huffy. 
-1	I have been going to see him for about 10 years and he seems to do right by me I can't really say what things he has done wrong as he seems to do me good..
-1	"I don't care how much of an expert any doctor is, you should never trust any one completely. If you want to be healthy then you need to be actively involved, not just relying on someone else for all the answers. So, while I do have great confidence in my doctor, I don't take everything he says as ""the gospel"". I'm not at all above obtaining a second or even third opinion on an issue that I'm still not certain about. At the end of the day, I see it as a 50/50 relationship between doctors and myself...in order to achieve optimal results we both have to do our part."
1	I believe my doctor is qualified to make decisions about my medical care. They are more informed and knowledgable about healthcare than I am.
1	"My doctor has been a ""lifesaver"" on several occasions for. Without him/her I don't know if I would have survived without my doctor and some divine intervention. My doctor has always answered my questions to my satisfaction and fully explained my issues. When my doctor thought that I needed a second opinion there was a quick referral."
1	My PCP is a very intelligent, capable and thoughtful man. He is actually the first doctor I've ever had who listened to what I said and accepted that I don't always agree with him. He works around it.
-1	I don't trust ANY physician. They're in the pockets of big pharma and push possibly harmful or unnecessary drugs for personal gain. Money is their bottom line.
-1	I do not trust doctors or really any kind of medical professional.  In fact, most of the time they don't even seem that professional at their jobs.  From my personal experience, it seems like doctors are only concerned with getting each patient in and out as quickly as possibly so that they can see more patients which of course lead to the doctors making more money.
-1	I have never had problems with them.  They always listen to me, as they know I have some medical background, and then we discuss options.  I always leave appointments knowing that it was the right decision.
-1	i trust my doctor 
1	I have been going to the same doctor for 40 years.  I completely think he understands me and has my best interests in mind.
1	My primary care physician has never done anything to cause me to distrust him. Every time I've needed assistance I've been met with high quality service and solutions.
-1	I usually feel like the doctor is busy and has a lot of things going on at once. Sometimes I get the impression they don't really listen. All in all I say I have to trust their advice but sometimes I feel they can be real impersol.
1	I trust all doctors to be honest There should be no reason why a person doesn't trust they're doctor I doctor wouldn't be a doctor if they were untrustworthy 
-1	For the most part I have trust in my doctor's decisions, but I don't have complete trust  in anybody except the Lord. I value the doctor's advice, but I would not follow him blindly and if I feel he is not right on something I would not hesitate to get a second opinion or other counsel. I weigh my own thoughts with what he tells me. 
1	i have a long term relationship with my doctor and can talk frankly with him. we un derstand each other and he knows my history very well
1	I think my doctor is often busy but is very concerned about my care. He does listen and tries to take time.  He cares more about what is good for me and will schedule more tests and or refer me to another doctor he knows and truest.  Overall he's very good but I always like to check on things myself so I do have to questions what he tells me or get a second opinion and he encourages this.  So far my primary care physician has been very accurate and has offered good advice or treatment.
-1	I don't think that my doctor at times puts much effort into giving me all the correction information it is that I need
-1	Sometimes not everyone has your best interests in mind. Your doctor is suppose to assist you with your health but at the end of the day they still have to make money so im unsure about completely trusting them
-1	"It seems in the last 2 years that my primary doctors practice has quadrupled in the size of patients, what use to be a 20 min wait is now sometimes 1.5HOURS, they seem to put 6 people in 1 time slot - this makes your time with the doctor feel rushed, and then you forget to tell them some of your symptoms which are important. This makes for mistakes in every angle - diagnoses, blood work etc, it is not that I fully dont trust my actual doctor, its the craziness of the practice and the feeling you are on a ""food line"" and they are not really totally focused on 1 patient - so every one loses in the long run - I have had nurses so confused that they were trying to give me a flu shot 2x because of the amount of people in the waiting room and at the nurses lab."
1	He seemed legitimately interested in now i felt and what u needed from him. He didn't brush me aside or tell me to make another appointment when I had more than one issue to attend to.
-1	I have been with her for years , and always be honest and truthfully with me on very thing . i want to anything or ask anything ,she will take the time to explain everything to me .
1	I trust that he is doing things for a good reason.  I believe that he takes his practice seriously.
1	I trust my doctor. He tells me whats going on in a straight forward manner. He explains anything I do not understand and answers any other questions that I may have.
1	He's always been upfront with me and has given me multiple ways to go about a situation. 
-1	I have a long-standing relationship with her and she has been right about diagnosis and treatment the vast majority of the time. During times where I've had complications, she's made herself available to me and has been flexible.
1	I trust my doctor because he gives me the answers I am looking for. Any questions I ask are answered. He is able to help me when I need it.
1	my doctor is no nonsense and to the point. he does not sugar coat things and has never kept anything from me. trust him implicitly.
1	I don't go to doctors a lot but I'm surrounded by them,  I don't trust just any doctor in general but the few doctors I do go to, are very trusted by me.  I have seen by the times I went there that they are very intelligent and reliable.
1	I have been with my primary care doctor for a number of year and he has provided excellent care.  He is not quick to to put me on drugs.  Uses other alternative prior to using drugs to remedy ailments.
1	If you ask a question and they don't give you a answer and just walk away makes me distrust the doctor and if they give you a answer makes me trust them.
-1	It really does seem like my doctor does care about me at times and it is really nice knowing that. Everytime i go in he askes how am i feeling.
-1	I believe you have to trust them. If I'm not mistaken they sign some oath to verify they will be honest and forthright with patients, and do what's in there best interest.  Also they make good money, and if it was found out they were being deceitful it would be hard for them to find work.
-1	I don't trust them because they have god complex.  I don't trust them because they think better of themselves.
1	I trust my doctor to give me the best medical advice, as she has always been straightforward and sincere with me.   She always seems to take my overall health into account before making recommendations 
-1	I trust him for the most part. But, even he can have gaps in knowledge and is perhaps more wanting to do the expedient thing than the most thorough. 
1	She is very sincere and caring. She is very knowledgeable and sensible. I feel like she does this job because she genuine enjoys taking care of people and she is very good at it
1	i trust doctors because they know more than i do. i do not know what is wrong with me, just that something is not right. they have gone to school and received training to be able to help me, so i try to trust that they will not lead me astray. I have had mostly good experiences with doctors in the past, so i cant complain
-1	It's all about the money, not the patients... they are just a sick-people mill.
-1	Do you think that money I good pick up your cross an well across the room n npoop onstick help help help help me an fin movie and some underwear and rock a little and an an an MD. Dmdjfked f em fmrdmdo
-1	I just that my primary Care physician is well educated on the subjects at hand i mean he doesn't have a degree for nothing right
1	I have had my PP for a few decades now and he is always on top of any of my concerns. He knows me and has all of my medical background info. 
-1	There are a lot of changes in medicine constantly and there are a ton of options it would probably take days  to cover the ones for each condition. Doctors tend to go with the simplest or maybe cheapest if that is the way insurance providers make you go. Sometimes the best answer is not simple or cheap.
1	I generally trust my primary care physician because he is a friend of my family, and also my in laws. He asks how family is doing.  He is knowledgeable about any issues brought up, and is open to discussing all options available.  He is friendly and kind.  I don't feel that he is ever in a rush to get out of the appointment, and move on to other patients.
1	He genuinely is concerned about me. He talks to me about every day things that are going on.  Asks me about my job,  my home, my personal life. 
-1	i feel like they see so many patients they dont have enough time to individualize care. They will just write you a prescription and send you on your way
-1	I cant really answer this question right now. Its hard to answer this question in the right way because i dont have a docter at this moment
-1	my doctor is the best. he explains everything, I am never afraid to ask questions and he is kind. He listens and explains every detail.
-1	SHE DOES NOT LISTEN TO ME. WANTS ME OUT THE DOOR AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. RELYS ON BLOOD WORK AND NOTHING ELSE IT SEEMS. I ASK HER QUESTIONS AND SHE WILL ANSWER A COUPLE, BUT THEN GET SIDE TRACKED EASY OR GET ME SIDE TRACKED SO THAT I DONT ASK THE QUESTIONS AGAIN.
-1	My doctors tend to rely more on pharmaceuticals to treat common problems, even when other options are available. I'm not sure if she's playing it safe or if it's just easier.  I believe all options should be made available to the client/patient and then allow the client/patient to decide the best course of treatment for them. 
-1	I just think that sometimes doctors do what is easier and convenient and time-effective rather than giving me the time and attention I may need.
1	My Dr. has always though about my good health, sometimes more than me. He declined to do a procedure because I just had it done lass the a month before and he was afraid it might cause me more discomfort.
-1	Sometimes it depends on the time spent in the room with me. Or the reason I am there for the visit. They may try to make me take a medication when we have discussed before that it doesn't work it doesn't help. Orsuggesting other tests etc to have more intake, but u don't know. Each doctor is defiNitleu different.
-1	I really want to trust my doctor but I think we have gotten away from the family physician model and now we just see anyone.  And each doctor is different so you basically always start over at square one each visit
-1	I feel like my visits are just to get me in and out.  The last PCP I had did not ask about my condition on my 2nd visit, and ignored my intense back pain when I told her about it.
1	he was able to get me better when I was si ill and he told me what was going on  with my body and every thing he has told me had help me get better
1	I have been seeing my doctor a while, we are around the same age and she is very smart and knowledgeable. 
1	He has been my family doctor for over 15 years now, he has made me feel very at ease as a teeger and young woman and I felt like I could really trust him with all my issues. He is always very interested and patient and doesn't make it look like he has better things to move on to.
-1	Like I stated before, sometimes I feel as if physicians are so overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people they are seeing that they do not conscientiously take the time they should to sit and explain, question, discuss with their patients. My parents have both been on the bad end of their primary care physician not doing what he was supposed to do. One time he even made a very bad prescription for my mother that could have been very deadly if the pharmacist had not caught the mistake and called him on it. Physicians are trying to see too many and utilizing the factory model that the United States has fit to everything from labor to schools to prisons.
1	I trust my primary care because I have to be able to rely on them to help me make informed medical decisions.  I also need to be able to trust my doctor to explain to me the best course of action.
-1	I go to certain doctors but its the bad news that shy me away from them so I always to get a second opinion but the outcome of that is it only gets worse so I go to doctors nsometimes not all the time
-1	Sometimes I feel my doctor does everything by textbook without looking at the whole picture.  For example, she was going completely by BMI without looking at my body type.  I have a LOT of muscle as I work out often.  After examining me she agreed with me.  
-1	I don't think doctors know what they think they know. I have multiple disabilities, and at least one is an orphan - no known good treatments.  The ones for the standard form don't work well if at all.  And the ones they won't give me are the only things that ever did any good!
-1	The reasons I trust my doctor is that they always answer my questions thoughtfully and in detail that I can comprehend easily.
-1	She tends to go above and beyond when it comes to finding treatment options that specifically help me both financially and mentally.
-1	I go to my university health center currently, where I feel the credentials to be a medical professional are slightly more lax compared to a pediatrician you may go to as an adolescent or child. In my opinion the structured, budget friendly operation of a university health center is caked with many professionals screening and treating students the same for the most part. While I can rely on them for blood work, sexually transmitted disease screening, general prescriptions, and counseling services I would not go to them for diagnosis or anything major. I personally would prefer a resident at a hospital to the nurses I usually see. At some colleges it is worse than mine, some only have nurses and no licensed doctors. As such I don't really trust my doctor, but it's not awful.
-1	I trust my physician because he cares about me. He always gives me good advice. He doesn't give me medicine that i don't need.
-1	I mostly trust my doctor. I think though that physicians generally think people are not smart enough to really understand medical information so they over simplify information or leave out certain information. My doctor is somewhat like this.
-1	They now what there doing but sometimes they don't Know what they are doing and that can happen too you and because of that you sometimes don't trust.
-1	My primary care physician is part of a large group. I feel my appointments are sometimes rushed, that I get certain tests because of age or other reasons, not because it's warranted. It feels like a 'doctor shop' without personalized attention. The specialist I see often cites outdated information, and doesn't seem to listen to my issues
1	I have been going to my primary care doctor for many years so I have built trust in him. He encourages questions and is great at asking what I think because he says I know my body better than he ever could. His confidence in me and listening skills are what really make me trust him. 
1	I trust my doctor, since I've been seeing her for over a decade but I am always aware that certain medications are pushed on patients with incentives to the doctor and their office. I trust her bust only after researching side effects and alternatives on my own.
-1	I trust my family doctor. He has been working with myself and other family members for many years. I am an active, healthy individual, so when something is wrong, I trust him to provide and recommend treatment.
-1	Alot of my symptoms have been resolve and some she is still working on. So im still having back pain and knees are hurting and getting stiff.
1	I trust my doctor completely.  We have a long history of him helping me when I was seriously ill.  He has literally saved my life several times.
1	I have a doctor who is an older gentleman and he is very caring and thorough with me.  He talks to me, not at me and that gives me a comfortable feeling about him.
1	I trust my primary care physician because in the past he has never gave me any reason to doubt him. Every time I've came in with a question or concern, he's spent the time to sit down with me and address all of my concerns. He's never tried to rush me me out or just disregard me. I am very comfortable around him, and would go to him about any medical concern I had.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is on top of my physical well being. Appointments test, and check ups are regularly scheduled on a ongoing basis.
-1	I trust doctors in general because I feel like they have the knowledge and experience to make sure that my health condition improves. 
-1	Everyone I go in with a concern I get a few words in  then suddenly there is medicine without test..
1	I've been in and out of doctor's office since I was a teenager to help with my depression/anxiety issues. With the exception of a few, all have been genuine people who have shown a complete and utter dedication to helping me be my best physically and mentally.
1	i trust my doctor because they know i'm a nurse and we are able to communicate in the same medical terms.
1	Back home the Family Doctor took very good care of my parents. So, I trust him for he has done a good job on me.
-1	I don't believe my doctor would deliberately lie to me or mislead me but I do think that at times it just isn't convenient for him to answer my questions or explain things thoroughly to me - that doesn't inspire trust.
-1	I do trust my primary care physician or else I would be choosing another physician.  I am also aware that physicians are busy and that sometimes things can get missed in a busy office so it is my responsibility to keep myself well-informed regarding tests, results and treatments and to ask questions if needed.  
1	I picked my physician based on ratings and reviews and when I met with her I realized and I could trust her.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor to an extent; he is fallible just like anyone else. I will do my own research after visiting with him, and if I don't agree with something, e.g., a medicine he recommends or a treatment protocol, I will tell him what I have found, why I don't want to take it, and let's try something else. Ultimately, I know my body best and I do my utmost to take care of myself.
-1	My doctor does not half ass his way just to get a job done. He actually talks to me and makes sure that I understand what is going on and what I need to do. Most physicians will look out for their patients because they are under their care and their reputation is on the line. 
1	My doctor has always proved to be a trustworthy person.  He's been very helpful to me.  The one time something was very wrong with me, he attended to my needs in a thoughtful and respectful way.
-1	I neither trust nor distrust my primary care physician. I believe in looking at the relevant information around you in a skeptical, but pragmatic way. You must neither let your suspicions about doctors fool you into not taking their advice all the time nor should you overly trust everything they tell you. It is, after all, completely up to you in the end to come upon the best course of action concerning your health.
1	I have had the same doctor for a long time and we have come to know each other. I feel she has an exceptiol persolity as well as the skills and knowledge to care for my body.
1	I don't distrust my primary care physician, but I'm cautious in general and if there's room for a second opinion I will always consider getting one. I'm not too trusting either but I trust that being he/she is the one with the medical degree that I'm in the best hands possible and I let them do their job.
-1	I trust my doctor because he seems like he cares about my well being. He tries to find any problems and fix them
-1	I trust   my primary  care  doctor   to provide   my needs. They   provide   my   needs and tell  me how to take  care of   my   health   they are  concerned  about   my   health .
-1	my previous experience with my primary care physician gave me the impression that he was more interested in me as a cash cow than as a patient.
-1	I think many physicians are conditioned to think and behave a certain way, whether that stems from training or peer influence and sometimes cannot be ooen to seing beyond that field of view which can be a detriment to patient care as well as the representation of the medical field as a whole.
1	My doctor is open and honest with me. He is very thorough in his examinations and he seems to listen to what I'm saying to him. 
1	My Primary Care physician is incredible. She's relatable and kind and takes the time to address any concerns I have. I trust her completely.
1	I trust my Dr because he is very experienced and he knows what he is talking about. I am confident that he has my best interest at heart.
-1	"Almost all primary-care physicians are driven by market forces and social need to see more patients per day than they really should. I think this leads them to make ""snap"" decisions without spending a lot of time considering possible alternatives; the ""easy"" answer isn't always the right one. I sometime distrust my doctor's opinion when I feel he wants to rush through answers or complicated diagnoses without really considering whether they're totally correct or whether I understand them fully. I recognize their dilemma, but will not allow it to stop me from getting all the info I need on my medical condition."
-1	My primary care physician always seems to be in a hurry and I don't like how he refers me to a specialist for just about everything. 
-1	Overall, I do have some base trust in doctors. I recognize their position, and what it would take for them to make it there. Obviously, they've gone through extensive schooling and are well experienced. Thus, I should at minimum, respect their opinions and strongly consider them.
-1	He's been my primary doctor for years already and his cure is always effective.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he knows what he is doing, afterall, he did go to medical school. He has never given me a reason not to trust his judgement.
1	She is a very caring doctor and has always been very persoble.  She takes time to talk to me, address any concerns or issues.  She is very thorough and attentive and I feel this is what makes her a great doctor, she likes people and helping.
-1	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. she is very attentive, always listens. So far all of her recommendations were spot on.
-1	Because they always there for me they know what's wrong with me they know how to get me back up to speed 
1	I get along very well with my doctor. I feel she genuinely cares about my well being, both physically and mentally. She is very sweet and kind.
1	I trust physicians because they obviously don't want to make mistakes, since malpractice is so costly. They have an incentive to do the best they  can, although no one is perfect.
-1	Just started seeing this doctor and they harp on and on about needing to lose weight.  I get the feeling that they would blame any issue I'm having on my weight and not want to investigate further.
1	I really think that he tries to make the best decisions for my care. I generally place a good deal of trust in him. If I didn't trust him, I would look for another physician.
-1	I trust my PCP to an extent, but my full confidence and faith does not rely on man--but on my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
-1	They want to see patients more quickly to make more money so they aren't careful or thoughtful. Some healthcare professionals are also judgemental if you do or don't do something that's right.
-1	Never insisted I get blood work done though I see him just once a year. When I told him about a past ailment, he was vague in informing me of what could have been wrong. Not sure if this was to protect the doctors I' d seen for that matter because they belonged to the same practice. 
1	I just my doctor because he had been my doctor for years. I have never had a bad experience. He has been very honest with me on everything.
-1	I trust my physician because they just wants what is best for me. They are honest to me about my options. 
-1	It depends on the doctor you have. You need to get to know your doctors personality and character so you can determine your level of trust. I feel my new doctor is thorough and attentive to my needs. I have a high level of trust in his ability and concern.
-1	My primary care physician is very intelligent and knowledgeable.  However their are conditions that he does not know the details of and when questioned he dismisses concern.  He is not likely to discuss emotional reactions to anything.  That is fine with me but he has patients that are upset about that aspect.  He is very clinical.  He trusts lab tests for most everything.  I trust him but wish her was a little more curious about symptoms.  It is possibly an age thing as he is ready to retire.
-1	I generally trust my physician because usually he will explain everything to me before any decisions are made. I think that they are knowledgeable and know what the fix should be. 
-1	He is not very knowledgeable about my condition called hypothyroidism but I have done a lot of research and know more then he does so that makes the matter complicated
-1	good experience in the past and a relationship of several years; i trust they are educated and continue to update their knowledge
1	"I use a NP as my primary physician. She is awesome. She spends more time with me than other Doc's do and I never feel ""rushed"" through an appointment. She gives me as much time as I need when I see her. "
-1	I may not have the best relationship with my kids primary care doctor, but I do trust her. She is a very straight forward knowledgeable person that has practiced medicine for for 30 years.
-1	There is never enough time and he is always running late. I wish he would be on time and listen to my issues.
-1	I don't believe a lot of drs continue to study about new medicines and treatments that are available.  It is difficult to have faith in someone when that is the case.  Not only that, how do you really know you dr is a good one?
1	The reason that I feel like I am totally able to trust my doctor is because they are a certified physician that has successfully treated me for years.                        .
-1	My doctor urges me to do treatments that will cost the most and does things to her convenience. But she tells me everything I need to know.
-1	I feel that she is capable and up-to-date but sometimes doesn't listen to details that might make a difference in my care
-1	I trust my physician because he seems knowledgeable about health care. Not only that he seems to generally care about his patients. He never rushes through my appointments and answer any question I may have.
-1	Due to issues with my health insurance and past experiences by parents have had. My mother has a rare from of kidney disease, and it took 12 years, 8 doctors, 20 procedures, and 5 surgeries to finally correct the problem and my health insurance didn't want to do their job and pay the doctors due to how many doctors my mom had to visit and had to get help from.
-1	First off with my current Dr. I have researched that individual, and have spoken with people that have this particular Dr. as their Primary Care Physician. I check out the reviews online by individuals, and as well as the PCP's background information.
1	my primary health care physician always have my best interest at heart so is always looking out for me been healthy and living a healthy life making sure I always have the best of medications and care
1	I've been with my doctor for about 5 years now and she has always taken the time to answer my questions and address any concerns that I have, even taking extra time to figure issues out.
1	I have worked as a nurse with my PCP and have the greatest respect for her as a physician and as a person. BTW, she makes for a lousy patient!
-1	I trust him because he doesn't try to upsell me on anything and takes a very relaxed and practical approach to things.  For example, I need to lose about 30 pounds, instead of being hysterical, he suggested I aim for 1 pound a month.
1	I have spent years looking for doctors I can trust and if I get a sense of mistrust or that they do not have my best interest at heart, I do not go back to them. My current PCP is awesome. We can speak truthfully about things and she will give me her honest evaluation, even when I don't like the outcome. I can ask questions and feel comfortable doing so with her. 
1	 I trust my primary care physician for several reasons. I know he has a strong educational background and has been in practice for many years. I have researched online and read reviews on my physician and they are very good reviews. My physician has always listened to me, given me good advice and treatment and I have never not benefited from his care.He has certainly earned my trust.
-1	I am doing fine and very healthy and nothing wrong with me. I am non-smoker, non-drinker, non-drug, and stay out of trouble, etc. I have one indoor cat. 
1	I known my doctor for over 10 yrs and they will go over my meds and tell me if it's unhealthy and who is better and make sure I'm happy or not
-1	my PCP is new to me.  still getting to know him, only seen him 3 times.  my initial reaction is that he is NOT very proactive and that concerns me.
1	I have never been given any reason not to trust my Doctor. He has always been able to provide the level of care that I expect and always answers my questions satisfactorily 
-1	I am not sure how thorough my doctor is, but I feel confident that she will answer direct questions appropriately
-1	I plan on changing my doctor. He is very arrogant and uncaring. He never listens to me and when he does it's with an nonchalant attitude. For these reasons I do not trust his diagnosis or treatments unless I receive a second opinion.
-1	I personally trust my physician, however I do not trust most physicians in general initially. There are so many different outlets these days urging us to try different medicines, it's hard to know who to trust. 
1	I trust my physician because since the first time I met her, she's been very welcoming and always willing to listen to my needs and concerns with nonnegative judgment but with respect and understanding. She respectfully and professionally gives me advice with options and helps me to understand prior to make it decisions. 
1	For the most part I have never had a bad experience with my doctor. She always seems helpful and honest about what's going on with me.
1	Through trial and error,  I know what to look for in a physician.   I want an honest and understanding physician, who will listen,  instead of being robotic or insincitive.
-1	I often feel like They do not full understand that some treatment options although a little safer might cause more of a daily issue for the patient. My physician also shames me on things that I can not control rather than offer help
-1	Anymore, I think time is a limiting factor in how effective a provider is. If given more time to spend with patients, I would be much more willing to have total trust. 
1	My doctor is new to the family due to the fact the old doctor had to retire. So far from meeting him, he's great. He seems to really want to help and make sure you are taken care of.
-1	I feel with their busy schedules, as much as they like to dwell on a patient, unless you're going to ask lots of questions.  They will give you a primary brief overview and description of your issue and then move on to the next.  Doctors are forced to see so many patients in a day and in between squeeze a break in.  With that limitation there is only so much persol care they can have.
-1	I don't particularly care for my doctor and have been looking for a new doctor. She doesn't seem to take any issues seriously and in the past this attitude has caused me to nearly miss a serious condition.  
-1	They seem to care more about making money than patient's care.  They seem to be more like auto service repair people than medical professionals.  They try to offer services that patients do not need.   In addition, they barely spend time with patients.
-1	I have been seeing my Pcp my entire life. He has always been honest and helpful. I have gained a lot of trust over the years
-1	I know what is wrong with me but I try to tell my Doctor and he thinks nothing is wrong.  All my X-rays,  CT tells a different story.
-1	Well, I just started to see this new doctor so right now, I have given her all of my old medical records and she was able to get me back on my medications. 
-1	My doctor is getting old a d is probably ready to retire.  Its time to find a new dr but im not one for change
-1	After listening to my concerns the doctor prescribed the medication that would best handle my medical condition
-1	He has resolved several medical issues that other doctors could not help me with in the past. He ask questI on to get to the heart of the situation
1	it took me a while to find the right doctor, but after almost 3 year I think I have finally found a doctor that I can truly trust.
-1	I found my doctor because he is agreeable to treating the thyroid with natural thyroid supplements, as opposed to most doctors (who will prescribe only synthetics, which actually harm the thyroid over time.)  My doctor recognizes my copious research into my condition, and works with me, with my suggestions, with the hope to improve my condition.
1	I have been with my PCP for over 20 years and we have pretty much grown up together (HA).  She is very careful and complete in her care for me.  She has usually been right is her recommendations for any treatment I have needed.  However, I always will retain my right to make my own healthcare decisions if I disagree with her recommendation.
1	I trust my primary care physician because we have been in a dr patient relationship for some time and have gotten to know each other pretty well she listens to me and we don't always agree but come to a workable solution 
1	I trust her because she has been my doctor for a couple of years now, and has had enough talks with me and has given me enough tests to where I have developed that trust over the years.
-1	the doctor seem to rushed to be totally trusted. He sometimes seems to have made a decision very early in the process and ignores evidence as I present it. he is also under pressure from insurers to provide the low cost options. there I have been times when I have mentioned more modern thinking or treatments and he was unreceptive.
-1	They are in it for the money, prescribing medications instead of recommending more tural vitamins, minerals, foods for diseases. 
-1	I've been going to my doctor for a few years, she has a good way of explaining things and listening to what I have to say. She answers questions thoroughly. I also checked her on the list of doctors who accept gifts from pharmaceutical companies and she doesn't accept those gifts.
-1	Having known a number of doctors, I know that they are human like the rest of us, and make mistakes like the rest of us. I also know that many are over worked and will sometimes rush a patient through his appointment. Others seem to care more for their bank accounts than their patients. And still others are hemmed in by rules and regulations where they work to really provide honest opinion. So no, I don't completely trust any doctor.
1	I have built a relationship with my doctor and he has given me the best working medicine to help with my anxiety. 
-1	I mostly trust the doctor.   I believe with how the current healthcare system is, that there are unnecessary tests being done to give them extra money.
-1	some times i can trust doctors but not all the time some times doctors advice go wrong because if we cant explain our doctprs how he can guide us. many times we never know our situation so how can we trust them in all casses.
1	My physician is very though and takes the time to explain things to me. And he shows patients and eager to answer all my questions. And makes sure that I completely understand before I leave his office. He always make sure we have a plan and a time when we will follow up.
-1	Last year, a test result showed I had a chronic condition. The only thing the doctor recommended was a prescription medication. That's it, nothing about lifestyle changes, etc.
-1	As I stated previously, I haven't had any serious conditions, but I have been to my doctor occassionally in the last few years.  Whenever I have seen her she has never seemed rushed or like she was trying to just move along to the next patient. I was able to talk very easily and at length.  Additionally, the illness or issue has always been resolved fairly quickly with the doctor's recommendations.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because my mother used the same one. Also, my physician is caring, kind and considerate to me when I visit. 
1	I trust my doctor for two reasons: 1) I have close family members who have been patients of his for many years all of whom highly respect and trust him, and 2) I have been his patient since moving to this town four years ago, and have never had reason to doubt or question his diagnosis, or opinions. when he makes a decision, he ALWAYS asks MY opinion of it, and if I have any questions about it. He is always willing to spend the time to listen and explain everything to my satisfaction.
1	i have been seeing my doctor for twenty year now. i trust her with my health and my hubbys health.she takes the time to listen to us. and explains treatment plans to us until we under.she sends us to a specialist if need. she finds the best medicine and treatment for our condictions.
1	I trust my doctor because he gives strong thought to my well being in we join together to decide what is best for me
1	For the most part I think I trust my doctor. She always takes her time and really listens to what I have to say before making any sort of rash decision. If I have any questions she's more than willing to answer and we talk what would be best for me. She's very kind and I find it easy to discuss things with her. Overall I think  I trust her decisions and think that she has my best interests at heart.
1	My Dr. seems to be pretty open with me in regards to my medical care. He gives me options pertaining to medications
-1	I am neutral about whether I trust or distrust doctors because there are many factors involved. You sometimes have to see different doctors and the circumstances are different for each one. 
-1	I think that my doctor and doctors in general face a number of pressure outside of being an advocate for best outcomes for me. Furthermore I do not trust the expertise of only one person in any situation. This means that if I feel something is serious I look for a different opinions and research the issue myself. I also feel that doctors are often unwilling to address my concerns to satisfaction due to time constraints, so this makes me feel that I ought not to trust them compeletly. 
1	I trust my doctor because of his track record and because of my own research into my condition. When  we meet, he seems to genuinely care about me and my conditions, and does not judge me. 
-1	I do feel that if I go to my doctor they will give me the best medical attention as possible but I am also aware of natural way of healing that can also be applied.  The natural way are never mentioned by my doctor.  Because of side effects of medications I will often try a natural way of healing first followed by a medication only if absolutely nessesary. I often feel that side effects are overlooked and not discussed. 
-1	I have not had a negative experience thus far. They seem to be concerned with giving me the necessary information, however, there have been occasions where they seem rushed.
-1	Well in general, doctors sometimes listen to you and sometimes have their own agenda. I had a doctor once that knew I was allergic to codeine, so kept giving me 'alternatives' that I was also allergic to, even if I told him, yes, it says if you are allergic to codeine to not take this other one. 
-1	I do not completely trust mankind. The doctor's diagnosis isn't always accurate. I take caution when advised by doctor's. 
-1	I know that they know what they are talking about but I feel that I get lost in the shuffle of other patients. I feel like they are quick with me to move on to the next person. I really don't know what to believe when it comes to what my doctors are telling me. I believe about half.
-1	"I mainly distrust my primary care physician because about a year ago I was told I ""needed"" to get the HPV vaccine, which I declined after reading the side effects and there is no need for me to get it, I was left in the hospital room for 1 hour with ""reading materials"" on it and I had to go get my doctor so I could leave."
1	He asks what is bothering me and makes different appointments for different medical problems that I might need to do to better my health.
1	She is always helpful and straightforward with me. She seeks to empathize with issues I've been having and understand better what's going on with me. For example, she asked me about my vegetarianism when I told her that was something I was doing.
1	Doctors take pride in their skills. I trust them to want to be right. Being dishonest would be a conflict but we all have convenience concerns. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because when ever I had concerns about the medication i was taking they've always listened to me and made changes in the medication that was effective and had less side effects.
1	I trust my PCP because when it comes to his patients he is very thoural. He does what is best for the patient. He also discuss a plan of care with his patients.
-1	I trust my doctor but I always research the decision, the medicine and or treatment plans myself. In addition, I read my bodies feelings.
-1	It's not that I think he's intentiolly deceiving me for some insidious purpose. I'm just read and heard about doctors getting bonuses for the amount of patients they can get on certain drugs (they get kick backs) weather this is true or not, we shouldn't ever just blindly follow someone because they went to school for awhile. Would if the school was corrupt? Would if Big Pharma changes the medical doc-turn so that the doctors believe its right, but it's actually wrong. 
-1	I don't believe I have any serious medical conditions.  My physician doesn't seem too concerned about me.  Some mistakes have been made when I visited him.
-1	I do not think they spend enough time with me and listen to what I am saying.  Some times I leave my appointment feeling frustrated.
-1	I do have a primary care physician. She and I have known each other for many decades. We frequently disagree with each other, though I'm confident that she has my best interests in heart...but her business office, my insurance, other third parties, et al. that are mostly concerned with their bottom-line can and do interfere.
-1	I often feel the doctor chooses treatments based on my level of insurance coverage rather than what might be best for me. I often feel the doctor is more interested in prescribing drugs for which the pharmaceutical reps have given incentives, even though I might not need them.
1	My doctor is open and listens to all of my questions and answers them in ways I understand
-1	I neither trust or distrust my doctor. While I know he will give me what he believes is the correct diagnosis I also believe he will recommend a drug that is more expensive than others or try to get me to go to see another doctor for the issue to get a commission. 
-1	I have had a past where there have been some missed diagnosis. Because of this I do not always trust they they are taking the time to get the job done well and make sure they are doing the right thing when it comes to my health. 
-1	I trust my doctor because she hasn't ever given me a reason not to trust her.
-1	I have gone to him for several years.   he takes time to listen and gives useful feedback.   
1	I trust in there ability to give the correct information because doctors are right on the spot with listening to you an getting you the things you need to make you feel better 
1	I trust this doctor completely.  She makes sure we get to the bottom of any problems that I am having.  She also like to rule out possibilities when faced with certain symptoms.  She is very caring, kind and listens to what I have to say.  She doesn't talk to me like I'm a child.  She explains everything. 
1	I trust my doctor because she explains everything in detail. She always asks if I have any questions or if I understand. She also takes her time with me.
-1	My doctor has always helped me to fix what it was I went to him for. He also acted calmly and explained what was going on.
-1	They're not bad. They haven't given me a reason to distrust them and have been okay so far as far as I can tell.
-1	sometimes i feel like i am told i need things i don't really need to milk money out of me. i do not think they would harm me but just trivial things that aren't needed are made to sound like bigger deals then they actually are.
1	I trust my doctor because we have built a solid relationship over the years and there is mutual respect involved. He will tell me the truth whether its easy to hear or not, and he will listen to hear what I need to do better. 
1	I am on a persol level with my doc. She knows who I am and what I have been through in life and will get right down to the nuts and bolts of my health so we can work on things together
1	I mostly trust my doctor, however, I will never 100% rely on their word or advice without looking into myself or seeking other opinions.
1	My doctor was really good, he seemed to care a lot for his patients. Sometimes you could tell, because he would go out of his way to do things that seemed above and beyond. He was also older so you knew he was putting forth more effort than someone who was younger.
-1	I do trust my doctor most of the time. But he only knows what the AMA has taught him. Medicine is centered around prescription medications and most, if not all, the time I believe there is a better tural solution. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he know me I been seeing my doctor since I was a little girl so he know a lot about me
-1	I trust my primary physician because they would have no reason to lie to me or falsify any information. They would not benefit at all from lying to me so it would not be worth doing that at all. 
-1	"I think my doctor is very, ""typical"", in that they tell you what is on the paperwork with little regard as to your persol situation. While they are obviously competent, they are not exactly empathetic."
1	My Dr explains the good and the bad.She's doesn't sugar coat anything. I trust her,she's easy to talk to
-1	I trust my primary care physician but doctors are humans and can make mistakes. I haven't personally had a bad experience but people shouldn't put complete faith in medical professionals.
-1	I trust my doctor but due to him having so many patients I do not feel like I gte the most thorough of care. However here are not too many doctors to chose from that deal with my medical condition.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because they know there stuff. They went to school for a long time to know all the stuff. If they mess up they are gonna hear it from me.
-1	Sometimes doctors are not sympathetic to their patients needs. I found on several occasions that to be true
1	because mt dr tells me every detail and leaves nothing out. he is straight forward yet compassionate and carindg, and listens to all i say to hm
1	The primary don't make the decision alone. It's a few other Dr's and they all agree on what is best for me 
-1	My doctor has never or has rarely asked me nor my family about exercise or diet. I know for a fact that these two things are among the greatest things you can do to prevent, reverse, or cure disease. Our doctor only puts my family on drugs and wants them to have expensive surgery.
1	I've gone to the same doctor for the past 20 years so I have a decent relationship with him. While I don't go to the doctor often, I know if I do need to that he'll be honest and up front with me. He knows me and is interested in helping me.
-1	He is a family friend but I personally do not like his bedside manner. He is a good doctors but he can be cold and brusque, which I do not like
-1	I semi-trusted my old doctor, because she is well known. I live in a small town, she is bascally everyone's doctor including my mother. I currently do not have insurance so I haven't used her as my doctor for yrs now, but I would use her again. 
1	We discuss what I should be doing at my age in regards to health screenings and such be he always leaves it up to Me he gives the pros and cons , but he has no agenda other than to inform me which I like
-1	Sometimes my doctor doesn't listen to my main concern and instead changes the subject and discusses other things that I didn't come in to discuss that day. 
-1	They've invested a lot of time and money to stand where they're standing. why wasted that time if you cant be trusted because in the long run your going to get exposed.
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. This is mainly because I have a long history with this doctor. I also go by my gut feeling that he puts the patient first and not himself. He shows his passion in his job and does not mope around the clinic. To me, that means it's not all about the compensation. Anytime I had an ailment, he knew right away what prescriptions and directions to give me, and they all worked. I also trust my doctor because he gives off a calm and reassuring vibe. If I had to choose among doctors, he would always be my pick. 
-1	My doctor is very thorough, when he makes a diagnosis he will tell you why and why not it is or isnt and what treatment he thinks will work,  He is very open about his opinions and ideas, and if something doesnt work he will quickly try a different treatment or diagnosis. Wether its something I want to hear or not, he will tell me, and provide his best opinion on how to cope with it.
-1	Doctors Care more about getting paid then helping or getting to the next patient most doctors don't do all that they know they can do for you 
-1	I do trust my doctor, but I also realize how busy he is.  I have never experienced my doctor making a direct mistake relating to my health, but there have been instances when he was rushing a little.  When I am prescribed something, I always take the time to research the drug and its results/side effects before taking it myself.  I do have faith in his abilities, but will still take the time to do my own research.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she explains everything in detail. She gives me time to process and makes sure that I understand the severity of a health issue. She also gives me time to ask any questions that I might have and is patient with me as she answers my questions. She is comforting and a great person. All these qualities make me trust her and feel comfortable when being seen by her. When I have questions outside of the doctors office I am able to call her during her work time and she will answer my questions. She is the definition of a great and caring doctor.
-1	My doctor is very candid. She always lets me know the possible effects and she has no problem telling me what she thinks. However, she just rushes too much and seems like she has better things to be doing.
-1	My primary physician has all the best intentions and is a very nice person. I like him personally but he has misdiagnosed me on two different occasions and this has had a negative impact on my trust level.  
-1	I don't trust my primary care doctor mostly because I feel like I'm being rushed through my appointments. Also because they tend to diagnose you with something and give you medication even when they are not completely sure if what is really wrong with you.
-1	I don't always trust my Dr. I think he tell me one thing and somebody else another.I feel he does this because he afraid he's going to upset me or scare me
1	I trust my doctor to be completely honest with me. They took an oath in medical school to help people and be truthful.  
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to the same one since I was a teenager and my doctor understands me. My doctor knows everything about me and I don't want to go through getting to know a new doctor.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she's confident and sure in what she's saying no feeling as if she lost or don't know what to do 
1	My doctor allows me to ask questions and help decide the right path for my physical and mental well being
-1	my doctor always listens to what I have to say.  If i have a problem I make sure to let my doctor know.
-1	My primary physician has a good bedside manor and takes time to listen and explain things.  She does not rush me.  She seems to have a good understanding of my health concerns.
-1	Seems nice and listens to me she reminds me of me physically so I can relate to her.  She is a female so it's nice that we can discuss colon topics 
-1	My doctor just seems so busy. It's hard to tell if he really pays attention to me and my health because I am only seen for a few minutes. 
-1	sometimes things go well and other times things dont go well it just happens to be that this is how things have been lately
-1	He's fine for check ups but quick to refer me to a specialist without trying a treatment first.  After I see the specialist, my family doctor defers to them and doesn't stay in the loop.
-1	Well, I just met my new doctor not too long ago, and I believe he's wrong on some points, but I don't believe it's out of trying to hide things from me.  I think he just believes every last thing that he was taught, and does not alter from that reality.
1	Feel totally free to talk about anything and to ask questions of my doctor.  Think she understands me and she is always willing to go the extra mile for my benefit.
1	"The doctor has a very caring way about him, and he has a long history of success as a doctor, as well as the proper training and eductation. He is very open and honest with me. I chose ""agree"" instead of ""strongly agree"" above though, because I don't completely trust anyone who isn't a dear friend or loved one, and I am not a medical expert."
1	He has always given me good advice and I trust him to help me make medical decisions.  Everything he has told me has worked out for the best.
-1	they are only after money not my health care needs with out money they wouldn't give me the time of day.
-1	"I have a disability and I have found that some doctors will try and say that it may be related to something else, and try to prescribe courses of treatment that are inappropriate and do not work. So some doctors will behave in such an unprofessional fashion, just so they can be credited with ""curing"" a patient."
1	I mean he's my primary doctor. If i can't trust him i would go find a new one. It's very important to have a doctor you trust in because if not you won't be able to get the treatment you deserve.
1	I trust my primary care doctor.  I have a very open relationship with him.  He will tell me the good things as well as the bad things.  I think that he is focused on recommending the best things for me as a patient.  I believe that his recommendations change based on the patients that he is dealing with.
-1	I do not have any medical problems. I do not visit hospitals or doctors. I do not have a primary physician.
1	I trust my Dr because she's concerned about what I what I want and how I feel. We make the final decisions together.
-1	I think doctors ca n be trusted in general. I do think they hurry you out more quickly than they should to maintain their schedule...which is wrong. I think doctors rely ro heavily on the patient to know what to ask, instead of asking the pertinent questions themselves
-1	I do not currently have a primary care physician, however, I trust most doctors to be caring and competent while I am proactive in my own care and research treatment options and ask questions of my physician.
1	My PCP has done nothing but good in my eyes. He always does whats best for me. I switched doctors and my current doctor reduced the dosage of metformin form 2500 a day to 2000 a day during my first visit because it was an unsafe dose. My previous doctor did not know that.
1	He been my doctor for 15 years.  I trust him. We know either very well, he explains  everything so I can understand it without question. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because they have a degree in medicine, and has seen many others like me with similar issues in the past.
-1	I trust because they talk to me and explain all my option and care about my needs always there in an emergency
1	I HAVE HAD A LONG EXPERIENCE WITH MY CURRENT DOCTOR, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A GOOD RAPPORT. WE SPEAK EASILY, FRANKLY, AND OPENLY. I FEEL THAT I CAN TRUST HIM GIVEN OUR HISTORY AND HIS NON-JUDGMNENTAL ATTITUDE AND FRIENDLY TURE. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY REASON TO NOT TRUST HIM, AND FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH ALL OF HIS REASONS FOR DOING THINGS, HIS EXPLATIONS OF THINGS, AND CONDUCT IN GENERAL. HE NEVER PRETENDS TO KNOW MORE THAN HE DOES, ALWAYS LISTENS, AND I UNDERSTAND OUR INTERACTIONS, MOTIVES, AND COMMUNICATIONS TOTALLY.
1	My doctor doesn't try to pressure or shame me into doing anything or taking any medication that he feels I need if I object. He respects my opinion.
-1	It's not that I distrust my physician, it's that I distrust the medical establishment, to include govt intervention.  I trust that my physician is doing the best she can with the training provided by the medical establishment.  The reason I distrust the establishment is due to its record.   Food pyramid, dietary cholesterol, fats are bad, massive numbers of people on statins with no resulting drops in CVD related deaths.
-1	I feel that my doctor has my best intentions in mind. He helps me to feel better every day and prevents me from getting sick. I have full trust in  him.
1	I like my doctor a lot. He's so fucking hot and is very thoughtful & intelligent. I want to see him without his shirt on.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has the experience to heal me whenever I am sick. I am not as informed and train as him, so I trust him tremendously. Also, he can examine me through scans and prescribe medicines.
-1	I feel that because I am not diagnosed with detrimental medical conditions my doctor has less regard over optiol treatments for a condition. I have some regard for their opinions, but am not fine with the cost of some prescriptions written for my treatment.
1	My doctor is excellent.  He never makes me feel rushed and he always takes the time to answer questions for me.  He is extremely thorough when I have to see him about something.  He also has a very human quality about him, unlike many doctors I have dealt with in the past.  He also sees my young daughter and is extremely thoughtful and thorough, more so when dealing with a youngster.
1	She considers information provided and what she sees. She is a known, competent authority and a worthwhile resource. That reputation has been earned over the years.
-1	Because of past experience I have with this doctor. I would really like to find a new doctor but haven't had a positive experience trying to find a good one.
-1	Doctors in general: They are narcissistic, arrogant snakes who care more about their country club membership payments than patients. I repeatedly have received misdiagnoses and inadequate when it comes to doctors such that I now view them as a means to an end--the end being the laboratory test results and that's about it. Dr. Google has served me far better than any doctor ever has.
1	I trust my primary care physician because they always listed, answer my questions, and never seem to rush thru the appointment. If something is wrong, they always make a follow up phone call.
1	I have had the same primary doctor for at least a decade. He is a primary care physician, and he has never done me wrong. He is flexible enough to let me try new drugs when they are helpful in being productive in my life.
-1	"Sometimes I feel as if my PCP doesn't take my concerns serious and just brushes them to the side. My doctor sometimes has this ""I'm the professional and your not"" kind of attitude, as if she is trying to make me feel dumb. She is also not very comforting."
-1	I haven't seen a doctor in a long time, and my recent visit had me feeling a bit wary about everything. I was worried about the cost of everything, and listening to my doctor talk about going to see some specialist for one thing, and a specialist for another thing made me very alert and unwilling to agree to either one. I just don't believe I have complete trust in the American Healthcare System and its practices, in regards to cost for the patient. I.e. a saline bag being charged at $100, when they are manufactured at perhaps $0.25
-1	My physician does not rush me out of her office. She sits and talks with me and makes me feel like a person rather than just another face in her daily routine. She tells me about her past experiences as she is less than ten years older than me and has gone through a lot of the same things I have. She tells me what things she thinks are optional (flu shots, etc...) and what I really need to get done to stay healthy. 
-1	I think most doctors are trying their best to provide good care but you really need to be your own advocate when it comes to your health. If something  doesn't  feel right or you are not getting better, get a second or even third opinion. 
-1	I have rarely had any issues with my medical treatments that are recommended by my doctors.  They seem to know what is best for me based on my medical history.
1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR. I FEEL HE GENUINELY CARES ABOUT MY PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL BEING. HE ASKS ABOUT THINGS THAT WAS GOING ON LAST TIME I SAW HIM. AND THAT COULD BE A LONG TIME AGO.
-1	I dislike going to the appointment because I and a dozen others have the same time. Once in the room it's 3-5 minutes to talk about everything thats wrong.
-1	I just feel like he doesn't listen to my concerns sometimes. He also seems distracted a lot. And he doesn't spend very much time with me, either. 
-1	Right now, I have a very good doctor. She takes the time to explain everything. I never feel rushed and in the way. She make me fill like she cares.
-1	My dr. Is ok but I'm not getting anywhere with her I feel like shot all the time and tell her how I feel and it seems like it goes in one ear and out the other without stoping
-1	I have not been with her long, but certain things have fallen through the cracks, like orders for follow-up tests. She's also not show much curiosity in helping me identify problems.
1	I trust my doctor completely because he has always been honest with me and always helped with any medical problems that come up. Also because you can call him at any time and he will come to the office to help any patient that needs it.
1	He never jumps to conclusions, he will talk to me about what ever it is and do tests if that's what is needed. 
-1	I do not see a primary care physician. I prefer holistic medicine, ie. natural or herbal medications, essential oils & studying changes in diet to aid in healing the body naturally. Our bodies were created to heal themselves. The use of synthetic medications tend to cause other physical side effects. They focus on the symptoms rather than the root problem causing the symptoms.
1	I've known him for a number of years,and I trust his judgement he's caring and I think he gives me good advice that is good for me
-1	I feel that certain doctors honestly care about their patients, I also feel that certain doctors care more about the money.
-1	i trust doctors for the most part because i believe many of them are inherently good people who got into the medical field in order to help be of service to others. Occasionally there are doctors who seem to be pretty detached from their work and just see all their patients as a paycheck, and that is truly an awful thing.
-1	had personally bad experiences with doctors in regards to making/performing good decisions, seems to be more out to make money than helping patients
1	I trust my doctor because he has cared for many patients over the years and he knows what he is doing 
-1	My Dr is very thorough.  She is willing to answer my questions regardless of the time it takes.  She is willing to schedule tests to eliminate possible illness that have not been diagnosed.
1	My doctor takes a lot of time and effort to explain my conditions to me. He gives guidance for modifying my diet in connection with my medication. He also gives directions to appropriate resource persons. He also provides scientific literature regarding my condition.
1	In general, I trust my doctor to take into consideration my wellbeing when and guide me in the right direction but at the same time I have reservations about whether they are giving me ALL the possible options.
-1	I trust my doctors in general because they have much more experience than I do and would imagine that would lead them to make or suggest the right options for me in regards to my health.
-1	I have had several doctors over my lifetime and I don't trust quite a few of them. If they don't listen or believe what I report about my own health then I can't really trust them to make accurate diagnoses or appropriate treatments
1	My primary care doctor has given me no reason to distrust them, so I trust them. The Hippocratic Oath and medical licensing process are enough for me to trust them so long as they don't give me reason not to.
-1	I feel that doctors sometimes have motivation to pursue a certain treatment plan without narrowly tailoring it to my needs.
-1	The reasons why i trust my physician is because i have known him for a while. He has always been honest with me and my care. For that reason he is my daughters doctor as well.
1	My doctor takes her time during my appointment to answer all of my questions and concerns. She seems concerned about my health concerns as well.
-1	I believe they are trying to do a good job but the problem is they are always over booked so you have to be your own advocate and try to understand your condition.  You should also ask questions you have in mind.  After all it is your own body and your own health.  
1	I really like my primary care physician. He is never in a rush with even though he may be busy with patients. I ask a lot of questions and he always answers them. He gives me his thoughts but allows for me to make my decision on my own
-1	I only see my primary care doctor briefly, once per year for a physical. I feel she is polite and knowledgeable, but that she is often dismissive of my concerns. I trust medical professionals who I see on a more regular basis, such as my chiropractor, because they are exposed to me more frequently. I also recently went to urgent care for a matter that my doctor dismissed and received more effective treatment from urgent care. 
1	Some things i can trust about physicians but mostly not everything is to be believed. Doctors give u things to suppress ilnesses but not get rid of it. Its all about keeping us sick. So no I dont trust doctors. I trust in the Lord Jesus Christ only! God of Abraham, Isaac and Joseph.
-1	I trust my doctor in a very basic sense. I feel that doctors don't take the time necessary to thoroughly go over medical issues with patients. They are quick to prescribe medications without considering the harm it can do with the side effects. I try to keep up with my own needs and search for medical information to better help me. I feel that I'm the best to look out for myself.
1	My doctor keeps it real with me and tell me whats the best method and medicines for me. He also tells me if it will work or won't work
-1	I have been going a long time and always get the help I need. My doctor goes over options with me and takes the time to explain things.
1	I've had the same Doctor for about 15 years and she's never steered me wrong , she's always had my best interest at heart . She is Really good at her job and it's not JUST A job to her
1	I trust my doctors because  they know more than I do about the situation, and if I express concern they explain the thinking process and differentials that they are concerned about allowing them to reach the conclusions that they do. 
-1	For the first few years I had full confidence in my primary care doctor. In the past year or two she has taken on many more new patients, and as a result she is harder to contact and schedule appointments with. She spends less time with me during my appointments and the conversation can sometimes be rushed. I feel like due to time constraints, she often forgets to tell me something, such as a treatment option or type of medication that could be helpful to me. Because of this, I have lost some confidence in her ability as a health care provider.
-1	I do not go to the doctor often so from my experience would require more time with the person but sometimes I believe doctors are dishonest in treatment plans as they don't give medications that will heal but rather fix the problem temporarily so that a patient returns
1	I have a NP who is under the license of a PCP. I love her! She is more thorough and caring than any other physician I have seen (other than my best friend, who is a nephrologist) in many, many years. The thing I like most about her is she really listens to my, my needs and wants, and I can trust her with anything.
-1	Sometimes doctors do not take the time to really look at the whole picture and just prescribe what is common for a condition
1	he told me exactly what was going on with me even though it might frighten me some he explained in detail why this is happening and some things I should and should not do . he explained what off symtoms to watch out for
1	he ran all my tests and told me what they were for and what they were used to determine. he kept me in the loop at all times
-1	One primary reason I have lost trust in my PCP is the fact that I have had surgery for the same reason twice now within three years and really need it again.  I went to an emergency room and the physician there asked me why I had to have the same surgery so close together and I couldn't tell him.  He mentioned that it was unusual for that type of surgery.  This made me contemplate a new option when I go back for the same reason.
-1	Overall I don't feel alot of trust of doctors in general. The reason why I feel this way is because I feel most doctor's are in it for the money and they don't necessarily want people to be healed. They give you medicine for almost everything and that is not a good thing. So overall I don't trust in doctors and don't go to the doctors unless I have no other choice.
1	My doctor is a very kind man and he is always looking out for my best interests. He inquired about my personal life and he has been my doctor for a prolonged amount of time.
-1	My doctor is a internist and cardiologist; and he spends little time with patients.  He quickly prescribes drugs; and claims diet and exercise won't help alleviate medical conditions.  He is abrupt and does not explain things thoroughly; and refuses to allow patients to see test results..  I don't trust him at all!
-1	My doctor was going to give Zoloft to my husband for anxiety knowing that he has heart problems. She also wants me on pain management and I don't want to do that. 
1	 tust my primary physician because she always explains everything in detail to me and takes time for me
1	I trust my physician because he was referred to me. He listens to me and answers questions that I have.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I can usually tell when he or she is not doing there best to treat my condition 
-1	My doctor used to really care about her patients.  It seems as though her practice has gotten way too busy and now she doesn't take the time she used to with her patients.  This makes me distrust her a bit.
-1	The body is meant to heal itself give the proper environment. I don't think taking chemicals and drugs are the way to make that happen. A lot of allopathic doctors don't want to acknowledge tural altertive treatments for their patients because they are being paid by big Pharma to solicit their drugs.
-1	Sometimes I think they may do what makes them the most money. They may not send you to a Specialist because it takes money away from them. They may also not listen to your idea because they feel they are always right.
1	My primary physician always gives options for care and leaves the decision up to me after explanations as to why he would suggest one option would be more beneficial than other.
-1	I trust my Primary physician because so far they have done a very good job and were right about what to do about the situstion. 
1	My doctor is a smart man and asks me questions about how I feel and then makes the diagnosis.  If I say that doing spiritual things help then he trusts my instincts. If I tell him that a medicine doesn't work then we change it.
-1	"I trust my physician because he is a trained and qualified professiol. Even if he ""cares more about what is convenient for him than about my medical needs"", I can not know about it. He would not tell me. I can only trust him."
1	I feel very lucky to have the PCP that I see. She really listens to what I say and answers my questions. She doesn't rush through things to get me out and on to the next patient. She is thorough and I am always provided written documentation about what we discussed and any changes to medications. First thing she does is read the nurse's notes of why I'mâ there and the notes made at my previous visit. I get nervous any time I have to see any of my doctor's, but she and her staff treat me with respect and dignity which usually calms me. I have no complaints.
1	I have had the same physician for several years. He is patient with my many questions. He is easily accessible. 
-1	
1	I trust my primary physician because he listens to what I say, and plays an active part in my health care.
-1	Some doctors feel like they should take the easy route when it comes to telling their patients what's best. 
-1	I just started going to a new primary care physician this summer.  I was very impressed.  She took 15-20 minutes to just sit down and get to know me and my health history.  She seemed very knowledgeable and was very easy to talk to.
-1	I trust that they are doing the very best they know how. And I'm very aware of the fact they they are only human and they are limited in there knowledge and expertise on all subjects
1	I completely trust my primary physician because he is aware of my health issues and can suggest me with good care.I believe Doctors always work for our betterment.After God we have to trust God for cure.
1	My doctor has seen me for several years. I trust them a lot because of the rapport we have built. My doctor has always given me great advice about my health, and has inquired about my life and goals. I think my doctor always tries his best with me. 
-1	The main reasons I trust my primary care physician is because they have been trained to deal with health issues and give helpful advice. I would only distrust advice about medication with side effects.
1	He has given me prescriptions that have alleviated my depression and anxiety issues. He seems to really care because he wants to see me every month and examine how the medications exactly affects me and make changes. When I tell him I have worries about my heart he always checks and listens to my heart for a minute. I have no reason to doubt his honesty.
-1	I generally trust my doctor. He always goes above and beyond to make sure my needs are met and keeps me up to date regarding my health.
1	for to get me better in life is hard place to live in we my docter to explane the prolbe is day afer day medice 
1	My doctor has always taken the time to sit and talk with me about any concerns I have regardless of the time crunch on her part.  She will walk me through different steps to take and even calls days later to check in to see how we are doing.
1	I finally found a doctor that doesn't only wants to prescribe more medicine.  He agreed with me that some to the prescriptions I was taking I did not need.  He  and I agree that there is only one that I do need.  Finally a doctor that is not a pill pusher.  
1	I believe there is a monetary factor connection to some of the health care decisions on the part of the provider.
-1	My doctor doesn't thoroughly talk about any diagnosis. My doctor also seems to always be in rush. I appreciate though that my doctor does seem to take an interest in being there and providing steps.
-1	I always feel that I am rushed when I go to the dr. The usually ask a couple of questions and make there decisions that way instead of examining or running test.
-1	My doctor has made decisions that made me  better after visiting and receiving my treatment. My doctor listens to what I have to say.
1	I trust my PCP because she is very caring and if I need a referral she gives me one if she feels my condition is something another doctor needs to handle.
-1	Because they give me good advice and they here too help me and keep my body healthy and make sure I stay healthy
-1	He's has been my doctor for as long as I can remember, when he retires I will have to find a new one
1	They have been through extensive training in the subject area and certainly at the very least know more than I do, and have no reason to want to deceive me
-1	I distrust my primary care physician because I have gone to them before about an issue and they could not give me any answers, years later I went to a specialist and they were able to tell me what it was immediately. I kind of think my doctor is incompetent and doesn't care for me much. I also think a lot of doctors are just there to make money and only recommend medications that sponsor them. 
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. He's never done anything to upset me. He listens to me and is very patient. I have had to switch my children's doctor one time though. I did not agree with her many times and she hardly seemed to check out my kids, I did not trust her at all. 
1	My doctor has never given me reason for distrust. He is always knowledgeable, friendly and professiol.
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for 7 years and still to this day have never seen him I have only seen the physician assistant.  She does a great job but I think its funny I have never seen him
1	I have never had a problem with anything my doctor has recommended or prescribed for me for any conditions.
-1	I don't think I receive adequate care, attention, or consideration.  I often feel hurried along and my doctor doesn't explain things in much detail, so I'm really under the impression that my doctor just sees each patient as something to cross off a to-do list.
-1	My doctor over the years I have lost trust in him he used to be throughout and take his time with me and discuss issues but now when I go I have to wait an hour and a half for him to be in the room for not even 2 minutes which really upsets me because I have to drive 75 miles each way to get to my appointment.
1	I trust my doctors because every time I had a problem with my health she steered me in the right direction 
-1	Wrote this in the other section but fits here better. They write down possible conditions and never tell me so I have to read it on my medical records to understand why they are asking me something.
-1	Although I do trust her, there are times that she is so busy, that she barely has time for me. I don't ask questions or tell everything either.
1	He takes his time and listens to me. He takes what I say seriously and gives me the impression he cares
1	I feel they know a lot more than I do and I can trust their opinions. They are not out to just make money but also to help people and part of being helpful is doing the right thing as far as diagnosis and subjestions on health.
1	I have no issues with my  doctor,  just  believe my doctor have my best interests  regarding my health.th. I  believe that  my doctor help me  reach my goal  regarding my health. 
-1	I generally trust doctors to provide a reasobly high level of care with persol integrity. However, I know that as in any field, there are fincial, administrative, and moral/ethical pressures weighing on these professiols. I am sure that sometimes they feel that they must go against their preferred ways of behaving and communicating with patients.
-1	I feel like all doctors are there first for the income and second for the health of the people. It's kind of hard to tell whether or not a doctor really cares about your well being or they just tell you anything to get you out of the way.
-1	I believe they attended school for a certain amount of time to learn the knowledge needed to assist patience with their needs in a daily basis 
-1	You can never trust a doctor all the way good or bad. Some times they out for money sometimes they want the best for you. 
-1	i trust my physician. My physician been in my family for years. When i she give me advice i take it to heart. I feel that my physician would not lie to me 
1	my doctor is there for me when I need him to be - he takes the time to listen to me and answer and questions I might have. 
-1	I've had several physicians over the years.  Most of them have always been trustworthy.  For example, I was taking ambien for many years for insomnia, and because my doctor truly had my best interest, she stopped filling my script and we opted for a different drug that was less addictive.  I have developed a lot of trust with her.
1	this is general-doctors have been nice to me and let me know what to expect in way of treatment or if it was something that would take time to heal-they have been right more often than not
1	I trust my doctor because they had my best interest and heart and always has been honest with me. My has been truthful with me from days one.
-1	I don't put complete trust in no one. That goes for doctors too. Everybody are human, and their well-being, opinions and feelings can affect my medical treatment.
1	They have many years of experience and tell me their thoughts and diagnoses without trying to put anything delicately or hiding any concerns.
-1	In general, I trust the profession but physicians are people - they can make mistakes and they may not always interpret symptoms correctly.   The more you interact, the higher the trust level can become.
-1	I usually trust my doctor if I agree with what they think is best to do and if I don't agree I question him.
1	I see my physician as someone who truly believes in his work and entered this profession due to a strong desire to help people.  He has never failed to help me when I have gone to him with a problem and I have been completely satisfied with the results I have gotten.
1	My doctor takes a great deal of time with his patients.  My last wellness visit lasted 1 1/2 hours.  I met with his assistant, his student doctor and him.  They took a full medical and social history.  Because he is a teaching doctor and has a 3rd year medical student working with him, he uses the questions I ask as an opportunity to educate both me and his student.  He runs all the tests he feels are needed to make sure I am in good physical shape.  He also counsels me on nutrition. 
1	I trust my Dr because he takes his time while I am there for my visit.  He leaves no stone unturned.  He always does blood work before the visits.  He orders appropriate test just in case.  He encourages me to continue on a healthy path.  He helps in dieting and what to eat and what not to eat.  I also trust my Dr because he is sought after by lots of patients.  He is always booked up.  He has been in the business for quite a few years.  
-1	I don't have one but the ones I had in the past do not fit the category of fully trusted.  
1	I trust my primary care physician.  When I went to him and told him I was depressed he immediately referred me to a social worker/therapist.  He did not just prescribe me medicine on his own.  He is careful and conservative but effective.
1	i have been with the same doctor for years and he listen to me and always give me the right medicines an test that im required to do
1	The doctors that I have are all outstanding physicians in their fields.  They listen to me and we work as a team in coming up with my health care plan.  My primary care physician really takes her time in weighing all the information and goes over with me what they recommend and listens to my input so that we can create a positive experience.  I trust her because she has shown that my health is of important concern to her.
1	My doctor appears to spend the time necessary to understand my conditions/concerns and address them. She is willing to admit when she does not know something and refers me to a specialist that can help. It probably helps that I am friends with one of her nurses (friends before I started seeing the doctor).
-1	I trust the doctors i see because of the training and education they receive. I do think there is a bit of opinion difference between different doctors but i think overall that is marginal in diagnosis. I do believe that in general almost all doctors and nurses are out for the patients best interest.
1	I have never had any reason not to trust what my Doctor tells me. He has always been very straight with me about everything.
-1	I will never trust a physician because they are just doing their job as an employee and dont genuinely care about you personally. They do what they are trained is best for their career, not for you.
-1	I trust hee because she is a specialist but i have done everything she asked me to regarding changes my diet and takon medications and gettung tests done but she never calls to check how im feeling or gets to results
1	My primary care physician is very thorough in explaining things and likes to make sure I understand what she has told me before the visit ends. 
-1	She never remembers me.  I go in for one problem and she ignores it and instead complains about my weight.  I once went to her to acquire a sedative for a very stressful upcoming doctor appointment and she screamed at me saying if I take 4 Valium pills I will turn into an addict.  She also gets my age wrong every time.  I only go to her for referrals.  She is at an age where I think she needs to retire and every time I have been there I never see any patients in the waiting room.  Her online reviews are also terrible. 
-1	I like my primary care doctor but I don't really see him enough to have perfect trust in him. I see him for maybe 15 minutes once or twice a year. 
-1	I am assigned a dr through the military and dont really have a choice. I advocate for myself and only see them when sick.
-1	I have had my doctor for a number of years and will go to great lengths to make sure I get the care I need and answers all my questions no matter how they may seem
1	My doctor delivered my children. He was always honest with me about my health. Any medical treatment I have ever needed he provided the best medicine 
-1	I am a little wary of doctors and their personal interests, and how this may conflict with my interests, but I generally feel confident in my personal doctor. He has always been straightforward with me. 
-1	I think she has so many patients so I feel like a number. I also thinl she wants to prescribe certain medications. I assume rhere are kickbacks 
-1	I have been going to the same office for around sixteen years. I have been seeing my current doctor now for seven years.  Being overweight he has always told me smaller steps to start losing weight. He always listens and looks into whatever i bring to his attention. He will even demonstrate small exercises if need be. Overall he is a kind doctor who looks out for his patients. If its something that beyond him and his office he is quick to refer you to a doctor that meats his standards which are high
-1	my doctor  is a good dr  and will  explain things  to  you  and  ask  for testing  for things  hyou  need
1	My doctor has always been open to questions and replies with swift honest answers.He is highly trained, caring and gives no reason for me to doubt him. he has also been my family doctor since 1998.
-1	I trust her and ask questions as I need to about health issues or concerns. I can ask questions about different medications or choices that I have   
1	He has helped with some of my medical issues when other doctors didn't. He listens well to everything I say and makes you feel comfortable. 
-1	I've only had one bad doctor in all my experiences with medical professionals. And he was an eye doctor with his own private practice that strung me along, to get me to keep taking many tests. I ended up seeing optometrists at the mall (eye glasses store) and she fixed my problem after one appointment. So now I rather go to a popular and well-known location to see a doctor, if it isn't a clinic or hospital. 
1	I have an excellent doctor who always takes all the time I need at my appointments and from past experience has been very helpful in any condition I am seeing him to be treated.  Feel very comfortable and trust his decisions in my care.
-1	I overall trust my doctor but there is so much information out in the world regarding health and sicknesses and treatments that he couldn't possibly know everything that is best for me.
1	I have never had a medical issue where I didn't know what was wrong before going in to see him. I usually show up for an appt and explain what's going on and know exactly how he's going to treat me.
-1	I trust my doctor because i make her career. If she is carless and overlooks something it could destroy her. Without me she wouldnt have a career. I would she spend so musch time and money on a career that she didnt care about.
-1	My primary care physician has been generally thorough and helpful, and when he says something is wrong he is very thorough in providing me with all of the information about treatment options available to me. However, I answered neutral for some of my responses because there was a time when I had a lot of non-specific symptoms and eventually began having a lot of pain, and he did not look much further into it and prescribed me muscle relaxers. I visited again and his PA took the time to do a full examition and determined based on my pain that I had fibromyalgia, which also explained many of my other nonspecific symptoms. In this case, I don't believe my PCP was as thorough during the visits I made to him because he didn't discuss this possibility with me. 
-1	I have trust in doctors because i feel that are trained very well and see things everyday and know about them.  I feel my doctor is paid accordingly and should trust my doctor as she would know best and whats best for me regarding my health. My doctor is usually a no nonsense kind of doctor and is very direct which is what i prefer so i know exactly where i stand.  
-1	Sometimes people just look out for their own well being more than others no matter what profession. Also plenty of doctors have been wrong in diagnosing issues I'm having. They mask everything with medicine instead of treating the root cause. 
1	I trust my physician because of my previous experiences. He has always done right by me. I trust him with my life
1	I simply trust them because I know that they are a professiol. Usually the person I go to has been in the area for years and is well known by the community. So I assume if they had a history of doing the wrong thing then people would have said something about it. 
-1	I have found that a lot of them will prescribe something because they benefit from the pharmaceutical representatives. I usually do more research on medicines to find out which is best for me. Some doctors know more or just care more than others. 
1	I have gone to my primary care physician for a long time and he has always helped me get 'better'.  I have never been prescribed a medicine that has harmed me in any way, nor have I been prescribed a course of treatment that hindered my recovery.  
-1	I don't have a primary physician, but I feel that overall, doctors are more concerned about the bottom line than the patients. In the past, I have been prescribed medicine I don't need for a condition I don't have, just because the physician I was seeing was paid to do so by the pharmaceutical companies. I don't feel that doctors really listen to their patients. 
1	I have been her patient for 20 years+ and I know she has my best interest at heart. She is very compassionate and caring.I appreciate her a lot. We have a good patient- doctor relationship.
1	I trust my doctor I've had her for 5 years she's usually straight forward with me about my health and wellbeing 
1	I have a long term relationship and have found my doctor to be knowledgeable and accurate in the situations I have been in
-1	There have been times where I don't think he payed full attention to what I explained to him, then had me do tests that were incomplete only to redo them again the next time when they failed to find anything. This ties in with my belief that he is rushed and therefore I feel rushed as well.
-1	I believe that my primary care doctor is mostly interested in the money and as such is not completely honest when prescribing medications or diagnosing problems. sometimes I feel as though he is too busyt to explain in detail and gets frustrated if I ask questions. I pretty much think this is true of the medical profession as a whole and as such I am reluctant to trust any doctor. 
-1	i trust my pcp because i have not had a reason not to when it comes important things in my life that could meen life; or death.i do get nervous when it comes to something major though.
-1	I trust the doctors but as any humans , they are imperfect. As a result i took his advice with some degree of caution and sometimes ask a second opinion with another doctor
-1	I trust him enough I suppose. He's my oncologist I still see once a year. He's a nice guy and everything but he's always busy so when I go there I do all the tests first (CT scan, blood work, etc.) Then he gets all the information before I see him and if no cancer or nothing new that's pretty much it. Usually only see him for 5 minutes or so. But all in all I'm happy with him, I still go there so he must be ok.
-1	medications are mostly prescribed based off what pharmaceutical reps are pushing, right? So whatever medication I get may not be what the doctor would have preferred to give. 
-1	I don't trust any doctors.  I have had many problems in the past with many different doctors. They do not know have of what they think they know.
1	My doctor is well-trained and has plenty of knowledge and experience. I have never felt like I was being rushed out the door. They always talk to me with respect, and for as long as I need.
-1	They are kind and know what they are doing.  She never seems to rush and always has time for my questions
1	i trust my doctor becaus eInhave been seeing him for a while now and he genuinely seems as thought he cares about me. He not only suggest things for treating a problems but suggest means for health promotion and disease prevention and this is nice because he is interested in the goodness of my health
-1	I do not have a primary physician, but I did have a cardiologist in which I seen somewhat often. For the most part I trusted him with the tests he authorized for me to do to find out what my condition was before coming to a conclusion because he went to rule everything else out before I received my diagnosis. I generally trust him, however I know that doctors do not work for the welfare of the people, but the welfare of deepening their pockets. The old doctor vow was to help people and to recommend dietary changes to promote health and well-being. Now it's about their contracts with Big Pharma and prescribing poisonous and toxic medications to create a lifelong patient and to create more money for themselves. In general, I believe my doctor's intention were in the right place, but I'm fully aware of the scam and can see through it all, so I generally do not trust them.    
-1	I have always had good experiences with doctors so there is no reason for me not to trust them.  I also believe that doctors are trained well and that they know what is best for me 
1	He is very knowledgeable and always puts my needs first. He often listens to my problems at our sessions.
-1	I believe if a person has dedicated their life to healing people, then their suggestions would be valuable. Doctors have a lot invested (time/money) in their careers, I don't believe they would throw that investment away by providing false information to their patients.
1	I trust my doctor because she always makes a point to bond with me and explain her reasoning. I've also been going to the same doctor for four years now and they are completely involved in my family. 
1	My physician takes his time in examining any problems mental or physically. He will provide accurate detailed information to in which once after the visit, you're more aware of your body especially on things that you didn't know.
1	I trust my physician because she is very thorough and is very caring. I also trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable and knows what she is doing.
1	My doctor regularly calls my home and checks on me. Also to remind me of any appointments I may have upcoming.
-1	"I believe that doctors see a lot of people and give a lot of ""canned"" answers that are probably good advice but aren't tailored to each person individually."
-1	Because there decision is made off of generals. They are not specialist. If I tell my PCP that I am not overweight but I eat well(veggies, all organic) they will at the end tell me to eat better. 
-1	THE MEDICAL PROFESSION HAS LITTLE OR NO TRAINING IN NUTRITION AND RELIES ON PHARMACEUTICAL POISON TO FIX AN ISSUE.
-1	I really dont care to be honest they just doing their job and making money for their families and hopefully friends who they probably make happy 
1	My doctor is a humble, caring person, who takes the time to go over any and all results of any tests. Also listeners to me when I tell her what is going on with my body.
-1	Doctors are just like everyone else. Some you can trust, and others you cannot.
-1	My insurance recently changed, so I go to a local clinic and never see the same doctor more than once, so I never have a chance at building trust or a relationship with them. Usually, where I go, appointments are only a few moments, regardless of the severity of the reason you go, so I find it hard to believe they're really devoting enough time and energy to treating me in the best possible way.
-1	Well, I marked neutral on all these because my PCP has only been with me 4 months. If i don't believe in my doctor or the doctor doesn't have faith in me about fixing things with a diet and exercise they get the boot. If they don't listen to me or make me feel ignored they get the boot.  So far I like him and he is  being a cheerleader for me 
-1	too big a hurry to fully listen to what Im describing.. wants his job to be much quicker and easier while still making alot of money.
1	I have never felt any reason to not trust my doctor. I feel as if they try and do their best to figure out what my issues are. Until then, I will trust them.
-1	I usually go to a clinic, so I never know which doctor or NP I will see. I like some of them, they go over everything with me. Some of them it seems like I only see for a minute, and then they leave the room before I can ask any questions.
-1	In general, I would trust my doctor to recommend what he honestly believes is the best medical advice for me. However, I have done a fair amount of research and reading regarding certain health issues, and in general I don't trust the medical community to always have the best or most up-to-date information on some issues, particularly regarding nutrition and diet. 
-1	I feel like my doctors are trustworthy for the most part but sometimes I wonder if they get paid by people like drug companies to give out certain kinds of medicine for people who have problems and maybe that makes them find problems that aren't there sometimes. 
-1	I always have full trust and my doctor they have my best interest in mind. So there's no reason I shouldn't trust that
-1	They are my doctor I have to trust in what they say. They went to school to study the stuff so I have no other choice but to trust in them
1	My primary care physician has been our family's doctore for 25 years. He is a caring man who explains thing in depth to my wife & I.
-1	I believe that my doctor is competent, but I sometimes feel like he doesn't take me seriously. I have never been harmed by a doctor, but I feel as though a doctor's convenience is more important to them than my preferences. Overall, I would like to be treated with more respect and dignity.
-1	I have never had to see my primary care doctor for anything serious, so I might feel differently if that were the case. All in all, I think my doctor can be trusted and has given me no reason to think otherwise.
-1	You should always trust your doctor to give you the best care you can receive. Doctors are not there to purposely harm you, they care about you and want the best for you. Not every doctor will have the right answer but you should still trust them 
1	I've being going to my doctor for over 35 years.  I trust him explicitly.  He has always been there for me and my family.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because so far she has not given me any reason not to trust her. She has really good online reviews and so far my experiences with her have been pleasant.
-1	Doctors have received the proper training and certification to perform their job to the best of their abilities. I trust these qualifications enough to trust doctors, but just like every other professions there will be problems. I do not expect everything at a hospital to go right for doctors, but I expect them to treat patients with care.
-1	I trust them because their doctors for a reason & that's their job but then sometimes I don't trust them because some doctors just care for the money & not the people that need help.
1	I believe he is smart and thorough. I don't usually need him for many things but he has always had good advice when I do have a problem.
1	i trust my LNP greatly, she recently listened to me and wrote me a RX for an Ultrasound. We discovered my gall bladder was full of sludge(pre stone condition) , I now cann look forward to finally some relief. 
1	I trust him the most because since I started going to his office my life has changed for the better. I feel great about myself and I think that is all thanks to him.
-1	I trust my doctor because they have more knowledge in that field of study and in the pains i may be having but i don't trust them to make the best recommendation for me when deciding between home remedy and hooking me on meds for profit; and benefiting from my insurance company. 
-1	In general, I think physicians are well trained and probably know what they are talking about.  However, I rarely get a chance to see a physician for more than a few minutes once or twice a year.  There isn't really a chance to build a trusting relationship.  I think the way the health system is set up forces doctors to go for quantity instead of having the opportunity to build real relationships with their patients.  Trust takes time to be earned and I just haven't really had the time to build any with any doctor in years.
-1	I have had concerns dismissed before without a good explanation, which is why I don't have 100% trust in my doctors, however, most of the time my doctor is willing to listen to me and provide the information that I need.
1	I trust my doctor because he/she allows me to make decisions within my rights, but makes recommendations  that he feels would best suit my body and well being. 
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because I've gotten second opinions and my doctor always  seem to take her time she knows everyone by name and takes her time with you
