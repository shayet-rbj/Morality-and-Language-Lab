0.888900	I feel like I do. I have learned through the years to be very direct with people in the medical profession. I frankly don't trust anyone but the doctors and the nurses, and they start out as suspect. Any civilian working for the hospital is to be treated with zero trust whatsoever.

0.916700	I AM VERY WELL READ AND HAVE NO PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING MEDICAL OR LEGAL FORMS
0.655600	I always feel comfortable when speaking to a medical professiol because they have seen many cases of my case. Whether I have allergies or anxiety, I talk to my doctor and tell him every step of pain or exhaustion I feel. I leave no stone un turned as I want the doctor's trust and help. 
0.916700	I have complete ability to understand all basic health information.
0.477800	Most of that stuff goes over my head. I don't even read it half the time. The United States health care system is designed to screw us over. Who cares if I miss the fine print? It's all the same to me. Nobody cares.

0.872200	I feel I am better than average.

0.844400	The only thing I have issue with is knowing my family history, and my immunization record - if it's really needed, I have to talk to my mom.  But I have excellent reading comprehension, know how to search for and then synthesize information I want, and know my own preferences well enough to be confident in my judgments.
0.783300	I feel good about it. I've also gotten better at asking questions that I need answered in a way that helps me understand better. It's very important that I know what's going on with my body.

0.755600	I don't even understand that statement.  Why do doctors go to school for 10 years to learn all this jargon and I'm supposed to understand it with nothing
0.494400	I feel like if I asked more questions and did more research I would be better informed but I put off both as]king questions and doing research for later and then never actually do it, so ivery often don't know the proper info about the prescription meds I'm taking and what I can't and can't take with them.I know the info is all out there but I just get too flustered to do anything about it. 
0.816700	I feel like I'm pretty able to research health information as it pertains to me and my children.  I am one of those people that will obsessively research something if I find out I have it and then be able to ask my practitioner the correct questions.
0.888900	I have a higher capacity than the general population but not as much as a healthcare professiol of any sort (nurses, MA, doctors, etc) because my son was in the hospital for a time and I have to help my mom understand forms about her and my grandmother. I know the questions to ask.
0.900000	I feel like I know what I'm doing when it comes to this. I try to stay informed and know what is important to ask and be aware of. I don't tend to shy away from asking questions and getting information.
0.838900	I work at a hospital so I am exposed to a lot more lingo/ terminology than others so I have a better grasp and understanding.

0.738900	I feel that this very needed.  It is hard to understand some of the information they tell you because I feel they need to dumb it down for me. 
0.833300	I feel that I am fully capable of getting and understanding the information.  I also know how to ask the right questions and to ask for help if need be
0.622200	im pretty confident i can handle it myself 
0.805600	I feel like I can understand basic health information. The only problem I would have is with technical terms related to the medical field. 
0.916700	I feel very confident that I have to capacity to understand basic health information. It is my health, after all, and I refuse to not have any and all information regarding any medical situations.
0.722200	I am pretty compentant at understanding what a lot of the words mean, but sometimes it is hard to understand certain implications of different aspects of my health.  I think it is better when a doctor can beak it down into terms more relateable rather than heavily coded in medical and scientific jargon  
0.644400	I feel like I sometimes am able to obtain, process, and understand health information and services to make appropriate health decisions, but not all the time. For example, when it's busy at the pharmacy, the pharmacist isn't always available to answer my questions about prescriptions. And when I visit the doctor for an acute problem, I can rarely get my chronic issue questions answered without having to schedule another visit.
0.916700	I feel fine with it.  100% capable of doing what it takes to mage my healthcare- both asking and receiving all medical information. 
0.916700	I am capable of understanding my diagnoses and seek the medical help I may need
0.855600	I believe I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I research online or talk to trusted friends/family who are knowledgable in healthcare in order to ask the right questions.
0.661100	I believe I understand enough that with the help of my doctor, I could make a choice. I don't think I could do it on my own, but also don't think I'd have nothing of value to add to the conversation.
0.761100	I can always understand basic health information but I have a problem processing it while I am with the doctor or nurse.  It takes me a little time to think of the questions I want to ask and by then, I am already home and it is too late to call.  I feel like doctors and nurses can talk too fast and get you out of the office too quickly at times.
0.594400	I believe I do have the ability to access the information but often it comes from outside sources. I often feel rushed or intimidated by my medical staff and do not speak up to ask the proper questions, or I become so overwhelmed by the dismissive or hurried mood they have that I sit quietly instead of taking up more of their time.  Sometimes things don't make sense and I am too passive to speak up and say anything, and then often have to research it at home myself, which leaves me wondering if I am finding the correct information or not. 
0.866700	I understand it for the most part. Sometimes I do not understand what certain words mean, but usually can find a definition online or ask someone who is in the medical profession. I feel like I have pretty good access due to my insurance.
0.883300	I feel I have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have no trouble with this. 
0.677800	I feel that I have a basic understanding generally of what the doctor or nurse is telling me. Sometimes I misunderstand what they are saying, or take the information out of context and miss vital information. When I get confused I feel kind of stupid and rarely ask for clarification.
0.744400	I think that I understand basic health information when its given by health care professiols. Sometimes I can forget things related to nutrition after I am told, but for the most part I think I have a pretty good grasp on this type of information. 
0.883300	I would ask questions to the doctor about anything I didn't understand until I was satisfied that I knew what they where telling me.
0.627800	I feel I am knowledgeable enough to understand basic health information, but when large terms start being used I sometimes get confused. 
0.838900	I think I pretty much have a good handle on understanding things, as well as seeking out reliable sources for information. As an example, when I was diagnosed as being BRCA1+, the oncologist said to me something like she didn't think she could tell me anything I didn't already know.
0.838900	I have a good amount of ability to understand basic health information. I have relatives in the medical field that teaches me things occasiolly. I have also taken some courses in high school and college that gave me the basic terminology and understanding.
0.755600	I can read and understand most of the information and questions, sometimes I have questions about what it says, and how to deal and live with it.
0.866700	I am someone who is comfortable overall in handling my own health decisions as I have been studying healthcare and lifestyle for a long time.

0.761100	I think I have a pretty good understanding to understand basic health information about conditions that arise. That being said, I've luckily never had anything overly complicated come up with my health. 
0.538900	i do not feel i have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision because it is impossible to see a doctor these days. Moreover, once you actually see a doctor, they charge you out the wazoo. So there's this incentive not to go see a doctor. If i can't see a doctor, because i can't afford it. Then it's impossible to obtain/process/understand basic health information. Health care in the US is so broken. And trump is making it worse.
0.538900	It all depends on the circumstances. Some things are just harder than others to understand. I don't like doctors to begin with, they seem to cause a denial for me if something is wrong.
0.861100	I think I have an average degree of capacity in these areas.  I understand all forms and am able to fill them out.  I do hesitate to ask some questions of the doctor at times but I am able to look up information online instead.

0.872200	I know the basics. So I think I can make good decisions. Or if I don't understand something, I can ask and learn to help me make a better decision.
0.911100	I am fully capable of taking care of my health needs.  I only need assistance when I do not understand some of the medical terms or procedures we are discussing.   The only help I need then is for the doctor to explain in non-medical terms. 
0.916700	My mother was a nurse, technical medical terms were always used in our house and I used to study with my mother. I have a good memory and like knowing about health areas. I have little difficulty understanding health decisions.
0.866700	Usually when I visit my primary care doctor, everything is pretty well laid out.  I generally can understand everything on the forms that they have, and they are good about explaining things to me.  I've had a bit of issues at emergency doctors, since they don't know me as well.  However, most of the time I'm good to go.
0.572200	I feel ok.  It is hard to access healthcare and it is so expensive.  He Internet has helped me a ton in deciding what to do when I need to make health decisions
0.844400	I feel confident. I have an understanding of the condition and the medical staff is helpful.
0.672200	75 percent.  Alot of medical things are just over my head in general so I need a bit of help to understand the specifics.

I have a good vocabulary and reading level, and I am not afraid to ask my doctor or nurse if I have questions or ask for their recommendations.
0.844400	I feel like i have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I have never been given information that I found difficult to understand.  I am also not afraid to ask questions and read more on my own if there is something that I need to know.
0.783300	I feel like I am able to do so with everyday medical decisions. If the medical decisions involve something rare or that I have not heard of, I tend to research the topic and seek advice before making a decision.

0.838900	I feel that I am pretty good at getting the information needed to make health decisions. I'm not afraid to ask more questions if I don't understand what is being said to me. I will do more research if I feel my questions were not answered sufficiently. 
0.855600	I work in healthcare so I feel that I have the capacity to learn well enough about whatever disease state I need to know about. I do encounter patients that have difficulty with understanding such material. It can be difficult.
0.850000	Yes, I feel I have the capacity. If there is something that I do not understand, I ask questions and learn about it. It provides me with the ability to absorb most things at, at least an intermediate level.
0.644400	 I am fairly confident on getting that information but sometimes their instructions can be confusing or I don't understand what the diagnosis is 
0.766700	I believe that I am competent in basic services and health information but whenever doctors and nurses start using terms that I am not familiar with i have a problem. They say the terms and explain it in a way that they assume you are already familiar with the term 
0.744400	I feel like my level of health literacy is fairly high. I've spent little time in the hospital as a patient, and much more time in the hospital as a research assisant working in social medicine. UChicago is a great resource to have.

0.844400	I feel like i have the ability to understand everything. I have a good understanding of my health.
0.872200	I think I have a high capacity to do this. I am comfortable both reading unfamiliar material, doing research, and acting as my own advocate when dealing with professiols. Also my sister is a RN and is willing to help me with technical terms when necessary.
0.761100	For the most part I feel that I do have that capacity, but it honestly depends on the doctor or nurse that I am dealing with. I feel that many doctors and nurses are so strapped for time that they are not as willing to listen to whatever questions I have, and therefore many things end up getting lost through the cracks. 
0.538900	I feel that if needed I can do this. It would be no problem
0.783300	I can answer somewhat certainly all that is required by my health professiols. When there is a situation that needs information outside my realm of understanding, I ask for assistance.
0.694400	I NEED EVERYTHING FROM PATIONT AND DISCUSSION EVERYTHING WITH MY DOCTOR
0.827800	I think I have a pretty good capacity thanks in large part to the Internet. I look everything up online. The problem I have is sometimes when I'm talking to a doctor I don't think of the good questions to ask right away. I'll think of them after the appointment when it's too late.
0.861100	I make sure that I understand what I'm being told at the doctors office.  I ask if I have any questions and if I have any questions after I leave, I call back to the office to get clarification.

0.544400	I feel I do well to understand, but there's times where a doctor or nurse doesn't give me much information and then bolts off  to the next patient.  When this hapepns, I have to call friends who are nurses, or go online to get info.
0.900000	I feel very comfortable with basic health information. I've never really had a problem with not being able ot understand something or not getting the information i needed. 
0.900000	I feel that I have an above average understanding of basic health information and services. I feel that I comprehend the information that medical professiols give to me whether it is for myself, my spouse or my child. I am often the one that other family members turn to when they have questions regarding health issues.
0.916700	If I don't understand, I ask or I even research on the internet. I pretty much know about health information and easily can understand.
0.822200	I feel that I have the ability to understand and make decisions given that I tend to continue to ask questions until I can understand in non-medical jargon.  I also will follow up questions or search online.
0.650000	While some terms and information is more complicated, I believe that I can follow general guidelines or understand preventative maintence as well as pre and post long term care, if necessary.
0.900000	I feel like I am competent and can ask questions to understand things I might not understand. I can also look up information on the internet that might help explain a situation in more simple terms. There are a variety of resources available.
0.672200	I usually feel I have the capacity. As a woman I sometimes feel talked down to/not listened to by health professiols, which can frustrate me and make me less likely to be open to talking with doctors, because I feel like they aren't taking me seriously anyway.
0.916700	I understand it because I ask my doctor many questions. If I feel like I need more information than they said, I will Google it to see what's out there. Between those two, I am usually very sure of myself.
0.711100	I have taken several medical classes as well as have a degree in Psychology so I tend to understand what I'm being told pretty well.

0.588900	I feel that I have a decent ability to understand basic health information told to me. Sometimes I don't completely understand the meaning and have to ask questions to decide the appropriate decision to make.

0.916700	I believe i am capable of making all health care decision.
0.772200	I feel I definitely have the capacity. I just get nervous around doctors and nurses and forget to ask the relevant questions.
0.811100	I have strong capacity to understand what I'm being told, but I often lack the confidence to ask appropriate questions, thinking that they're either silly questions or that I already understand the information. More often than not, I'll think of a question as soon as I get in the car to get home. My mother worked in health care for a long time, so she is a valuable source of information for me if I need some help better understanding things. My wife is also there to answer questions and process information, though she is similar to me in that it takes some time to process questions.
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to understand and obtain all the necessary information and ask questions when needed. In previous medical encounters, I researched information using reliable sources and asked follow up questions to providers, which made me confident in my understanding. 
0.855600	I think I have near full capabilities because I actually work at a hospital. I work at psychiatric hospital so there are still medical concerns I do not understand when I have them myself.

0.900000	I fully have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I am educated, fully aware, and proactive in my health care.
0.788900	I trust doctors and nurses. I feel they will always give me the information that I need, and the only questions I might raise are in regard to how best to facilitate recovery, things like that. I don't *have* to know the ins and outs, and I would not presume to know more than a trained professiol.
0.616700	I think it is a low capacity- mainly because I am usually very intimidated and do not realize all the questions and confusion I have until after the doctor leaves. I don't feel confident enough to question them, or to disagree if I think they might be making incorrect assumptions. 
0.694400	I feel like sometimes I get a little overwhelmed and I either forget to ask pertinent questions or I don't quite understand what's happening, so I pick out the things I think are important and try to understand those. Sometimes this results in me missing important things.

0.644400	I do my best to answer the questions truthfully. So net Ines the questions are not clear. That's when I require clarification.

0.688900	We have access to so much information now it is overwhelming to determine which is accurate.  I can find information easily but I do not always know if it is correct.  I find it best to speak to someone in person or on the phone to get the most accurate information.

0.800000	I feel pretty competent in understanding basic health information and services. I make all of my health decisions on my own, and rarely need help. 
0.800000	I feel like I have enough knowledge about basic health situations to understand what my doctor is telling me. If I look confused when my doctor tells me something they will often explain what I need to know. I do not feel like I would understand things that are more uncommon like serious diseases or complicated insurance limitations.
0.916700	I am fully capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. The documentation is quite clear and easy to understand. The employees usually clarify what is unclear if there ever is a need.
0.711100	I find the information often complex and I have to read it several times.  I utilize my doctors, family and the internet to help me understand this information. 
0.794400	"I am the type of person that likes to know all the details about any given situation.  So when I am told I ""have something""  always ask a lot of questions and can find answers when needed.  I run into issues when I am told I have the symptoms of something but may not have it.  I have trouble understanding some of this info and how it relates to me: re how can we make this a known situation vs. a maybe.  So I can make decisions quite well when the information I have is concrete but have more issue when doctors start trying to diagnose me using exclusion tactics."
0.816700	I have the ability to understand all the information given to me by doctors and nurses.  Sometimes doctors do move quickly and so obtaining all the information can be tricky, I sometimes have to keep a running list in my head of things to circle back to and sometimes I forget before I have time to circle back to them.
0.900000	I feel that I have complete capacity to do the things listed above because I understand a lot of medical terminology as I lived with a doctor for several years. 
0.900000	I am fully capable to understand this information. I have a fairly clean health history. I usually only go to the doctor when something needs to be addressed.
0.838900	I feel I have the capacity to understand.  If anything is unclear, I ask for another explation to make sure I understand.
0.883300	I haven't encountered many serious health related issues in my life but I had an appendectomy at the age of 23 and I have had three kids so I have had some experience with hospitals.  Also, I have had one of my children be briefly hospitalized.  I felt like a competent adult in these situations.  I am an educated person with a law degree so my reading comprehension is good.  
0.900000	I feel that I can adequately process and understand anything that has to do with with my health. If I need help my daughter is a registered nurse and available to answer my questions. I also have a regular physician who is very good at listening and explaining health related issues.
0.916700	I have total capacity and understanding of health related matters and services and need no one to help me with making decisions. I am a fully functioning and sane adult that can make decisions for myself. 
0.661100	I do not have health insurance, therefore I have to go to a clinic in which I feel they do not give the care that is necessary. I try to ask the questions I need to but they are busy so they really just want you out the door. I don't have much of an idea how to get assistance.
0.916700	I have never had a problem with understanding and processing health information, so I am able to make appropriate decisions when it comes to my health.
0.916700	I believe I can understand the majority of health information to make decisions. I have a degree in Nursing so medical terminology is not confusing to me.
0.633300	I think I can figure it out. My sister is a nurse so I can ask her when I'm unclear about something and if she doesn't know she finds someone who does for me. 
0.916700	I am mentally healthy. I am able to understand or get information.
0.888900	I think with my background in exercise and fitness I know a lot of terms and what they mean so i am confident that I can understand basic health information
0.788900	I feel confident in my ability to understand most information presented, but I do sometimes avoid asking questions out of shyness and a fear of looking dumb. I do have friends I can ask though.
0.622200	I am somewhat confident in my abilities.  When I don't understand, I try to ask some questions.  If my questions remain unswered I will try to research online
0.916700	i am pretty confident I have complete capacity to understand all of the above.
0.872200	I consider myself to be an intelligent individual and I haven't had any trouble understanding any medical information I've been given. Things have been explained well enough for me to understand.
0.844400	I think this is an issue with non-tive speakers.  I also think uneducated folks may have issues.  Since I was born in the US and finished grad school, I feel pretty confident.
0.844400	I feel that I have the capacity to understand better than the average person, given my educatiol background. I have a masters degree in biochemistry and molecular biology so I think in a scientific way. I am also interested in the medical field and so I think that helps. 
0.916700	I feel I have full capacity to read basic health information because I am learned enough to understand it.
0.777800	I feel I can make basic decisions because I do not have a health background or a lot of medical problems.  A lot of confusion I have relates to the medical insurance and how and what to do to get coverage or obtain pre auth if needed.
0.805600	I feel that I am fully able to understand and process health information and services.  I make my own health decisions based on the information that I have obtained.  I use my doctor as a resource if I do not understand something.  I also ask for recommendations so that I am able to have a choice of what is going on with my health treatment.
0.550000	I think I have the capacity to understand medical information but much of it goes over my head and I would need to ask for help (after which I should retain that information)
0.888900	i feel my capacity for that is pretty good, because i went to college and i know how to understand concepts. also, i know how to google things i don't know.
0.844400	I think I have an above average ability to understand and process basic health information. This is due to my schooling in the biological sciences, in addition to my mother being a nurse with whom I may ask questions and have her explain the complex medical jargon that I may not understand. I also have the ability to google terms/conditions I do not know about and glean understanding about them from reputable sites.
0.900000	I think I am capable of making the decisions and asking the questions that I need to ask about medical subjects.
0.900000	I feel like I have the complete capacity to obtain any information I need. I feel this way because anytime I have had questions or issues I have always gotten an answer to my satifaction 
0.800000	I have a pretty good grasp of it.  If there's something I don't understand, I make sure to ask someone at the doctor's office before I leave, or I call later if I have a question.
0.916700	I am able to read material with no problem, and I always ask questions for clarification when talking with a nurse or doctor.
0.822200	I believe I can make appropriate health decision as well as most other people. I do my best to stay informed and do extra reading on the internet.
0.694400	I have ability to understand. Sometimes doctors make things seem complicated on purpose. I understand more easily by doing my own research. 
0.672200	I feel like once I listen to what my doctor or nurse tells me, I need a few minutes to process it and by that point, they have left and I have been pushed out of the room and I now have a million questions I wanted to ask. On my last doctor's visit I left feeling confused and I realized in the parking lot I had no idea what I was supposed to do after my blood work results were going to be messaged to me. I then contacted my doctor, she was uble to respond to me, so I talked to a nurse who read the results and scared me to death thinking I had a disease and then hours later my doctor messaged me saying it's no big deal. 
0.750000	Generally, I feel confident about my ability to obtain and process basic health info. It can be confusing when two different doctors say two different things or even say things in slightly different ways.  Everyone seems to have a different opinion and it can be difficult to ascertain what to follow.  I don't always understand why I am given the prescriptions I am given and if they are really necessary.  
0.838900	I think if the problems and information are simplified to a degree where it is easy enough to understand for someone who did not go to med school, I can understand pretty well all the information given to me. 
0.788900	I feel like I have a good capacity to do so. I fill out the doctor's forms when I go get a physical and I schedule a physical yearly. If anything came up on a physical I'm sure I'd be able to check it out.
0.872200	I don't have any real doubts about my ability to process basic health information. Obviously I'm not initially familiar with some of the terminology, etc, but the basic instructions are usually fine. The one area I'd say is a little confusing is hearing conflicting advice from different sources, but I guess that situation is present whenever you have professiols with differing opinions.
0.916700	I am able to completely understand written and spoken information regarding my health. I am fully able to make health decisions on my own. 
0.516700	I feel that my Docotor just fills out a prescription form and doesn't really invegistgate if the problem I have still exsists or not. He doesn't ask me questions and makes me feel uncomfortable asking him anything. 
0.833300	I think that I feel competent enough to ask questions, but sometimes I feel that I am wasting their time and I could go home and look online. However, if I did research prior to the doctor's visit, I would ask the doctor or nurse questions that I've had during my research.
0.855600	My vision, hearing and reading are excellent, so I feel I have no issue in getting the information. Occasiolly I might be unsure of a particular word that a doctor has said if it is the me of a condition or medication. Sometimes I will ask them to repeat it, and sometimes, if I don't think it's important to know the exact me, I won't ask. I normally feel comfortable asking any questions of my doctor that need clarification. And if I think of other questions afterward, sometimes I will call the office, or try to research the information online.
0.616700	I'm often times too shy to ask for help or further explation. However, I also feel that doctors and nurses have a tendency to rush things. I can barely even get my questions in because they just breeze through the appointment like they don't really want to be there or they have other things to be doing. I understand that they are busy, but this gets really frustrating as I almost always leave the office feeling as if there is more I need/want to know.
0.855600	I have a couple of doctors I see regularly and they usually explain things to me which I seem to understand. But sometimes after I leave and get home I question some of the information because it can be overwhelming. 
0.705600	I can understand most basic health information. The more complicated manners I sometimes need some assistance in explaining what the condition is, side effects, and possible treatments.
0.916700	I believe I have this capacity to a high degree. I am a high level reader and can understand information that is directed toward me, whether through reading or listening. I am also willing to ask any questions that will address any issues I am not clear on. 
0.800000	I feel I can handle most things. If I don't understand something, I will ask the doctor or nurse until I figure out what is necessary.
0.900000	I have had a lot of experience with hospital/medical documents so other than medical terms, I feel confident in determining what those documents say. I occasiolly run some medical terminology past a friend who is trained in the medical field but rarely. 
0.738900	I feel alone what confident in knowing medical conditions but sometimes what is explained still doesn't make sense. Also I think of questions to ask after the appointment is already over. Sometimes I feel like doctors make up explations and doing really look into what is going on.
0.544400	Oftentimes information concerning my health can get a bit complex, and I occasiolly need aid from a professiol health professiol to decipher certain things regarding the information.
0.811100	Because both my kids have had surgeries, one has food allergies and my consulting business often works with doctors, I am comfortable asking questions and feeling like I understand the whole picture by the time the office visit is over. I also worked in rehab facilities and was in charge of insurance several years ago, so official forms don't confuse me at all.
0.883300	Fot the most part. I try to ask the right questions in the room but sometimes find myself having to do my own research online when I get home
0.616700	For the most part, however, sometimes I am not really sure of what they are trying to convey. I usually have my daughter with me so she can ask questions I am not thinking of.
0.711100	I know that I have the capacity to understand basic health information. Sometimes I just need a little bit of help to understand medical terminology.
0.655600	I feel my understanding is average. I can understand some things but most need assistance from someone who understands more. I usually prefer an expert in the field to get my info.
0.833300	I feel I have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.861100	Full capacity to understand most anything presented to me. 
0.816700	I feel like I have most of the information I need. I can usually find more specific information, or explations in layman's terms, regarding my health information online. If not, I can always ask my doctor, who is very helpful. If my doctor is not available, sometimes I'll call my sister, who is a nurse and can often explain things better to me.l
0.916700	I do feel that I can fill out any forms regarding health and ask doctors/nurses to explain health information so that I completely understand and am able to make decisions.
0.572200	I am somewhat in the middle. I think my problem is I don't know how to ask the right question and don't know how to process the information correctly. I think I should be more active in asking questions. Usually the visits are less than 10-20 minutes and I forget to ask every important question.
0.822200	I feel confident about my ability to ask and answer questions about my health as well as the health of my child. If i don't understand something, I usually ask for it to be explained again or a different way.
0.672200	I believe that I can understand the basic health information. Although, I do have to ask questions to clarify details. In my experience, medical professiols, such as nurses and doctors, talk over my head. I am more confident in asking questions about things I don't understand, as I get older.
0.772200	I usually am able to follow what I am being told in regards to the medical information given to me, however, there have been times when I needed more information and did not ask for it. I would get flustered by them trying to hurry me up or hurry me out of the office that I forget what I wanted or needed to ask. 
0.600000	I feel that I have a basic ability to obtain and process basic health information. At times I need help reading about conditions or help explaining what medications that I am on. But when I have a question or need assistance I always find the help that I need from my family.
0.811100	I think I've very capable of understanding basic health information. I can read just fine, and have a good understanding of most medical terms, unless it's something very abstract and rare. I ask questions when I think it's needed, and understand the answers given just fine. Between my understanding of things and other explations given (if needed), I feel I make good health decisions for myself.
0.733300	The Internet is full of useful information. There are plenty of official medical sites to read through if I don't get all the information I need from a medical professiol. But, honestly, I haven't even had a cold or flu in the 14 years I've been a vegan, so I don't go to the doctor. I'm a very healthy person.
0.772200	While I do believe I can read all the information given to me by medical professiols, It is sometimes difficult to understand exactly what they mean. I also don't know if I'm asking the right questions or what to even ask when I am given new information. 
0.688900	Once I receive all of the information, I am usually able to understand it. Most of my problems come from understanding the fincial parts of my condition. Also my condition affects everyone differently, so that always causes distress.
0.750000	I have a good capacity to do all that because I have done it in the past and plan on in the future.
0.805600	I understand basic heath information as I have had issues before and make sure I know and understand what I need to know.
0.916700	Its very easy. All you have to do is ask and they will answer. You can also go online and find anything that you need to know. Getting information is very easy.
0.844400	I feel that I have a moderate capacity to obtain, process and understand this information. It's easy to understand information about simple concerns -- like if I go to the doctor with an infection, and she diagnoses it and sends me home with a prescription for antibiotics, that's easy. No problem. But when I get into harder-to-diagnose issues (like the vertigo I've had for more than a decade), doctors tend to under-explain things and make a lot of assumptions that can make it hard to get useful information from them. My vertigo was never diagnosed by my then-doctor despite him running a bunch of tests I couldn't afford that all came back fine; I filly figured out the issue for myself (badly-adjusted new glasses that caused chronic eyestrain I still struggle with). Doctors also tend to brush off my concerns because I'm overweight, even when my concerns have nothing to do with my weight. Behavior like that from professiols can make it difficult and intimidating to make the right decisions for myself.
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to read, comprehend and understand not just basic but most or all health information I read. I'm fully capable of making appropriate health decisions concerning myself and also my family.
0.916700	I feel completely capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed.
0.838900	I feel like I am very capable of understanding basic health information. I am a smart person so I am able to understand things that doctors tell me as long as they keep it relatively simple. I am also able to do some research on issues if I need more information to make a fil decision. 
0.727800	I feel that I can obtain and process all the basic health information that I need. I have a very general understanding of what most medical and health information means. As long as it isn't something too complicated, I can understand it very well.
0.888900	I feel that I have the capacity to understand obtain, process, and understand basic health information relatively fully. I have no issues understanding written or spoken word regarding my health decisions.
0.777800	Sometimes my doctor will just scratch the surface when he explains things to me. He will avoid going into detail on what can happen if a test comes back a certain way.
0.866700	I have no problem asking questions, and I have asked doctors to explain in layman's terms.  I also go online a lot to look up information.  I prefer it coming from the doctor though.  I also have a brother who is a doctor and a sister in law who is a nurse.  I have asked them questions before.
0.883300	I can research terms or definitions online.  I am well educated and I am not intimidated by medical professiols.
0.900000	I can understand the medical forms and processes quite well. I can also process the information given to me by my physician. 
0.833300	I feel like i do have the need to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Because I know the questions to ask when i need information and am not afraid to ask anything like if i dont understand to have them explain it again
0.750000	I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I do try to research medications (if needed) so I may ask appropriate questions to my medical doctor and or pharmacist. 
0.855600	Although I am not a tive english speaker, I've been here since I was 5, so my English is pretty good. I watch a lot of medical documentaries and I am familiar with a lot of the equipment and procedures that some doctors go through, so I am very confident making medical decisions for the most part. If not, I can always go online and Google things. I am pretty tech savvy and know where to get my information from.
0.844400	English is my tive language so I understand the forms I'm filling out and the conversations I'm having with my doctors.  I'm also relatively young, and do not have dimentia or other type of mental processing blocks.  
0.833300	I feel that I have a high capacity to understand, obtain and process basic health information because I have a high understanding of the basic physiological systems in the human body. I have a degree in biochemistry and have a high understanding of the human body from a chemical standpoint. 
0.633300	I am pretty confident in my ability to comprehend medical information when it comes to conditions and medications and things like that. However, if it involves hospital procedures or insurance or technical information like that, I need either assistance or to read up information from several sources in order to make sure I actually understand what I'm reading.
0.883300	I think I am fully capable of understanding and obtaining my basic health information. I am also fully capable of making decisions about treatment for any health problem.
0.916700	I feel that I have no issues understanding health information and services. If I feel that the doctor is rushed or otherwise not totally available, I feel comfortable researching online to resolve any questions.
0.916700	i feel good about being able to find out the information i need
0.605600	At the present time, when people need medical health they don't worry about understanding the information that is provided to them. They usually focus on getting healthier and resolving their matter.Each person should have a basic understanding of their health information and services that are provided to them in order to make their long term decision. 
0.800000	I find it very easy to get the information I need. I can understand and process it well. If there is anything difficult to understand or I need help with, I will ask.
0.855600	Having a science background, I feel that I am quite capable of understanding health information given to me by a doctor. I am also very good about researching and asking questions if I do not understand at first hand.
0.916700	I feel very comfortable understand basic health information. My health literacy is high due to my educatiol background and previous work experience. 
0.888900	I have no problem in regards to information about my help. Anything that I don't immediately understand I can look up on the internet or ask my doctor.
0.805600	I think that I can understand basic health information.  If I don't understand something, I usuallyl ask.  Although sometimes its hard to keep up with everything the doctor or person on the phone is saying   
0.866700	I have a decent general knowledge about health and medical terminology. I'm kind of science oriented anyway, and am very curious. I am confident in my ability to research terms and procedures and know which sites to trust and which to make sure to find corroborating information as there is a lot of bad info out there too.
0.883300	I think I am able to obtain almost enough information needed. I can always call my doctor back and she will answer any questions I have or may have forgotten at the time. I feel like any information I may need I can get from someone or other sources.
0.655600	I think I could make my own health decisions 
0.900000	I am educated and somewhat experienced in health information. I believe I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand what I need to know from any health care provider, having done so in the past with success. 
0.844400	i feel like i have the tools to process basic medical knowledge without any real help. Unless the medical problem is super specific to things i know nothing about.
0.788900	I feel adequate to understanding basic health information. I usually search my condition on Google to get a general idea and I use that general idea to ask my doctor for confirmation or for more detail.
0.666700	i always ask questions and i am very vocal and proactive about my healthcare. i want to know every option i have and a full diagnosis and outcome .i watch and observe everything that goes on during my treatment.
0.655600	well i think i understand most of what the doctor says.Sometimes i have to ask in more detail like break it down a bit.
0.605600	I've had some major, very rare medical problems in the very recent past that I had trouble with. Their rarity of the conditions hindered me, I think I can do the basic things health wise pretty easily though. 
0.888900	The knowledge one needs to be able to process the information  gathered is taught at the most basic levels of education, so when it come to being able to process said information, I never have an issue with it. 
0.916700	I have no problems reading or understanding english so i can read and understand the materials im given just fine. If there is something i have never heard before i just google it since you know we all have smart phones. I tell my doctors the truth even when im worried they will disapprove to i know all of my tests and things are accurate when i get the results
0.900000	Whenever I have a doctor's appointment, I always have questions written down in advance of my appointment that I will need to discuss with my doctor. When the doctor is explaining anything to me, I will make certain that I understand exactly what they are saying, and will ask whatever question(s) I need to ask in order to understand everything.
0.672200	I feel like I have the capacity to do all of the things listed. My biggest problem is remembering the specifics of what is told to me. I need to take notes to keep track of everything that is told to me.

0.872200	I will always be slightly unsure, and will always go talk to a friend for their opinion, but I feel like I can get the general gist of it. I am very confident that I would understand 90% of it and make decisions based off that. My biggest issue is I don't like making decisions in general.
0.872200	I am capable of understanding most medical information whether it is by reading or listening to a professiol.  I am confident that I understand what I am told and most remember to ask the important questions.
0.694400	I think I can understand mostly everything. However sometimes medicine information can come off as hard to understand in which case I will ask a doctor or nurse for more information on it. Sometimes doctors and nurses seem annoyed by questions. However I think they should never be annoyed because it's their job to inform us on this kind of information. Overall, I understand most of it but I wish when I didn't nurses and doctors wouldn't act so annoyed like I'm wasting their time with questions.
0.672200	I think I have a normal capacity to obtain and process the basics of the health information that I get from my health care workers.

0.861100	I'm getting old but am cognizant enough to understand almost any verbal or written instructions. Insurance forms are a little bit harder but I can figure those out.  Hospital bills aren't too easy either.
0.744400	i think that i am ok at understanding medical jargon.  even if i can't, i can at least usually pick up the general instructions about preventive care, or what i need to be doing. i usually err on the side of caution.

0.722200	Because I am able to fill out official documents and understand for the most part what a doctor is trying to communicate with me, I feel I am decently capable of making these decisions. I do, however, believe that it is hard to ask doctors the right questions, and understand why they are giving you the information that they are.
0.800000	When I need to talk to the doctor and/or nurse, I leave my pride behind (at least when it comes to my health). If I don't understand something, I just ask them to tell me again like i'm 4.

0.772200	I believe I can alyze and weigh decisions about my health information.  I have the basic understanding of things related to it.
0.722200	I think I am mostly fine to understand and obtain the materials from my doctor office, anyway sometimes I am not sure some process like the billing system
0.738900	I do not often have to read, fill out or ask about medical conditions. However, in the limited experience I have, my physicians, doctors, and nurses have been very informative and helpful, and  I am usually able to fill out any forms I need to with no problems.
0.916700	I was in the health care field for about 7 years. I understand the need for transparency with the doctors. Also, I am sickly, so I fill out paperwork regularly. i see no point in making the medical staff work harder, so I am very forthcoming, and ask lots of questions if something kind of confuses me.
0.811100	I feel very qualified to do this as I was the caregiver for two termil parents and, due to the urgency and obvious passiote interest in their welfare, made a concerted effort to become highly involved in their medical care and procedures. Taking care of someone you love who is ill is like taking a crash course in medicine. And out of necessity, I developed the necessary courage and stami to talk to health care professiols irregardless of their taciturn or uncooperative tures.
0.872200	I am an educated person that reads and has a high comprehension level.I do not believe that I have begun to experience Alzheimer's, yet.  When I do not understand a topic by my PCP and Cardiologist, I ask them to explain their thought processes to me, and they are always glad to share their knowledge with me.  
0.711100	I feel that I have the capacity almost entirely. Everythime I have gone to the Doctor I have left feeling confident that I understood what was going on.
0.872200	I feel like I have the means necessary to understand basic health info. I have a background in health services so I feel I am slightly above the curve. I also have a group of friends who are involved in the medical community that I can ask questions if I need to.
0.694400	I feel that it is very important to provide the dr with as much information as possible so the can effectively diagnos you issue correctlyrics.  I also think it is important to ask questions so I can understand what my issue may be
0.916700	A very high degree. I'm a college graduate with a degree in jourlism. Not sure what else to say.
0.866700	I am able to do all that stuff sufficiently.  I do have tremors in my right hand so at times I do ask for help writing stuff.  But all in all I have sufficient amount of help and understanding.
0.827800	I do not think that I have any issues obtaining, processing or understanding basic health information and services.
0.850000	Yes, I believe I can understand basic health information and make good decisions about them. I search google for information on things I don't understand. It's pretty easy to clarify things through asking dr./nurse questions and the use of google.
0.833300	i have a great capacity for asking and understanding questions and answers i might have for medical information from a dr. i usually google everything first. so i basically know what i have, i tell him. he checks says yup your right. i always carry a list of notes if i need to, like for more complicated situations  
0.888900	I am able to read and understand my medical information.  I can listen to the Doctors and comprehend and set up follow up care. I someitmes forget to mention everything that I am supposed to about my condition to them 
0.872200	I have a large capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information when making health-related decisions. I am highly educated. I do find it more difficult to understand more advanced information such as articles from medical jourls (occasiolly provided by my doctor) mostly due to the industry specific language that I am unfamiliar with. 
0.800000	I regularly research online about health problems and conditions so I am fairly knowledgeable on these matters and feel confident in my ability and capacity to obtain, process, and understand this info.
0.716700	I feel I have a good understanding of health information and typically don't require assistance to understand 
0.916700	I guess I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision. First, I had MA, so I guess I'm well educated. Second, I have some experience to read and understand such materials. Third, I can fin any information I need in Internet.
0.855600	I have plenty of access to medical professiols and trusted advisors to obtain, process and understand basic health information as needed. 
0.794400	I feel that I have a basic understanding of health information. This, in turn, means I am able to understand basic health information. Because of this, I feel that I have the capacity to understand what I am told by doctors and what is written in medical forms.
0.511100	my mom is a nurse and i grew up with her talking about medical stuff and I was never able to have it all click in my mind.  I don't have the capacity to obtain, process and understand it.  Its like when people talk medical my brain shuts down.  I let my husband explain it to me...or my mom or my niece who is also a nurse
0.677800	I feel like I understand stuff about my own health when it's explained to me. I mostly just have issues understanding health insurance. I think they make it complicated on purpose.
0.866700	I think most of the time, I can handle the information. If I am very ill, or uncomfortable, that affects how much attention I can pay to new medical information.I have, in the past, had doctors repeat things as many times as I needed fr me to understand.
0.788900	I feel as though I have the capacity to obtain information, but the part where I may need help most is interpreting the information in a way that I understand it. A medical diagnosis is great, but unless my doctor can explain it to me in a way that I can understand, and also understand everything that accompanies it, then the diagnosis itself is useless to me. In my current health care system, if you speak to enough people, eventually you will be directed to the person who can help answer your question. 
0.777800	I feel I have a good capacity to understand basic health information.  I have had a preexisting condition my entire life and need to be able to understand this type of information.
0.761100	For the most part, I think I can understand most of the information.  If I have any questions, I do ask my doctor or after I can call her or one of the nurses in the office. They will always help me. 
0.883300	In the past I have always been able to understand the information that I have been given relating to my medical concerns. I have made good enough decisions and have not had any problems due to my reading comprehension.
0.838900	I have a lifetime experience of dealing with a variety of medical problems. I feel confident in my general knowledge. I come across things I do not understand sometimes. I am not a medical professiol so I expect to be confused sometimes.
0.900000	Yes I asked the necessary questions if there's anything I don't understand
0.916700	"Most of the health information I have had to deal with has been very well explained to me, and I don't mind asking followup questions.  The doctor's are the experts after all.  One of my favorite quotes/phrases to use is ""Help me understand.""  When I am truly confused or stuck with something, that is what I go to, and I let the doctor know that they can break it down and treat it as if they are telling a five year old.  Most of it I understand, but don't mind letting them know I may have follow up questions."
0.561100	I feel like I'm literate and competent enough to understand things, but I often lack sufficient information because I have too little time face-to-face with a doctor, nurse, or tech.  I feel rushed along and don't feel like it's ok  to ask many questions or to provide very detailed information.
0.638900	It depends on the condition. For instance when I have a cold, medical care is easier to understand than when I am being seen for my thyroid.
0.900000	I believe I can make appropriate health choices. I have worked in healthcare for the last four years, and I actually do administrative work where I review health information forms. I am confident that I understand what I am filling out on my persol health forms.
0.888900	I have good health insurance and therefore have access to the professiol opinions I need to make a decision about my health. I am a young, intelligent professiol and I am able to take the information provided by health care professiols and make the best decision. 
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and understand the basic health information that I need.  I can easily understand the decisions I need to make.  I have infrequently gone online to get extra clarity when needed.
0.794400	I do feel that I can understand most of what is explained to me.  If not, I feel confident that I can find a doctor or nurse to explain what I don't understand.  I can also research issues myself on the internet.
0.916700	I fully understand what they tell me and I ask a lot of questions if it is unclear. I will also do significant research on the internet about any medical condition or procedure I may have.
0.844400	I feel confident with obtaining and understanding health information. I have been a caregiver of someone with cancer as well, so I got quite a bit of practice doing so as asking questions was very important. 
0.750000	When it comes to health, I have the capacity to understand basic health information. I also have the capacity to make appropriate decisions based on what I need to do. If I have questions or concerns I feel that I can ask them.
0.705600	Medical information can be overwhelming, especially when you receive less than positive news. I have a hard time digesting all the information given by doctors and medical professiols and wish there was a better way to capture this info so I could better research at home.
0.677800	I think i do ok with everything . But there are times i need help 
0.733300	I think I am very capable in understanding health information.
0.722200	Im open minded, and feel the need to question things, so I think I can usually dig as deep as i need to
0.794400	I feel confident that I am able to comprehend health information provided by my doctors. If there is anything I don't understand, I feel comfortable asking my healthcare providers for an explation. Availability and ease of communication is one of the things I look for when choosing a doctor. 
0.705600	I can understand basic health information if I have the time to research it, but I often feel that they're rushed and would rather not go into it so I don't ask them. Only in rare cases where it's very important do I ask for clarification then and there.
0.672200	I believe I have the full capacity, I know how to use the internet very well and I have a big hospital 5min away from where I currently live where I can obtain information
0.622200	I work at a hospital so I feel like I kind of get it, but when it comes to major issues I still feel confused when getting the information told to me. I don't think that it is due to stupidity as much as it is due to being confused on what to do. You feel trapped with one real choice and in many cases you want more options to choose from. 
0.677800	I feel like I can understand a lot of things and that I have gotten better at asking questions. However, I am bad at asking questions when they are about a new topic. For example, if I made an appointment to talk about issue A, but I also have issue B, I will only talk about issue A. I also do not understand health insurance information well.
0.666700	I think I may not understand everything on forms or what a doctor says, but I try to ask questions if I don't understand. I don't mind asking questions to understand better. I want to understand and will ask. 
0.916700	I have excellent knowledge of the healthcare field.  I am the person to go to when you need help understanding anything involving health.  I am not a Dr. or nurse. 
0.794400	To a good extent. Sometimes the questions on the forms are a bit confusing and it's hard to put down an answer.  They are also repetitive. I am able to ask the doctor questions about information given to me, but often questions do not come up until after the visit. 
0.883300	I have no trouble obtaining and understanding health information, generally. The exception to that is if a doctor starts rattling off scientific medical terminology that I'm not familiar with, or if they reference drug mes I don't know. Reading material isn't an issue because I can always look something up if I don't understand it.
0.733300	I understand written and spoken English very well, but when I encounter a field-specific jargon I am not familiar with it can become difficult. I don't feel like being that tedious patient who wants every word defined like a verbal test from their college days. I do, however, ask for more information when I feel their explation is based on the assumption that I already know something. 
0.916700	I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information about myself and what services I would need to make well thought out, appropriate health decisions for the better of myself. 
0.583300	I know enough to stay healthy by myself most of the time. But I sometimes take medicine. I feel like I'll have to think more about it when I am old.
0.800000	yes I can if it is in plain english often there is to much medical jargon mixed in and it can be confusing such as diagnosis etc
0.916700	I am confident in my capacity to effectively obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  
0.505600	I have problems thinking of a Way to ask the doctor what I need to know. I have a hard time ezpressi g myself in that manner. I also think doctors give me information to quickly for me to process it. I feel rushed when I'm with a doctor and I don't think the exlain everything thouroghly.
0.672200	i think i am okay at it, but i do not always understand some of the big words.
0.883300	I feel that the doctors who I go to are very informative and have provided me with both the pros and cons of the treatments they recommend. They usually also provide me with an adequate understanding of consequences that come with the treatment.
0.794400	I usually try to understand most of the basic things about my condition or diagnosis. I will ask some questions occasiolly. But sometimes if the doctor or nurse seems to be in a hurry, I won't ask everything that I really want to know and end up looking things up on the internet.
0.611100	First and foremost I have the internet to use when I have a health concern or question.  I will turn to the internet from the start since WebMD and other sites are a great resource to use for general information.  From there, if I visit the doctor I can ask the doctor or nurses questions.  I can also pick up literature in their offices for more information.  I have also been known to consult with friends and family members for advice and information on my health situations.
0.833300	When given when told about a condition or issue the doctors and nurses give me all the needed information and if I need more I will ask for it in writing or do further research on my own.
0.872200	Due to my employment in health care, I feel that I have a decent grasp of medical terminology and pathology. I usually understand what a doctor or nurse is explaining, and if I don't I feel very comfortable asking questions. However, I do also feel somewhat complacent when being treated and tend to trust what they are doing and not question their decisions.
0.916700	I have no problem understanding written information or directions. I have never had a doctor (or nurse) use terminology I didn't explain--at least not without explaining what it means.  I am capable of calling my medical provider to ask follow up questions if I need to, and have done so.
0.850000	Somewhat a little from a doctor. I recently went to see a doctor and their diagnosed wasn't very helpful. They spent less than 5 minutes for a $100 charge. 
0.655600	I think I understand written information much better than what a practitioner says to me. I miss SO much when I'm at a doctor's appointment - I forget what I'm told and forget what questions I wanted to ask, even when they're written down.
0.916700	I am very health conscious, and I am very pro-active about health-related topics. I know a lot of terminology, and I usually have a higher understanding of the information on the forms and on health topics than the nurses. I often have a higher understanding than the doctors on the topics as they relate to lifestyle choices (i.e., food), and have a reasoble level of knowledge about how the various systems in the body work. I am able to understand what the doctor tells me, and I know what I don't know, so I can ask questions on the fly and often come prepared with questions. I usually know enough to begin with to understand the answers, but I certainly don't mind clarifying questions. 
0.855600	If I do have any questions about the information I make sure to ask until I do understand the material.  Otherwise I read over the material and look at it closely until I understand what it says if I did not the first time I read it over.
0.716700	I have the capacity to understand and process basic health information. I typically understand whatever doctors tell me when I or my children are sick, need medications or surgeries.
0.716700	I am fairly intelligent about certain things, but i could use more help understanding medical info.  I am not comfortable filling out forms for medical purposes.
0.761100	I would say I am able to understand these things the same as anyone else, there is people doing their jobs all over so plenty of people to talk to.
0.844400	I feel that I'm knowledgeable to understand and talk about ay medical issue that I may have efficiently.
0.711100	I feel that when I have the opportunity, I am able to ask relevant medical questions and to assert myself if I feel that there is a mistaken diagnosis or if I am not well understood by my physician.
0.872200	I have a high level of reading comprehension so I am very confident that I can understand any information that is given to me.
0.694400	I have a good ability to understand basic health information. But there are times that I do have a little trouble that is when I will ask the doctor to explain and help me. They usually do as long as they are a good doctors tho I've had a bad one or 2 and if that happens I find a new one.
0.855600	I feel that I have all the ability I need to do this. I am able to go to doctors offices, fill out the forms and ask the quesitions that need to be asked by myself. I understand the things that they tell me, but if I don't I make sure I ask questions until I do.
0.605600	I can find a good amount of the information I need regarding basic health information and services, though there are times when I am not able to find it. There was once a time when I needed information on why I was bleeding in between periods and to an extent it was helpful but then there was contradictory information and some information was unclear. I ended up asking my doctor directly and he explained it just fine. There was another time I needed to find out if my insurance covers a test I needed and no one could tell me. I called the health insurance company, I am not kidding, they did not know the answer. But for the most part, it's easy to obtain most answers to my health questions and to understand what I am being told.
0.816700	I definitely have the capacity to obtain,process,and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am of sound body and mind. I've never had any problems understanding and health related issues and services. I always ask questions if I don't understand all the information 
0.916700	I have high capacity to understand basic health information.  I am well read and know a lot of medical terms and how related things work.
0.827800	I do have some background (college, scribe/EMT experience) in medical language and knowledge that helps me understand at least the basics of conditions that may affect me. Likewise, I feel like I am able to critically read relevant informatiol materials and interact with health professiols to address unswered questions.
0.883300	I think I do. I think I can understand and obtain basic health information. It's not too much of a problem.
0.861100	I have the capacity to make health decisions.  I have some medical background and I am very good a research if I have questions that come up later.
0.888900	I feel my ability to read and process issues concerning my health are better than average as I once started school to become a nurse. 
0.772200	i feel i understand most of what  i need to. i know i can look things up that confuse me. still there are some things that seem a bit beyond my understanding but most things i can understand.
0.855600	I'm told I ask many questions.  I research the internet and I always ask questions.  
0.883300	i can read, if i dont understand i always ask for more information
0.850000	I have always filled out my own medical forms and the forms for my children when they were younger. I have been making insurance claims for well over 40 years as well. Yes, there are some medical terms that I don't initially understand but I'm the one paying for the medical service so I make sure to be assertive when I have to to get the information I need.
0.783300	I feel even though my mom never took me to doctors, unless the schools made her, that I have a fair understanding of medical information. This is partially because health classes in school and getting pregnt as a teeger. When I was pregnt I did all the doctor stuff alone. Plus in my crappy college I took atomy and microbiology. 
0.866700	I fell I have a high capacity to obtain and understand health information and services. If there is something I do not understand , I have no problem speaking up and asking for an explation . I feel that most people do not understand everything they are told when seeking medical advice and that medical professiols are happy to explain it when asked. 
0.694400	I feel that I am capable fo understanding most of what medical professiols tell me. Sometimes, though I feel they do not speak in layman's terms. If they did, it would make me feel better.
0.883300	I feel my capacity is fine - I'm fortute enough to have a lot of formal education including a background in biological science, so it's not a problem for me generally. Also, my father has had serious health problems most of my life, and I've spent a lot of time in hospitals and dealing with cardiology/diabetic/etc terms - I'm more familiar with them than I would like. 
0.872200	I believe that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services.  I have a strong education with strength in math and sciences and I believe that this helps me to better understand.   In addition, my spouse is a DVM, so I am exposed to a lot of daily discussions regarding health and medicine.
0.866700	Some complex medical jargon can be difficult to interpret for someone outside the business, but overall I'm very confident I can understand what's relayed to me, especially if I'm able to ask for clarification in layman's terms. 
0.661100	At times I feel that the abbreviations on medical forms are what really mess me up.  Sometimes it takes time to really evaluate what the abbreviations mean, but I usually have the ability to figure it out, if not as my mother who works in the medical field.
0.761100	I feel I have a pretty decent understanding of most health information and services. More complicated services, insurance, and health information I may need to ask someone who I know is more familiar with health services. But the basics I understand pretty well.
0.777800	I feel somewhat confident that I can understand health information and make the necessary decisions to live my life healthier. As long as something is thoroughly explained, I can usually do a pretty good job of retaining that information and applying it to my life.
0.655600	I feel that I have an average capacity. My dad was a pharmacist so growing up I could easily go to him with any health issues or questions and he always had an answer or directed me where I needed to go for the answer. Because of that I feel I have a strong knowledge of how to understand basic health information. I struggle a but with services needed to make appropriate health decisions because I hate going to the doctor. I avoid it at all costs so in that area I have little capacity for obtaining services and health information.
0.761100	i have a high capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. i have been visiting medical professiols for decades and have always asked questions whenever the initial explations needed more clarifications. i have no issues in doing so until i can understand what is going on.
0.766700	I feel like I can process and understand basic health information enough to make medical decisions for myself and my family. And if there is something I am unclear on I always ask.

0.683300	I think I have a decent understanding. I think it's hard for a lot of people.

0.822200	I feel like I have the basic understanding that is needed when seeking health attention or to make health decisions. I make sure I ask all the appropriate questions and if there is something I am not sure about I will see out additiol information from health care providers to make sure that I understand it.
0.844400	I am knowledgeable in the terms and words used so I can answer and understand what they ask or am able to comprehend the material. The doctors and nurses usually let me know of the situation in an easy to understand fashion so I am not confused. 
0.822200	I think I am able to understand basic health information I took some classes in college so I know basic medical terminology. My mother is a nurse so if don't understand something my mother can usually describe it for me so that I understand. 
0.816700	I feel very comfortable with the skills above. Also I am experienced in researching diverse topics on the internet for a better background knowledge.
0.811100	I feel hat I have adequate capacity because I ask enough questions.  I feel that I am able to get the information I need because I do not let the practitioner be in charge.

0.777800	I feel like I have the tools available to understand what I need to know, however those tools are not always connected. For instance, when I am with the dr. I do not always think of the question I need to ask. When the dr gives me information to read at home, the questions prompted would be better asked in the office. When I look up information on-line, I rarely print the information to take in and discuss. 
0.916700	I feel like I have a good understanding of health and health related issues due to my college education which required me to take many classes in biology and other sciences, including atomy and medical terminology. I also feel I am able to obtain and discern the legitimacy of medical information that I find online. I also know where to find a doctor when I need one and what issues I should address when there. 
0.811100	I have a relatively high level of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. When I don't understand something it's usually because I didn't ask my health care provider.

0.805600	I just do
0.883300	I believe I do have enough knowledge to make those kinds of decisions.  If I feel confused, I will ask a doctor or nurse. In addition, I will often look up information on the internet as other sources will have a different way of explaining things.

0.944400	I am capable of getting the information I need, and I understand what I read.  I am a retired lawyer, a Mensan with a law degree and an MBA.

0.600000	I feel I have a pretty strong capacity to obtain, process and understand health info and services. There is usually some doubt, however, and that is why I like to have someone help me just to make sure I am making the correct decisions.
0.888900	I have a degree in zoology and have always been interested in medicine and health. I've read extensively, going back to before the Internet was a thing. And I'm a very good researcher.
0.672200	I would say that for the most part I do have all the information, tools available to myself when I need them or need an explation of something. My current doctor is very caring and explains things well! He even tells me to ask questions at all times if I have them. When it comes to filling out a form and I do not have confidence I can always ask him or the staff for help.
0.900000	I have a good capacity to make appropriate health decisions. I have no cognitive disabilities. I worked in healthcare for 25 years so have a good understanding of the lexicon. My knowledge is somewhat dated so I do have to rely on my provider to give me the most up to date info.
0.811100	I was a medic on the FD for 29 years, so I feel like I have at least the basic knowledge to ask the right questions to look after my health. My girlfriend is a pediatric anesthesiologist, so I have a good resource at home to help with difficult questions.

0.700000	I feel that I am very able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services.  What I have trouble with, is when I read the possible side effects or health risks for medication I am prescribed, I can't tell if it's worth the risk or not.  This is bothersome, and there seems to be no clear way to know - it's like you take your chances when you take a drug, that you will not be one of the ones who has a side effect (some side effects are minimal, but others are very serious - like death!).  I wish there was a better way to assess the risk/benefit of taking drugs.  Also, I am very capable when I am well to make decisions regarding my health, but if I was very sick, I would probably want to make sure I had someone with me who was not sick to help me process information correctly...

0.633300	I think i have a reasobly good capacity to understand and process health service information. I might need some help with certain things when plain language isn't used, or when my anxiety disorder cripples me to the point that I have trouble processing information, but during those times I have either my mother or the internet to consult for help.

0.883300	I feel that I am very able to understand and make basic health decisions regarding my own health.

0.683300	There are times where I am unsure of exactly what the forms are asking. I feel like doctors talk too fast at times trying to explain and then rush out to the next patient. I have a general understanding and feel like I can figure out how to get health information or assertive enough to ask for help.

0.566700	I feel i am confident to fill out the documents myself, It just seems there is alot of red tape in filling out all of these forms.

0.716700	I feel that I have the capacity to understand the information but sometimes there is too much of it. The insurance process can get overwhelming and often deters me from seeking medical assistance.
0.827800	I can understand at the moment, but after getting home I do sometimes have trouble retaining what was said.
0.650000	I usually understand most health information given to me. Some doctors try to give you the information fast and that can hard to comprehend.
0.850000	As a registered nurse I feel very confident in my capacity. I have also had positions that required me to break down information to teach patients/members. 
0.788900	I feel like I have a pretty good idea of how to obtain health information. If I do not understand something, I am confident in the doctors abilities to help me understand the condition. In addition, I also am confident in the questions I would have for the condition. And if I forget to ask something or think of additiol questions later, I can always contact my doctor. Having all that available information and understanding my circumstances, I feel like I am very capable of making the appropriate health decisions. 
0.777800	As someone with an interest in health, I can understand and process basic information. However, health is rarely basic. Therefore, I sometimes need help from professiols to understand. With a basic understanding of the more easily understandable concepts, I am more prepared to tackle the difficult scerios. 
0.872200	I feel I am capable due to life experience as well as a background in medical processes through the military, family experience and my significant other is a RN at a major hospital in a major city so though these experiences, i believe I am quite capable of understanding basic medical terminology and processes that go with them. 
0.627800	I feel like it's a 50/50 chance I'd be able to do it on my own. The issues I tend to have is I either don't know exactly who to talk to or how to get to the person I need to talk to you.
0.883300	Yes, I believe I can. I am able to process almost all of the information I am given in health situations, and I have people I can ask if there is something I don't understand. I regularly call my insurance company with questions about coverage, and I am comfortable speaking to my doctor about more persol issues. When I have general medical questions, I also sometimes call my brother, who is an internist.
0.655600	I always question everything, i do this so that i can learn. Whether it is about a recipe or a law or my own health care. I get the information from the doctor and than will do my own research. I research every pill that is given me because i want to know exactly what i'm taking and the effects from it.
0.916700	I have a pretty good understanding of the human atomy and have quite a few health complications that have required emergency medical services. Over time I've just read up about more and more just so I didn't feel stupid at the hospital or doctors. 
0.827800	I think that I am able to understand my medical issues more because I have studied biological sciences in college. However, I feel that doctors and nurses tend to only give one option for the issue and do not give further information about altertive treatments. I would have a difficult time making the decisions if I do not have this information.
0.794400	I'm a smart enough person. I'm well educated and well read. I can usually understand most of the materials that I am given. When I can't, I have no fear of asking my doctor or nurse or pharmacist for help.

0.883300	I am cogent enough and doctor savvy enough to get the information I need and ask the questions I need to ask so that I have a full understanding of any procedure and process 
0.916700	I think I am quite good at deciphering medical information and understanding medical terminologies. I have a few medical professiols in my family, so I've been hearing about insurance, procedures, and diagnoses since I was a child. Though I find medicine fasciting, I never went into the field myself. 
0.616700	I think I have enough capacity to process most of what I need to know, but on occasion, I can get a little confused. I don't ask questions sometimes, even when I need to know more to fully understand necessary health information. Some of the information seems pretty daunting to me.
0.866700	I feel I have the capacity to understand health information. If I receive a diagnosis or prognosis that I can't understand or if a medical professiol uses too much jargon too quickly, I often repeat back to the professiol what I understand and allow them to clarify or correct me if I'm not understanding them. 
0.816700	I definitely have the capacity to do all o f the above. I am able to discuss with my doctors and nurses what I have issues with and I have the internet to formulate opinions on things and find information and services myself.
0.916700	i am a retired paramedic so health information is not a problem nor is asking questions and understanding answers
0.900000	I am very confident in my ability to successfully vigate all steps involved in being treated medically. However, as I do not have any medical conditions and have only dealt with health care via a check up every few years, I would say that if I did have a health issue I could imagine not being as confident in dealing with the process.
0.672200	I feel I can get most of the information I need if they're brought up. I worry that I may, or the staff may forget to check or mention something that will help my health. I also worry that some of the information is too complicated to understand and the meds prescribed have side effects that are glossed over.
0.916700	I have worked as a Medical Transcriptionist for 5 years.  so, having the basic understanding of medical terms and conditions helps me to have an intelligent conversation with doctors and medical personnel and read and understand medical information.
0.700000	I often have my wife explain to me things when they are too overwhelming or complicated by a doctor or nurse. It's important to get the information from them or I usually end up on the internet looking things up and that is probably the worst thing to do.
0.805600	At this point in my life. I am in control of my own health. And I hope I will NEVER have to depend on medical officials ever again.
0.727800	I think I have decent knowledge. I would like to have an extra opinion though just to make sure I'm making the right decision. 
0.766700	For the most part I feel I can make the appropriate decisions.  I would ask questions on things that I needed clarified.  I would also use the internet to search for answers that I still was unsure of.
0.827800	I think I have a good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I can ask questions to the doctor or nurse if there is something that I need clarified.
0.916700	I feel that I am fully capable of understanding the directives given by my doctor, along with all paperwork given to me. I am capable of understanding almost all information in written form. On the rare occasion I will ask a nurse in the office for some assistance in understanding information or obtaining advice on taking steps to move forward.
0.827800	I rarely go to the doctor, but for the most part, I feel like I understand everything that is discussed between my health care provider and myself.  At least as far as my condition at the time goes.  I do have some problems understanding treatment options and insurance issues.  That is where I need some help.
0.811100	Between asking health professiols in person, and looking up additiol information on the internet, it is easy to obtain the health info I need.
0.866700	I am ale to understand most information provided by providers. I am a professiol health care provider.
0.916700	I understand everything. I could be a damn doctor if I wanted to go to medical school. I understand it all. 
0.777800	I feel I can obtain, process and understand my health information to a mostly satisfactory degree. There have been some instances in the past where I have had trouble understanding what a doctor tells me. In those cases I will ask nurses for clarification, and I also changed my doctor to get someone who communicated better to me. 
0.827800	I'm pretty confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand information. My largest issues would be that I am generally reluctant to go to the doctor unless I absolutely need to, and that I often don't ask too many questions especially when I'm afraid of the answer. I will generally accept instructions from doctor without asking for explations, which probably also limits my ability to make decisions well. To this point, none of this has ever had a negative effect on me.
0.900000	I deal with doctors and forms so much over the last 2 years I'm getting to be a pro at it.. I also don't let doctors walk all over me and not hear my wishes. I live in opioid overdose central so I make sure I know what's going into my body and my doctor isn't just trying to make a new junkie. 
0.833300	I have a working knowledge of several general medical practices and back office procedures in the field. I know what rights I have as a patient and obligations of doctors and nurses.
0.855600	I believe I have the full capacity. I've never had problems before.
0.844400	I believe the hospitals and doctor's offices try to make things as easy as possible. I'm able to understand what they feel is important for me to know about a medical condition, which is usually more than I know. They treat everyone the same though, and I wish more time and attention would be given to taking my particular circumstances into consideration. My particular questions could help them treat others like me more specifically, but they don't seem to see it that way. 
0.805600	I think I'm capable to process and obtain basic health information. I do have problems when I am not definitively diagnosed with an ailment, but rather given a group of things that it could be. 
0.811100	I believe I am extremely capable of obtaining the information needed, and I am more than capable of understanding the information. Those concepts aren't beyond my reach, because I've always had an affinity for scientific studies, and that includes medical related fields. Making those decisions, however, is difficult for me, because decisions in general are difficult for me to make and motivation is even harder to come by.
0.827800	I feel that I am able to get adequate health information from doctors, nurses as well as through other resources.
0.888900	The doctors I see always explain my condition and my options really well. Whenever I ask questions I feel like they go above and beyond on telling me everything they know to help me understand my illness or whatever I am seeing them for. I also have access to the internet; while not a reliable method for diagnosis, it does have extra information available about practically every illness and condition if I wish to learn more.
0.816700	I am literate and intelligent. I keep myself informed about health issues in general and specific to me. I therefore feel I have the capacity to process and understand health information.

0.855600	I think that I have the capacity to do those things. However, I do have issues with feeling that I am bothering my doctor. If I have a new health concern I don't usually call my doctor to inform them. If my appointment is taking too long, I worry that I shouldn't ask too many questions so she can get to her next patient. I don't call when I am having problems, and really only have appointments when I have to have my annual work done. 
0.883300	I'm confident that I have the capacity to learn basic health information and receive services. I ask my doctors questions and they explain things. I also feel like I have access to many other sources of information I can look through on my own.
0.916700	I have full capacity and competency to obtain, process and comprehend health information. I ask doctors and nurses all the questions I can think of relating to my health issues. I feel I need to be proactive.
0.855600	I have great capacity to obtain process and understand basic health info to make appropriate decisions. I ask a lot of questions and make sure the Dr. understands what issues I am having so that I get the best care. I also follow up with the Dr. if I forget to say something about my issues etc. It gets a little murky when the Dr. decides to go down one path and I am not totally clear why, or if I received different info from the same Dr.
0.783300	I feel like I am able to make good health decisions however I rarely feel like I have all the information. It feels like there is information my doctor isn't telling me. I would rather they gave it to me straight with all the information so I could really make an informed decision.
0.900000	I think whenever i ask for any question or information regarding anything , my doctor gave me satisfactory answer. However i am not satisfied the way nurses handle the situation. whenever i call doctors office regarding my test results they never replied on time , and sometimes take more than 24 hours to return my call. 
0.872200	I have great capacity.  I take care of an elderly person who acts helpless and pretends he can't do anything for himself in regards to his medical care, and I see how annoying this is to the doctors, so I make sure to really take a proactive stance in my own healthcare.
0.866700	I feel I have the ability to process most information when it is presented in a transparent way 
0.866700	I make sure to ask questins of anything that is not clear, and I don't stop until I am satisfied with the clarification.  I also will obtain more information on my own to confirm that what I've been told is true.  If there is any discrepancy, and if it is important enough to me, I have not reservations about seeking second opinion.
0.700000	I'm pretty confident that I can understand, as long as I have someone available if I have questions about the details.
0.916700	I grew up with both of my parents working in a hospital and was often surrounded by doctors. I am very familiar with medical terminology and human atomy.

0.733300	I think I can understand the information well enough to get by but there are times I don't understand what doctors verbally explain to me. I'm not great at asking for clarification either.
0.900000	I have a background in medical field-former nurse, so I know a lot about medical terminology and information. Therefore, I feel very confident filling out medical forms but I also ask my spouse to go over information with me just to make sure I did not miss anything important.
0.794400	I feel that I have a good degree of capacity to process and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions.
0.788900	I feel like I have a good handle on it as long as I have very good explations from my doctor. I won't just let the doctor tell me what to do, I read up on options and come prepared. I have some knowledge of biological process, so I'm good in that way. The only thing that gets me is medical language--it's sometimes hard to understand. 
0.688900	I feel I am capable in making decisions regarding my health, and often fully understand what my doctors tell me. The only times when I am in need of assistance, like from my parents, is with matters related to insurance plans and making appointments. 
0.883300	Knowing a few people in the health care industry and finding it interesting myself, I feel very confident with health information. The internet can further help obtain information that I find questioble. 
0.855600	I am very clear when describing any symptoms. I am also very clear in my understanding of what the doctor tells me. i am also very clear in my understanding of what to ask the doctor. I am also very clear in my understanding that the doctors may also be incompetent.
0.744400	Sometimes they don't speak clearly enough to me where I can understand. They will tell me a lot of things I need to do, and most the time I forget. And it's hard to read their hand writing.
0.744400	I feel that I am capable to a certain point in understanding health information.  There are occasions that I am not certain of some information and have to get back in tough with the doctors office to explain something to me.  They do not do a great job unless you know the right questions to ask.  A lot of people do not know how to go about getting enough information they need.
0.900000	I feel that I understand basic health information and services very well. I have family that worked in hospitals so I have grown up with the language
0.900000	I feel that my current and past knowledge and experience allow me to make decisions regarding my health. I know all the necessary information when it comes to my health so I can understand it and make informed decisions.
0.916700	I have an Associate's Degree in Medical Information Technology and have taken many classes related to the medical field.

I am always able to research things I'm not sure about, but that doesn't happen often.
0.900000	I am able to process and understand basic health information. I read everything I am given. I do my own research if certain words are not clear. I ask questions and make sure I understand what is going on with my own health. I don't let anything be unclear. 
0.794400	I feel that I had adequate capacity to process and understand basic health information for my needs. I've been fairly healthy so far, so the information isn't too complex. The surgeries I have had did have some involved procedures and recovery concerns so I made sure my spouse was fully aware since one of the surgeries was going to take a significant amount of time.
0.883300	I am still fully able to deal with doctors.  if I have any problems i have no problem asking.
0.633300	I think it's difficult to gauge. I mean they have things written out with complicated language that only doctors understand I mean there's a reason they have to go to college for like 8 years. Then when you have a doctor in front of you, you don't know exactly what to ask whether it's relevant or just a stupid question. 
0.661100	I believe I have the capacity to understand the information, but I do think that sometimes it is presented in an unclear way. So I think there are ways to make it easier to understand.

0.716700	I sometimes have difficulty trying to explain where pain is to doctors, and have had a condition that no one seems to know what it is after a few tests. I still don't know. I am always perplexed by some of the explaitions that I am given and often times go away from an appointment more confused that I was when I went in. I never feel like I have had enough time with the health care providor. 
0.811100	I usually have all the questions I want to ask read. However I process methodically and they process you so fast,I often leave with all my questions answered but more crop up just a few minutes later.

0.844400	I don't feel like too much is out of my grasp when it comes to learning and understanding medical terms and treatment processes. It all feels pretty straightforward and I don't worry about it too much. If it were for something very involved like a risky surgery I might be more inclined to review the information with the professiols a few times but other than that I feel fine.
0.888900	I'm a pretty sharp guy. I understand what is being told to me. I ask appropriate questions to my situation and understanding. Understanding an issue and acting appropriately on that information are different things, however.
0.700000	I think I have the capacity to understand things when they are explained to me.  Knowing the relevant information is another thing altogether.  Sometimes I don't know which questions to ask.  I put my faith in the professiols and hope for the best, although I wish I had more control/knowledge of the situation.  
0.916700	I have a high degree of understanding as both my father and sister are doctors.  I worked many years in their office while in school.

0.866700	I think I can grasp what the doctors or nurses tell me when I go to the doctor. I've been to the doctor's a lot when I was younger so I know how things work, and when to ask questions about certain things if they don't explain things as clearly as I would like.

0.783300	"I feel comfortable in my ability. I don't believe in a lot of the western concept idea of ""diseases"" and have been focusing more on getting my health back without pharmaceuticals by eating clean, vegan whole foods diet. And it's working. I don't need doctors to tell me about shill information or services that we'll find out 50 years later was all wrong, like how doctors recommended cigarettes. Only time I'd need a doctor is in an emergency."

I have at least a semblance of knowledge in regards to the human body and how it functions. As far as forms and things. They can be a bit tricky once in a great while.  Otherwise I find them fairly straightforward. 
0.833300	Yes. Everything is usually pretty straightforward whenever you go to get health care. My only issue is health insurance not being as transparent as it needs to be.
0.705600	Forms I can do. That's the type of work I do for a living. But when I get with the doctor, first I become very nervous, so I may not always be forthcoming with information. Then the medical talk becomes a blur. I usually nod my head yes yes yes, thinking I can process it all later.

0.866700	I can understand what they tell me most of the time. When I'm in doubt, I ask till they give me an answer I can use. The medical\dental profession have a bad habit of obfuscation...they call it 'not scaring their patients(a direct quote). When did informing people at a level they can use become scarey???
0.900000	I believe I have a high capacity to understand everything being told to me. Not only was I a science major in my undergraduate studies. But I am currently in a doctoral of physical therapy program and therefore have a high level of knowledge in the functioning of the human body.

0.805600	When it comes to a basic understanding I do have the capacity. I have no problem with this at all. All I need to do is slow down while reading and it becomes evident.

0.916700	I feel that I have the ability, through my doctor, physician's assistant and the internet, to ask any questions I may have about basic health information.

0.777800	I feel that I'm capable of generally understanding the information that is given to me, and also to do some extra research on it later on.

0.783300	I don't go to the doctor super often but when I do I feel I'm able to understand the basic information. I make sure to make my points clearly and I make sure that I'm understanding them also. If I'm not entirely sure about something they said, I'll ask questions.

Legal issues make the wording on most 'serious' documents more difficult then they need to be but over time you do develop a sense of understanding. I do my best and when I get confused I will typically go  online and look for my answer which is almost always available. Just like fince, medical industry is powered by legal staff and they go out of the way to make a simple form complicated for various reasons. 
0.811100	I feel I have the ability to obtain and understand the information. What I would be worried about is retention. If I am given a lot of information, some of it may be verbal, I could easily forget or misunderstand the information. This could be detrimental in regards to my health.

I think I have a bit of an advantage as I'm currently enrolled in a pre-pharmacy track at my university, but I've always been able to understand my health information without much confusion. That said, when I do feel the need to ask for clarification, I've always been able to get a more thorough explation.
0.588900	I'm usually not shy when it comes to talking to doctors so I typically question them pretty thoroughly. The problem is that I have bad anxiety and so I'll rehearse the questions I want to ask at home beforehand and then freeze up and forget to ask them when I'm there (due to my anxiety and nervousness).

0.872200	Since I have not had experiences with uncommon disease or sickness, except from regular health check and common cold, I do not really have much more experience with health information and services.  In fact, aside from some emergencies in my teege and younger years visit to hospital due to injury, accident, the past 8 years, the only time I have to stop by the doctor was to drive someone else close to me for health check up.  Because of this, as far as health information and services needed for me, I am up to date on most of them, plus I am rather good at internet when I need to do research on something peculiar related to health
0.861100	I feel confident that I can understand the information given to me by the doctor and pharamcy. I am confident when I read over the instructions on how to take medications and the possible side effects.

0.916700	I am quite capable of reading and understanding health information and services.  I used to work in the insurance industry for 15 years in a variety of positions and I had the opportunity to learn many things about health, medical, insurance, etc. and have no trouble with forms. 
0.850000	I feel fairly confident. I have access to the internet which helps quite a bit, and I'm not shy about asking questions or asking for clarifications if there's something I don't understand.
0.800000	I feel like I have the language skills to obtain information relevant to my health.  The barrier (if any) seems to be my discomfort with asking certain questions, or not knowing the right questions to ask.
0.650000	I mostly have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I feel like sometimes the information is written in a way that it is difficult to understand if you don't have experience or training in the medical field.  I usually ask questions or Google information if I am not sure or don't understand.  I do feel I am able to make appropriate health decisions for the most part.
0.827800	I'm more or less able to comprehend most information regarding medical information and decisions. If and when I find myself confused by something, it is usually due to the manner in which it was written (i.e. It contained unnecessary legalese or terms with which I'm unfamiliar). If I ever find myself having reservations about making making decisions, I am usually able to speak with someone (a receptionist or patient care advocate) who is able to clarify information for me.
0.800000	Filling out basic health information is not a problem for me. My weakest area is asking questions so that I understand exactly what the doctor/nurse is saying. Sometimes I just don't know the right questions to ask.
0.738900	I think I ask all the question I want answers to. But I don't asks questions I don't want to know the answers to. Such as smoking.
0.844400	I don't feel like I have any trouble understanding and processing the information I receive.  Even if I don't understand something right away, I know where to go to get help figuring it all out.
0.744400	I think that on average I am moderately knowledgeable when it comes to health issues, however I comfortable and feel it is within my rights to ask the healthcare professiols any questions that helps me clarify any information, procedures or recommendations they may have.
0.722200	I feel like I definitely have the capacity to process and understand health information. Sometimes if there are too many technical terms being used I might have to ask either my doctor or someone else (my sister is an RN so I can call her and ask for her help) to explain in more plain language. But most of the time I don't have a problem. As far as obtaining services and information, that's a little bit trickier. There's the issue of services being available or not available in my area, long waits to see a doctor, and the massive cost of seeing a doctor. And I've had a few issues where I've gone to the ER or the walk-in clinic in my town and ended up seeing a doctor who doesn't seem to care about explaining what's going on to me. But overall I feel like I can probably make appropriate health decisions. Not 100% confident, but at least 70-80%.
0.916700	I've had a few operations and have taken care of a parent with Alzheimer's. While I have a pretty severe phobia of all things medical, I've had enough urgent care to know the ropes and even a lot about interl organs/functions as well as pharma and tural medicine. 
0.850000	I feel like I am have general understanding of most of the important health decisions I make based some of my previous professions. 
0.811100	I feel like i have a great ability to obtain and understand basic health information because i am confident with my research and communication abilities. For something i do not understand or need clarification i usually try to research it before hand , get an idea of what it is before consulting a health professiol. By the time i consult a health professiol, i usually have a general understanding of whatever it is i need clarification on.
0.900000	Normally when I don't understand something that is hospital related, I do ask enough questions to help me understand what is going on. I also do some research online. 
0.727800	I think for the most part I have the ability to make appropriate decisions.  Sometimes I wish I had more information about how to do some things that I'm not used to doing.
0.916700	I like to follow all instructions given to me by my doctor. I like to read everything the doctor gives to me, especially medications. If there is something I do not understand, I am not hesitant in the slightest to look for something on the internet. 
0.916700	I have a fairly good understanding of  medical terminology having worked in a benefits related industry and also what is required to make a proper diagnosis.
0.916700	I am not a science-minded person, so the medical information I receive is not obvious or tural to me. Therefore I like to listen to everything a medical professiol says to me, because I am learning along the way. Since I like learning about new things in life, I have no problem being interested and understanding what they are telling me.
0.916700	I am cognizant of my health condition and fully able to make my own decisions. I easily understand the options available to me and what course of medical treatment offers the best outcomes.  
0.744400	I struggle at times to understand printed material, particularly literature about prescribed medicines. Sometimes I have difficulty understanding a doctor's verbal explations, especially since they are always short on time. 
0.838900	I think I would be able to obtain what I needed in order to get a general understanding of a condition.
0.888900	I can almost always understand and remember what a doctor or nurse tells me. I understand all basic medical terminology as well as some more advanced terms.
0.638900	I feel I am able to understand and process basic health information because of my education. If it is basic info I can usually follow along or I am capable of using the internet to clarify things I might find confusing. 
0.783300	Pretty good. Not illiterate. Can read.
0.783300	I think I have a very good ability to understand and process basic health information and make decisions. I was taught by my parents to ask doctors the necessary questions and to understand all diagnosis given to me by doctors before leaving the office.  
0.827800	i believe i can understand what my healthcare professiols tell me about my health. i rarely need anyone to explain things to me. if i don't understand something, i search the internet to find out more information. the internet is very helpful in finding out information.
0.900000	I understand basic health information very well. If I need to I can always go to a reputable medical organization on the internet. I have worked in a Dr's.  office and familiar with basic medical terminology. 
0.883300	I have the knowledge and ability to be forthright and ask questions when I don't understand something.   Even if I was really scared of a diagnosis, I would not be afraid to find out any of the info I was looking for.     It goes across the board and would involve information, services, and billing.
0.883300	Almost perfectly. I am a good reader, have good reading comprehension,and frequently refer to Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins when I need more or expanded information on my or a friends medical concern.. 
0.805600	I believe I understand well enough what questions I should ask pertaining to my ailment. I am sometimes hesitant to ask some questions I deem embarrassing, though.
0.622200	Confident. I feel confident in making my health decisions. I'm still fairly young and healthy. I know yo ask questions when something is important. I forget information, but I know what to do and say to function and survive. 
0.883300	I feel like I have a decent ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  If I don't understand something I ask questions and I usually end up doing research on health related maters online so that I can better understand anything I may not understand.
0.538900	For most of the real basic stuff, I get it. But when it gets more complicated with medical words being spoken to me, I get a little lost. I always have my husband with me in the doctor's office to make sure I don't miss something. 
0.811100	I feel like, given my individual circumstances, I can easily obtain and understand basic health information and services. This is likely due to the fact that I enjoy reading and learning and have taken an interest in the medical/scientific fields in general (particularly in psychiatry, as I have mental health issues). One area that does cause problems for me, though, is that I am a drug addict and I am generally reluctant to tell healthcare professiols exactly what drugs I may or may not be on, due to the stigma attached to my habits.
0.844400	i have no issues filling anything out. i normally have a good idea whats wrong with me due to healthcare websites like webmd and such. it is typically hard to ask questions to a doctor because they usually are running behind and are in and out of the room in less than 5 minutes so they are not always available to answer all questions if i have any
0.861100	I feel I can make informed decisions and obtain necessary information as I have friends who I can consult and also use the internet when I need to read and find out more about certain topics. 
0.916700	I never have too much of a problem understanding what they tell me, and when I do, I always ask questions until I know I understand completely what's going on. Other times I'll research on my own time what they tell me if I'm still not completely satisfied, or if I just want to know a little extra about something.
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand all of my health information. I believe in taking charge of ones own health care, doing careful research and working with my physician to make the best health care decisions for myself.
0.516700	I generally feel that I can understand the basics but dont fully grasp the overall picture. Sometimes I dont get how some aspects relate to other things but I am slowly learning to ask more questions or to ask family and friends for further clarification. But I generally feel I  can understand the basics.
0.883300	I feel very confident in acquiring information from health professiols when needed. I am also confident in my own exploration of health information on the internet. 
0.900000	I have a high degree of being able to understand health information. My doctor is excellent with explaining and making sure I understand. I have also used Google to search for health knowledge.
0.738900	I think I have a good capacity to obtain help when I need to make decisions concerning my health. I have family members who are able to help me fill out forms when I don't understand certain questions. The doctors and nurses are pretty helpful as well when I don't understand something, whether that deals with information I'm filling out or the information they give me concerning their judgement on my health. All in all, I haven't had too much trouble in this area. 
0.833300	I do understand the process of decisions for my health care, and if I am confused I then ask my doctor or nurse
0.861100	I feel I am very capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health info. I make my own health decisions on an everyday basis, as it is. I feel I am a smart and competent person.
0.788900	I mainly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services, although I do have difficulty with communication due to having high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder. I tend to not ask questions that I should ask because of being uncomfortable with communication.
0.916700	I feel confident in my ability to handle health information. I have a background in health insurance, so that part of the equation is very easily understood. I also have fine research skills, a large vocabulary and enough general experience at the age of 48, that I know how to find out anything, of which I am unsure. I'm ufraid to speak with health care professiols. 
0.888900	I think I have a good knowledge base and am confident that, for the most part, I understand the directions my doctor and nurses give me, along with the materials and directions given to me afterward. I make sure to ask questions, but I will be honest and say that I often forget some of the things I want to ask before I go in during the exam. I
0.850000	"I feel that I can do all of the above on my own very well. Usually, I would just ask for ""help"" or advice from someone if I have been diagnosed with something they have previously had if I had any questions about it. I was also responsible for my grandma's health decisions and went to all of her appointments with her."
0.916700	I'm not shy. I have no trouble talking to people in normal situations and important matters such as my health I'm even less likely to remain silent. If I have questions I ask. Even at routine medical checkups I have questions for my doctor either about the current situation or some other issue that has been bugging me.
0.744400	I have taken medical terminology I and II and earned A's in both. I have also done some research on my conditions. Because of that, I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I've even taken a nutrition course.
0.827800	I have a pretty good grasp on my health and health issues. I do a lot of research on the chronic conditions I have as well as the treatments and medications. Most of the information I obtain comes from trusted sources on the Internet rather than my health professiols. Many times I feel like just a number to my health care providers.
0.900000	I am pretty certain that I am capable to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make appropriate decisions. I mostly do not need help in understanding any information given to me. On rare occasions that I do need to as a few questions to better understand the information, I was always given clear answers by my doctors or nurses.
0.633300	I feel that I have a moderate capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. The reason for this is that I can usually understand and process basic information, but when it comes to things such as specific terms or words I do not understand them which causes me to not understand more things. I sometimes also do not ask all of the questions I should  if I do not fully understand something. 
0.744400	I think it can be difficult because they are just trying to push the protocols on you and not necessarily do what is helpful to you or what you want. Especially in the case of my pregncies. I also do not understand the labs and stuff like that and I always have to ask and usually they dont even give you a copy, only when you go to a specialist or something then you see. I have heard that you can ask for a copy of your medical information the same day of your appointment and they give it for free but I feel intimidated because they make it seem like they charge you and they know better like why would you be asking questions. 
0.900000	I have enough experience on the matter to know what is being considered. I know what is told me and I know the basic issues. I can understand what is provided and make appropriate choices.
0.916700	I have a lot of confidence in myself to be able to understand and process basic health information. If I had questions after leaving a doctor's office, I would search for information on my prior before calling back. Anytime anyone I've known has had a medical condition, I always research it as well. I have never worked in the medical field, but I do learn quickly and comprehend what I do find on my own.
0.872200	I can understand all information provided to me in order to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.583300	I think that I will need to some research before making a decision. 
0.827800	I understand what they tell me for the most part, but I do get hung up on the science behind it sometimes. If I don't understand the science I research it a bit online to get a better understanding because I'm slow on stuff like that.
0.822200	I feel confident in my capacity to understand health information to make good health decisions.  Sometimes I think I have too much information, rather than too little, since the internet has much information on health these days. Once I've met with clinicians though I do believe they are able to sift through any problems I have in order to give me the proper care.
0.883300	I think I have the capability to understand my health concerns. I am not afraid to ask doctors any questions about any concerns I may have and I'm also not worried about appearing ignorant if I need any clarification or explation of different medical terms.  Also, the internet allows me to do further research into any health topic I want to learn about.
0.900000	As I am tive to English and I usually speak to English speaking doctors - I have a fairly easy time of understanding what they tell me. Most doctors know how to speak in layman's terms which makes it all easier. Otherwise, I can look up the term and can basically always understand what it says online.
0.794400	I feel pretty confident in my ability. However, sometimes when new information is given it's hard to process it on the spot and know which questions to ask. I often think of questions after I have left the doctor's office. 
0.777800	I think I'm smart enough to understand most medical information. I find for me on thing that does not help is on the internet you can almost find contradictions to any medical recommendation. Diet, supplements, vaccitions all have opposing views for the general medical advice given.
0.872200	I feel that I am more than equipped to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  I do not have a background in medicine but I my comprehension and alysis skills are high.  If there was anything that I did not understand, I would research it until I did.  Good health is a high priority.
0.800000	I try to pay close attention to what the Dr. says.  If I'm not sure what the problem is I ask them to explain better.
0.827800	I think I certainly have the literacy skills. I read and write better than most people I know and have a good vocabulary. But I don't have a lot of specialized medical knowledge, so sometimes I do feel like I don't have all the information I need to make a good decision or to understand what a doctor tells me. I think compared to most other people who aren't doctors or nurses, I'm doing well, but there are still a few times when I wish I were more confident.
0.777800	For the most part, the services I receive are superb, the only trick is waiting to get a appointment, which can sometimes take a month or longer. I feel that for the most part I understand the health system and the information provided me as well as the services, but sometimes I ask for help or opinions and explation when necessary.
0.738900	If I need help I can call the office and ask.  But sometimes I don't ask.
0.655600	I feel like I can answer about all of the questions right. Usually they are pretty straight forward.  They don't use too much jargon that the average person cannot understand.  Very rarely sometimes the questions are worded in a way that you don't know what answer they are looking for.
0.872200	I feel confident in my ability to understand basic health information and make decisions. My doctors are very clear and helpful and always explain in detail if I need further clarification. They also lay out the options clearly so I can make an appropriate decision.
0.883300	I've worked in the healthcare field for most of my life in one way or another. I feel like I can understand just about anything thrown my way and I can make the right decisions regarding my health and treatment.
0.566700	I need it broken down better into easy to process words that i am familiar with to understand better. I feel sometimes the information is jus thrown at me and i would like it written down on papers so i can refer back to what i have and need todo for it and the medications.
0.811100	I persolly feel I am fully capable of obtaining and understanding the basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision. I am able to accomplish this by questioning my healthcare providers and also reading through materials or seeking additiol information online if necessary.
0.833300	I feel like I have enough of an understanding of health issues that may arise that I can discuss options with my doctor or doctors. I also only go to doctors that I trust to help me make the right decisions. I have a couple close friends who are nurses so I can always talk to them if there's something I'm not completely sure of.
0.716700	I feel as though I can process most information fairly well. I have had issues in the past with having a lack of confidence in doctors explaining, but never my own understanding. 
0.688900	I worked in a hospital as their accounting staff, that may be the reason why I can understand easily their given information to me. But, I always ask them to read it for me to clarify that my understanding to my medical record is really what it seems to be.
0.916700	I have no problem asking a health professiol any questions to clarify anything I don't understand. Some Drs speak in medical terms and I often have to ask them to explain in layman's terms. My current Dr is extremely good about explaining everything and is more than willing to answer any and all questions.
0.833300	I have full access to the internet. If a health care professiol does not provide information to answer all the questions I have (which come up after the visit), I look online.  I do not use blogs for the most part. I use credible sources for information.  Of course, if I have questions that cannot be answered at that point, I reach out to my PCP.  My PCP is actually available via internet for me, so I use that resource when appropriate. I have a small healthcare background as well, so I feel I am able to understand and comprehend better than someone with no healthcare background.
0.866700	I feel that I am able to achieve this to a pretty high degree. Most times my health provider will provide a good enough verbal description of what I need to know and is available to answer any questions. I think what helps me the most, is that prior to going in and seeing someone, I research and look into my issue myself which gives me that ability to have some prepared questions or address any concerns. I have never had a problem following up with my provider with a phone call or email with a question and them not explaining what I need to know.
0.783300	I usually feel like I'm able to get enough information. Certain situations can make me flustered and uncomfortable, which sometimes limits how I interact. I do feel like there are more chances these days to get the information you need beyond the actual care interactions.
0.883300	I know that I have the capacity to understand medical documents and filling them out. Occasiolly I have my doctor explain something if I don't understand it but for the most part I do. 
0.883300	I feel like I am very capable in making health decisions.
0.838900	For the most part I understand what I am being told and if they use a term I am unfamiliar with I usually will ask follow up questions.  I will also sometimes search online to find the meaning of some things.  
0.727800	For the most part I feel confident in my ability to understand basic health information, as long as it's just basic. Once medical jargon and terminology starts to be used, I get a little lost. Whatever I do have trouble processing, I can just turn to the internet for answers.
0.916700	I am extremely proficient at maging my health. I live a very healthy lifestyle and my great health reflects that. I understand exactly what i must do to maintain great health.
0.777800	Sometimes it can be difficult to obtain your health records due to the office being too busy. It can also be difficult to have them explain in detail what is going on with you because they have so many patients and not a lot of time.
0.850000	I am a  brittle typp 1 diabetic. I  have been googleing things  for  years and am a member of many diabetic support groups.  We all share our storys  and all healp each other understand what is wrong with us. the docots  only see  part of the story  but they dont understand the full story  
0.916700	I think I have a great ability to understand what doctors and nurses are trying to tell me. I am familiar with some of the language used to describe medical conditions, and I tend to ask questions in areas that I'm not strong with. 
0.916700	I feel that I perfectly competent to make basic health decisions. I am a tive English speaker and routinely complete medical information forms by myself without help.
0.900000	I have the capacity to read and understand information and services because I have had extensive medical issues during to an auto immune system disease.  I research anything I am told until I fully understand it and then discuss with my doctors in depth.  I have a background in language and that background has aided me in understanding complex issues with my health.
0.866700	I think it is really important that if you are being seen by a health care professiol that you understand what you are being told. If you do not understand then you MUST ask questions so that you are clear on what may be wrong or any instructions that they may give you. I think that I completely capable of asking questions and understanding what I am being told so that I can understand and make appropriate decisions as I do ask questions if I don't understand.  
0.883300	I feel as though I can understand everything a doctor tells me in order to make decisions. If there is something that I don't understand, I have no problem asking the doctor to explain.
0.555600	I don't have obama care, so I don't feel I have access
0.883300	I feel i have a high capacity to understand and process information that's been given to me. I feel this way because i consider myself intelligent.  In addition , or maybe it goes hand and hand, i do my research on any topic i have questions on. I will never blindly take the advice or recommendations of Doctors/Nurses without also doing my own due diligence. 
0.705600	I think I understand medical information about myself fairly well. If I ever have any difficulty, I can just ask my husband and he will help me figure it out. If he is uvailable then I would ask the nurse or doctor for clarification of any information I don't understand.
0.516700	I think that I have the capacity of the average person to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. At times, I do need assistance filling out forms because I am afraid that I will do so improperly and they will not have all the information needed because I misinterpreted a question. Also at times, I try to process the information they give me and am afraid to ask questions so I then go home and search on the internet for further information. 
0.916700	i can do research and ask questions
0.750000	I think I am well equipped to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have been seeing a doctor regularly for the same issue for decades and I understand the information. However, this was not always true since years ago I had a lot of trouble understanding-- since then I have read a lot about my issues so it is no longer confusing for me.  
0.705600	I feel semi-confident in my ability to understand basic health information and services. I do find difficulty when attempting to get answers from health professiols. I generally notice that health professiols automatically assume that people have a general understanding of all aspects regarding health but I don't believe this is the case. This makes decision making more difficult. 
0.855600	i have have no problem understanding medical language and if i do have a question i call back after i get home
0.916700	I have full capacity to understand all the basic health information and services because I have experience with the medical field. Not only that, I am fluent in English, so I am able to make deductions based on what I already know. 
0.844400	I feel I do for the most part.  I know basic stuff
0.872200	I don't feel I'm lacking in any of these areas. Between what the medical practitioner I usually see (a PA) tells me and the ability to fill in the gaps with information I can find on the Internet, I feel like I'm able to keep myself pretty well informed with what I need to know. That said, I don't currently deal with anything overly complicated either. When my dad was diagnosed with a rarer form of blood cancer, the learning process they went through was not as simple.
0.805600	I feel like I am completely capable of understanding information given to me by health care workers.  Although I don't always ask questions like I should, I know that I am able to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.750000	I'm quite capable of understanding what doctors are telling and reading medical documents. I have a background reading in scientific research, so understanding the technical side of things is quite easy for me.
0.805600	I feel like I can obtain and process basic health information effectively. It's only when there is a complication that I don't always get the information I need or follow up material to make an informed decision. Or sometimes I don't think of  question till long after I have left the doctor's office.
0.722200	I think I do have the capacity to deal with the health information that I get. I am always sure to not leave the doctor's office or hospital with unswered questions. I try to search on the web first and I make a list of all the things I would like to ask so I don't leave details without answer.
0.422200	Based on the questions I answered, I realized I don't understand much about health information. There are many terms used that I don't know and often I don't know where to start asking questions. If information were described to me in simple terms, I would be able to make appropriate health decisions.
0.794400	if i don't understand something and i am not at the doctor's office, i can ask a family member to help me or go online for help. the answers are there, you just have to ask a person or online.
0.711100	I feel fairly competent to obtain and understand health information that is given to me. I studied biology in college (it was my major) and was considering going into medicine, but decided on another field later on. I have accumulated a lot of knowledge on health issues and factors over the years, through reading online and keeping track of my own health. 
0.916700	While I lack medical expertise on any of its subjects, I in general have good reading comprehension and can at least partially understand things that I don't know about using context. I also know how to ask good questions, when necessary, and have good research skills to investigate a lot of things on my own. 
0.916700	I have no problem processing health or health related information . I am a retired Paramedic and my wife is a nurse
0.794400	I feel that I am fully capable of asking questions surrounding my own healthcare. The problem is I can become embarrassed or shy while I'm trying to advocate for my needs and make sure that I get all the information that I need to. It's also hard for me when the doctor or a nurse is behind schedule or seems to be in a rush. If that's the case, then I'm almost afraid to ask a question because I don't want to get the brush-off.

I LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT I KNOW WHAT I AM GETTING INTO.
0.627800	I'm not confident at all that I obtain what I need to. A lot of the blame lies with me I guess. I am a nervous person, and I usually want to get away from people ( especially medical people) fast. If they seem busy or annoyed, I fell like running away. Fortutely I have a very nice DR. who usually explains a lot of what I need to know without me asking. 
0.672200	I have good common sense, so therefore I can understand things that are common. When it comes to the technical terms and jargon of the medical profession I like to get help just so that I do not misunderstand anything
0.727800	To an extent, I understand what they say.. But there are times where I need the doctor or nurse to better explain what's going on especially if there are decisions on treatments and etc.
0.900000	I have taken human atomy and physiology in high school and I have taken a health class, so I am aware of a lot of basic information that they would tell you. Most results I have obtained in the past few years are online, which usually give you more information than you need.
0.788900	I feel like I have an above average knowledge of health information. My mom and dad both work in the health industry and I have learned a lot from them through out the years. I have also done some own private research on some health topics as it interests me.
0.694400	I feel I have the capacity to understand and ask questions, but I rarely ask or mention everything I want to. I usually think that the medical professiol will think I'm wasting their time, and don't speak up.
0.816700	I feel like I have a very good capacity to understand my medical history,  The only time I really had a problem, was when I was having brain seizures and I was going into a coma.  People were explaining things, but I could not understand what they were saying.
0.672200	Sometimes I struggle to understand what Doctors say if it just scientific medical jargon. I also worry that they are just trying to legally protect themselves by stating things so matter of factually. Usually nurses are the ones who explain things to me in more of an understandable way.

0.888900	I feel I have a capacity greater than most others in my age group to understand health information. I come from a family of health professiols and have a good vocabulary when it comes to healthcare terms. I also worked as a CSR for a major heath insurance company for a couple years.
0.855600	I feel I am completely able to understand any thing I'm told by the doctor or nurse, and am able to all questions correctly to get the answers I need on the things I do not.  I usually do not have an troubles with any forms or reading I am supposed to fill out.
0.816700	Most people in the medical profession talk and explain things to fast for me to fully process the information at the moment.

0.900000	I feel I have a well developed capacity for obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information.  I always take a list of questions to ask my doctor (if I need to), and I do not leave his office until I am sure I understand everything I need to know about my condition, medications, and altertive forms of therapy.  I have to be my own health care advocate, because no one else will do it for me.

0.916700	I am confident in my ability to understand and ask appropriate questions on health information and services
0.744400	I feel comfortable talking to my doctor about anything, but sometimes I forget questions I wanted to ask.  I utilize WebMD a lot, and my sister-in-law is an RN.  She's very good at explaining things to me.
0.711100	Some information needs explaining,but you can usually find good information if you can access the internet. As long as it is not very specialized information.
0.733300	I always try to be sure that I understand whatever I am told by the doctor (or other medical person).  But sometimes they are in a hurry and I might be asking for details that they don't think matter so they don't really explain everything.  Like when I took my child to the doctor with a fever and the doctor said be sure the child get plenty of fluids.  I understood that, but I asked why is that important and was just told that it is and see you later.  
0.916700	I feel I definitely know how to get all information effectively. I speak fluent English, consider myself intelligent, and have taken plenty of science courses.

0.827800	I know that I can understand the information given to me, but it seems to be difficult to get that information in the first place. There aren't a lot of places that you can go to find dependable information for you to make your decisions.

0.883300	I feel that the information is obtaible, it's more a matter of knowing where to go to obtain the information you need. It's the starting point that is the biggest challenge.

0.850000	I have the mental capacity of understanding my basic health info and services. Usually my doctor and nurses are pretty reliable. Though some are set in their old ways and think certain things are the answer to everything. I'm pretty sure how to take care of my health information and services on my own. If I need any further assistance I usually ask for the help.
0.811100	I believe I can obtain and understand all written material. When it comes to spoken material given by healthcare providers, they Often do not answer all my questions or allow time for me to give all my questions.

0.822200	I feel I am very lucky because I am able to understand and process information about my health better than most to a very high degree, unless there are circumstances. I am a student, and decently intelligent, along with having taken many scientific courses; I feel this gives me an advantage. However in some cases, I am still troubled. For example, I have trouble when I am very anxious about a Dr. visit or technique to be utilized, and this can hinder my comprehension, requiring me to ask for help or repeats of information. This could also apply to an emergency visit or ER visit, as I will be stressed and in a lesser state of consciousness than normal.
0.794400	I asked the doctor the questions that trouble me and he explains my concerns very well and when I go home I do a little research of my own as well.
0.811100	I feel pretty confident until I actually get to the Drs office - it can be overwhelming. Nerve racking.

I think they're used to doing the same thing for everyone with a particular health condition and don't understand how my multiple conditions interact with each other. 
0.916700	I feel like anything I don't understand that's given to me by a doctor or nurse would be easily understood after they explain it to me. If I didn't understand it then I would simply ask and that should be enough.

0.822200	I have a basic knowledge of some of the medical jargon that has been used around me when it comes to my body. I have had diagnoses thrown at me occasiolly that I haven't been able to understand until someone has explained them in a language that I understood. When I was in my twenties, I was told that I was Septic. I didn't understand. they gave me paperwork to read over, but with the infection of that magnitude, I couldn't read.  I have had diagnoses with my mental health as well, I wasn't sure what the treatment meant, until someone explained it to me. There was a time where I was taking Lithium. (2011) I took it for two years, I lost joy, and my ability to comprehend written or read information. Once I was switched to a different medication, it took two years for me to even be able to comprehend a page long news article. I am doing much better now, but there are still moments that i feel foggy, or loose memory of certain words. I will have to google things to remember what the words mean. 
0.727800	I think I can for the most part. I can understand a problem and the possible solutions and strategies to treat the problem. I feel confident enough to share all of my concerns and ask all appropriate questions about my condition. 
0.855600	I can explain what the problem is. I can listen to the answers and I usually understand them. Sometimes I ask additiol questions to clarify something.
0.883300	I read about medical issues, symptoms, and treatments online or ask family and friends. I look up medical terminology to understand subject matter i do not understand. I also try to look online for answers to better understand medical problems
0.555600	i think it is very hard to understand most of what they tell you. i can understand the basics to my problems like eat less to loose weight but when they go into more detail and reasoning behind things i get lost.
0.866700	I feel I have enough resources to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.

I research online and I review with my family members and friends within the healthcare profession.
0.850000	I feel that I have a high capacity to make appropriate health decisions based on the information I receive.  I always make sure to ask any questions I have no matter how small they seem.  I make sure I understand what I need to before I leave the office as I want to make sure I get better and don't do anything to make my condition worse.  I try not to use things like webMD or other things on the computer and just listen to my doctor.  I don't want to get any false information or confuse myself.  I trust my primary health physician as he has been right in the past and has helped me get over a few things with no complications and fairly quickly in all instances as well.  He goes over any documents or directions with me before I leave so I can ask questions and so he knows I understand everything.  
0.805600	I have no problem keeping my medical appointments, however I write a list of things to ask when I meet with my Dr. and I forget to take my list with me. I'm married to a retired RN and she is a big help with my understanding my health care. I'm seeing 5 specialists so it's hard to keep on top of it. It's almost a full time job but easier thanks to the internet.
0.844400	"I depend entirely on myself to research my health conditions and my options because I am ethically and philosophically opposed to the techniques used by ""modern"" medicine. I refuse invasive procedures (surgeries) and medications. Since this puts me in opposition to 99% of the physicians out there, I never visit a doctor and rely on myself to research what types of noninvasive, tural remedies are available to me."
0.727800	By and large, I understand what's given to me to read or am told by health professiols. Sometimes the reading may have terms or wording I don't understand, but all it takes is asking a simple question to clarify things. I'm confident I understand everything by the time I'm done.
0.872200	I believe I am fully capable of understanding health information given by to me by doctors, and I am also fully capable of providing accurate health information.  I believe I am intelligent enough to comprehend and conduct independent research, and make decisions based on the information I am given.  I think I have a healthy dose of skepticism when given information as well.
0.594400	I feel like I am able to obtain the information rather easily, as well as process it. Although when I am being told health related things or how to take care of myself , my mind shuts down and I refuse to actually take in the information permanently.  I understand most of it but it doesn't stick with me much after I leave the doctor/health professiol.
0.705600	I feel that I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions because my doctors/healthcare providers generally give me the information I need, and if they don't give me the information up front, I can ask questions and they will answer them. If I have questions about my medication or other issues, I can call my doctor's office to get information regarding that. I also have friends and family that can help answer questions about certain health issues.
0.633300	i know when i feel headache and i consult doctor but most of the time i feel difficulties to understand when i feel back pain join pain i took calcium and iron suppliment. i walk daily and also vitmain suppliment.
0.727800	I feel I have all the capacity to understand my health decisions. Also I find doing more research on looking up on my computer more helpful.
0.805600	I'm involved in my healthcare and value having a doctor that communicates well. I've switched doctors in the past when I felt a disconnect with them. I generally understand what is going on; advanced medical specifics can be confusing. I aprpreciate having detailed explaitions written down, for my perusal when I'm not as stressed (if applicable).
0.755600	I think I ask a moderate amount of questions to clarify most of the information given to me by professiols, which I think is the whole key no matter what my mental capacity - you ask until they dumb it down for you to a more comfortable level.
0.827800	It seems that most medical professiols are really good at explaining things simply right from the start. At times, I really wish they would be more detailed but most are too rushed. In the few times I get any sort of information in writing, I will save it even after reading it to be sure I have a record. I think most information is pretty straight forward. 
0.883300	I think I have the ability to understand everything.  If there was something I didn't understand, I would ask the medical official for clarification, or seek out answers from friends or the internet.
0.883300	To some extent- whatever I don't understand, I just ask questions. 
0.900000	I self diagnosed my self as a hypochondriac. I often visit the doctor for every ache or bump despite having nothing wrong with me. My doctor knows me very well since I visit often and always explains to me why what I think I have, I do not actually have. I feel I have a lot of experience with going to the doctor and asking questions.  
0.661100	I think that I am well able to fend for myself on all the matters regarding my own health from forms to taking informed decisions to an extent. for instance as long as my faculties allow me to do so. 
0.883300	English is my first language and I'm of normal intelligence, so I don't see why I would have problems understanding basic health information and services. With respect to obtaining information, most doctors and staff I've met seem quite willing to provide whatever information is requested or needed.
0.777800	I believe I have a good capacity to make health related decisions.
0.650000	I think that when you are in a position to have face to face time with a doctor or nurse, you are usually not thinking clearly and things go rather quickly and then when you can't think of what you want to ask right that minute they leave and as soon as you are home you start thinking of questions you should have asked. You can alway call and wait for them to get back to you but that always seems like you are bothering them. The internet is usually a good source to do you your own research to get a better understanding of whats going on, assuming you fact check and don't just believe something because some random person said it was true.
0.800000	I feel I am able to do all those things most or all of the time. I ask the questions necessary to make sure I understand while with a doctor or nurse. I also will research information on my own. I will also occasiolly ask friends who are in the medical profession.
0.855600	I have an excellent understanding of the basic health information to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.722200	Overall, I feel that I have a pretty good capacity for reading and understanding information in medical settings. I am a bit shy, however, so I have trouble with speaking up and asking all of the questions I should ask. Sometimes more technical information on forms confuses me and I get my husband to help me in that case.  Sometimes I also get him to call the doctor or pharmacist for me with my questions.
0.755600	I think I am able to obtain, process and understand basis heath information easily as I am in the medical field myself. I feel competent in understanding diagnosis as well as doctors orders. I Usually don't have any issues filling out medical forms. 
0.672200	As I get older it is a little bit more difficult to understand certain things when they explain to me.  I usually have to ask twice or three times before I am able to fully understand what they are explaining to me.  Some of the medical terms they use are words I have never heard before in my life, so this is why I can get confused at times. 
0.872200	I feel as though I could get the information that I need and process it to a great degree. I tend to bring notebooks with me to the doctor to write down questions I have and what is said to reference in the future.
0.850000	without understanding i can spoil my health mor so first of all understand the problem well then correct  treatment
0.850000	If the issues that I have are basic I feel that I will have more than enough capacity to understand and obtain the information needed to make the correct decision(s) for my benefit. If the issue is something of higher significance I may than need more assistance. 
0.783300	I am very confident that I the ability to obtain proper medical and health decisions. If something isn't clear, I can always ask and find the information I need. I feel confident in my doctor to give me all the information I need.
0.777800	I feel like I am capable of understanding basic health information. I have not had an experience where I did not understand most of the information given to me. I also am in college and planning on going into the medical field, so I would like to say that I should know more than the average person that takes this survey.
0.833300	Although I don't often understand the big words that are used and have had to come home and look some of them up on the internet, the doctors at the clinic I usually go to are pretty good about answering questions and putting it into terms that I can understand. The nurses at the clinic and the hospital are also willing to answer questions to help me understand. And even though I sometimes have felt that I am not sure about making the right decisions I trust the doctors to help me make an informed decision.
0.866700	I feel that I am perfectly capable of understanding most basic health information. But sometimes things can be a little convoluted or confusing and you want someone there with you who can confirm what you heard and understood it the same way that you did. It is also stressful when you are dealing with a health condition and you might miss something while you are worrying and thinking about your health, so it's helpful to have someone along with you to get any information that you might miss.
0.744400	I feel that overall I do OK. I do a lot of research on my own and try to prepare for appointments in advance. If I don't feel a doctor is helpful and really listens to me, I will switch to someone else. 
0.572200	I am very confident in getting all the information that is needed. The reason is very simple I do not trust anyone or anything. By having that believe I always make sure  thing goes smoothly.
0.761100	I know I have the resources to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I may not be able to do so immediately, but with the help of the internet and my wife who is a nurse, I am confident I can understand just about anything I may need to go over with a doctor (non-specialist). Most people can't answer all their own medical questions and I don't think it's fair for anyone to be able to answer medical questions without being given adequate time to look into the questions.
0.855600	I'm not in the medical profession, so I can honestly say that I do need to have some medical information explained to me. I do believe that I'm capable of looking up information about a treatment, diagnosis or medication. I do ask a lot of questions to people providing medical care to make sure I fully understand what is happening and how the treatment options affect me persolly.
0.883300	I feel comfortable seeking medical information and discussing health topics with professiols. Usually can read in office information, talk to health professiols, and/or research information independently.
0.733300	WHEN I GET THE MEDICAL ANTTENTION
0.866700	I feel that I have the capacity to understand a good amount of what doctors or nurses are telling me because I work in the medical field. If I did not, I think it would be much more confusing as a patient,
0.872200	I believe that I can understand basic health information well enough to be able to make appropriate decisions.  I believe this because I have the ability to comprehend what the health professiols are telling me, and if I have questions I will ask them to obtain the answer.
0.550000	It all depends on the wording. If it is placed in simple english then it is easily understood if they attempt to use many weird medical terms then it is different
0.811100	I have a university education so I'm not too concerned about not being able to process or understand basic health information and services needed to make health decisions. With ease of access to information online through a smartphone and being open with medical assistants and practitioners, I believe I am able to understand everything being presented to me. Excessive legalese or use of scientific mes/terminology may give me pause, but I am confident I will be able to find a means of getting layman's definitions for them or convince medical personnel to simplify anything that I might find confusing.
0.716700	I feel like I have the knowledge and resources to typically find out what I need to know if I have any questions. Understanding and comprehending medical conditions isn't very difficult for me, however many of my issues during my life time have been fairly basic. If i were to leave the doctor's office with questions, I would probably do research online.
0.833300	I feel that I have superior capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions. I tend to do my own research before making decisions, sometimes compiling positives and negatives and balancing them to make the most optimal decision.
0.850000	I feel like I can understand most of what is told to me; I also act as another set of ears for my fiance, who has had a number of health issues lately. I make sure to ask questions on anything that we're not completely clear on, and know when to get clarification when needed.
0.777800	I have a basic understanding due to a few courses in school. I took emt training etc
0.750000	I am perfectly capable in obtaining, understanding and processing basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have never needed any help when dealing with these issues.
0.811100	I feel I have a high capacity for understanding health information. I am college educated and have worked in health care for over six years. This gives me an understanding of some basic health knowledge and knowing how the process works.
0.572200	It would help with making sure that it would have a lot of health info, while people are able to have good decisions
0.816700	I make sure I am explained in layman's terms anything I should know about any conditions or symptoms or medicines I need. When I leave the office I am confident I understand throughly and am able to make informed decisions. 
0.916700	From the various tests I've taken in my life I've been judged to be in the upper levels of intelligence. I'm aware of nothing in my experience which do not support those results. Overall, my reading and understanding of English and the ability to comprehend all types of information is more than adequate. 
0.850000	I think I have all of the resources needed to make appropriate health decisions. First off I have a great doctor who is more then willing to answer all questions that I have and he explains information well. I also have the internet of course including some resources there that my doctor has recommended. Overall I have had very few problems and when I do my questions are usually answered satisfactorily. 
0.850000	I am responsible for my own medical appointments and decisions.  I have learned to be self sufficient in that regard and learn the necessary steps to take care of myself.  I believe I have good health insurance, doctors and a pharmacy that willing to take the time to educate me or answer any questions I have.
0.916700	I am the son of a doctor so I am very aware of my health needs and how to read documents. I know what is good for myself and my body and I am able to understand how different procedures affect different outcomes and make a ratiol decision based upon the facts. 
0.888900	I believe that I have a large capacity to obtain all the information and understand it, as I am a person that asks questions of the doctor's so that I know what is going on with my health. I also am one to do my own research on medical conditions by going on health websites. 
0.850000	Well, I have the good fortune to be a fluent speaker of English in a largely English-speaking country and, while I am a pretty low-key individual, I am not afraid to ask a question about something I don't understand.  I am not afraid of looking foolish- it is much better to be properly informed.  While I have a bad tendency to not think of a question fast enough while I'm at the doctor's office, my main physician lets me e-mail him and has answered many of my belated questions that way.
0.661100	I have a good capacity to get the information and services I need.  I have enough insurance coverage to get health services.  I have good doctors who provide me with the information I need.  I can also use the internet to get some information.
0.661100	I believe I have a moderate capacity. The issue is that I have a very limited knowledge of many parts of the body and how they should function with one another properly. It's sad to say but it's true. So it can be difficult and I can require extra explaining when something is wrong with me.
0.911100	I used to sell health insurance so I do not have problems filling out the forms. I understand most of the paperwork. When a doctor is talking to me, they sometimes us terminology that I do not understand but I do not have a problem asking them what that means.
0.444400	I always ask my husband to accompany me to my doctor's appointment because most of the time I can't remember everything the doctor tells me and I can' understand most of the medical terms.  My husband is a nurse so he always go with me in my appointments.
0.855600	I believe that I am quite confident in understanding basic health information and services about my health decisions and other medical conditions that I experience.  I like to do research online and read articles, if not even medical jourls about specific conditions that I experience, or at high-risk for.
0.827800	There is nothing that prevents me from understanding basic health information. I have enough experience with the medical system that I can understand the common terms used in writing and expressed by my doctor.
0.900000	I feel that I am completely capable of obtaining, processing and understanding health information if I need to. I have no defects of vision, education, memory or any other disability that would impair my capability to acquire any information or to understand it.
0.883300	I usually have a good understanding of what is being told to me.  I ask questions when needed and also may look up something about it on the Internet. Then I can make the best decision based on what I have learned about my condition.
0.827800	I feel that I have had enough experience and education to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services I need to make decisions. I have had college courses in biology and health, I have some familiarity with Latin and Greek, and I regularly read science jourls to keep up with discoveries and developments in health sciences.
0.583300	I have to ask questions again if I do not understand.I often have a family member come with me so I do not miss anything.
0.850000	Well I'd rather know than not know so I'm not afraid of asking hard questions and will press if I'm not getting answers that I fully trust or think they might be holding back.  I also think I'm quite capable of understanding my options when explained to me properly as well as of course being able to research my options myself.  All in all I feel quite capable that most of the time I can make good decisions about my health.
0.861100	I am highly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have a strong educatiol background in health and medicine so I understand what I need and expectations for the services should receive. 
0.916700	I feel like I have the capacity to understand health information.  If I ever have any trouble in understanding, I am not ashamed or bashful to ask for further information or a more clear explation from the doctor or nurse.  My husband can look over my paperwork and if he has any questions he will ask me or even call the healthcare professiol.
0.805600	I don't have any trouble understanding materials that are given to me regarding healthcare, but I don't always read everything. I'll read the parts I think are most important. Face-to-face communication with any healthcare provider is difficult because they are usually in a hurry. If I have questions I know I'll want to ask, I'll write them down ahead of time, but there's not time during appointments to discuss anything.
0.916700	I feel that I am of sound mind and body and am more than capable of making decision in regards to my health. I usually don't have issues with taking medications as prescribed, always have a good understanding of what I should and shouldn't do for my ailments, and have the capability of seeking out information I don't have. 
0.511100	It's hard to say. It often depends on what it's about--if it's psychological, I can understand things a bit better, but with most GPs and such it's not something I'm well versed in
0.916700	I am fully capable of processing information from a health professiol.  I am also good at looking up symptoms and I usually am good at figuring out what is wrong.  (For example, my husband had a blood clot in his leg, but I looked it up before he went to the doctor and told him it looked as if it was a superficial clot, and it turned out that is what the doctor said.)  I know that I can go to the doctor for more information when necessary and I know I can get second opinions with serious health concerns. 
0.800000	I believe that I can understand health information better when told in person rather than reading a pamphlet or brochure. This also offers the opportunity to ask questions so that I'm sure to understand something I may have initially missed. 
0.761100	I feel absolutely competent in understanding and processing basic health information to make decisions about my health. However, finding or obtaining information that will truly be helpful to my health is difficult. Intense research is often necessary for basic information. 
0.916700	I feel I have a full capability to process and understand any medical or health information given to me. I know the basics of how the body works, and anything beyond that is not too complicated for me to understand. I feel completely comfortable vigating the health care system.
0.916700	Im typically a detail and fine print person so I always read information thoroughly and if I have a question I ask and build on it if it doesn't make sense to me. An example would be when I had 5 disk fusion surgery on my neck. The Surgeon had given me some pamplets to read that were essentially percentages of improvement. I may have a 20 percent full recovery or 12 percent full use of my right arm or 8 percent no change at all. The percentages made little sense since none left me with a 50 / 50 chance of improvement and I had to ask more questions as to whether this expensive surgery had any upside at all.
0.727800	I feel sort of confident to be able to process the information that I am given by the doctors. I do wish that I had a better way to understand the results  of the blood work and xr and mris.
0.883300	I believe that I am fully capable of understanding most health information that is given to me by any health professiol. I have the means to research things at home. If I don't understand anything, especially certain terms that I have not heard before, I make sure to ask my doctor exactly what that means.
0.866700	to a high degree, I guess.  I have no trouble understanding the information they present to me.  I also have no trouble looking it up.
0.833300	Now most providers have online services so I have message them about anything and ask questions 24 hours a day, its all secure with quick replies too so this makes things easy for me. Anything more complicated I can call or visit my provider, usually get a callback same day and an appointment within 48 hours. Health related things are a lot more efficient and accessible than even just 5 years ago.
0.622200	I understand basic of the medical term.  If I still not fully understand at the office, I will do more research or asked my sister for help. Because she is an nurse too. 
0.738900	Yes I feel that I do. I have dealt with hospitals and medical things quite a bit due to my children.
0.827800	I feel I am quite knowledgeable about my health problems and can understand what is said to me
0.900000	Yes I am quite confident that I can ask the right questions plus plenty more they probably don't want me to ask. My knowledge comes from many years of using tural methods of healing over traditiol methods.
0.722200	I think I have the ability to obtain a lot of information on the internet.  I can't obtain information from other people as much as from the internet because I'm not around people much especially medical people and because it's very difficult for me to think of everything if I'm talking to someone so sometimes I don't end up asking anything and sometimes I only ask one or two things that I've already thought a lot about.  I think I can usually understand information on the internet, though I think sometimes both the internet and doctors and nurses don't give much information because they don't think I need to know much.
0.900000	I'm pretty confident with my understanding and basic knowledge of the health information, and I do rely quite a bit on online information, if I didn't understand something even after I ask my doctor, I spend a considerable amount to research more online. It also helps that I have a couple doctors in my family as well as a good friend of mine who is also a doctor (in addition to my own doctor) so I talk to them quite a bit whenever I have questions, although sometimes it can get confusing to get multiple answers from different people at the same time (one may say I need more meds for my cholesterol, another says i don't need that much, etc).
0.916700	I can understand the materials that are given to me by a  doctor and I fully understand what they tell me about any problems that I may have. If I don't understand something, I always ask the doctor to explain it to me. Any forms that I need to fill out I can usually fill them out all by myself without any help. If I have a question about a field to fill out on a form I will ask the receptionist about it. I will then fill out the form completely. I don't make any decisions without knowing the consequences of those decisions first.I always ask the doctor of my options, so I can fully understand what I need to do.
0.883300	It's easy for me because I'm obsessed with health and fitness (tural bodybuilder since the age of 16). I have no illnesses and pretty much never get sick, so I seldom have anything to process. When the occasion does arise, my tural interest and passion for health causes me to exert more effort to understand and assimilate the information, that's a large part of why it comes easily.
0.916700	I have strong abilities to understand medical information and research things I don't understand so I can ask my medical providers informed questions without wasting their time or mine. 
0.761100	I believe I am knowledgeable enough to understand most basic information. However, I do tend to ask a lot of questions just to make sure I get everything right. Especially when it comes to your health, it is always good to get more information and clarification. 
0.572200	well fortutely there is the internet,and i can search for more information about the things i dont know enough about.without that i doubt i could find the info easily.
0.900000	I am a fluent English writer and speaker and I can read very well.  I am very aware of what the Doctor or Nurse is telling me and I clearly understand what they are saying. 
0.777800	My doctors and nurses tell me what to do, give me the phone number and explain to me what will be done and when it needs to be done.
0.850000	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Occaisiolly if there is language or benefits that are worded in a confusing manner I can call my benefit provider for clarification. 
0.750000	i think i do but sometimes it is hard to understand what some terms mean but i always find the answer if i dont understand something 
0.750000	I feel I have adequate ability to understand basic health information and services in regards to using it to make intelligent health decisions. My introverted ture makes face-to-face conversations awkward and I tend to avoid them. But I am usually offered ample written material that I can read on my own.
0.916700	I have a good relationship with my doctor.  He is very down to earth, understanding and easy to talk to. I feel comfortable sharing information.  He is good at explaining information.  I have a lot of trust in him and this helps me to make appropriate health decisions.
0.838900	I feel I'm well informed on most medical matters that affect me. When I have questions I usually search the internet first. I view several sites and read a couple articles to get a consensus. 
0.916700	I have an understanding of my medical problems, so I feel that what the doctors recommend, I am able to make a decision.  If there is an option that I am not aware of, I will have the doctor explain it to me.
0.594400	I'm not too well versed on medical conditions and what causes them so I always get a little worried. Insurance and how it relates to health throws a wrench in things 
0.883300	I am very confident about my abilities to read and understand health information. Sometimes I may need help to understand some of the medical jargon used but overall I can do it by myself.
0.644400	I feel I have a basic understanding of health information that is provided to me by my doctor.  If I am confused by information I will look it up on the Internet for clarification. I believe with my knowledge and the Internet I came make informed decisions. 
0.883300	I feel pretty confident in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I believe I have a pretty good idea of how to keep myself fit and healthy. If I have any questions for my doctor, I'll ask them. I'm always careful to follow my doctor's advice/orders very carefully. 
0.855600	I think my ability to understand is good and I also have the ability to research answers from places like Mayo Clinic online.  But sometimes I do find it hard to talk to doctors and hard to be able to assess if they understood 'me' as opposed to me understanding them.  I think I'm capable of making appropriate health decisions.
0.661100	I can do as well as the next person i think But when they start talking to fast it can go over my head. I feel I am smart enough to understand most subjects and health care is no different.
0.822200	I feel that I have a good grasp of the terminology often used, and if I don't I feel confident enough to ask questions of my doctor or to search for the definitions of the terminology on the internet.
0.672200	I feel like a normal capacity to understand and absorb basic health questions, if I needed to make an appropriate decision.
0.850000	I think I clearly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself. I am quite intelligence and have never had a problem understanding health information and if I din't, I knew where to find the information to explain it.
0.705600	I feel that I have enough knowledge to understand basic health information.  I am able to review and understand all the information that is given to me by healthcare professiols.
0.866700	I feel that I'm pretty good at understanding health information and for the few instances where I'm not completely sure, I ask the doctor questions. So I think that I have a really firm grasp of what I need to know to make a good health decision.
0.833300	In my opinion, I have a high degree of capacity to obtain and coherently process my health information. I've thus far accurately understood my treatment plans and executed effective decisions that have had great outcomes.
0.538900	I feel that some doctors could be better at explaining medical conditions in a way that normal people can understand it. Sometimes it's difficult to understand what they mean, but occasiolly I am too embarrassed to ask what they mean exactly. In that case I will look it up myself later. I realize that it would be better to actually ask the doctor, because the internet is not always the most reliable place to find information. So I feel that I do have the capacity to get the information, but I don't always do it because I feel intimidated by some doctors.
0.844400	I feel quite confident in being able to understand basic health services and information. If there is anything I'm unsure about I ask my doctor. If it's after I've left the doctor's office, the internet can be a helpful tool in better understand certain services or diagnosis.
0.850000	Overall I am confident in my abilities here. The greatest worries come in areas where there is a great deal of conflicting information in circulation, such as on appropriate macronutrient balance for diet. Then I feel I have to fall back on my own judgment rather than that of my own doctor, which is risky.
0.916700	I feel like I have a great understanding of getting and processing the information I need regarding my health. I have no issues.
0.816700	I feel that I do have the capacity to process and understand the information needed on my health issues. My concerns are that the health care professiols are not providing me the true information that I need to get the proper treatment. 
0.833300	I am very attentive to my Health and always ask questions about different situations when I don't understand. And when it comes to finding additiol information on a particular subject I am either on the internet or ask my doctor if I am not sure.
0.611100	YES BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T ASK YOU WILL NEVER KNOW ARE UNDERSTAND 
0.716700	I feel that I have the ability to process and understand my health information by speaking with my doctors and their office assistants, including visits to specialists and labs. Details I may want to investigate are very often found online.  But when it comes to the fincial aspect of healthcare and health insurance I have often been confused and intimidated. The past several years have been much better with the help of the ACA and Covered California; but I am extremely worried that Republican legislation will end all that and allow insurance companies to focus on their profits instead of getting healthcare to those that need it.
0.866700	I think I can read and understand most information presented to me and If I have any problems I usually just ask somebody.
0.750000	I think I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Generally I can understand most things but sometimes I might need help for the more complicated issues.
0.883300	I feel that I have a high capacity to understand health information. If I need clarification, I have no problem asking a health care professiol. 
0.788900	I have the capacity to make health decisions with occasiol help. I am dealing with several health problems and sometimes my daughter goes with me to the doctor so she can understand what is happening to me medically and what she can do to help. I thank God I have her!
0.888900	I believe I have full capacity to understand and make health care decisions for myself and my family. I can understand most of what the doctors and nurses tell me, and when I don't, I ask questions to clarify.
0.794400	I think I have this capacity to a high degree. At least on par with others. I also don't hesitate to ask health professiols to explain anything that I don't understand.
0.761100	I am confident that I can process most of the health information. Before I make an appropriate health decision I usually ask at least two different doctors for opinion. I am really confident that I can make an appropriate health decision because I process the information carefully and with help of specialists.
0.733300	I think that my understanding of medical terminology is better than average.  I try to do a good deal of research before a doctor visit, and I will ask appropriate questions when there.  
0.866700	I have no problem with asking questions which make me feel comfortable about understanding basic health issues.  Sometimes I get uncomfortable with trying to process information becasue some types of ambiguities are usually involved.  I don't try to understand too much of what I am told because I trust the health professiols that I am dealing with.
0.822200	I feel I have a high capacity in general regarding those questions. I ask so many questions of my Doctor he gets irritated, but I get my answers. :) I believe I understand basic health information, and if I don't there are people I can ask - and an entire internet to search - for answers. Sometimes the official forms are intimidating. I try to take all forms slow and question what I don't understand.
0.500000	To a very high degree
0.811100	I have confidence that I am able to obtain all basic health information. I know there are plenty of people that can explain and help me understand the important information if I need help.
0.838900	To some degree. I do feel like healthcare professiols are able to answer my questions when I see them. The trouble is being able to afford to go to the doctor very often.
0.916700	At one time, years ago, I studied biology, Latin and Greek. If I find my understanding of a document or information is uncertain, I look it up. The internet can be a good resource for information. So is a library.
0.588900	When it comes to basic health information, I would like to think I know as much as the average person--I at least possess the capacity to understand said information. If worse comes to worse, I can Google it later--after years of practice, I am quite adept at Googling and finding information that I can understand myself.
0.861100	I am quite able to process medical info if it is free of medical jargon, chemical mes, latin mes, and what i call medicalese which is like legalese.I don't retain info when in pain so well, that is when I bring an extra pair of ears so to speak.
0.766700	If I don't understand something I ask questions.  I would rather talk with someone than read about instructions or explations of my care.  I feel that after asking questions I am well informed to make decisions for myself.
0.766700	I have the capacity to understand and convey my basic health information
0.844400	I think have a better than average understanding of medical information and general medical knowledge. When it comes to advanced information I can figure out the important things although I sometimes don't understand the technical details. Dealing with basic health information is no problem for me.
0.727800	I feel that with the internet I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions- but that is done on my own time outside of the doctors office. I do not feel that health officials play a key role as more often than not they are rushed and not listening to concerns. If I or another family member are seeking diagnosis, I will give as much information as I know to have but can't say that I have the details or knowledge to know which specific questions to ask. As for documents pertaining to medical procedures or medical information they are often confusing and difficult to understand in the short time allotted. 
0.833300	I have had several minor and a major surgery. Before I make any decision I make sure the doctor or nurse explain in basic language what I need to know. I will also take notes of what I am being told. I will go online and do some research and after that discuss it with my doctor. When filling out paperwork if I do not understand something I will ask questions until I understand.
0.511100	I think I am starting to understand important health information. Before I filly found good health insurance, I ended up reviewing a ton of possible health conditions I could have before filly going to the doctor.  These supposed conditions prepared me for the future conversations I would receive at the doctors. 
0.827800	I feel have an average capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to help me make appropriate decisions. Sometimes I ask questions for clarification and sometimes I am afraid or hesitant to ask but I think for the most part that is average. I rarely need help filling out forms.
0.722200	I feel I can adequately obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I persolly haven't had many health related issues, but my family has.  My experience in this matter mostly comes from my family's medical history and my wife whom works in a doctor's office.
0.916700	I feel that I have the utmost ability to understand basic health information and services. I am fully confident with my ability and have never needed assistance.
0.844400	I feel as if I have the capacity to obtain or understand most basic health information and services needed to make my own health decisions.
0.650000	I feel comfortable enough understanding health situations where I have to make a choice on behalf of either myself or my kids. Our doctors are generally pretty good about explaining things, which makes us feel comfortable asking questions. I think that a person's capacity to process and obtain health info like this does largely depend on the doctor's ability to explain things in a way that makes sense to a patient/caregiver, and our doctors are very solid in this area.
0.944400	I think i hav no problem with any of that
0.727800	For me sometime, it is difficult to understand the hand written explation of health and i need to check with doctor / nurse to clarify again about it. I always ask question if i am unsure about the health situation to my doctor during the visit.
0.766700	I feel that overall I can make a good decisions. Sometimes things confuse me but I try and ask questions if they do. 
0.777800	I think I do have the capacity to understand all the basic health information needed, whenever I don't understand something am not afraid to ask the medical personnel and with the help of all these free online resources, life has been made much easier, I can google something for further clarification.
0.861100	I feel that I have no problem understanding medical information about my medical information. Not only has this been a problem for me but I have gone to doctors appointments with multiple older family members to make sure someone understands their issues. 
0.883300	Because of my extensive experience in the field of medical transcription and the need to understand what I am typing makes sense, as well as conversations with my doctor and my children's doctor, I feel very capable of obtaining, process, and understand the health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.883300	I feel that I can certainly obtain, process and understand basic health information and services when I need to make health decisions. At anytime I don't understand something, I will ask a knowledgeable person about what they think, ask them to explain it to me in a better manner or point me in the direction of the information that I'm needed to make an informed decision. I haven't ran into too many instances where I needed additiol assistance in understand and making health issues.
0.783300	Yes, I can understand all of thec forms I need to fill out.  I can understand and ask questions about information told to me verbally.  Some complicated written material in medical language, I cannot understand.

0.627800	I feel comfortable. I have more capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.900000	I feel I'm full capable of understanding medical information. Things that may not be clear I ask the doctor for additiol information. If it's something I want to know more about I research it online. I'm always well informed about my health. 
0.827800	I feel that I can understand most of it If not, I can ask a doctor or pharmacist, or research it on the internet.
0.794400	I feel like overall I can articulate my needs and get the help I need/ understand the basics of the medical care I receive.  I do more often than not withhold some information from my doctor because I didn't want to get a lecture. For example, i am on the keto diet,  which has done wonders for my labs,  weight, etc. Yet when i mention it all I get is how bad it is... It's really frustrating. So i feel like the communication is not there and i often feel rushed and just put to the side in terms of the concerns I have. I'm very information literate and able to understand studies and research results,  so I'm usually mostly put of by my physician's ibility to consider other options or opinions. 
0.761100	I can understand most things concerning health, but rarely ask for help when I do. That is a bad trait on my part.
0.822200	I have access to online information. I can get a second opinion and compare results from multiple websites related to the information I am trying to research. medical terminology is difficult but very specific and usually much easier to search for than more generic terms used in legal or home and car repair. that''s an advantage
0.900000	I majored in biology so it's easy for me to understand health information. And on the rare occasions when I am uble to process information, I ask a lot of questions to make sure I understood the information I was given. And I also search online for information that furthers my understanding. 
0.872200	I feel I have a moderate to high degree to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed.  I believe in my abilities to make appropriate health decisions with the advice of seasoned professiols.
0.900000	I have never experienced problems understanding health questions.I have been successful researching any conditions I need to seek medical attention for and have a large support group in the medical community 
0.916700	I feel confident reading and understanding written medical information.  I feel confident that I can understand verbal information a doctor or nurse tells me. I feel confident understanding information a pharmacist tells me. I feel confident that I ask important questions of a doctor or nurse if I am given time.  However, with some doctors and nurses I feel rushed and don't get to ask all the questions I would like to.  This happens more than I would like.
0.866700	I feel very able to obtain, process, and understand medical and health information in order to make my health decisions. I read a lot of 'altertive health' perspectives, which are written by people who are not constrained by the rulings of the AMA, and can speak more openly about the medical system, without fear of losing their jobs. 
0.833300	I have more than the necessary amount of competency, capacity, and ability to effectively and appropriately obtain, process, and comprehend medical and health related information. This competency has been fortified as a result of my educatiol and professiol background. 
0.794400	i feel like if there is information i'm curious or want to ask about i'm capable enough to get the answers that i'm looking for about my health situation
0.794400	I feel comfortable reading complicated documents and sifting through insurance information, policies, and procedures. I sometimes lack the confidence to ask the doctor all of the questions I have because I feel bad taking up too much of their time. That is something I need to work on. 
0.855600	I can usually understand most information given me and I am determined enough to make sure that doctors listen to me and that they explain things I am uncertain about. My biggest concern is that I don't always know what questions to ask. 
0.916700	I feel I am very much capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions regarding my health. I am of sound mind and body.
0.827800	I am confident in my abilities to read and understand health information that is given to me. It is crucial to know at least the basic stuff and that is pretty reasoble to identify. I can make health decisions on behalf of myself because I am good at cooperating with doctors. 
0.861100	I feel I am pretty competent to fill out forms and make basic decisions regarding health issues. I feel like I have enough experience in making these decisions that I would trust my judgment. 
0.900000	Given that I recently had to do research to write a paper on mR and learn lots of interesting new things about how R and D are used in cellular structures and that, in standardized testing, my written communication skills were ranked in the 96th percentile I'd have to say that the previous questions hardly apply to me. There is very little that I read aside from articles on physics that I have difficulty understanding.
0.777800	I feel a higher than normal degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information because I had to function as my own healthcare advocate when getting a cancer and precancer diagnosis. I was referred from one doctor to another so I learned really quickly to come into the office with a list of questions to ask.
0.827800	I have a good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I can fill in forms rather easily and, aside from the insurance part, seldom have questions in regards to forms or information given to me by the doctors or nurses. I have a fairly good knowledge of the body and its processes.
0.733300	I am a tive speaker of English, I have the ability to look up information about drugs and diseases, I can ask questions to doctors, nurses and pharmacists and I can get second opinions.
0.866700	I am currently cogent and intellectually capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information.  I used to work in the health insurance industry and that work gave me some good insights into medical jargon and the red tape in getting medical care.  I also helped both my parents in the last years of their lives with vigating medical information.
0.833300	I think I understand any written material and forms I am given.  Occasiolly I have trouble asking doctors questions because I usually recall them after its too late and the appointment is over.  At that point I usually try to find the answer on the internet. 
0.833300	I feel that I have an adequate degree of confidence in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make the best decisions regarding my own health. Ive had medical problems since I was 13 so the hospital literature was what I read many many times over.
0.850000	I once worked in healthcare. I also read medical literature and websites often. I am aware of many prescription medications and types of conditions.
0.883300	Because of a disease I was diagnosed with over 20 years ago, I've learned a lot of terminology related to medical health.  I'm not afraid to ask my doctors questions or for thorough explations if necessary.  It's been my experience that doctors are always very willing to take the time to explain. My husband has EMT training and his knowledge helps sometimes.
0.744400	I feel that I have a high degree of understanding and capacity to obtain and process basic health information and services.  I am able to make appropriate health decisions and I am confident in my ability to do so.
0.622200	I think that the internet really helps because I can look up things I don't understand. It is much easy than asking questions in person when I am nervous.
0.777800	I am ninety-nine percent  confident that I would be able to understand, process and obtain basic health information. There are many sources and information that are available to help me make the right decisions, for example religion, family, internet etc. 
0.811100	I feel like I have the capacity to understand the information.  I feel that it is extremely difficult to either ask the right questions or get the doctor to take time to explain things in-depth.  I usually leave frustrated that I don't have the information I need to make a good decision.
0.705600	I believe I have quite the capacity to obtain. I can use the people around me, the internet, and the doctor/nurses to explain the rest. I'm not going to leave with questions still on my mind.
0.816700	My family took care of my mother for 7 years before she died. I was the main caregiver. I learned that you must be proactive with your own health or anyone you're caring for. I know how to ask questions when I don't understand something. I know how to research it and gain the knowledge I need to feel comfortable with whatever it is I'm trying to understand.
0.811100	I feel I somewhat have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the info I need to make health decisions. Sometimes, however, I feel rushed and don't think of questions until after I see a doctor or nurse. Other times I feel like I just don't know what questions to ask. I usually just ask the doctor for their opinion of what I should do and try to trust what I'm told. 
0.900000	I can talk to my doctor about anything that is related to my health and I know how to ask my doctor questions.
0.722200	I'm a smart guy so I have A basic grasp of what's happening but it's always better to be completely sure and not make any foolish mistakes.
0.866700	I have the ability to do so, and usually feel at ease enough with the process. I sometimes am confused, but do my best to seek answers.
0.883300	I feel that I have the general medical understanding to be able to accurately decipher health forms and information. If it is, for some reason, very complicated I do have resources to assist me. I am not afraid to ask questions of my health professiols if needed. 
0.872200	I have the capacity to do all of that, as long as it's out there on the internet. Medical office people usually are rushed or too busy to answer all questions or at least not to the detail I want.
0.650000	I'm kind of confident about my capacity to obtain, process and understand the basic health information and services. Based on the basic medical knowledge that I have, with the help from online searching, self-learning and the help from family members, I can understand the majority of health info, if I still have questions, I will ask the doctors/nurses until I understand it completely. 
0.800000	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information. When I have doubts I some times go online and do some research.
0.916700	I feel that I am completely competent as I have excellent reading comprehension and a background in science.
0.688900	Overall, if I do not understand any health information or services, I have a few people in my family that would be skilled at answering any questions that I have. Therefore, after getting these people involved, I think I would have the capacity to obtain and then understand this information once I have talked with these people.
0.916700	I am of sound mind and well researched. I know how to read and write and I can understand information or find answers on my own. But I'm not afraid to ask for help if I need it because my health is important. 
0.788900	I have a pretty average capacity to obtain and understand health information. I see a pulmonologist and a regular doctor regularly and always have questions that usually either get answered or I get referred to the appropriate doctor. There are a few conditions I have that I have a hard time explaining and getting an explation about from my doctors. Why it sometimes feels like my heart is beating harder than it is, for example.
0.766700	I usually have no problem understanding, processing, and obtaining basic health information and am very able to make appropriate decisions.  When I am in need of medical help, I usually make the appointment needed at a local clinic and the P.A. I like to go to is very good about explaining things, and making sure medical information is understood, as well as provided.  I also feel comfortable asking her questions. 
0.833300	Reading and understanding health information and services is a full time job!. have trouble understanding words used in health care. In some instances, a word may be totally unfamiliar. In other cases, a word may be familiar, but the i may not understand it in a health care context. For example, upon hearing âkeep your glucose in a normal range,â people know what normal means about a person, and they may have a range in their kitchen, but they may miss the intended concept in terms of health care. Even people who understand the concept may need more information than the phrase provides. They need to be told what glucose measurements are considered normal.
0.883300	If the information is written in a way that an average person can understand, then I will be able to understand it. If there's a lot of medical jargon, I'm going to have a problem understanding it.
0.850000	I feel in most cases I have the sufficient capacity to acquire the necessary information needed to understand health information. I believe I am capable of obtaining meaningful and detailed information of any and all information relevant to my needs as related to health issues. This includes relevant resources such health care professiols for particular medical conditions.
0.644400	I will do more research and ask the questions next time when I visit them.  Therefore, I will be fully understand. 
0.900000	I think that I have a decent understanding of basic health concepts. If I happen to have a question, I do ask my doctor, if I happen to be in his office. I also look up information online on sites such as WebMD. 
0.916700	I feel completely able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. The language of health information material tends to be in the simplest form possible while still accurately conveying the necessary information. The great majority of health care professiols that I have dealt with make a point of assuring themselves that I understand the information necessary for decision making. They also invite questions. 
0.583300	When I do not get all the information that I need I usually go to the internet for any missing or additiol information I might need. The health industry has gotten a lot more complicated in all levels of health. From making simple appointments to diagnosing, to the right health care needs and all of the complications with insurance , how to pay and how much health care cost. The healthcare industry is overwhelming and that is an understatement. If someone needs an example of a broken system all they need to do is look at the healthcare industry. 
0.900000	I can understand what I'm told to me by a doctor but when they use terms that I've never heard of before I get them to explain it to me in terms that the everyday person understands. I can understand all the basic info they tell me.
0.800000	I've only got a college education, but despite my setback, I DO understand basic health questions that I'm asked, and can explain what I'm feeling to a medical professiol. The only real problem lies in actually communicating my issues, instead of just passively letting them go unmentioned. However, I certainly know how to fill out forms and talk to doctors and nurses, and I can read the abbreviations on my prescription labels. 
0.511100	I do not have the full capacity to do those things. I have a caretaker that helps me with these things. 
0.900000	I can easily obtain and understand health information provided to me by medical professiols. Usually the medical condition is explained multiple times by the nurse and doctor. Also, they usually give you educatiol literature to take home and read. 
0.488900	Reading health information is scary and understanding the services offered is so confusing because for one symptom or one health condition different doctors take a different approach so since it not universal we get confused. So I always go on trustable sites and view the health condition in detail.  I also consult my family doctors whom I can trust to ankle appropriate health decisions.
0.850000	I feel that most of the time I'm aware of what's going on with my medical issues and can communicate that to the medical personnel that I interact with. I do research online to supplement what I learn during appointments as well as to find more information on issues that may not be significant enough to take up a lot of appointment time. Occasiolly I have to interact with a medical professiol who seems to not be paying attention (or seems to dislike me), and I do find that frustrating and tend to not communicate very well in those situations. But overall, I feel pretty confident in my ability to understand and communicate about my medical issues.
0.700000	I have basic knowledge of health issues, but I have difficulty understanding complex concepts and advanced language about health issues
0.766700	I think I'm perfectly capable of understanding anything a doctor tells me, but sometimes I need to have them clarify the information for me.
0.900000	I have capacity mentally as there is nothing hindering my thinking and reasoning  ability. Moreover, I have great capacity to obtain, process and understanding the information that the doctor or nurse provides me, since the doctors and nurses answer any questions I have for them. Thy also provide any information I need.  They will go into as much detail as necessary until I understand.
0.883300	I think, that I have the capacity to get all the health information I need to make the right decision. I am capable of getting all the info and to understand what is needed in my case.
0.716700	I feel I have a decent capacity to make health decisions. If I need help or advice, I can ask friends or family. I can also look up information on the internet, search through forums, and research what others have done when in similar situations.
0.783300	I am confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information when making health decisions. The doctors I see are very helpful and competent in explaining things when I do have questions.
0.916700	I feel I am able to understand basic health information very well. While I may not know all of the medical terminology I understand what is right and wrong
0.850000	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision. It is very likely that resort to more than one opinion and seek out someone to consult with before filizing a decision. 
0.588900	The best formula for making health decisions is to combine the most reliable medical facts with our persol values. These include our beliefs, fears, lifestyle, and experiences, and they all play a role in helping us make decisions about our health.
0.655600	My doctor is very good about answering all of my questions in the most simple way possible and is very patient about me asking a ton of questions, so I very rarely feel like I don't know exactly what's going on. 
0.888900	I understand the basic terms health professiols use. Whenever they use a term that I'm not familiar with, I feel capable of asking them to clarify it in terms that I understand.
0.850000	I feel I have a good understanding of medical terminology, and when in doubt I always ask my medical practitioner, or do some online research. 
0.594400	I think as long as the information is simple I can understand it. I hate when doctors give you the medical term that I cannot pronounce or spell. I try to ask as many questions as possible.
0.855600	I have sufficient knowledge and reading comprehension skills to understand basic medical information. I've also had fairly extensive experience with care issues of family members over many years, so I've gleaned a fair amount of basic medical knowledge.
0.883300	Basic health information is easy. Some of it is common sense. The technical stuff I can get from the internet. The doctor's recommendation is just opinion until I can get it verified. 
0.572200	I think i have a fairly good capacity to retain information. Hearing it from a Doctor, Nurse or even my wife is my best way to get the information. While reading it i often get distracted and lose focus. Same goes for writing and filling out forms. 
0.916700	I feel I am excellent at obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. If I have a question after I leave the office I know who to call for answers. I always ask questions of the nurse or doctor while in the office if I feel I do not understand what is part of the treatment or medication. I read medication leaflets and call the doctor with questions.
0.827800	I think I have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. My medical practitioner often explain any health reviews or concerns to me in a simpler form. Anything I truly don't understand, I would ask for an explation right away. Sometimes there's medical information that I don't mentally process until later, which leaves me with many unswered questions. When that happens, I can utilize the internet, speak to my mother or best friend (they're both nurses), or call the clinic the following day to gain more information. I have many options to help me feel secure.
0.822200	I don't go to a doctor very often so I am unfamiliar with their processes. I have a pretty good grip of English so I understand most of what they are saying and usually figure out the rest.
0.788900	I think I can understand most things if they are presented in layman's terms.  If I can't I know I can research things on the internet to get a better idea.
0.883300	100%. I'm completely comfortable in these areas. 
0.916700	I believe I have a well developed capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information, and to take advantage of services, where applicable, to make appropriate health decisions.  The problem for me is not one of being able to understand materials, issues, and choices, it is about making the best choice with the available information, which is sometimes lacking, ambiguous, disjointed, incomplete, or even biased and perhaps incorrect.   I frequently consult with other health professiols when forming judgments about health decisions, and almost always benefit in the long term from doing so.
0.900000	I have the capacity to obtain & understand the information unless there are some medical jargons or procedures that need further explation from them.
0.888900	I have a bachelors degree in Clinical Laboratory Science and I currently work in a genetics laboratory so I feel very confident that I can understand basic health information. Before working here, I worked at a hospital for 10 years and then at a physician's office for a couple of years. I also take yearly courses in the laboratory science to satisfy my CEU requirements for my state laboratory license.   I also feel very confident that I can make appropriate decisions about what services I may need.  If there is anything I don't understand about a condition I have the knowledge to search for the appropriate information and the mental capacity to sift through to gather correct information.  
0.727800	I feel in most situations I am able to understand and process the information that I am given in regards to my health.  There are times though when I do have to ask the doctor or nurse to explain what they are saying to me again to make sure that I understand exactly.
0.766700	I feel somewhat confident.  Some doctors have accents or use medical jargon, which makes it difficult to understand what they're saying.  Sometimes I have to ask a nurse to explain things thoroughly.
0.777800	these days I feel that I am more educated about health information, as I am seeking the information before and after I visit a doctor to get a better understanding of my case and to integrate the information I get from the doctor with what I can do to help myself as well.
0.766700	I am a graduate student, so I think I have a fairly high level of comprehension and am able to quickly research answers whenever I am unsure of something. However, as I come from a family with a lot of medical professiols, I often second guess things way too much and have difficulty actually making decisions without consulting others.
0.766700	I am quite literate. I ask physicians questions, instead of being nervous in a medical office and thinking I'll ask someone later. I ask questions about how behaviors could possibly lead to conditions. My mother has worked in the medical field so she helps me. I look up terms online.
0.872200	I am old enough that there aren't many surprises when it comes to my health or in-care services. I routinely do a lot of research when something new comes up.  I have a lot of experience in forgetting to ask the right questions until after the fact.
0.833300	I feel I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. I study a lot on health myself, work in the health field at an Assisted Living facility, and have a lot of information available on the internet to assist me in decisions.
0.883300	I think I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions completely. I rarely have any issues when filling out health documents or understanding a medical condition or forms. If I do have any questions, they are always answered and I understand them before leaving.
0.661100	I feel I'm well versed and educated enough to ask the questions necessary to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  The issue that comes up most often is an unwillingness to ask the necessary questions; or at times it is difficult to recall all the details of my own medical history given that I do not hold all of the relevant records and information.  My medical history is either held by my doctors or in some instances by my mother. 
0.883300	I think that for the most part i understand what the doctor tells me concerning information about my health, sometimes if something is written down it could be hard to understand because of the hand writing and then i would ask  to explain to me what is written.  
0.900000	I have access to  most if not all the information I need .. my health care  providers have always answered my questions.
0.672200	I think that I can understand basic health decisions but more info on advantage illnesses when they occur or am told about them. I can gain more knowledge through them and the internet
0.805600	I think I am highly capable of making appropriate health decisions.  Even when doctors are not clear always clear to me, I am able to ask for more information when I feel that it is important that I fully understand what I'm told.  Doctors often spew a lot of medical terminology that not everyone can understand so I often do my own research after and later ask for more emphasis or for advice from friends who are also in the medical profession.   Once I fully process what I need, I then make the changes needed to feel better and healthier.
0.900000	I feel I understand it quite well. If I have a question I don't hesitate to ask someone. Some of it can be confusing at times, always ask if uncertain. So far in me life I have had no problems understanding and processing health information.
0.761100	It depends on the nurse/doctor helping me, some explain things in a hard way to understand. I feel that I have the capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, although it can be a complicated subject to understand the basics are pretty understandable.
0.588900	I can do my best.  I know english obviously however there are ideas and concepts I may be missing out on.  An experts time and input is appreciated.
0.794400	There is an Internet to search for the information (i.e. medical terms, conditions, symptoms, ... etc..) and knowledge to read and learn. My physician will explain my illness and the treatments options when the tests results came out. Of course, I may ask any questions to my doctor. There are plenty of doctors to let you have the second opinion. I believe that most of people can make appropriate health decisions as long as you have a clear mind and know how to read and write because everyone concerns about their health conditions very much unless they give up.  
0.866700	I feel I have a pretty good capacity because I know how to look up what I don't know and ask what I don't know and in college I took many biology related classes that helps me digest some medical terms.
0.800000	I am really good at understanding information but I am not good at asking appropriate questions because I feel like I do not get good answers.
0.916700	I feel that I have a high capacity to understand my basic health information.  Unfortutely, I have had a chronic illness for many years so I have learned a lot about basic health information.
0.672200	I believe that i have access to any type of resource that i need in order to obtain information to make medical decisions. There are a lot of ways  can go about this such as asking a loved one, asking a pharmacist, asking the doctor, or calling in to the doctors office and speaking to a nurse. 
0.583300	I believe that i have enough understanding of health information to make a judgement or decision concerning my health. If i do mot understand something i will either look it up, or ask questions about it
0.861100	I am only 30 so I am capable of reading and doing research on the internet of people with similar problems. I also am able to view the different literature and opinions to find the appropriate health decisions.
0.844400	With the internet, I have so much access to information that I feel like I could always find a source that made sense to me.  If one trusted website is a little over my head, I'm sure I could find another that made more sense to me.
0.855600	if i dont understand something i usually just pull it up on my phone. i dont try to look for anything other than what it means, i then if i dont know exactly i ask the doctor or look for more indepth info
0.850000	I always fill out my own information. I do a lot of research on conditions I have so that I am educated. I have PTSD and fibromyalgia. I fill out a lot of forms. I also am a Therapeutic Support Staff so I do a lot of paperwork involving data collection and personal information so I have to know what I am doing.
0.900000	I am perfectly capable of researching my own health conditions and being fully prepared to deal with them with a doctors help. I have questioned my doctors diagnoses before based on my own research. And it turns out I was correct. 
0.916700	I can do everything I need to make health decisions. I understand documents,treatment plans, etc very easily. And if I don't I know what questions to ask and what research I can do on my own.
0.883300	I am able to understand my condition because if I have any questions, I will ask them. I will look to a doctor's treatment plan as a recommendation but not as the only option. Once diagnosed with something, I will research the condition on my own and see all of the alternatives. I will search for cases very similar to my own and look for information about how others treated this condition most successfully. I will not just follow what a doctor says without researching for myself. 
0.588900	I feel capable
0.883300	I have an environmental engineering background so am comfortable reading about technical issues.  I am also an inquisitive person so I am comfortable researching topics. 
0.883300	I feel that I can read basic health information just as long as it doesn't involve very technical terms that a normal person wouldn't understand.
0.916700	I am an intelligent and discerning person capable of understanding medical explanations, I have a mature understanding of biology, physiology, and medicines, and am highly confident that I can learn and utilize my skills to obtain any pertinent knowledge that I should have regarding my own health and diseases.
0.872200	Overall I feel pretty confident. However, sometimes I don't think of the best questions to ask the healthcare professional while I am meeting with them. Sometimes I dont' think of the best questions until after I have already left.
0.883300	I'm experienced enough that I've accumulated significant knowledge already. I can always access my health providers website or ask my doctor if I have questions. There are also thousands of websites providing an abundance of information. I have watched many hours of medical television and have become familiar with medical terminology.
0.833300	I think a have a good capacity to understand what health informations, I always ask my doctors to explain everything I want to know and I also do research.
0.883300	I know how to find the answers to my questions if I have any via web, medical professionals and friends. 
0.916700	I feel i can relate symptoms to known conditions and input my own variables into the equation to make sure everything is correct. I also sometimes rely on stories from people with similar conditions and things that didn't/did work for them.
0.916700	At or above the level that a non medical professional can.
0.827800	I have all or most of the necessary abilities in terms of being able to understand what's being communicated to me. However, my issue is more that, sometimes, I do not seek medical advice because I have other priorities. Alternatively, I really value my privacy and might feel like I do not want others telling me how to act, regardless of their expertise. 
0.916700	I think I have a pretty good capacity to do so. I can easily read and understand most medical literature and I know what information to seek out and what questions to ask. I also feel confident about my ability to conduct independent research online or anywhere else.
0.850000	I am willing to do whatever research is necessary to make sure I fully understand the situation. I fell that when I make a decision it is based on the best information available. 
0.900000	I for the most part understand the basic health information that is presented to me. And i am also confident in making a executive decision towards my health. 
0.722200	I think I can process health information well because I listen to my doctor or nurse. I have the knowledge to look up and remember what I should do in certain medical situations.
0.916700	I'm very confident. I worked as a surgical tech for 10 years and have a degree in biology so I'm well versed in medical research and how to understand it and comfortable with medical terminology.
0.872200	I feel very capable of locating any health-related information I desire. I have been using the internet since the mid-1980s (yes, it did exist at that time but was mostly available only to certain companies, government agencies and universities) so I have a lot of experience with it. I am also VERY willing to rely on my own research to question my doctor's advice or even disregard it in favor of something that I think makes more sense.
0.916700	I am positive I have the capacity to understand and process basic health information and even beyond that to make appropriate health decisions. I am a registered nurse working towards my master's and am confident I understand what my doctor tells me 100% of the time.
0.627800	I think I have just about average ability. Sometimes the information is overwhelming. Sometimes when I ask logical questions about things that do not make sense, the answer I get it medical science does not work logically. I question and read about what my health interests are but in the end chose to listen to the doctor even though I may not agree as they are the experts.
0.844400	I think I have access through friends, the internet, and acquaintances in the medical field, to get help understanding most situations I might encounter. I think that while some of this information might not be totally accurate it may give me some more context when seeking medical information.
0.827800	I feel I have quite a capacity. Ultimately, no matter how professionally trained a doctor is, your health is your own responsibility and no one will care about it as much as you. Given this motivation, it isn't hard to believe that I would do the requisite research. 
0.916700	I feel extremely capable of understanding basic health information because I have done a lot of research throughout my life about various health issues so most of the information is not foreign to me. They are things that I already have a small amount of knowledge on.
0.616700	If I am interested in a not very serious illness then I look for information in the internet, but I always seek advice from the doctor is the condition is somewhat more serious.
0.900000	The internet is a big factor in staying informed. People tend to overestimate a doctor's knowledge. Much information can be found on the internet about basic medical info.
0.833300	I can understand health information. I research anything I want to know on my own and I find that most doctors are just crap shooting and don't really know or care to help. I make decisions on my own based on what I feel is right for me. 
0.866700	Im well educated and smarter than the average bear.  Im also willing to ask for clarification (or do my own research) if something is unclear.
0.916700	I feel like I am fully capable of making appropriate health decisions. 
0.883300	I have a good understanding of my health conditions and will research anything I need additional information on.
0.916700	I have been in situations where I needed to find out as much info as possible and I did. I have also been the person that was needed to get the info for someone else, so I know that I will ask about anything I am not sure of and that I can research and question the Dr's based on that research. 
0.900000	I have a smartphone and a computer at my disposal. Any and everything that a Dr or nurse says is completely researchable and verifiable on the internet or in books.
0.850000	I am usually pretty good at keeping pace with medical forms. If I have a question I simply ask. If jargon is used I am not familiar with I just google it.
0.916700	I feel that my capacity/ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information/services to make appropriate health decisions is more than sufficient. I have no problem digesting even relatively complex information about health issues, symptoms, treatment. If I have any questions about information, I have no problem whatsoever communicating with the relevant health care provider in order to obtain any needed clarification. I am also rather vigilant about communicating any questions or concerns I may have when I don't understand information being relayed to me by a provider, as well as when informing them about my own issues or various respective symptoms. I don't know what else to say. The process is pretty clear to me & in the odd exception that it's not, the process of how to obtain clarification is clear. 
0.872200	I feel like I could understand and process any basic health information to make appropriate decisions involving my health. If for some reason I couldn't initially understand I am confident I can find resources or help that would enable me to properly understand health information and services. On some issues I would probably know more than any medical personnel I talk to.
0.633300	I feel like I am very capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information.
0.827800	I feel that I have the capability and if I am struggling, my mother has a health background to provide additional needed information.
0.655600	I feel like I have an above average capacity to understand basic health information but I need help occasionally with prescriptions. Lymphoma is more complicated than a google search, so I have to ask my doctor how to deal with it.
0.822200	I started to get my own medical records because I wasn't getting all of the information that they were writing about me. So it helped me understand what they were thinking of me, and what I needed to do to get them to understand. I do have to google a lot of the wording on copies of MRIs because no one really tells me what came up on the scans.
0.844400	I studied Medical Office Technology in college which included classes in medical terminology. I had to learn a lot about different medical procedures and afflictions. I've always read about my level, and I read rather fast. I know I can understand what I read. If I can't, I know how to get online and look up what I need. I also know a few medical personnel I can call and ask to explain something to me.
0.733300	I think I can process basic health information for basic health decisions. But more complicated stuff probably not, I'd just have to trust whatever the doctor said. 
0.827800	i use the internet to find out more info about hat a doctor has told me. i usually think of questions i leave. 
0.638900	I feel that I have a medium capacity to obtain, understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel comfortable with my basic medical knowledge and problem solving skills to make the correct health decisions on my own.
0.644400	I have had a grandfather who had a lot of health issues and helped him with his forms and dealing with the doctor. I also have a couple of health related issues that I have had to deal with so I understand most of what I learn.
0.850000	Well, if anything is confusing to me, I can just ask a doctor or a nurse. I can also use the vast internet to find answers to my questions as well as find people online to discuss medical issues/decisions that I might be faced with -- people who face the same things. I can seek advice from those people. For the most part, I am confident I can and do understand information relevant to my health.
0.883300	I think I have a good understanding of basic health information and services needed to make appropriate decisions. When I've went to the doctor in the past with any issues I'm always very inquisitive and helpful with my doctor to pinpoint what exactly the issue is. 
0.900000	I can look up symptoms online and hazard a guess but I understand that I can't do much more than guess. Information given to me by doctors and nurses I tend to trust but if I'm still not certain I will look up further information for myself online. I wouldn't have access to any specialized machines to try to diagnose myself so for that at least I'm completely reliant on health professionals. Things like blood tests, urine flow test, cultures etc.
0.900000	I think I am able to obtain a good deal of information on my own.  Searching the internet can be scary when it comes to health topics, but I do feel it is useful in getting broad ideas.  I also am not afraid to ask questions of health professionals.  I do know that not being able/willing to ask questions has been an issue for others in my family.
0.916700	I feel like I have a basic understanding. If I don't get a basic understanding or if something is confusing I'm fine with asking questions. It I'm still unable to understand there's always Google and a billion people who have the same exact questions as I do so its fairly easy to figure out what something means if you have internet access.
0.711100	I think that I have what it takes to understand the information given to me by my doctor. But there are still times when it is a bit cloudy in trying to understand all the variables. When I don't completely understand the information, I either go to an online forum or ask a friend. 
0.916700	When I became an adult I never needed help filling out forms. My mom always helped me when I was younger understand what information on the forms meant if I had a question. 
0.866700	I feel I have a good ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information so I can make health decisions. I have never run into a problem at my doctor's office or medical facility where I was confused about any particular thing.
0.538900	It's pretty good, I don't think I need too much help. It's fine.
0.888900	I feel that I am informed enough, and I feel in tune with how I feel with my body. I am always asking questions If I feel I don't understand something, or want to know more about a respective issue. I feel certain I can care for myself.
0.900000	I feel very confident in my ability to understand health information. The internet is a wonder resource to learn more about health information and services pertaining to my health decision. I still believe a doctor should be your number one source and you shouldn't believe or trust everything you read online.
0.916700	I'm fully competent in deciding what is best for me pertaining to my health 
0.572200	I have everything ready available for me online. I do also have  my doctor on had close to me to help me understand information.
0.900000	I have good ability
0.872200	I am mentally capable. I research more than the average person on medical care and medications.
0.916700	as a nurse, i feel i have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself and my family.
0.916700	I have access to the internet and can look up information. I can ask doctors for a second opinion. I am very skeptical and cautious in general. I also believe that having a medical degree doesn't automatically make you any more intelligent than the average person and certainly doesn't make you the alpha and omega of medical knowledge. Like in all fields and occupations, there are mediocre people.
0.783300	I think I can obtain the most extensive information from my personal doctor. I fully trust him because he has been my doctor for my entire life. 
0.361100	iTHINK BASED ON THOSE QUESTIONS that I can make a good decision regarding my health. Bring it on!!
0.566700	I would consider so important information and some people advice 
0.844400	I have no problem understand what my doctor tells me. But he like pills, and i don't so we disagree but I still take what he tells me to
0.900000	The internet is my main source of health information and tracking as I do not really have reliable health care. I feel I'm fairly lucky with my health, all things considered
0.844400	Health topics are something I research all the time on the internet. If it is something that directly affects me, I have a tendency to do a lot of research on the internet about the subject. I will consider alternative medical treatments along with what the medical establishment recommends.
0.616700	I think I have a better ability than most to learn about my illnesses. I have been chronically ill with several rare diseases for years now and I tend to have to look up medical studies on my own time to get more knowledge about how to help myself heal. 
0.705600	I feel like as long I knew the definition of basic medical terminology than I would be able to understand somewhat. It would provide a good foundation of comprehension.
0.755600	I am very capable of understanding. I like to ask questions and know what is going on. I don't go to the doctor often, but when I do I find out everything that I possibly can. I like to ask about medications and if I should take them all the time or not. I like to go for physicals and have my blood drawn and tested. I like knowing the results of my blood work and if something is wrong I ask questions.
0.633300	While I am reasonably confident in my abilities to understand, there are times when doctors and health care professionals speak with too much complicated jargon. It is helpful to have someone with me to ask the questions that I don't even know I should be asking.
0.650000	I can make basic decisions on my own. However, it is good to get reassurance from the nurse and doctors. Basically being able to use common sense is how I would approach it. 
0.916700	I feel that all of the forms that you have to fill out are pretty self-descriptive. I've never had any kind of problems understanding anything - they almost over explain things on the forms so you know exactly what you are getting into or what you are diagnosed with.
0.694400	I believe I understand most things, sometimes I get frustrated when filling out forms regarding insurance information because I don't fully understand that sort of thing.
0.833300	I believe I have perfect capacity to obtain basic health information and services that I need to make decisions.  I am a literate person that is not shy about asking questions.
0.916700	I know that I can ask questions of my health care provider and that they will answer me. If I am unsure if something I will ask them to clRify. I also know the terminology in medical papers enough to understand what I am agreeing to. I am in control but I must ask the questions.
0.866700	I feel like I have all the tools for my basic health information. I can call to obtain, and I can also go online and access a lot of my medical information. I think it's so easy to access this information.
0.672200	I feel I have the capacity to understand and retain most basic health information. It is harder to retain services as I live in America where health is expensive and hard for anyone that is not rich.
0.788900	I have worked on the administration side of healthcare for about 10 years. I work with medical terminology on a daily basis so I feel quite comfortable and have people to ask. 
0.811100	I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. If I don't understand something, I ask for help. I also research online to figure out any questions I have.
0.572200	I have the basic understanding to take action when I need to when it comes to important issues like my own health.
0.827800	I think that I have the capacity to understand health information and services. The doctors I see are helpful and informative, and so are their staff members. I usually find health information pretty clear and easy to understand, but if I do need help, I know there is someone I can go to.
0.916700	I'm completely able to make appropriate health decisions for myself and for family members when necessary.  I have no problem asking questions when I don't understand something, and I'm capable of doing my own research if I feel like I want more information.
0.488900	I feel very unconfident. It's an unfamiliar environment and unfamiliar forms to me. Often I'm nervous anyways about being sick and my health declining so I do not think of questions I should ask at that time. I would want a friend or family member to accompany me or have assistance from personnel in filling out forms and documents before seeing the doctor. Often I'm in a rush to get in and get out so I don't take time to ask questions
0.916700	I think I have a fine capacity.  I am able to coherently explain my concerns, and ask for aid if I need it.  I am native in English, and know all my health issues and past surgeries and such.  It isn't hard for me to do anything medical, and I am confident in making whatever medical decisions I need to make.
0.733300	I think I can easily fill out the health forms but it's difficult finding a doctor that is covered by insurance and affordable to get the answers needed, so I always feel like I am doing the bare minimum to maintain rather than actually getting help.
0.833300	With the internet these days it's usually not too hard to figure something out if the front desk is too busy. I had testicular cancer a few years back and practically lived at the Urologists. I figured out what most of their doctor words meant pretty quickly. 
0.705600	i think that i do. i graduated college and i have known english all my life. i have taken many english courses
0.827800	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information. There are times when doctors may use terms, medications, procedures, etc. that I don't understand, but I always ask them to please explain. 
0.761100	I think as long as someone is good at explaining it I can usually comprehend most of it. I guess I t would depend on what was being discussed
0.866700	Well, I have the internet available as a tool if I find myself in any confusion regarding a diagnosis, medicine dosage, symptoms, side-effects, etc.  My sister-in-law is in the medical field as well, and can explain things.
0.850000	I think I am able to get all of the information that I need, although sometimes I can not think of what to ask until after the fact. Also at times, I may not completely understand what the doctor or nurse is saying, but I trust their diagnosis and directions for the most part. 
0.794400	I feel completely sure of being able to carry out a success with these approaches, without a doubt I can do it with all certainty
0.816700	Throughout my life I have had to deal with medical professionals due to two auto-immune disorders that I have had since childhood. Therefore, I feel as if I am able to understand medical documents and explanations better than some . 
0.888900	I've been in and out of hospitals my entire life, having numerous medical conditions since I was young. I've been filling out and reading medical forms ever since I was able to do so (around 16 or 17, I believe) If I ever don't understand something, I simply ask until I do.
0.900000	I believe I am able to understand the health information I need to to make appropriate decisions. I can read well and have an educational background in health sciences. I also know how to use the Internet to look up information.
0.883300	I feel I have all the options and services I need to make appropriate health decisions.  I often ignore going to the doctor because they don't value my time and make we wait too long in the waiting room
0.827800	I am pretty confident that I am capable of understanding and processing basic health information and services. I tend to do my research on my own to better understand medication conditions, which helps me with make the necessary decisions.
0.850000	I feel I have the capacity to do all of that to a high degree. I do not think that it is very complicated at all. I have confidence in my ability to handle all of the above with little to no trouble. I think I would be able to handle it at any given time.
0.672200	I feel that If I am unable to figure something out than either my wife or possibly a close friend who is a registered nurse is always there if I have questions or flat out just don't understand what I am looking at
0.777800	"I think that I do have the capacity to process and understand basic health information.  Sometimes it gets very confusing and I'm not sure what questions I should ask in order to be fully informed.  I often find that the doctor is telling me information and I am just nodding and saying ""ok"" because I am not sure what other information I might need to know in order to make the proper decisions."
0.527800	In order to get the good health it would be very good and nice of it.It would be very good getting a good health is very important one it would be very important in life fo it
0.772200	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand health information to a significant degree. This confidence comes from the availability of almost anything I need to understand health conditions via the Internet. I can read about health information through my insurer, my care provider, and third-party sites. 
0.883300	I feel like I am adequately prepared to understand and assess all of the information that I am presented with. I am not afraid to ask questions or to let people know that I don't understand what I am being presented with. In order to ensure that I get the best possible health care, it is essential for me to ask questions and have things explained to me so that I can properly care for myself and make decisions about my life. 
0.916700	not presently an invalide i can and do inquire about my health with drs, etc. i also do myown reearch about health issues i may have which have been dislcosed by the drs.
0.850000	I am intelligent person who knows what to ask questions. I feel like I am extremely capable of processing most medical information. That being said, there are times when information given to me about my health is very technical and complicated. In these instances, I'm a bit less confident.
0.805600	I feel that I have the same level of understanding of the medical system as the average person. A lot of things that are written or said by doctors are in their own language, and they sometimes forget that they need to put things in normal terms for people to understand them. Forms can be confusing, mostly it is just the way some questions are worded and you have to get clarification on what they are exactly wanting from you.
0.872200	I am a literate, college educated adult. I believe I am fully capable of completing health forms, communicating with health professionals and making decisions about my health care. Of course there are always those times where I leave an appointment and realize I forgot to ask a question or when I think of a question after I have left an appointment. 
0.600000	Average, I think. If there's something I don't understand, I'll research it myself or ask someone with the medical knowledge I need. Sometimes there's a need for a second opinion, and I generally go with gut-instinct about which advice to follow.
0.855600	I usually follow what they're saying. If I know in advance I'll write my questions down. A lot of the time if I don't do that I'll have additional questions later.
0.822200	I beleive that I have a high ability to understand. I am a caregiver to my father who has a lot of health problems and I was once to my mother as well (5 years). I am the go to person for this type of thing in my family.
0.916700	I do feel that I am able to understand the materials provided to me by doctors as well as ask any questions for items that I may not understand for my basic health and wellness.
0.633300	Regarding all the questions you just answer to whether you feel you have the capacity to obtain process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions - To some degree I feel like I can do that and usually it just requires knowledge of language and information.

0.794400	I believe I can adequately obtain help understanding,  and processing basic health information and services.  I've had an injury in the past where if something wasn't clear to me there was an employee explaining anything needed.

0.900000	I feel like I have everything I need to understand doctors and nurses about my current health situation. If I need help with something I always have google and family and friends to turn to.
0.577800	I feel I have a fairly good ability to obtain information and process it however at times it is really not that easy to do so. I find that it is difficult to get much time with my doctor and my time with the doctor is rushed. The nurses are some help but also are focused on moving people out of the office very quickly.  
0.638900	I think I can handle it with a little help, there is always the option to ask for help, specially from the doctors and nurses, and based on all the info I can take an appropriate health decision.
0.850000	I feel I have a good degree of understanding  basic health information. I used to work in the medical field so I was able to get a good understanding through patients I interacted with and learning from the doctor and other co-workers. 
0.850000	It's not that hard to obtain and process medial information. I just have to tell my doctor everything I can and remember that there is always more I could say. I try to be accurate and thourough with the information I provide.
0.855600	I believe I do a sufficient job in understanding basic health information and making appropriate health decisions. This may due to my above average knowledge of the general medical field as I have taken college courses regarding health and medical services.
0.916700	I feel I am 100% capable to obtain, process and understand basic health information. my career is part of the healthcare field and therefore I feel I have a very good base knowledge that others may not possess. I think in most cases I am able to ask appropriate questions in order to make good health deciions
0.916700	I think I have as much capacity as anyone could have.  I hardly ever get sick and have never had a major illness luckily.  Neither has my daughter.

0.655600	I feel that I can do most of the information, but you there is usually information that is obscure. I think just making medical questions basic and simple would be much more helpful.

I am able to most fully understand what forms say and the information that is provided to me when talking about any problems that I may be having with my health. Although sometimes I am unable to fully understand or fill out forms, when explained to, I generally end up understanding everything after I get some help. 
0.555600	I always feel when I go to my doctor that they really do not seem to care about what is going on with me, therefore they do not really explain all the details on what I need to do t make my condition better. Or they just give me the run of the mill answer, not really getting to the root of the problem.
0.827800	I feel like I am more than capable of understanding health information myself, but doctors and nurses often underestimate me or don't give me all the information. I frequently find myself googling conditions or medications to get more information. Many doctors and nurses I've seen have been condescending to me, which has made me feel uncomfortable asking questions, so I have to seek out the information myself.
0.861100	For myself, I feel fully capable of understanding all basic health information at all times. If I do not udnerstand something, I make it a point to get in contact with the most appropriate professional who is qualified to answer my questions; it is not difficult to do so.
0.622200	I have the ability and capacity to achieve and process, but hospital and medical settings are intimidating and there are times when I find that I just want to be out as soon as possible, even if that means not asking questions or understanding.
0.883300	My Mom is a registered nurse and I took Pre-Med Bio in school so I am used to medical jargon and biology. I can also sometimes self-diagnose or know of similar conditions. I also know what my family genes means for my own conditions.
0.861100	I'm fairly health, college educated and I trust my ability to understand documents. I'm of sound mine and confident that I can read forms and if I do have questions find the answers via online search or through a health care provider or their staff. 
0.888900	Yes, I am a capable adult human being that can understand medical procedures and issues.I am also very confident in my abilities to google anything I am unsure of.
0.683300	I think I do. Sometimes I don't quite understand how to fill out the forms, because the forms are different depending on the place you are at. My last appointment the forms were different a bit, and I signed in the incorrect place, and they had to redo them. 
0.916700	I'm comfortable enough with my doctor to where I have no problems asking questions about my health, and any test results I have been administered. I also know how to look up information, in regards to bettering my health, no matter what it is.
0.750000	I feel as if I have the capacity, but sometimes not the time to look up certain terms. I am still occasionally shy as well about interacting with healthcare professionals because I am not used to it which makes me hesitant to sometimes clarify things on the spot.
0.900000	I feel like I do. In August I was diagnosed with epilepsy, so in the past 6 months I have visited a neurologist, as well as had an MRI/ Cat Scan performed. I had no issues regarding the info I was given. If I do not understand something, I will ask questions.
0.900000	I feel I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.916700	I think I have 100% capacity to obtain, process, and understand all my basic health info and services need and I am currently able to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.916700	I have grown up around doctors and hospitals. My mother was very sick when I was a child. It makes it where I am use to the lingo and feel very confident in my ability to understand what doctors are saying.
0.811100	I definitely have the capacity. I have a moderately high level of understanding of what I'm read and am told, and I have the agency to be able to make my own decisions about my health.
0.827800	I can understand basic health information very well. I sometimes need to do further reading on my own at home to get a full understanding. I don't make the doctor explain everything in detail, I can easily find the information on my own via the internet. 
0.900000	I feel I have a good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make appropriate health decisions. If I do not understand I ask so I do understand how to make an appropriate decision.
0.916700	I have all of the abilities I need to read and process this type of information and make my medical decisions. I don't need anybody's help with that at all.
0.822200	I am rather confident that I have the ability to do so. There are some questions I'm unsure about, specifically questions that might pertain to past injuries sustained in sports and that could be affecting me at the time. I don't have any medical school background but I make sure to ask as many questions as necessary to satisfy my curiosity about my medical issues almost every time I go to be seen by a health professional. I also feel that most health professionals in our area are competent and have the patient's best interest in mind.
0.622200	I think i have a pretty good understaning of how to translate medical materials from a dr point of view to that of an average joes point of veiw without much of an issue.
0.705600	"I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions - but not always immediately.  I will often need time to ""research"" the information myself prior to making a decision.  Sometimes this results in me having to call the doctor back."
0.722200	i like the doctors that i go do. if there is anything that is in writing and i am not understanding they are willing to sit down and explain things no matter how long it is going to take then to explain. If the doctor is there and the nurse needs further help he is going to do the same thing to assist. the hospital always wants to make sure the patient is well aware of their diagnosis the medicine was was given and the amout of what needs to be taken. 
0.883300	I feel I have a great understanding of what I need to know, after an appointment with a medical professional. If I do not understand something, I have no problem asking for more explanation. I never leave with unanswered questions or not understanding the information given to me.
0.888900	I feel that I can fully obtain and process all the information that I need.  I make sure to ask for clarification and don't leave until I am satisfied that I have gotten the answers I need.  I've never had a problem with understanding my doctor. 
0.755600	I feel that I am very capable of processing health info and filling out the necessary forms to do so. I have no problem with the language, so I manage perfectly fine. It's important for people to communicate their health needs with their doctors at all times.
0.722200	I feel like I have the capability to understand and ask the appropriate question to ensure that I understand health information and services.  In today's age it's pretty easy to find out information online either through search engines or forums dedicated to medical information.  I am very confident that I can ask my doctor as well any questions I may have.
0.677800	I feel like i am able to understand most of what they tell me. If i have questions about what is happening i will ask them. Sometimes I get confused by medical terms i dont understand and will have to get them to clarify for me. If im having a procedure done i make sure i fully understand what is happening and what is suppose to happen. 
0.794400	Throughout my life, I have had some negative experiences with doctors and in hospitals, especially as regards feeling listened to, respected, and having my questions fully answered. As a result, I have become less confident over time in medical settings and often choose to look up information later on my own rather than have a dismissive or confrontational interaction, which can sometimes add more stress to an existing medical problem for me. Once I have information from trusted sources, I do feel confident exploring, understanding, and responding to it. I appreciate the expanding information available online, especially that increasingly provided by insurers.
0.666700	I feel like I'm no better than the average person at doing these things. I don't have a ton of knowledge about the medical world, but, with modern technology and customer service, I feel like I can easily solve any problems or misunderstandings.
0.866700	Intellectually, I can understand the pieces of information that I am given, but we often don't hear or learn enough about the health system for me to understand everything (especially regarding insurance)
0.805600	I feel like I should understand what I am reading.  I feel I have the capacity to understand what is being asked of me.  I went to college and should understand the terminology of the forms.  
0.800000	I feel I am capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services to make decisions about my health care. I can also use Google to look up any conditions or medications and get more information about it that way also if I dont understand something. I am not afraid to ask my doctor for certain medications I think I may need and discuss my health issues with him. 
0.900000	I can understand basic health information because I am a nurse. I am used to dealing with medical information and doctors on a daily basis. I also have an extensive background in terminology and know how the body works. This gives me a lot of knowledge to where I don't need to ask the doctors or nurses questions. 
0.861100	I have no problems understanding medical or health information and don't need help.  I am perfectly capable of figuring things out on my own.
0.411100	I believe that I am able to do the things that I need to do and that is why I do the things that I need to do to make sure that I get things done.
0.838900	Sometimes I don't always ask a question for fear of sounding a bit stupid but the older I get, the more information I want regarding my health. I think I am fairly healthy except for the fact that since the age of 17 I found out I have NF1
0.872200	I wholeheartedly feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed not only for myself, but for my family as well.
0.900000	i am confident that i can make my decisions.  I don't need much help with reading materials.  I am not afraid to ask questions.
0.900000	I believe I have above average capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.633300	I feel that I my ability to understand basic health information is a 100%. I often feel that my doctors don't spend enough time explaining to me, what my condition is which makes me feel that they don't understand my condition very well at all.
0.511100	I don't really understand anything related to health information, because I have trouble understanding technical words and I rarely make healthcare decisions.
0.916700	As a retired RN, I am well versed in the field of healthcare.  I am able to research any topics or findings I am unfamiliar with and, I hold health care providers accountable for the quality of care they provide.
0.827800	I feel quite confident in my ability to understand basic health information and then use it to make health decisions.  I'm not shy about asking doctors or nurses to explain something if I want more information or feel I don't understand it.  Sometimes I might not ask all the important questions, or think of them at the appropriate time, but usually I'm okay about that.  And I find that doctors and nurses typically do a good job of explaining things anyway, which makes my role easier.
0.677800	I do have the capacity to obtain and process the information that is given to me to make appropriate health decisions. It can be sometimes confusing if the doctor doesn't explain it or uses words I do not know which makes me confused about the topic. Otherwise, though I can often obtain all the information and when they give you sheets or directions on paper often helps with the refreshment of memory and is sometimes better explained.
0.766700	When I go to the doctor I always make sure that I give and get all the information that I need.  I am able to read and understand everything that I am given and if I canât then I ask enough questions so that I am no in the dark when I get home.  If I do need help I am able to contact the doctor to have then further explain what I need.
0.694400	I feel as if for the most part I am able to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. The only time I might need help is if it goes in depth to terms I wouldn't understand.
0.916700	I've always had exceptional reading comprehension, and my mother was a nurse so health related information is something I can easily understand. I'm also not the type of person to feel embarrassed or afraid when I need to ask the doctor hard questions.
0.577800	If you are like most people, you have opportunities to initiate difficult conversations on a frequent basis, but they probably donât really feel like âopportunitiesâ,  we are using the term âdifficult conversationsâ to convey a situation where both parties in the conversation need to stay in a relationship, the stakes are high, opinions vary and emotions may run strong. At work, situations may arise between you and your supervisor that call for you to initiate a difficult conversation. Your supervisor may be many things, but it is doubtful s/he is a mind-reader. 
0.822200	I feel like it is completely within my capacity to obtain basic health information and services. However, it is a bit more difficult to always process and understand that information. I feel like the last few times I saw a doctor, the appointment was extremely rushed, and did not allow me the time to ask all of the questions I had about the information I'd received at those appointments. My doctor gave me print-outs, which were a little helpful, but felt like a lazy way of ensuring that I was provided with the information I needed. I ended up having to do online searches at home to fully understand everything that was discussed at my appointments.
0.672200	I feel like I am adequate enough to understand health information that I receive from the hospital or a doctor. The health professional usually dumbs it down enough for me to understand it.
0.866700	I think I have the full capacity to understand basic health information. I've done a lot of reading over the years, and I'm also capable of looking things up online or on my phone if I need to understand it in plain talk and can't get my doctor to explain it.
0.666700	I feel over all I understand most of everything but when I don't feel well it's harder for me to understand things. I mean I could be tired, sick and sore. It's hard to process information at that point. It's at that point I need my wife or a nurse to help me out and explain some information to me. 
0.827800	I feel confident in my ability to understand most health materials I'm given, as well as my ability to articulate concerns and ask questions.
0.916700	I feel I have all of the tools and knowledge to obtain any medical information necessary. I am not afraid to ask if I need assistance or an answer to my questions. 
0.855600	I feel pretty confident that I am able to understand most of what my doctors and nurses tell me in the office; If I don't , I ask, or I look it up myself
0.916700	I have no underlying issues with reading comprehension, with memory retention or with medical terminology that would preclude me from understanding basic health information provided to me by a doctor or hospital. I recently went for a physical with my doctor and was able to fully understand all her questions to me and instructions given to me. 
0.794400	As a former Nurses Assistant and Med Tech i feel i have an above average understanding of medical terminology and practices.
0.600000	I believe that nowdays we have a lot of information provided for our health. It is possible to check every symptom and to get to know if there is something wrong with your health and the ways to stop it. I think that medical advice is however very neccessary and very useful.
0.844400	I feel I have decent capacity to achieve all of these.  The internet is a good source of info that I can leisurely spend my time on as needed for this.  Google and discussion forums provide most of the info I would find if I need to conduct such as search.
0.783300	I have no problem answering or asking questions regarding my health. Growing up, my mother was a nurse so I was often around medical jargon. Even when in college, though I am not in the medical field, I enjoyed taking health and nutrition and anatomy classes. I also feel that I have the resources that if I have questions, I can speak up and find someone to help me make the most appropriated decision for my well being.
0.838900	I feel that I have enough basic knowledge to understand my health.  When I don't I either ask questions or I google information.  This lets me get more information for the next time I visit the doctor.
0.866700	I believe that I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  I try to stay fairly well-informed, especially when the information pertains to my own health or the health of someone in my family.  My sister and mother are both RN's, so I have people to ask in case I'm confused and my primary provider isn't available.  I try to take the time to think of all symptoms, instances and relevant information.
0.794400	I feel like for the most part I can read and figure something out. Now when it comes to not knowing something I have a awesome doctor who is willing to put it in terms that I understand and who will explain it to me. Sometimes I might not understand something but I am the type of person who will research until I am able to figure it out. I feel I am probably able to process everything about 80% of the time.
0.616700	i feel like i usually understand the main points but not always the details or the reasoning behind what they are telling may. I dont understand enough to really form my own opinions on things, so i just do what the doctor says and hope it is what is best.
0.633300	I think in the event that I interact with health professionals that I have a fairly good capacity to obtain and process basic health information. I regularly independently research from respected sources, but I tend to prefer getting information directly from health professionals I'm working with since they will have better perspective on my individual health condition.
0.811100	I feel confident that I can understand basic health information I've read and heard. As for making appropriate health decisions, I feel mostly confident. If I have any questions, I feel confident in asking health practitioners questions. And I also have my mom, who is a nurse, to ask for advice.
0.916700	I don't have any problems understanding health information that is provided to me either in written form or verbally, and I can fill out my own medical forms. Also, I always ask as many questions as I need to of my health care providers.
0.583300	I feel fairly unconfident in understanding medial lingo. A lot of the terminology is really hard to take in. Especially if I'm already worried about the procedure or the test results. 
0.650000	I think I would have a basic understanding on what procedure or task I would need to do obtain the information required. Processing and understanding the information might take some time and that requires me to do some external research to get a more general idea. A second opinion is also helpful.
0.622200	I feel I can understand the information that is given but it is hard to get the full info out of providers especially if I don't know the questions to ask.
0.844400	I feel like I have the ability to understand the information provided to me by medical professionals. Sometimes, I don't give doctors all of the information or ask the questions that I want to ask. I've dealt with anxiety but am unsure of whether or not I want to get it treated. Other than that, I try to be forthcoming. I also try to be easy to deal with so as to not seem like a bother.
0.800000	I think I have ample ability to gather and use medical information. I'm reasonably well-educated, such that even if I don't know what something means, I would be able to look it up and understand the definition.
0.850000	I am college educated and competent, and have the mental capacity to take care of any health issues that come my way in the near future.
0.588900	I feel like the material I read or are given are sometimes a little hard to understand. There is a lot of conflicting information on the internet that makes it hard to decipher.
0.566700	There are several resources that I rely on regarding the health related information. First, I usually do a web search when I encounter some pieces of information that I do not understand. Second, I have some friends who work in the health care domain that I can talk to. Third, I do not hesitate to ask for help from doctors or others when needed.
0.916700	Yes, I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. If there is something that I do not understand I will ask the nurse or doctor or Google the information.
0.855600	I am completely capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information in able to make appropriate decisions.  The only problem I have is when Doctors or Nurses have trouble communicating or just don't want to spend the time to answer relevant questions.  I have changed doctors for this reason.
0.761100	I feel that I have the appropriate capacity to, at the very least, obtain the information I need to make important health decisions. Sometimes it will take me a while to understand and process the information, and I may not always be able to digest the info given to me in a doctor's meeting, etc., but I feel that over time, with the help of the internet and following up with a doctor, I can understand all that I need to.
0.688900	I feel as though I can understand basic health information pretty well. I have some background in the medical setting so I do sometimes completely understand what they are talking about. I am more likely to look something up after I leave than ask the doctor or nurse then. 
0.850000	I feel like I have the proper amount of capacity to fill out and obtain any and all health information and services that I need to make appropriate health decisions. I make sure that I'm always asking my doctors questions about my health and trying to understand completely what it is that's going on with me or what it is that I'm being diagnosed with. I always make sure that the doctors are explaining things thoroughly and if I feel like I need more information about something, I'll make sure that I'm asking them to try and explain things a little bit better to me.
0.872200	I feel I am able to understand health information and understand what I am told about my health. I feel I am able to ask the questions which will enable me to generally understand my health and the treatment options open to me.
0.738900	For the most part, I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I prefer to have my husband with me at all times to help fill out paperwork and digest information. This is just because it is better to have two sets of ears hearing what is going on and processing the information. We are then able to talk through the information later to make sure we both understood everything. My husband is also a lot better at thinking of questions to ask in the moment, whereas I need to process information before I can think of questions.
0.822200	After eleven years of life with type one diabetes and various other endocrine fuckery, yes, I feel I have the capacity to look information up, verify it by checking the references, and ask my pharmacist and doctor for help. I've had a lot of practice. Unfortunately at this point most of my questions are beyond my doctor and I dislike the endocrinologist available to me, so I depend on my own research skills and online communities of people with my conditions to do further research -- but that's a point beyond 'basic health information'.
0.883300	I am a reasonably intelligent person, so I feel equal to the task of understanding health information provided to me by my care providers. I also make sure to get clarification of anything I donât understand. I ask lots of questions, and listen intently to what my care providers are telling me. I said that I often give my care providers all the information they need to assess my health, but I do some times hold back information that I find embarrassing. This is not often the case, but I do so on occasion. Also, I am perfectly capable of interpreting the literature provided to me by pharmacists, nurses and doctors, and very rarely have to have someone help me read and interpret. 
0.833300	I feel like i understand the health information pretty good. I have kaiser so i can get help very easy they are just a phone call away if i have a question i can email my doctor very easy and have an answer pretty much the same day.
0.844400	I feel pretty confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have been living with an auto-immune disease for almost 14 years and needed to do a lot of research on my own because the doctor who I was seeing when I was first diagnosed did not tell me anything about the disease. After I did some research on my own, six months after being diagnosed, I found a doctor who explained everything to me and knew how to treat my disease. 
0.816700	I think i know about most diseases, If i go to a Dr. and don't understand something I am not afraid to ask, I also have my spouse with me if I think I might be given information that I might understand or be confused about. I like to ask if what a doctor suggest might affect other problems I have, 
0.916700	I believe that every person should have at least basic knowledge in health related field. Of course doctors and nurses would know more, but the final decision is always up to You, so You have to make an informed decision. If i need to learn something - i do it, no matter how hard it would be
0.916700	I feel 99 percent confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information given to me to make the right health decisions for myself. I feel comfortable communicating with my doctors and always ask them to clarify anything I'm unsure of. They're always reachable by phone. And anything I want to know more about is always online and I definitely do my due diligence in researching health related issues to give myself as much information as I can find to grasp what's going on. 
0.866700	Sure I understand, usually basic information and I usually research something in the library or online before I even talk to a health care professional about it.
0.838900	I can completely understand and process any basic health information that I am given. My only issue is that sometimes doctors do not plainly discuss information and seem to be guessing, or at least being noncommittal to their answers to my questions. Doctors also do not seem to like to admit that they do not know something to be certain, in my experiences. 
0.811100	I feel like I understand most of what doctors or nurses tell me. I feel there is enough time for to me have them clarify anything I don't understand, or I can go online afterwards to find out more details myself.
0.827800	I feel I'm intelligent enough to understand most information provided to me by my doctor. If I have a hard time understanding information, I'll rephrase my question or simply tell him I don't understand what he means. I sometimes think of additional questions after my appointment. If so, I'll usually look on the internet for answers. If I'm not confident in the information I find online, I'll call my doctor's office and ask to speak with him over the phone.
0.533300	I think I have enough information processing ability, but sometimes health information can be pretty complicated so I am not confident enough in my ability to understand complicated information. I think I will need things put into simpler terms so that I may not only understand them better, but also commit them to memory and actually learn about the information. I also have trouble making decisions for myself so I need help filling out forms and deciding how to proceed with medical decisions.
0.744400	I feel that I have an above average ability to understand all of the information that is needed to make health decisions. I have an interest in health topics and do quite a bit of reading. However, it can be difficult to trust my own decision because I am not an expert in the field.
0.900000	I believe that I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I am an educated professional that works in social services so I understand the best ways to advocate for myself and ask questions in order to get the most complete information.  I am also very direct and have no issue asking questions if I need to in order to better understand something.  I like to do my own research as well.
0.838900	I feel very capable of understanding health information.  I struggle sometimes when I feel rushed asking all the questions I need to get all the information I need.  Often I think of questions  after I have left a doctor's office that I forgot to ask.  I try to make lists when I know I have an upcoming appointment.
0.833300	I was involved in my mothers healthcare. Dealt with doctors and nurses and hospice. I had power of attorney over her healthcare. The american Cancer Society was very helpful. Still have lots of information, pamphlets and newsletters.
0.566700	I feel that i have most of the information that i need. I am usually pretty confident when filling out forms or making recommendations to my doctor. I feel that we work well together to keep me healthy.
0.916700	I feel 100% confident I can get the information and services I need since I grew up always fending for myself and when I didn't know something I'd goto the library and figure out myself or look it up online. I have no problem asking for help or more information if I can't figure it out for myself.
0.805600	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. If there's something I don't know or understand, I have a large support group willing to explain or describe things to me so I am informed.

I also am not afraid to ask questions or ask for help if I need it. I do not want to be in a situation where I am not confident in my diagnosis or treatment.
0.844400	I feel like I am comfortable enough with my primary care physician at this point to basically say anything or ask any questions. I have a basic background in medical training due to classes taken for pharmacy courses, even though i didn't complete the degree I feel like i have enough of an understanding of medicine and the field to understand basic terminology and ideas. 
0.916700	I'm extremely confident. I've got a background in both clinical psychology and i'm a certified professional educator in the state of Florida with certifications in teaching Biology and General Science on the high school level.
0.916700	I feel that I can understand what they tell me without additional help, because I have a pretty good memory. Also, if I wanted to find more information, I would trust the internet more than a single doctor to tell me specifics.
0.866700	I feel I am fully capable of understanding basic health information whether it be something I read or what questions to ask. If I am unsure I will ask or look up online if need be.
0.600000	I can understand some information, but the finer details are hard. I don't know some of the terminology and body processes.
0.722200	I 5ink I am pretty compitant when it comes to medical matters.  Sometimes I donât understand some of the wording and I ask for help. I sometimes ask my dad who has a medical degree or my cousin who is a medical reassearcher.  I also sometimes have questions about prescriptions and I ask my cousin who is a pharmacist to help with any questions or concerns that I may have. 
0.811100	I feel mostly competent in the basic health information interactions, but once in a while may ask family for advice/help.
0.644400	I feel slightly capable to do asses the information and services needed to make health decisions because of the access to the internet and access to nurses that can explain difficult medical terms or other bits words that I canât understand, So on my own I canât understand too much because of the medical terms but thanks to the internet and nurses they help me understand 
0.705600	I think I have a basic knowledge of what is required by a layperson to evaluate, and determine if someone needs to seek medical attention.  I have two small children and would take them to the doctor or call if I thought one of them was in need of seeing a doctor.  While I do not have medical training, I can tell when someone is sick.
0.761100	Yes, I do pretty well with this normally. If I need a little bit of help I have doctor friends I will ask for their input sometimes. However, that is usually not the case and I end up doing things on my own.
0.883300	i feel that i have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. if i do not understand then i make sure that i ask enough questions until i do understand. i have never had a problem with getting the information that i need regarding my health.
0.888900	I think I'm pretty competent and well informed about my medical stuff. My doctor is open and honest and I don't feel ashamed asking questions. Sometimes I forget but whatever I don't ask at the appointment I can google when I get home or email my doctor.
0.883300	I think I have a good understanding on how to read and process health information. I always ask questions and sometimes I have to go home and go online to get a better explanation but I get the basic gist of what is told to me.
0.538900	Most of the time I feel like doctors and nurses are too rushed and I don't want to bother them with things that they seem to think I should already know. Many test results are too complicated to understand anyway and I feel like I could just look them up later instead of wasting their time. 
0.811100	I feel I have an above average capacity to obtain, process and comprehend basic health information because my significant other has worked in the medical industry all of her life (her father is a doctor, she is a nurse) so I have been exposed to and actively consulted medical professionals throughout my adult life.
0.700000	I have most of the time the help to get health information from doctors. But I rarely go to hospital and see doctors. It is not appropriate to judge from my experience.
0.744400	I believe I have a high capacity to understand basic health information, I have family in the healthcare industry and I've learned through them and through reading on how to be effective in asking questions and learning about different health problems. 
0.811100	I work for a health insurance company so I have a little knowledge on how to complete forms and probably have an above average idea of what information is needed to complete forms.  My major in college before I changed my mind was pre med so that also puts me at an advantage over most people.  I feel that I can either complete most forms and understand basic health information at a reasonable comfort level or I know which questions I need to ask to be able to.  I am not afraid to ask if I do not understand something because this is my health and I am not taking any chances when it comes to my health and my livelihood.
0.700000	I can understand the basic information given, but feel like there is a lot that could still use explaining. I usually have to make a list of key phrases that the doctors or nurses say and then google them on my own.
0.772200	I feel that I am able to comprehend most medical information, however I feel my anxiety and fear of judgment at times keep me from asking questions.
0.716700	I do feel that I am capable to obtain, process and understand basic health information, but not always. There is a good amount of health jargon which I do not understand. I think me asking questions allows me to have a better grasp of this information. With this I am able to make the appropriate health decisions. If I was not the type of person to ask questions, I would most definitely have a more difficult time. 
0.861100	I feel that I am reasonably able to comprehend and obtain the basic information to make appropriate decisions regarding my health.
0.661100	If I get confused by what the doctor or nurse is telling me I research my condition online. This can be a little exhausting but it's worth it. I go to Web MD and other sites like it; there's a lot of valuable information there. Younger doctors communicate better than older doctors; they care more.
0.622200	I have had GERD and issues with my stomach for the past 5 years and have seen a number of different stomach doctors who have conducted a lot of different tests and tried a lot of different pills on me. This survey is really hitting home because I think doctors and their staff need to do a better job of using normal terms and explaining things better to non-doctors. I ask a lot of questions but a lot of times think of them after I have left the office and am forced to google the terms and wind up on webmd!
0.861100	I believe that I have all the resources that I would possibly need for healthcare questions and information. I have a solid healthcare team who have helped me every step of the way.
0.483300	I feel like I have the basic understanding but I find it difficult to get things done because of outside forces that I have no control over, it is kind of a pain in the ass to be perfectly honest. 
0.733300	I feel that I have somewhat of a high level to obtain, process, and understand basic information and services needed to make the right health decisions. When I don't understand something, I will usually ask questions but a majority of the time, I am able to process the information given. I feel that if I don't understand then I definitely need to know. That's very important and should not be overlooked. 
0.744400	I understand written material very well, but I sometimes get confused when I am given a lot of information and especially if I  have to cross-reference it with one or more other bits of new information. I don't retain new information relatively well either. Also I have a nurse in my family and have her further explain issues sometimes.
0.688900	Because medicine is a complex area, it is sometimes very difficult to understand exactly what they are saying since it is all comprised of jargon. The doctor or nurse could try and explain it in layman's terms, but sometimes it can be lost in translation. 
0.916700	I think that I have complete capacity when it comes to basic health information and am able to get the health services I need. I can fill out forms and communicate with healthcare workers without any assistance.
0.722200	I feel like there have been times when I have planned ahead what to ask my doctors so I can be informed about my health.   But there have also been times that I feel like I have not asked enough questions and things were not explained thoroughly enough to me.   Luckily I have friends and family I can turn to in order to help me understand. 
0.872200	I studied a lot of science in college so I have some general knowledge of many of the medical terms so it's not so hard for me to process everything.
0.444400	"I feel like I have the capability to understand very basic health information, but anything beyond the basics presents a challenge to me.  I find it very confusing and a lot of times, doctors are so smart in their profession that they don't know how to ""dumb it down"" for me."
0.866700	I feel that I completely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself. I do not have an issue comprehending health information and do not hesitate to ask doctors questions when I am unsure about what they said and how my medications and levels affect my health.
0.855600	I feel like I can understand most things doctors and nurses tell me about my health. If there are things I don't understand, I have no problem asking for clarification from medical staff. Regarding medical forms, I feel very comfortable filling out medical forms for myself, I don't have a crazy medical history so it make it pretty easy to fill out forms at doctor appointments. 
0.638900	I feel there is enough information to read online, and from different sources to compare information, to be adequately informed about health information. I tend to want to do things on my own but then I don't fully get the whole picture because I don't know, or want to know, what's going on.
0.916700	I make sure to read all the materials carefully so I understand fully. I ask questions as they come up for clarity when needed. I can generally fill out all forms by myself but can get help for clarity if needed.
0.583300	Obtaining information is not difficult.  The process and understanding is difficult sometimes.  This really is evident when it comes to cost.  More often then not, healthcare providers have no idea what a procedure or condition will cost. 
0.866700	IM VERY CONFIDENT THAT I UNDERSTAND WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL STUFF. I DONT KNOW EVERYTHING BUT I KNOW AND IF I DONT KNOW I ASK OR LOOK IT UP. 
0.827800	I am able to understand just about any basic health conditions I need to. When I or someone in my family have a health condition, I am usually able to research that condition on the internet so that I feel more knowledgeable. 
0.633300	I feel that I definitely have enough competency or capacity to process my own basic health information. I worked at a pharmacy for years so I have quite a bit of familiarity with medical terminology as well as having family in the medical profession which helps too. 
0.888900	Having spent far too many years in graduate school (teaching science/math classes and being around MDs and PhDs), I've become confident both in being able to understand information but also not being afraid to ask if I don't understand something. I'm also confident in my ability to do my own research regarding health information and services.
0.872200	As a college educated individual, I feel I am competent enough to understand basic medical information to make the correct decision. Even though my major has nothing to do with medicine, I have had to read and understand a lot difficult material to be able to obtain my degree, understanding basic medical information would be no different.
0.872200	I feel that I can express myself in such a manner that health professionals will understand my condition. I think I can describe my symptoms well enough such that a doctor or a nurse will be able to recommend ways to help me feel better. I also think that I understand what I need to do when a doctor gives me instructions on how to treat my symptoms.
0.888900	After going through a serious medical issue within the past 2 years, I feel like I am completely able to comprehend basic health information and make an informed decision.
0.916700	I feel I have a high capacity to obtain and understand basic health information.  I ask my doctor when I am concerned about a health issue.  I look-up information on the Internet to supplement information from medical providers.
0.716700	I feel like im very capable to get all the information I need to understand all my health information. Either if its from someone else helping me or asking the doctor questions
0.850000	I believe that I understand documents that are given to me concerning my health. If I do have a question, I feel comfortable enough to ask my healthcare provider to explain it to me.
0.883300	I feel I have the capacity to understand what is told to me and if I dont understand I will ask questions so I do know what is going on
0.611100	The main issue is that medical documents and also doctors speak/read in a very scientific medical manner. They use confusing words that not many people understand. I feel that these things should be simplified to ensure understanding on the patient's part.
0.816700	I feel I have the capacity to understand health information and make decisions. If I do not understand, I ask questions and follow up with an internet search of reliable medical information sites.
0.850000	I am confident on this aspect of myself, because I have experienced this numerous times and I worked in a clinic setting where I interact with health professionals making it easier for me to understand to accomplish this things.
0.916700	I feel that I have a very high capacity to get and understand what health information I need. I learn quickly, have a good memory for facts, am very capable of research, and I'm able to look at my condition objectively without letting anxiety or fear get in the way of me understanding what I need to understand.
0.883300	Currently, I'm an RN and went to nursing school, so I have a pretty good idea understanding medical conditions and knowing what to do. If I ever have questions, I ask whoever I need to, such as the doctor or nurse at the doctor's office. Because of my health background, I often don't have too much trouble understanding things. 
0.661100	I am pretty confident I can do this.  I have a lot of experience reading about health conditions and services available. I typically do a lot of research on the internet about health issues I or people I know have.
0.850000	I have good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make decisions about health.  I also ask questions if I do not understand something.
0.844400	I feel I have a very good capacity to obtain and understand health information. I have a good ability to read and comprehend written information. I can ask questions if necessary about what I don't understand. I usually have no trouble understanding health information that I am given.
0.855600	In general, I have no trouble reading and understanding health-related information. I am sure the fact that I am a psychologist (PhD) does not hurt. It is also helpful that my wife is a doctoral-level nurse with 46 years of experience. When I need to select a specialist, I rely entirely on here, as she can learn in 5 minutes what would take me much longer. Who would know best about which doctor to select than a nurse with access to other nurses who know.
0.855600	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information if it is given to me in a way that I can understand. Some doctors are not very good at relaying things in layman's terms which can cause some confusion at time. If this happens, I try to remember to ask any pertinent questions that I do not feel were addressed adequately. Overall, I feel that I am very capable of processing health information given to me. It can at time, however, be overwhelming.  
0.844400	I feel I can understand most if not all of the material I receive from doctors and pharmacists. I do find that I sometimes forget to give doctors important information about my condition, and I sometimes forget or don't quite understand the information they tell me and feel like I don't want to waste their time by asking follow up questions. I do feel I have someone to help me or go with me if I am confused.
0.644400	I can reasonably understand and process basic health information. Whatever I cannot understand I try to search on the internet to get a better grab on the situation. I also try to discuss the issues with my medical friends.
0.783300	i have no problem making health decisions for myself.  I was diagnosed with choroidal melanoma 2 years ago.  It is still hard to comprehend sometimes the magnitude of future treatments and what is required.  The doctor never discussed long term percentages with me and i am afraid to ask.
0.750000	For the most part I think I have the full capacity. If its something that is really in depth I probably miss things and need someone to kinda help walk me thru it. That's why I always make my wife go with me just in case. I know when my twins were born at 32 weeks all the technical jargon was so hard to understand.
0.500000	im not the best when it comes to health information it really confuses me and im not sure what im looking at as far as numbers they can be everywhere with the numbers
0.844400	i feel like i have a good knowledge of the body and i have no problem understanding complex topics, or things that are explained to me. 
0.916700	I feel confident in obtaining and processing basic health information. I try to research as much as possible prior to going into the doctors office. 
0.838900	To a great degree, I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel this way because I have the capacity to think for myself, comprehend information, and ask (when necessary) if I don't understand something that is not clear to me. I also feel like I have the capacity to step back and not make irrational and immediate decisions and the ability to ask if there are alternative options. In addition, I am capable of researching any issues online to learn more about my medical conditions.
0.866700	Well, I have a background in Healthcare, so I feel quite competent. I realize some of the terminology can be tough even for me, so I can't say I'm 100%, but I'm close.
0.833300	I feel like I am a well educated person, so that even if I don't understand something, I can research it for myself and come up with useful questions to help me understand it better.  
0.783300	I believe the mix of my regular doctor appointments, reading up on ailments I have/have had, watching my nutrition and being proactive in setting up appointments creates an environment where I meet my health needs. I feel like I get a holistic and encompassing medical review and am well-informed. 
0.722200	I think depending on how the doctor explains it I can usually understand it. If they use strictly medical talk I will have issues understanding it but if they put it in a way that myself as not a doctor would understand then it would be easier to comprehend. For the most part I usually have no issues understanding what the doctor is telling me and if I do then I ask questions.
0.738900	Sometime I do and sometime I not do to how they words thing after we talk about it. With the changing of words it can sound differ from before
0.677800	I feel like the services are out there. However I also feel constricted because the processes can be complicated. When several organizations are involved it can be hard to get everything sorted out. This is even more difficult when you got a lot of stuff going on in your life. This makes it a tendency to procrastinate instead of getting help sooner.
0.616700	I broke my humeru last year and the doctor recommended surgery, but I declined because I don't have insurance.  I basically kept my doctors visits to a minimum to keep medical costs at a minimum.  Because of this I do feel that I missed out on a lot of feedback that would have been helpful.
0.777800	I think i have sufficient enough intuitiveness to understand most relevant health questions posed to be by my medical health professional and pharmacists.
0.900000	I feel as though I am mostly competent concerning medical conditions. However if i'm unsure I have no problem getting verification, and then following up with my own research.
0.777800	I think i do pretty good understanding these things. At times, I do need my husband's help when I do not understand a question or cant remember the answer to it. 
0.727800	i have dementia so sometime i can understand whats being told to me, sometimes im in a daze and have to have my daughter explain things to me. i most of the time understand, it depends on my day
0.872200	I feel I have the capacity  to make appropriate decisions. I am of sound mind and judgement. I cam understand information presented to me without difficulty. 
0.866700	i think that overall, it's pretty easy to understand basic health information. I always make sure I know everything there is to know and I before I leave I always make sure I understand everything and ask what I need to ask.
0.883300	I feel that I fully have the capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information.  I have been going to the doctors for a condition for over 20 years and have had to do all of my paperwork and question asking.  I have no one else to depend on.  I have to also do my husbands information.
0.916700	I believe I fully have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make health decisions. I am always open to more guidance and learning, but I do not require more assistance than average.
0.827800	I think overall I have a good capacity to get and understand the information I need. I'm not scared to ask questions but I do sometimes worry I might forget to ask something important. I also sometimes wonder if my doctor gives me enough information. 
0.777800	I believe I have the capability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions. I am educated in a healthcare field and I also have had many health issues which have given me experience in understanding information given to me by my doctors and when I was in the hospital. I am a breast cancer survivor and I have had ten surgeries, so I believe that is a lot of experience. I also have worked in medical offices and centers for 12 years which has also given me a lot of exposure.
0.866700	I feel have good capacity to obtain and understand such information.  When there is something that requires further clarification I find it easy to get additional information from a number of different sources.
0.616700	Yes, I feel confident that I can obtain information on health services and medical conditions. It is easily accessible on the internet and thru my health insurance provider (via phone or live chat on the provider website).
0.900000	I feel I have a strong capacity to understand what I am being told and the information I am given. If I do not quite understand something I will make sure I get more information from the health professional. It is my health and I don't want to be unsure about these things. I always like to ask about best courses to take, or alternate methods of treatments available. I would not want to engage in anything I don't fully understand.
0.866700	I can comprehend almost all written instructions unless their are way too technical. I can hear very well and can drive to various medical facilities to have tests performed when necessary. I have ongoing back issues and have had numerous test performed and everything has always been explained very clearly. I deal with the VA for health care so one can imagine the red tape and mumbo jumbo that is associated with them.
0.533300	I feel that I can understand and process some of the basic health information that is needed to make the appropriate health decision but sometimes health information can be overwhelming even basic. I feel if I could process it and understand it better then I would put a greater trust in the medical profession.
0.750000	I feel I have more than average knowledge on healthcare and related services. I look up all procedures and medication before they are done or taken. If I need clarification on something I will ask a professional or search online. I will often try to find someone who has gone through similar health experiences to get their insight. It is also to my benefit I have a relative that is in a medical field that is informed on a lot of topics. 
0.555600	I need help understanding medical terms and diagnosis most of the time before I can make an informed decision. Sometimes it takes asking repetitive questions to understand.
0.844400	I feel rather confident in my ability to gather and interpret health information. I am mostly confident in making the right decision, although at times I gather too much information, and often that information contracdicts one another ad then I feel like I am in a spat where I feel less confident. 
0.461100	Sometimes when I have a condition that send me to hospital I don't feel confident enough to tell the nurse or doctor about it because sometimes I feel that not everything that I'm feeling right now is not related to the condition.
0.755600	I feel I have the neccessary capacity to understand what I am reading in order to fill out paperwork properly.  If I am not well during an Doctor's visit, however, I may not be able to retain everything that was said by that doctor and sometimes will bring someone to the visit with me to help listen.
0.900000	Overall I believe I can get the proper answers.  While I haven't gone to the doctor often for myself, I have to go regularly for my children for many different conditions including multiple medicines with different doses and times.  I've been able to read the instructions given and understand what I need to do. Furthermore I tend to doublecheck by asking the medical specialist for confirmation.
0.916700	I am perfectly capable of understanding anything the health care professionals tell me about my condition at all times and I do not need any assistance with any of the information I have been given.
0.827800	I feel that I am somewhat able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I think that it depends on how technical the information that is provided is. I think that it also depends on how open my medical provider is to answering questions and how well I understand initially to be able to think of questions to ask the provider for clarification. If the information is simple or very basic, I am completely able to obtain, process, and understand the information.
0.783300	In most cases I feel that I am able to find the basic information that I need regarding my general health, either from my nurse or physician or by consulting online literature. It is the bureaucracy of insurance and the corporatization of medical forms and requirements that cause me the most headaches. Much of the stress of dealing with a medical situation has to do with things that are not related to any ailment itself.
0.916700	I'm well educated on health and medicine via my schooling, having looked things up online regularly, and having discussed health issues on a regular basis with my friends, family, and doctors.

I am quite well informed on a multitude of health information, and I spend time online doing my own research.

I have disagreed with a prognosis before and ended up being right. It pays to be vigilant.

0.900000	Whenever I've visited any health professional in regards to my health I've always had the option to seek out any health information that's necessary.

They always have constantly made me feel as if I have the opportunity to understand and obtain the information with relative ease. 
0.872200	Most information provided at the Doctor's office is written in simplistic enough terms that I am able to process the information with confidence that I am understanding of the material.

0.844400	I have a general understanding of all of the information that I am given or asked to provide.  They usually will highlight everything that needs to be filled out. 
0.916700	As long as they don't use technobable only understandable by nurses and doctors I don't have problems understanding what is told to me (or read about it). The problem is (for me) to get them to give me the information (that seems to be something they don't want to give).

0.866700	I believe I have a high capacity to obtain, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.

0.744400	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information to a great extent. I am a nurse, so a lot of medical things I understand. But even being a health professional myself, I find some of the information is hard to understand, and I realize working as a nurse a lot of it is even harder for someone who has no medical background. 
0.783300	I feel I have the capacity to understand most things I receive, my issue is that medical professionals either don't listen when I ask a question or if they hear it, they half answer it or rush through the explanation. A lot of the time, I find myself going to Web MD after a visit to try and get more detailed information. Medical professionals are often too busy to take the time and answer you thoroughly and I can tell they are trying to hurry me through the appointment. Some written material I don't read, as it's repetitive and the font is like 1/2 point.  
0.850000	I generally keep a healthy lifestyle, and through others I've become familiar with health related illnesses, helping them to understand the medication directions, and other such things. I feel to a reasonable degree, I can obtain, process and understand basic health information/services necessary to make the appropriate decisions regarding my health. A good bit of this is due to me knowing exactly what I would want, healthwise, and decisions surrounding it.
0.561100	I feel ok about what I am doing when I read through it several times. It can be a bit nerve wracking though because I feel like from time to time there are several medical or big words that may be difficult understanding for people who do not talk that lingo. I feel like I get enough from it though that I have minimum questions.
0.638900	I believe that I can understand most basic things, but if it was more than basic, like maybe tests or a diagnosis, I would need someone to explain it to me. I don't understand a lot of medical terms, like names for tests. I also do not know pretty much anything about medicine. I have to pretty much completely trust my doctor's knowledge. I leave the doctor's office not knowing enough. I don't think to ask the right questions when i'm with the doctor. That or the appointment is so rushed that I don't have the chance to ask. I have to Google stuff a lot when it comes to medical stuff. 
0.638900	I feel that I have capacity to understand health information, but it is often difficult to obtain it because doctors are always busy and difficult to get information from. After after procedures when my consciousness is still altered, it is very difficult to understand and remember information at the pace they provide it.
0.783300	I have a great capability to read and understand. Now if it is a medical condition I never heard of I would need a lot of additional information
0.838900	I feel that I don't have a problem with understanding or comprehending the medical information.  I have had to deal with a lot over the years and I feel that I have learned from that.

0.794400	I make sure I get every single piece of information that I need. I ask every important question so I make sure I understand 100% of what I am told or given. I don't want to do or understand anything wrong. I want to make sure everything is on the same level. Once I am sure I get all the information that I need then I feel I can go on. Everything would be based on what my doctor or health care provider tells me. That is all I feel that is needed to make the appropriate health decisions in my life.
0.866700	I have a fairly high capacity to learn about basic health information to make good health decisions.   I have a fairly diverse background in interest in medical things, and I have also been through MANY medical issues with my self and my family members and close friends.  
0.811100	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain any type of health information that I need whether I have to ask a doctor about a question I have or I can always look up info on the internet if I think of a question after I see the doctor.
0.750000	I feel that I have all the tools and the ability to If I really wanted to. I would know where to look and if I didnt I would know where to look to find out where to find the information I was missing. 
0.866700	i work in the medical field and took some courses so I have some knowledge about health information.  I ask questions when i don't understand things because i need clarity
0.655600	I think I have the capacity. Sometimes I don't understand everything that is given to me, however, my father is a nurse and can usually explain these things to me. I do usually get shy about asking further. Sometimes I don't realize I misunderstood until I get home and will just inquire to my father. 
0.855600	Mostly I feel pretty confident. I have had experience with getting a little overwhelmed with information while doctors are talking to you and coming up with questions to ask later

0.616700	I think I'm capable enough of understanding medical information and processing it properly. So in the end i think I've made goof health decisions basing on that. 
0.916700	I am extremely confident that I have the intellectual capacity and critical thinking to comprehend and critically evaluate the medical information I am given by health professionals.

0.916700	I'm pretty knowledgeable about health and medicine, although it is not my field.

I have very high academic proficiency, so I don't need people to help me to understand things.
0.833300	I feel i have this capacity to a great degree. I can ask family or my personal doctor if i have questions and there is also help to be obtained online, all i have to do is google the right keywords for what i want to know about. 
0.561100	I think I have a decent level of knowledge available to me to make a health decision. I feel if I did not have enough information to make that choice I have the ability through people and resources to get that information when it is most needed.
0.794400	I feel as though I am usually able to obtain and understand the information given to me. If I don't initially, I always make sure to ask questions until I do. By the time I leave the doctor I make sure I understand it all, but if I don't I will ask a family member for help. I used to be nervous to ask alot of questions, but now I am not.
0.827800	I know that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information and easily be able to schedule and make health decisions. I'm not shy about asking about certain topics or health language that I may not understand at the moment and then later on understanding it and seeing what impact it has on me. Usually I am pretty quick in catch and processing info that is new to me but without question, if I don't know about a certain topic, I will ask about it.
0.794400	I feel that I have a pretty good capacity to understand health information.  Having the internet at our fingertips is helpful if their is ever a word that I don't understand or something that needs further defining.  I also have health professionals in my family that are always willing to give feedback when asked.

0.872200	I believe I am capable of understanding the majority of information required to make appropriate health decisions. If I don't understand something, I either ask my doctor, or I look it up online. 
0.866700	I believe I have enough knowledge to understand health information, but I of course I need help from medical people sometimes to understand what the best option is and seek their advise. Dealing with a regular health care provider is pretty easy. But when my husband has been very ill and in the hospital I found getting information was excessively hard. If you did not aggressively ask you would not get an answer. And sometimes I had to persistantly ask for help about various solutions to his problems. There was no one person to talk to about someone in the hospital. It
0.833300	I have had a diagnosis of Anxiety and Depression for over 20 years so I pretty much understand all that is related to that. I have only in the past 3 years finally been diagnosed correctly with Bipolar Disorder and started treatment. I have had to learn a lot about the diagnosis as well as the new medications, and side effects associated, in these last few years. I am at a point where I understand the basic information regarding the disorder and the medications and have no problem asking my psychiatrist questions about such.

0.861100	I am confident in my ability to understand written information. Information communicated to me verbally is sometimes lost because I have an auditory processing disorder. In addition to this, I sometimes have a difficult time asking for help due to social anxiety.
0.677800	"in the age of internet, where information is abundant if not excessive, I don't see why one couldn't find any ""unclassified"" information on the world wide web, simply google it and one would find anything related they want"
0.916700	I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions?, I would make sure I have enough information from the doctor and follow up literature. Also, I would research online to further my understanding and to get a solid support for my decision.
0.844400	I have the benefit of working at a hospital so i have ample resources available for me, especially on our internal systems. However, if I didn't have tat access, I'd feel like the amount of information I had access too is limited, unless I google everything. 
0.561100	I feel that I have a moderate grasp on obtaining and understanding health information but sometimes the forms and doctors make me feel very overwhelmed.
0.777800	I feel like I have the ability to understand and process information really well, but sometimes I forget to ask for clarification and that will usually lead to misunderstandings on my part.
0.900000	I have no problem to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I used to have my health insurance license. I also worked for Aetna for 2 years as a Customer Service Representative, I also worked in a hospital in medical records analyzing out patient charts.
0.844400	I have a BA in a medical related field so when I am unfamiliar with a diagnosis I am given in regards to my health I usually know what to ask. Anything I am unfamiliar with and did not ask while in the presence of the health professional I usually research online to get a better understanding. Although I often call pharmacist with questions about prescriptions. 
0.777800	I feel I have the knowledge to understand health information to make good decisions. Sometimes if a lot of medical jargon is used, I do require assistance most often with web searches.
0.850000	I have Congential Adrenal Hyperplasia and Dystonia as two of my more problematic medical conditions.  Both cause me severe medical problems with far bigger repurcussions in my personal, social, and work life.  Because of the lack of support and understanding ever found a other than lies to weaken I have learned to fight for myself.  My first and core victory is never giving that up and second is seeking informed treatment while assuming others are always negative.
0.822200	I believe I have the resources to do so. I can always ask my doctor important questions concerning my health. I feel like I can go on the internet to obtain certain information.
0.888900	I feel very confident that I can easily understand any basic health information and services that I come across. I fill out health documents for myself and also work in the healthcare industry; it is a field that I studied in college.
0.827800	I do feel i would understand most discussions in regards to my health condition, if i needed an explanation on why or how i'm certain i could call the doctor or the assistant that works him to ask what i don't understand. That is if i was for some reason afraid or unable to ask during a visit.
0.761100	I usually don't have trouble with the paperwork but when it comes to talking to medical professionals I feel that they are always in such a rush and ask the same brief questions repeatedly so there's little time for me to ask my own questions. I had an experience where I was given a prescription and I wasn't even able to see what the name of the medication was until I was at the check out so I couldn't ask the doctor at all about it, only the receptionist.
0.900000	Yes I feel that I am able to hear what my doctor says and understand their recommendations. There are times when I forget to ask them specific questions or give them details I had planned to mention. I usually ask them to clarify instructions just in case I misunderstood. Sometimes they do not give details and I have to ask them for instructions.
0.722200	I can get alot more information on my own.  I just struggle sometimes really knowing what is relevant in my situation there is so much info on the internet, its hard to know.  Doctors always seem in a rush and I try my best to ask all the questions in a visit but sometimes forget or think of things later
0.916700	I'm completely capable of understanding all of the required information. If I have any questions, I am not ashamed or embarrassed to ask. If there is still something I do not understand, I am capable of looking up the information online.
0.744400	I think sometimes I struggle to communicate verbally---like in person, I don't do a good job of explaining things. I also tend to panic and forget everything I was going to say, which means that sometimes I have follow up questions and stuff, that just don't get answered if I didn't write them down before hand. 
0.866700	I have absolute ability to understand, and if I don't, I will ask questions until I do. I read a lot and have common sense, and any information that falls outside of that I will look on the internet to get the right answer. 
0.811100	I feel like I have a higher than normal capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I do a lot of research whenever I come up to something I don't know.  So, I have acquired a lot of knowledge on health when dealing with insurances, babies, etc.
0.738900	I feel like I am able to understand most of what they tell me. I think the hard part is remembering it later. 
0.666700	I feel that I have the capacity to understand basic health information and to process it.  If I don't understand, I have no problem asking questions until I do understand.  
0.811100	I think I have the capacity to understand my doctors information and to read about it online. But I think in the moment at a doctor's appointment I forget to tell them everything and so I worry they do not get the whole story. I also think that appointments themselves are expensive and I don't have the means to go to a doctor or get the tests I want done. I also think that health insurance policies are written in a confusing way where it limits what I do because I am not entirely sure what I can do. This narrows my health decisions a great amount.
0.605600	Sometimes I think doctors don't explain everything outright like they should in laments terms. They don't always give adequate resources and it feels like you're taking up too much of their valuable time if you ask too many questions. 
0.838900	With the advent of the Information Age came with it the ability to research many things independently.  For example: A terminology used in a diagnoses can be researched through the internet.  This can be essays or articles that are written in plain English, or robust biological analysis.  So to answer the question.  I feel I have absolute and total control, as long as we have an ethical and strong education system that can share their knowledge on the internet.  All can be informed about almost all things.  One only needs to learn the tools.
0.594400	I truly enjoy working at Health Decisions. The atmosphere is very casual, friendly, and has a good work life balance. I love how management has an open-door policy and are great in communicating and providing support. 
0.900000	I always fill out medical information by myself and rarely need help.  I always ask questions if I need to and I try to be as honest as possible when speaking with a doctorl
0.777800	I feel like I can review my health records well enough. When I was in the military, I used to review my records occasionally since they were available online. Sometimes, I didn't understand things and would ask. My sister is a nurse so I am able to ask her about anything I need. My best friend's father is also a Neuro-surgeon. If I have questions about anything, I ask them.
0.794400	I think that I'm perfectly capable of understanding any basic health information. If I had any questions I'd probably just look them up online so that I could get answers from multiple sources so I don't really ask that many questions.
0.916700	I have an education background in biology and I teach high school A&P. I also care about my health and want to know exactly what is wrong and how to fix it.
0.783300	Asking many questions help me understand most health information. I also often check what I heard with research on internet. And most of the time when I have a certain condition I research the symptoms on internet even before I go and see a health care person so that I already know what questions I should be asking.
0.866700	My sister is a doctor of medicine, so in the rare occurrence where I have any lingering questions or doubts that my doctor wasn't able to answer adequately,  I ask for her input. For the most part I am able to understand basic health info, due to asking my doctor questions, reading the health info pamphlets or researching it online. 
0.777800	I feel like I am pretty capable however there are somethings that can be confusing which I need help with. I can usually find this help from family or on the internet
0.766700	I believe I have the capacity to obtain and process health information and services needed to make health decisions.  Sometimes it is a matter of understanding the language and complexities of health care that makes making decisions difficult.
0.883300	I feel that I have a strong capacity to understand health information that is presented to me. I ask questions when needed, and do additional research on medical websites afterwards if something remains unclear. 
0.855600	I feel that I can fill out paper work with no problem. If I am at the doctors and they are explaining things to me it's somewhat easy to process the information that is given to me. Sometimes I ask follow up questions to make sure that I am hearing the correct information. I feel sometimes doctors give you information in a way that is hard to understand so I feel like I have no other choice then to make sure that I am hearing everything correctly to make the right decision for myself. Once I hear the information at least twice I can be confident that I know what i need to know.
0.916700	I feel fairly confident that I can ultimately get the relevant information I need   through any necessary direct questioning of the medical professional. Further, I will ask if have I questions about any written material that I might be given. I am not averse to seeking help from close friends nor researching an issue on the internet (though I rarely do this.)
0.866700	I feel that I can obtain, process and understand basic health information services needed to make health decisions.  In fact, most of the time I look up the conditions online and read books about them so I have a better grasp of what I'm dealing with.  It's important for me to understand these things completely since I have really high anxiety and I am completely uncomfortable if I don't understand what's going on with me completely.
0.900000	I feel that I am quite capable since I consider the scientific research method to be the basis for my reasoning. When I receive information from a medical professional, if I do not possess a complete understanding of the information, then I research the information that I require to understand it. I, then, discuss any concerns I may have with the medical professional.  I find that this methodology works for me.
0.683300	I usually have little problem. But only because I bring a list of questions with me to each dr appt. Having someone with you at the appt also helps. My wife and I remember different things the dr says. I look up the info on google when I  get home. 
0.633300	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basci health information and services. I usually refer to google but in the event that I need to get help for a medical personnel I would. 
0.916700	I do not have a medical background other than basic first aid and cpr training but I have always been fascinated with health issues in general. I try to keep current on health topics. I have a fair amount of experience helping relatives with their medical information and decisions. I have learned a lot through helping others about what questions to ask and how to make the most of doctor visits. I feel very confident in my abilities to do the same for myself.
0.916700	My two passions when I was young were science and writing, which led me into journalism covering the sciences.  I have worked around scientists for years.  I am comfortable reading technical material and do not hold doctors or scientists on any type of plateau.  Yes, I do have the capacity to make decisions
0.666700	I feel that I can understand most of my health information.  I have a phobia of needles, so getting shots or having blood drawn is such a trauma for me, that my health has suffered.  I haven't been able to get a full picture of my gall bladder disease.  It's also been difficult learning what I can do to help myself without surgery because doctors don't want to let you try any other option.  They always want to remove your gall bladder. 
0.827800	I believe that I am capable of understanding health information that is given to me. I also feel comfortable looking for information online to help me understand better.
0.727800	I believe in understanding documents and filling out forms I find it easy to process and understand. It is when I need more information and have to ask the questions where I do stumble and or tend to ask the wrong things or word it weirdly. I have horrible social anxiety which does not help one bit.
0.916700	I am very capable of retrieving all the information I need. I can ask questions to the nurse and doctor when I am not clear on any issue. 
0.838900	I have learned with age to ask questions. If i do not understand something I'm not afraid to speak up. I have also learned it is good to get a second opinion.  I have had instances where my PCP misdiagnosed certain conditions. 
0.783300	I think that on the whole, I have a good ability to obtain and understand basic health information.  More of my personal barriers involve my comfort in communicating with doctors and nurses clearly and honestly.  There have been some occasions in the past where I have needed assistance in understanding medical information and have had to consult several sources to get the answers I needed, but this is the exception, nor the norm.
0.783300	I feel that I can understand basic health information just as well or better as most people. I think that I have a bit more understanding of health principles because I read a lot about health conditions. Therefore, I think I can make appropriate health decisions based on my base knowledge about health.
0.844400	I have, many times in the past, successfully read and understood numerous medical documents. This includes those that come from the emergency room, family doctor, specialists, nurses, and pharmacies. Sometimes I will even read about a condition on the internet to learn more. At one time I had to read things to my grandfather, but he has passed now.
0.738900	I feel i have a great ability to obtain process and understand basic health information and services need to make an appropriate health decision. I struggle when it is something that is not basic sometimes, but i can usually look up something online and quickly gather a basic understanding of most things. Also, my mother-in-law has worked for a doctors office for 30 years and has a higher understanding of most of the things that i struggle to understand.
0.844400	I feel like I am able to understand the basics. I think having majored in Biology has also helped me understand the body as a whole more. 
0.788900	I think that I can do a pretty good job , I know that it's important to leave nothing on the table and ask any questions that I think are important. Also if I was ever going through a serious medical crisis then I would research online to make sure I'm getting the questions that I need to ask a doctor.
0.833300	I understand the majority of what doctors or nurses tell me. The only times I do not understand is when it is a subject that I know nothing about. I usually ask questions and when i do not fully understand I will try to learn about things from Google.
0.833300	I feel as though for the most part that Iâm capable to understand most of the health information provided to me. There have been times over the years that I would need further explaining of certain things and my health professionals have been able to effectively explain things to my understanding. It has been very rarely that Iâve not fully understood something but being too embossed to ask for further explanation of said conditions I have left and researched things on my own whether using the internet or talking with family and friends to understand it better.
0.811100	I feel I can comprehend many of the basic health information given to me from doctors and nurses. Ive never had a problem with understanding any fallow up documents that were given to me either.
0.722200	For the most part I do feel I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions while I am well. However having multiple conditions like MS, RA, Epilepsy when I am I'll I become extremely overwhelmed and nervous during visits and don't always get the info I need.
0.783300	I believe that overall I have a pretty good ability at obtaining and understanding basic health information and services. I have a doctor that I fully trust, and who I am always comfortable asking questions to. I also now have a pharmacy that I use, whose workers are also always willing to answer any slight questions that I may have. I have access to these physical people, as well as the Internet in order to gain information about anything else that I don't understand. I'll use it sometimes to check basic drug interactions that I can't remember, such as Tylenol and Aleve, or other such over the counter medications. I also have my parents that are always willing any questions I have concerning medical history when I have to fill out forms. I'm generally a nervous person, but when it comes to my health I do the best I can in order to receive all of the information I need, and not allow myself to feel bullied into making choices that may not be right for me.
0.805600	"I have a curious mind so anything I may not understand I will be sure to ask my doctor to explain. I have the capacity to understand much of what I'm told. My only barrier to understanding health information is anxiety which leads me to have a tendency toward ""burring my head in the sand."""
0.750000	I believe that if I don't get the answers I need from a doctor or nurse, I can always get further information online and I can use Google or WebMD or mayoclinic.com.  I an always call back the next day and ask if there is something I don't understand. I also have medical encyclopedias in case I want to look something up that I am unsure about.
0.866700	I believe I can understand the conversations I have had with a personal physician so far.  I am 70 years old but am basically healthy other than aches and pains, and see a doctor once a year for a physical. 
0.916700	My main hobby is reading, and I prefer thought-provoking non-fiction articles. I read all I can on exercise, nutrition and prevention, plus have kept myself as mentally sharp as possible. If I am sick or have any kind of health problem, in addition to seeking help for it, I read everything I can about it to self-educate.
0.661100	Oftentimes it can be quite overwhelming to take in the whole medical field information. Many terms are used that are very unfamiliar which in turn makes it all the more difficult to understand. While I may feel like asking questions I sometimes do not because I am most afraid that it will become even more overwhelming.  Most of the time I find myself googling things said by my medical professional in order to get a more clear understanding.  I also save the pages so I can refer back if I forget the terms or information. 
0.811100	I feel like I can understand and make basic decisions regarding my health but may need assistance with more complicated matters or forms.
0.916700	I feel I have the intelligence and comprehension capabilities to understand any information I am given by a medical professional. The information is usually tailored to a non medical professional and I am more than capable of processing that information. I have many sources from which I can receive medical information. 
0.605600	I understand my health questions quite a bit if not I tend to ask the doctor or dentist office as they told me not to check on internet as they said that information is not correct and to come to them only.
0.672200	I have general familiarity of general, basic medical terms, however, I don't feel great about filling out forms. I tend to overthink them and am always concerned that I'm going to fill something out wrong, and have it negatively impact me in the future. 
0.888900	I think have the capacity to read, listen and understand all that the doctors or nurses tell me. If not, I would probably ask questions until I understood
0.822200	I feel I'm well equipped to obtain and understand health information. That doesn't always mean I get it from the doctor or his staff though. Often they seem so rushed and impatient it's easier just to find out what the diagnosis is, and use the internet to obtain any additional information I need.
0.711100	I feel that the jargon used on official medical documents needs to be dialed down to my level of understanding. There is often too much redundant information.
0.916700	I feel very confident in my abilities to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I believe this is because I am a medical student, so I have a better idea of what to ask. 
0.916700	I am totally capable of talking to doctors or nurses about my health conditions.  I research anything they tell me and on later visits I will have a list of things to ask and I even take notes if I need to.  I may ask them about more natural alternatives of care especially concerning medication.  Doctors and nurses are human and only the patient knows what is completely  best for them.  
0.888900	I am well educated with a good vocabulary, so I feel that I am well equipped to understand health information and make decisions. Further, I am a scientist, so I have an understanding of medical terms. When I do not understand health information I have the resources to figure out what it means without asking another person.
0.844400	I feel I am very competent in understanding, obtaining, and processing basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. The main time I have difficulty would be with major health issues.
0.722200	I feel like I can do an okay job at it. There are definitely times I dont understand certain medical terms but I usually just ask questions and that clears things up
0.872200	I believe i'm 75% capable of reading and processing it because i like to read up and ask questions so at this point i''m pretty up to date on medicinal info 
0.844400	I feel that I have an above-average understanding of much health-related documentation.  I have grown up with parents who worked in the healthcare field so this helped me develop a basic understanding of many terms at an early age. Overall I would say I am above-average intelligence so this helps me grasps things with relative ease.  I have all of my abilities such as sight and cognition to understand documentation as well.
0.827800	I feel I have the capacity to learn and understand the basics when I visit any health professional. However, sometimes I leave the doctor feeling as if I didn't get as much information as I think I should have.
0.855600	I have no problem obtaining or understanding basic health information and services needed to make decisions regarding my health. I often do my own research to fill in what I didn't receive from the doctor
0.822200	I feel confident in expressing my Symptoms to my doctors and nurses to get the necessary test and treatment needed. My doctors always make sure I have all the knowledge to understate my diagnosis and the proper medicines. They also make sure I understand the medicines and how to take properly and how to maintain my conditions at my house.
0.727800	I feel that for the most part I have the capacity to understand and comprehend health information. The doctors and nurses that I go to and interact with usually do a very good job explaining what means what and how conditions that I have or have had in the past work, and I am the type of person to always research medications and conditions so that I can have a better overall understanding as to what exactly I am dealing with or taking. The information that is usually shipped or tagged with medication is usually quite confusing, so having a doctor who is very good at explaining things, alongside the fact that I always ask questions and research information online keeps me informed.
0.855600	I have experienced a health catastrophe in which I suffered through the treatment recommended by Western medicine (actually, I avoided the most recommended treatment and am not a cripple today, or dead, as a result).  I'm a lawyer.  I read and understand complicated documents for a living.  That's not to say I like it.
0.916700	I do not feel that is a problem for me at all. If I don't feel like I understand completely what they are saying, I make it a point to ask for clarification. I also always make sure that they are understanding what I am trying to tell them as well.
0.861100	I feel I have the full capacity to do so. Understanding the scope of health problems is not an issue for me. i have one life and understanding my body and my health issues is important, and thus fully grapsing and listening to and comprehending doctors is something important and neccessary for me. 
0.900000	I believe I get all of the information I need from my doctor.  If there is something I'm later confused about or forgot to ask my doctor I usually turn to the internet and can find my answers there.
0.883300	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process and understand my basic health information and services that are needed so that appropriate health decisions can be made.  I know how to ask questions if I do not understand and I know how to call or email my doctor also.  I also know that I can ask a loved one to get their interpretation of material that I might not understand.  Also, I can ask my doctor if I can record information so that I can listen to it again in case I miss something. 
0.916700	I believe I am 100% capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I can read and understand written material more than competently and understand verbiage just as well. I anticipate no problems in my near future also. 
0.822200	I feel that I get the information that I need from either the doctors I see or their assistants.  If I have questions about prescriptions I talk to my pharmacist, I usually get more complete information from her than the doctor on medications.  The internet has also been helpful in making decisions about my health care, in knowing which questions to ask of the doctor or hospital personnel.  I try to be very informed when it comes to surgeries or medications that are prescribed to me.  I learn best by reading, our local health care professionals are good about asking the best way that a person learns things so that they can accommodate everyone.  we are very fortunate in our health care for the rural area that we live in.    
0.666700	I believe I can fairly easily obtain basic health information.  Processing and understanding the information is usually a little harder but with the help of the internet, friends, and family I can usually figure out what I need to.  
0.683300	Some papers are really to hard to understand.  They need to either simplify the forms are have someone readily available to speak to someone and make them feel more comfortable.
0.900000	I feel like I try to enter the situation with my medical provider with some pre researched information so that I have an idea of what to ask. I try to maintain a healthy level of dialogue without giving too much unneeded information so that I can naturally ask for more information should there be an instance where there's something they tell me that I don't understand. I rarely hesitate to ask for more information if needed and if I do, I try to get back with them via email or other forms of communication.
0.866700	As of now I've been able to understand and comprehend what has been told to me. I'm lucky in the sense I haven't had any serious issues that would make it difficult for me to not understand.
0.755600	I have no problem reading basic health information.  I do sometimes have trouble filling out forms and generally have my wife help me with those since she's better with dates, doctor's addresses, etc.  I feel I sometimes don't get all the info I need since I'm somewhat shy and don't ask the doctors all the questions I probably should.
0.544400	I don't appreciate it when documents that I need to read are in medical jargon.  I need help understanding what is actually happening to me, and that frustrates me.  
0.677800	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I usually check on the web for information on health issues, and when I have questions, I will ask my Primary Care Physician. He is very good at explaining things so I understand them. My brother is also a Physician. I will occasionally ask him a medical question.
0.900000	I feel that I can understand pretty much everything that is explained to me  or that I try to find out. If I don't happen to understand everything, I am always sure to do my best to find out everything that I need to know before leaving or getting into a situation where I can no longer get help or assistance. 
0.838900	As far as basic information goes I'm fully confident I have the ability to understand what my doctors tell me. However if there's any serious issues I'll typically do my own research at home on the internet about the condition. Sometimes I'll have questions after I leave the doctor that I didn't think about while I was at the doctor, and I'll look up information online. This helps me fully understand it to a greater extent.
0.888900	I have a firm grasp of the English language and I'm reasonably intelligent and well read.  If I have questions about health information, I'm capable of finding a source that will answer my questions.
0.916700	I try and get all the information I can when I am facing, or if a loved one is facing, a health problem.  I read, I research, I listen to the doctor and nurses (especially to the nurses as they are hands-on,though my doctor explains things well). The written material is not too big a challenge normally, even when  not clearly written - I do ask when it's indecipherable because I need to understand things.
0.716700	I am able to read and understand material given to me regarding health. If I do have a question I have no problem asking for help to understand. 
0.850000	I believe that that I am more than capable. I have read a good deal about health related topics, and I ask a lot of questions. If I needed any help, I am able to get that help easily.
0.783300	I feel like if I use my knowledge and information collected from credible websites, I usually have a good idea of any conditions that I currently have BEFORE I ever see my doctor or nurse, and so I know which questions to ask when my appointment rolls around. One major issue is that medical professionals tend to ignore or downplay questions and concerns by patients At least that's been my experience and I truly resent it because I'm not some unintelligent yokel, I have a genius-level IQ and I'm obsessive about researching things, so it angers me when people talk down to me or dismiss my concerns because they have a piece of paper hanging on their wall.
0.883300	As a young, intelligent woman who has no mental health issues that would preclude me from basic literary understanding (ex: dementia)  I feel that I have very good capability to read and understand basic health information.  When a medical professional gives me materials, I read and understand them just fine.  And when I have questions about my health or medical procedures, I can usually find the answers I need on the internet.  Then, if there is some question specific to only my situation, I can ask my doctor and receive a suitable response in a timely fashion.  
0.722200	I have  the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions on my own. Most of the time I do not need assistance from others.
0.883300	I feel that I am quite capable of managing and comprehending basic health information for my children and myself. I consider my knowledge of health matters to be above average and I know how to research reputable sources when additional information is required. I also have a great rapport with my pediatrician's office and know how to call for information if needed.
0.766700	I think that I have an ok capacity.  I can read just fine but sometimes the medical wording confuses me.  I'll usually do some research once I've gone to see the doctor and been given some medical advice and that usually causes me to get further confused because there is so much information.  I'm also not confident asking questions so, I think that hinders my understanding a lot.  Also, like many others, I fail to tell my doctor everything and I know that it doesn't help my situation and can really hurt my health decisions because by keeping things from my doctor, I'm only hindering my diagnosis.  
0.688900	If I dedicate the necessary time, I can usually figure everything out that was presented to me either in paper or verbal form. My biggest hangup is when it comes to billing from hospitals or doctors since it seems like the breakdown of charges is so detailed that it is easy to lose track of what expense was for what aspect of treatment. I do find myself not always able to ask the questions I would like to though when visiting a doctor because of how rushed it always seems. The doctors (any doctor) arrives after I have waited in the waiting room as well as in the examination room, and I know the doctor has other patients who are also waiting.
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to understand everything that is explained. I always ask follow up questions if I'm not sure that I understand something.
0.844400	I feel I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health info. I do sometimes do extra research after the visit to clarify and I am at times murky on details but on the whole I have a clear picture of my health and services needed.
0.872200	I feel that I am quite literate enough to understand and process basic health info.  I am healthy and physically fit.  I have a science background so I do understand scientific jargon.
0.888900	I believe I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. When I don't understand something completely, I am sure to ask, if not right away then later through email or a telephone call. Sometimes health professionals use abbreviations or jargon that makes sense to them, but not to the average healthcare consumer. So when I don't recognize a term or need explanation, I ask.
0.838900	I am old enough and been through enough to feel comfortable with health information provided to me to make health decisions.  If there are questions that I am not comfortable asking at the time or just dont ask, the information is often readily available on the internet to find.  There is no reason I should not have all the necessary information when I make a health decision.
0.888900	I an very interested in alternative health treatments so I am very familiar with my health issues and possible treatments. I am constantly trying new herbal supplements and other nutritional supplements to see how they affect my body. I am well versed in how the human body works and what it needs. I constantly give health advice to relatives.
0.916700	I feel I definitely have the capacity to understand and process basic health information and services. If I ever have questions, I have no problems speaking up and asking my doctor to explain something or answer a question I have.
0.850000	I have basic knowledge and confidence to answer, process and obtain health information. If there's something I truly don't understand then I'll definitely ask questions to my nurse or doctors to get further explainations. 
0.833300	I think I have a fairly good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services I need to make the right health decisions.  My biggest concern is I am not always able to find the right information.
0.638900	getting the information is reasonably easy, once you are able to contact your provider, thats the biggest headache that takes the longest, Actually speaking to a doctor or nurse is difficult and it time consuming. My doctor is however very good at explaining everything, causes,syptoms, treatments.
0.900000	I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process and completely understand any basic health information and/or services that are needed to make any and all of the appropriate health decisions for myself. I usually have an easy time understanding info. given to me by my health provider. If at any time, I do not understand, I will always ask for further explanation.
0.744400	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information and make decisions about my health.  I can usually understand any material that is presented to me and if necessary I can research on my own to gain further understanding of medical information. 
0.777800	I think i am able to understand basic medical information. i generally am ok with asking questions when i don't understand something, but only if the nurse or doctor i am speaking with is approachable. Some doctors are not approachable or they talk down to you and make you feel stupid and intimidated. In those cases if i don't understand something i won't say anything, i will just try to find the information on the internet later.
0.861100	I feel I have a high degree of proficiency when it comes to the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. When situations arise in which this is not the case, I am not afraid to voice my concerns and questions and be persistent with medical staff until we can reach a mutual understanding of the information being presented.
0.722200	I always try to keep asking questions until I fully understand what is going on with a medical condition. The internet is also a great help to find additional information.
0.883300	I am very competent in filling out medical forms. I may have to get someone to write for me if the forms are small because of a lost nerve at C7/T1. Most of the time I don't though. I am well aware of my medical conditions and explain in detail what is going on with me to the doctor/nurse. 
0.472200	I have a difficult time asking the doctor to clarify when I donât understand.  Sometimes I am intimidates or feel rushed.  It is hard to reach the office one I leave.  This has led to me discontinuing care and leaving the practice.  I can research basic information online, but when dealing with a complicated matter itâs not as easy. 
0.916700	I have a full understanding of the best way to take care of myself: be honest with health practitioners, ask the hard questions and answer ones given to me honestly, keep up with check-ups, maintain a healthy lifestyle. I do not need help taking care of myself when it comes to the medical aspect of my life because I'm mentally capable and emotionally capable of doing so on my own. 
0.783300	I'm fairly confident in my ability to understand basic health information because I passed 8th grade English with no problems whatsoever.
0.844400	Whenever I have any kind of health issue, I heavily research the symptoms online, as well as all treatment options and medications, before I even go into the initial appointment.  I feel that it is very important to be informed.
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to make any decisions regarding my health. I have never had any trouble comprehending anything my doctor has informed me of, and i don;t make decisions without being informed.
0.916700	I think I have enough basic medical knowledge to handle most basic health information I am given, and I know enough to know when I need to ask questions  to make sure I completely understand the ramifications of any new health information
0.855600	I feel confident in my ability to understand medical information because I take the time to research and ask questions.  If I ever don't understand something or would like to discuss further I don't delay and ask right away.  I also go in to any appointments with my thoughts already written down so nothing is missed.
0.700000	Sometimes hospital and health lingo are really hard for me to understand and sometimes my health problems are difficult to understand. I try to ask my doctors to tell me about every detail of my health and I ask for recommendations to improve my health or to maintain my health. I don't know what it is but it's like a mental block when I try to understand my health situations and how problematic some of my problems can be about my health. I feel helpless sometimes when I ask the doctor to repeat whats been said to me for the third time but slower. Filling out my forms aren't hard but confusing at times.
0.727800	I believe I am very capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. I understand the body's normal processes and I can understand when something is wrong. However, when medical terminology is used, I sometimes need it to be explained.
0.672200	I can obtain and process health information fully. The only instance I can think of where I can't is if I were to get bad news and be so overwhelmed and scared I would need a second person there.
0.638900	I feel somewhat confident in my ability to obtain information, however, processing and understanding it can be difficult. Oftentimes, I like to have someone with me (e.g., my husband) at my appointments with me to make sure I am properly taking in everything I need to know. When I am on my own, I have left appointments several times realizing I don't fully remember everything or perhaps have forgotten to ask certain questions.
0.883300	I have the capacity to use the internet, with which I prepare myself ahead of any physician visit. And after each one. I have good physicians but they don't always give information, and I like to understand things.I also know I am my own advocate. I feel fairly empowered.
0.733300	I usually ask my doctor about any questions in regards to anything I have going on with me.

I asked my doctor every question pertaining to how fast I would be healed.
0.805600	I feel I have an above average to obtain and understand basic health information.  I'm not afraid to ask questions. I always ask questions if I need more information.  I also make sure I'm given informed consent, if applicable in the given situation.
0.916700	I believe that I can fully understand all health related information I get. I process it all very well. If I come up with a question later on I will call the office back and ask it over the phone. I understand a lot medically especially when it's explained well to me. I can process everything that I get. I have always made accurate and appropriate health decisions for myself.
0.822200	I think I have a reasonable understanding of what it means to make healthy life choices. I understand the requirements involved and am willing to remain compliant.  It also helps that my mom is an RN.
0.900000	I feel that I have a lot of capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services needed to make the appropriate health related decisions. 
0.638900	I feel that I do have an adequate ability to understand what treatments that my doctor recommends, because I am so interested in recovering. But when the doctor starts to talk about potential complications, interactions between medicines, or the 10 year road to recovery ahead, I am melancholy and I do not feel that I am able to process the information that I receive in an appropriate manner, especially given my dire medical situation. 
0.588900	good understanding Understanding is a psychological process related to an abstract or physical object, such as a person, situation, or message whereby one is able to think about it and use concepts to deal adequately with that object. Understanding is a relation between the knower and an object of understanding. Understanding implies abilities and dispositions with respect to an object of knowledge that are sufficient to support intelligent behavior
0.800000	I feel like I am able to obtain and process basic health information needed to make decisions very well. Sometimes I don't remember everything exactly so if it's something really important I like to have someone there with me to help remember everything and remind me of any questions I may have.
0.844400	I completely believe I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information! By using your brain to complete these tasks it becomes very easy!
0.638900	I Fell I have a good amount of capacity to to make appropriate health decisions but would not want to to so all by myself. Medical information, options, trust in some in the medical field and the overwhelming amount of information/misinformation available these days has me always questing and I find it difficult to make decisions that I am comfortable with 100%.
0.755600	I believe that I can understand most information and what I don't understand I look up on the internet. I use several different resources to make sure that the information is the same across the board. I also talk with the nurse at the clinic if I don't find the information I need.
0.572200	I think i can understand it somewhat however somwtimes whe the doctor is talking to me i really do not know what they are saying or taking about 
0.588900	I read the bottle labels to understand what is asked of me when i take the medications that i have.I have a bit of understanding from previous medications that i have taking in the pass because it seems like all medications are close the the same 
0.844400	Well I believe getting the best care comes down to my ability to efficiently use Google. I mean nowadays that's just a default resume skill, but it's actually relaly good to have. Knowing what search terms to plug in and which links to follow to find the best information is extremely helpful in any situation, including finding medical help/info.
0.766700	Overall I feel I have the capacity to be able to obtain, process and understand my basic health information and services because my mind is still very sharp. I am of sound mind and body. I am able to make other important decisions in my life so I feel I am totally capable of making health decisions. 
0.644400	I do feel like I can understand it all to a point. I went to school for biology and chemistry so I understand the deeper aspects but sometimes I just don't feel like my doctor understands. He is so busy. I haven't been to a doctor in a while. I do feel like I can understand information though to an extent and anything I don't, my mother will help me out with. I can make solid health decisions and have been. 
0.744400	I feel that I have full capabilities to understand, process, and follow through with any information needed on health decisions. I always end up knowing more information than most nurses most of the time.
0.822200	I feel I am pretty good at understanding the information I have been given.  I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and have also had major ankle surgery so there are times when I am not sure on a specific topic or instructions.  
0.833300	I feel that I am more than capable when I need to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  If I am unable to understand something, I will ask for help whether it be from someone else or a medical profession.  Given the right circumstance, I may research it as well.
0.794400	I have filled out medical paperwork and also have had times when I didn't understand something.  In any circumstance that I do not understand, I ask my doctor questions and or someone more knowledgeable than myself.  I have only had to do this one time.  I definitely feel capable of understanding basic health information to make health decisions on my behalf.
0.872200	I'm usually able to fill out all forms without problems, but a term used might make the question a little ambiguous. When that happens, I'll ask someone at the desk what it is asking for to be sure I'm filling it out correctly. Usually when I see my doctor for a yearly checkup and lab tests, we can chat a little about results, whether I need to do anything, and if there is something I want to being up or ask about. My doctor is very busy, but she does seem to want to answer my questions and is a good listener. I know that most of what I might be concerned about isn't a problem, so I don't bring up everything because it would probably be a waste of time. If something happens where I am sick, I can just make another appointment. My doctor uses easy to understand language gives me options when the advice is appropriate. I feel like I am part of the process, but I trust her judgement when it comes to giving me good health advice.
0.794400	I think I do have the ability to ask and understand health information if I so do so. Sometimes I might opt out of asking question, purely because I would find it embarrassing to ask such a simple question.
0.688900	I can generally make my own health decisions. The issue comes when doctors and nurses do not have time to give me all the information I need. I can understand most things just fine but if I do not have all the information I want then I can't make a good decision.
0.722200	I feel I have a pretty good capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I would say I am confident in this area about 85% of the time. Sometimes I need some assistance from other health care workers or more information before making a decision. Usually, in these cases, I am able to get the help I need.
0.766700	I am fairly confident in my ability to understand what I am told by medical professionals. However, sometimes I am bad at thinking of appropriate questions in the moment, such as clarifying questions about what I am told. I also need to put a lot of effort into being organized before an appointment in order to make sure I say everything I need to about my symptoms. When it comes to written documents I am giving after an appointment explaining my diagnosis, I am generally confident in my ability to understand, and that anything unclear is easily researched online if not.
0.777800	I feel I am capable of understanding the health information given to me by health professionals.  If I have questions I usually can ask a family member such as my brother or my wife.  Also, I see numerous doctors, I am sure they would assist me in understanding.
0.827800	Basic health information is pretty straight forward in my opinion. The doctors and nurses do their jobs perfectly well, and help me as a patient understand my options, and whatever else seems to be going on. There could be some ways that hospitals could improve upon their services such as having online forms in order to fill out information before hand which would make it much easier to get serviced quickly. Most of the time I can understand, and process the diagnoses that I have been given, and with the help of online resources the doctors job is not as necessary to explain in detail if I don't understand something or have questions I can quickly look it up and if I am still confused I can contact my doctor in order for he she to clear things up for me.
0.616700	I can read but it's hard for me to concentrate on what I am reading so I usually have to read a sentence three times. I'm not good at asking questions, I have a predisposition of not wanting to impose on people. 
0.777800	I have the utmost ability to do what I must to understand every facet of any health related issues I have, before I go to a medical professional I tend to make notations of questions I might have on my smartphone memo app for reference during consultations/visits. I also ask for any external resources online that I can review/read to help me understand, also I am not concerned about asking the same question to different specialists/medical professionals in order to ensure I have obtained accurate information. As well as needing help with forms/directions/instructions there are usually a myriad of staff members who are always read to help.
0.850000	I think I have a fairly decent understanding of basic health information and services to make appropriate decisions. If there is ever something that I do not understand someone is always around to get the correct information. 
0.872200	I feel like there are enough resources out there to gain the information needed if I don't know something. I can search something on the internet, or ask qualified staff in person. If it's basic health information, I feel like I should have no problem understanding it.
0.716700	I think I have an average understanding about basic health information and services when making health decisions.  For me, it depends on the doctor and whether they take the time to explain in layman's term the information they are trying to convey.  I usually ask questions if I am not sure or now I use the internet to get further information if I do not have someone I know who can explain it. 
0.827800	I feel that I have a decent grasp on basic health information. I can usually understand what my doctor is saying or asking me. However, I tend not to ask enough questions because I often forget what I wanted to ask once I see the doctor. 
0.888900	Understanding health information is no different than understanding anything.  Read thoroughly, and ask questions on areas that you do not fully understand.  And, in you free time, do some research.
0.727800	As a person who takes care and pays attention to my own health in general but specifically physical health, I am very confident that I can understand basic health information because of the research I have done throughout my years of living as a person who's very careful.
0.883300	I am very confident. When I think I need additional information, which is frequent, I look it up. That does not mean I randomly Google and look for confirmatory statements on websites of dubious quality. I am always ready to give the medical professional the benefit of greater education and experience if I have come to an incorrect conclusion about my condition or medical needs.
0.872200	I feel I am more than capable to do these things.  I am certainly intelligent enough to process and understand basic health information, and I make my own health decisions on a regular basis, as well as decisions regarding my children. I don't visit hospitals that often, however.  
0.838900	For the most part, I feel like I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions based on the given information and external resources; however, the glut of resources available (between internet resources, studies, constant barrage of news, etc.) can make decisions more difficult. I feel this is further compounded by the general distrust of healthcare providers as of late due to news coverage, dealing with cost of services and insurance coverage, and the volume of patients versus the number of healthcare professionals to allow adequate time to get the information that one needs. These details increase the skepticism I have for specific diagnoses and treatments as it can be hard to tell if a course of action is necessary or if it is just a profit center for the doctor/hospital prescribing the treatments or diagnostics.
0.844400	I understand most forms, occasionally i don't understand whats being asked of me. I normally understand what doctors are telling me as long as its in lamens terms.
0.833300	I feel that I get the information I need to process the information the doctor or nurse gives me by asking questions.  I also take someone with me to aide me when having a really important appointment so that I don't forget anything the doctor says or any questions I had originally that I may have forgotten to ask.  But all in all, I feel like get the information I need to understand what the doctor or nurse has said.
0.833300	I feel that i am completely able to understand. I feel this wa because i never had a problem in the past
0.916700	I am a former medical school faculty in biochemistry. I helped teach and train doctors. I can listen to, converse, and understand medical jargon. As a former biomedical researcher, I often know more about the molecular mechanism of disease than many of the doctors I associate with, and I have no trouble asking questions and hearing recommendations.
0.722200	I think I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to a pretty good degree.  I am still somewhat young, so I haven't had a lot of occasions of going to a clinic or hospital on my own.  I am still pretty used to going with my parents.  I do, however, believe that I have the capacity to be able to gather all the information needed to make appropriate health decisions when needed.
0.816700	I feel as though I have the capacity to understand basic health information. For the most part doctors I have been to speak in la miens terms so it is not difficult to understand.
0.794400	I feel like I am well prepared to pay attention to terms and read over documents and if and when there are things I do not understand I am good at knowing who or at the very least finding out who I need to talk to in order to make things clearer. I am not afraid to ask questions so that I too can completely understand my basic health information so I can then make an informative decision.
0.794400	For the most part, I feel like I can obtain and understand the information. I do get overwhelmed by the decision making process.
0.655600	I am college educated and consider myself a smart person but lots of the medical information provided or asked to provide can be very confusing. I find myself turning to Google for feedback as it's generally easier and faster than reaching out to a medical provider.
0.916700	I am able to understand written or oral information without any trouble. I am able to search for information online, make appropriate judgments about the quality and reliability of the source, and understand what it says. I have no problem asking questions of doctors or other providers if I do not understand something or want more information.
0.900000	I feel confident in my ability to process most basic health information. I do consult the internet often if I have questions.
0.827800	I believe I have the capacity to get the health information. The big reason is that I do my research. I use reputable searches to garner information about health conditions. I also come prepared to dr appointments, I bring a list of questions. I make sure to ask all the questions I have so that I can find out what I need to know. If something is not answered I will call or email the dr to ask. I can process written information well. 
0.900000	I do believe that I have the capacity to understand everything. The key is to ask questions from the doctors and nurses and read everything carefully. I also try to research any relevant information via the internet, not to necessarily make decisions, but to understand things more clearly and put me on the right track.
0.672200	I have the ability to obtain the information I need about health services and decisions. Anything that I don't understand I am able to gain more understanding of by asking doctors, nurses, or pharmacists questions. I have never had any issues gaining additional knowledge from these resources. 
0.627800	I have some issues understanding some things, hospitals and doctors give me bad anxiety so that makes the problem much worse. I can almost always get the information I need from a doctor or nurse and if I can't get it from them I use google or ask my mom. I feel I am very capable to get the information I need but I sometimes have a hard time understanding it, that is where I always make sure to have someone explain it to me.
0.861100	Being an adult of reasonable intelligence, I feel I'm able to comprehend much of the information I receive from health care providers and I'm fairly comfortable asking for clarification on concepts I'm unfamiliar with. I have a firm grasp of the English language and solid reading comprehension skills. This makes it relatively easy for me to understand written materials.
0.900000	I feel that I am able to deal with medical situations and information well in the vast majority of situations. Anything out of the ordinary simple needs to be asked about and I am confident enough to do so when I am unsure. I feel that I am better than average at making appropriate health decisions based on the criteria. 
0.811100	Before I visit my doctor, I usually call and tell them on the phone, why I need to make an appointment with them. When I get to the doctors office, they also give me a form to fill out. On the form, I have to fill in information regarding why I am there to see the doctor, what kind of symptoms I am experiencing, and for how long.  
0.500000	i do need assistance because i have ms and have all kinds of memory problems. i do not remember or remember correctly information so i do have a caregiver and partner help me to answer correctly. even when i didn't have cognitive challenges i might need a little help but now, as my health history is very complex, i do need help. 
0.916700	I have wonderful doctor that is down to earth and the Health clinic I go to makes it easy to understand what they need from me. I think it comes down to communication and at the places I get my physicals etc they are very competent and helpful.
0.761100	I am currently a senior at a University. So I feel very confident about my ability to obtain, process ,understand the necessary information regarding my health and make appropriate decision regarding my health. I am also very conscious about my health. I try to do exercise as much as possible. I often watch videos regarding healthy practices and ways to remain healthy. I have been to the university hospital several times on my own. I have talked with a physician several times and followed physician instruction carefully. I have had no problems that I can think of. So I feel very confident regarding my health decision. 
0.916700	I feel I am 100% able to obtain, process, and understand the basic information and services I need to make appropriate decision on my health. I recognize that help is available should I not fully understand, and I reach out for that help when it is available and when I need it. 
0.844400	I feel comfortable making these decisions because i ive been doing this since i started going to all my dentist and doctor appointments on my own since I was 18. After going by myself I've done research on my own and use recommendations from family and friends 
0.716700	I know that I have to ask more questions to understand the information given to me by my doctor.  I don't always advicate for myself
0.783300	I feel that I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make health decisions because I tend to use research online. When I have follow up questions I will look for scholarly websites and articles explaining what I need to know. I do find it hard to ask the doctor a question after I have left so I take the learning in my own hands.
0.716700	I am really certain that I can get the information that I may need to understand what health decisions that I have to make. 
0.833300	I feel totally able to make decisions for myself and feel that I have an above average understanding of medical issues since I was employed in healthcare for 25 years. In addition I have always been interested in the subject of healthcare. However, I do not like to go to doctors and rarely go unless it's an emergency.

0.900000	I grew up in a family where a large portion of the women in my family were nurses or had worked in the medical field. So this environment allows me to have a somewhat decent understanding of health information and understanding medical forms.
0.900000	I think to a high degree. Not only am I assertive about getting information from the health professionals that I deal with but I have the greatest library on earth, the internet, at my fingertips. In addition I am a very good reader, so I am rarely confused by written information.
0.916700	I do feel that I am capable of making any decision that needs to be made and processing any information given to me about my health care. I am actually a physical therapist and I feel that I am pretty intelligent so I think I am completely able to do anything that needs to be done regarding my health. If I have any questions, my wife is also a physical therapist and my parents are both doctors so I am confident I can get answers if I need them.
0.900000	I understand all basic health information given to me. If I need services performed on me, I understand the services advantages and disadvantages. I can comprehend every detail regarding any medical conditions I encounter.
0.883300	I feel confident that if I'm comfortable (meaning they're helpful and nice) with the doctor/nurse that I will ask all of the questions necessary and make sure they explain it to me in terms I can understand. Usually with paperwork, if I'm confused by something, I will always ask for assistance from a receptionist, etc. 
0.850000	I think I am able to process materials very well, to obtain I have to be very self confident and some what pushy to get the answers I want or need,  some times I feel I give to much information and that they don't want to listen to but I would rather they have a complete picture.

0.800000	I ask many questions during the office visits. Then followup with phone calls to doctor or his staff if needed after doing additional research. I often will seek second opinions on more serious medical issues. 
0.838900	I do my best to make sure before I leave the DR office that everything is explained to me. I do not have a problem with asking questions. They always help me make sure I understand. Most of the time I do understand what they are saying. I had some experience with questions and trying to understand things when I took care of my parents.
0.900000	I have a biology background, so I can understand what is going on most of the time. In fact, I often feel like the doctor knows less about me than I do. I try to explain what is going on in detail so the doctor knows.
0.738900	I feel that I have the ability to process the information that they are giving me. I like to get stuff in writing as well so I am able to refer back to what was said to me at a later time. Having the information in writing also helps me to do some research on the topics when I am at home after the appointment. I will also ask questions in person whenever possible so that they can explain things further 
0.744400	I feel that my capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information give me to me is good.  Sometimes, I helps to have another person read the information and explain some uncertain points. 
0.916700	I have the ability to process and understand information about my health. I also have the ability to research what is instructed to me by health professionals.
0.722200	I feel I have a very good grasp on my capacity to understand my basic health information. I have always felt that I've made appropriate health decisions given my health status. My doctors and psychologist all agree that I should attempt the way i choose to treat myself and if I need further help, they have offered to be of assistance if I require it.
0.794400	I feel that I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process, and understand different basic health information. Most of the hospital staff that have helped me in my lifetime have done a great job at explaining things to me. Almost all have been attentive and gone into further detail when I inquired about further explanation or detail. 
0.916700	I believe I take my health seriously, and that I have the resources and knowledge to understand all the basic facets of health information. I am able to make decisions about my health, and ask questions clarifying anything that I need more elaboration on. It is not difficult for me to research health information either. 
0.866700	I believe i can process almost all medical information that is relayed to me from medical professionals including doctors and nurses.  I can understand what is told to me, and I can give and solicit medical information during doctor visits.
0.866700	I am always quite confident in my own ability to either find the necessary answers or ask for help when it comes to health. I have had to make doctors and nurses re-iterate things or clarify but there isn't anything more important than your health so I make sure to ask anything i need no matter how dumb i feel.
0.861100	I feel like I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I know how to read information given to me by doctors and nurses, and if I need any help, I know who to ask.
0.688900	I'd say that I'm moderately good at doing this but this is also due to recently becoming a lot more independent than in the past so I now do all of this stuff on my own. I make sure to ask questions and go to my doctors regularly and consistently so I can stay on top of my healthy and learn to live a healthy life. The thing that's hardest for me is healthy insurance because there are so many variances based on the type of doctor I see and what's covered and what isn't but that is a learning trend not associated with my health information directly.
0.883300	I feel very confident in my ability to understand medical information.  I have never had a problem doing this task in the past and would not anticipate having it in the future either.  I have taken some basic health classes and have a good general idea of the medical field, including insurance, etc...
0.844400	I feel sometimes like I am not taken seriously by doctors. I suffer from chronic migraines and fatigue. Whenever I have brought this up with any doctor, the story is always the same: they write it off as just a lack of something in my lifestyle, maybe give me something which only barely helps, and send me on my way. I may not be the healthiest person, but I know when something's wrong with me. I wasn't always this way. I rarely ever had migraines before I went through puberty. Even then, I had more energy, but after I was in a car accident things got a lot worse for me.
0.916700	That stuff is pretty easy to understand and I make sure to ask my doctors or nurses everything I'm unsure about.  After I leave the office, like when I'm reading about any prescriptions, if there's anything I need help with, I just search for more information online.  I have no trouble understanding it.
0.861100	I have had a few medical issues since I was born, and am fairly accustomed to medical forms and medication instructions.  Also, my mother is a nurse and works interviewing patients, and I have learned a bit from her about how hospitals and the medical industry work.  I feel like this makes me capable of understanding most information presented to me by my doctor.
0.811100	I feel I am capable to read and understand health informaton and if I cant understand the health information I can ask my husband doctor or pharmacist to help me understand the situation at hand. 
0.650000	I feel like things can be complicated on papers and forms, it can be hard for me to understand. I've come to realize that sometimes nurses will be able to give you better information than some doctors. 
0.916700	At age 35 and my comprehension I feel I have 100% capacity in how to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services that are for me and that are needed to make appropriate healthcare decisions. I am well versed in my care, health issues, medical issues, basic medicines and my insurance policies. If there is something I am unsure of I have no problems or difficulties in asking for an explanation.
0.688900	I feel that if it is explained to me simply I can easily understand what is being said. I can also ask all the questions that I need to ask in order to get the answers that I need. 
0.844400	I feel that i have the ability to understand basic health information. I am usualy very healthy except when i am pregnant That's when issues tart. When I receive information from a doctor or nurse that something may be wrong, I try to ask all the questions that come to my mind. If i forget, I write them down. My uncle was a nurse before he retired so he is always there for me to assist with making health decisions. I feel that i am capable of making the right decisions for myself and my family.
0.838900	I feel like I have a great degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I regularly visit my doctor and they frequently explain any and all tests and treatments, as well as answer every question I have in an easy to understand way. I also know what websites to use for additional information.
0.844400	I feel fairly confident. Sometimes though I don't feel like I have enough of the doctor's time to ask all the questions I want or to receive all the explanations I need. Some things I need repeated because they're complex but I don't always feel like there's time for notes and repetitions.
0.822200	"I feel I am fully enabled to understand basic health information, as I I am extremely literate and studied in medical conditions, including scientific terminology. This knowledge base is self-pursued rather than academic. I also do not worry about asking ""stupid"" questions to medical professionals."
0.588900	I feel that my education which included anatomy, first aid, and a health course perhaps puts me on a slightly higher pedestal than an average person. I know a fair bit of terminology, symptoms, solutions, and of how the body works, but I am by no means an expert. The bureaucratic portion of the forms needed at doctor's offices were done by my guardian until I was 19. Because of this I feel that I have had very little time exposed to them, and as such need extra help usually on one or two sections, never the whole thing however. I feel it is harder to obtain than to process and understand as many doctors are very busy.
0.838900	I believe overall I can understand what medical professionals tell me about my health. Sometimes though I need to get them to repeat information I didnât fully understand the first time they explained it, especially when a lot of medical terminology is used.
0.916700	It's simple, whether it's the doctor, dentist, therapist, or anyone else, I follow a policy of never agreeing to procedure unless I feel like I completely understand it first. So if they can't answer all my questions satisfyingly, I say no.
0.916700	I believe that I am capable of understanding basic health information. I am a pretty smart individual. If I need help with something, I will just ask. If nobody is available, I will check the internet.
0.866700	If I don't understand something I ask questions about it until I feel that I understand what they're saying. Sometimes they can get rude about it but for the most part doctors and nurses take the time to make me understand. 
0.766700	When I was insured, I generally felt like I did; I could ask my doctor to elaborate about particular health related concerns and follow his advice. Now, though, I can't afford insurance, and I cannot afford to see a doctor in any capacity, so any health information I need has to come from the Internet. I can't get anything from a face-to-face conversation with a medical professional.
0.888900	I feel that I can obtain, process and understand my basic health information very adequately. I ask questions if I am not sure what a doctor/nurse is saying, and I read through the materials they give me. I feel competent to make my health decisions. 
0.694400	I feel that I understand basic health information to a pretty good extent. I usually only go to the hospital when it is completely necessary. The only other times I go to the doctor is for my routine check-ups. Things like flus/stomach bugs/general sickness/etc I can handle on my own and do at my house with over the counter drugs. I have a good grasp of what makes my body sick and how to take care of it.
0.827800	I am a fairly intelligent person, becuase of this if I do not understand something, I ask a question.  No shame.  Medicine is not my chosen profession.
0.794400	I feel ok in most instances when it comes to my health and any health related questions I may have.  Generally I ask the upfront questions of my medical care people but then I also rely on research i do myself to fill out that information when I have questions.  It's sometimes frustrating having to wait on test results and, generally, I feel,that's where the communication breaks down between patient & doctor.  Every time I ask 'When will X be ready?'  I get the answer that goes from tomorrow to next week with no definitive time line and that is incredibly frustrating to me.
0.900000	I feel like I understand the information given to me very well. I want to be a lawyer, so I have no problem understanding official documents. Additionally, I have lots of doctors in my friends and family, so I have plenty of people to ask when I have problems understanding information.
0.833300	As a nurse I have a good understanding of heath information and this has helped me a lot when ever I have needed to seek help regarding my health. I usually understand what a doctor is telling me regarding any heath problems.
0.844400	I feel like for the most part I can obtain, process and understand information and services related to my health to make decisions. the only thing that would stand in my way is that sometimes there are details that you don't want to share with your doctor, that make you uncomfortable. Also sometimes the doctor makes you feel uncomfortable by asking questions, so it makes it hard to totally understand what they are saying.
0.844400	I have some medical training so I'm able to understand most things.  I don't really have any complicated health issues but even if I did, I think I would be okay.  If not, then I would ask my medical professional.
0.644400	A lot of the time I don't quite understand what doctors and nurses are saying about certain things. When it comes to basic health decisions, I can usually make the decision, but a lot of the time I just want the doctor to tell me what to do. If I'm unable to understand something and the doctor and nurses weren't helpful I usually ask my sister, who is a nurse.
0.688900	Often I find myself seeking medical attention for recurring issues. I often spend time on my own (out of curiosity) reading about these conditions I have been diagnosed with. I regards to basic health information I usually have enough knowledge to understand what is being relayed to me.  
0.838900	I feel confident in making decisions as well as asking questions of my doctors about any and all items related to my health.  I believe I feel this way due to the fact that I was caregiver for both my parents and had to learn what and how to ask questions early on.  Given that I had over 15 years of experience with my parents and their doctors it gives me the confidence that I need now to take care of myself when needed and to ask the questions that I feel I need to have answered.  
0.900000	I feel that I have the capacity to process and understand basic health information. I choose medical providers that are good at communicating things to me and do not get mad or annoyed when I ask questions. I feel that if I am paying a doctor for medical care, they should be happy to answer my questions.
0.672200	I feel I have a very basic ability to understand basic health information, I find it easier to understand when layman's terms are used and not medical jargon, and if the writing is not very small, the fine print is too difficult to read.
0.483300	As a type 1 diabetic with a diagnosed learning disability I have spent a great deal of time getting medical documents transcribed to me. Thankfully my wife who is a social worker and deals with medications in her field is always able to help me. 
0.833300	I feel as if I do have the ability to retain information given to me about my medical conditions. I ask frequent questions, and also do research on my own. Any questions that I have I feel completely fine bringing up with my doctors and they are wonderfully helpful. 
0.766700	I'm confident that I can find the answers to things that I might not understand. The Mayo Clinic website provides a wealth of information that helps me understand anything that I have questions about.
0.766700	I think I have the ability to process basic health information. I am not an expert by any means but since I have not had health insurance for 10 years, I've had to rely on my own research top determine my ailments. Apart from that, I've done my own research about medicines and read news about the latest things going on in the science world.
0.738900	I feel like I've usually understood what I've been given. I don't have much experience. Nowadays, my brother's girlfriend is a doctor, so if I had any major questions, I could ask her. 
0.888900	I am fully confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand health information about any condition I have in order to make appropriate health decisions. When I visit my doctor, I always make sure to mention any health problems I'm experiencing. Sometimes, I forget to mention something or ask questions that might be pertinent to my doctor, but recently I've begun writing down talking points I want to mention in the days leading up to my appointment.
0.872200	I feel that I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process, and understand information to make health decisions.  If I don't understand something, I usually ask the doctor to further explain, and if I have more questions after I leave the doctor, I will do further research on my own.  I have done this in regards to my children's and my husband's health as well as my parents health concerns to further understand their problems.

I very infrequently have to call for more information, but when I do I usually do not have any difficulty getting in touch with somebody that can be of assistance.
0.461100	I feel like I do have the capacity to understand. I do feel however that health practitioners don't assess me on an individual level. I have a long history of being medically different,  certain tests and advice are not applicable to me. I have taken medicine that has opposite side effects on me not disclosed on the medicine brochure. Doctors usually don't believe the side effects I explain to have. 
0.761100	As an academic who lives close to a hospital, I feel that I am uniquely fortunate in my ability to obtain, process, and comprehend basic health information because I have research resources at my disposal to help understand concerns and experts to consult nearby.
0.700000	I believe that I do have the ability to obtain process and understand basic information, but sometimes the way it is conveyed is difficult to understand, and they use too many âdoctorâ terms that normal people do not understand.
0.511100	as far as I'm concerned I have enough ability to ascertain and digest the medical information provided to me unless I am not as sharp as I think, but then I normally ask my wife for help on hard to understand information.
0.866700	I feel like I can obtain, process and understand basic health information. The health professionals I've always had ask me if I don't understand something. I can also call them if I have questions later on.
0.838900	I feel that I am competent when it comes to getting the appropriate amount of medical information. I often come up with questions to ask my doctors before my appointments, so that I don't forget. I'm comfortable with asking follow up questions, and reading and processing new information that's given to me. I also feel confident about researching and reading more information about concepts or diagnoses that are unfamiliar to me.
0.850000	I feel capable of understanding the information needed to proceed in any cases. Basic health decisions and stuff like that. If you are in doubt just ask someone so you can take the best option
0.838900	I believe I am very capable to get and understand medical information. Although, I sometimes get overwhelmed due to anxiety and it makes it difficult to focus my thoughts and sometimes it affects my vision (blurred).
0.788900	I have a medical administrative background so i am familiar with most medical terms and situations. It is very rare that I need someone to explain basic health information to me because I have the resources to find any information I need. 
0.916700	I feel like I am fully capable of reading and understanding what is being told to me about my health, but sometimes cost prevents me from getting all the treatment I feel I need or desire. I think I don't always have the funds to obtain the treatment and information I need.
0.866700	I feel I am able to obtain and comprehend basic health information and services. My decisions are usually made with my husband so if there is some misunderstanding on my part he helps to clear it up. Otherwise my doctor and nurses are very willing to help.
0.722200	I have a pretty good understanding of the basic health forms given at the doctors. At times, when it comes to insurance mostly, I have trouble figuring out what they mean by what.
0.827800	I feel like I am competent enough to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed. Sometimes I may forget to ask pertinent questions while there. I may look the information up online or contact the doctor's office to obtain any additional information I need or am unsure about. 
0.655600	I would say for most basic health related information and services, I can grasp it if I take time to read through it and have a way to ask questions if needed.
0.888900	I have an undergrad degree in biology and several family members in the medical field (1 doctor, many nurses, 2 respiratory therapists), so I feel confident that I could either understand it on my own or ask them for help,
0.744400	I find myself more than adequately intelligent to understand most scientific/biological issues, but the problem lies in the paperwork. I'm never certain as to how to fill it out correctly. The only time I go to see a medical professional is in an emergency due to my lack of financial resources, so it's very intimidating to be VERY ill and be slammed with unfamiliar paperwork.
0.616700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, understand and process health information and services to a certain degree.  When they start using heavy medical jargon then I know it's time to get someone to assist me.   It's very important for me to understand what's going on as far as my diagnosis and treatment.  It's not difficult at all to get assistance but it is critical as far as making appropriate health decisions.
0.700000	i feel most timesi have the ability to comprehend and obtain information and services i need but like with anything there is those  situations and instances i do not have to ability to understand and pricess 
0.561100	It really depends on who is speaking and how they are approaching me. If they are rushing I will miss everything. Sometimes when everything is translated in me it sounds like jargon. Mostly because I am anxious and cant think clearly. 
0.811100	I feel I am pretty capable of understanding the basic health information and services I may need to make appropriate health decisions.  If there is something that I don't understand, I am able to get the answers I need. I would be able to get further clarity if needed from family or friends.
0.705600	I feel like a lot of doctors don't listen and just brush you off. I understand basic information but if I need more detail, they act like they don't care or have time to explain. I am going to try to get pregnant soon and my OBGYN just brushed me aside when I had concerns about not having a period after being off the pill for 6 months.  That's a big deal! hello???
0.916700	At this point in my life, I believe that I have all the skills that I need to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I believe that having three kids has given me an advantage of being able to understand health information more. I was a stay at home mom for a long time so I was the main parent that was in charge of taking my kids to the doctor and taking care of them. If it's something basic, I know that there are resources online that I can easily access to find quick remedies to certain ailments or injuries. I also know that there are phone numbers that I can easily call for more serious conditions like being poisoned by some kind of liquid or being bit by a poisonous animal.
0.688900	I can understand and maintain most of the basic health information on my own. Although sometimes I need a little more explaining from the doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. If I donât understand things I will usually ask a question
0.766700	I think that I am able to obtain the information that I need the majority of the time. There have been times when I took my daughter to the doctor and they wanted to give her shots and they don't want to explain what they are really giving her. I ask questions and they don't really want to give me a detailed explanation about what is in the shot. I had to look it up on my phone one day because they didn't explain it well enough. 
0.844400	I think I am fully capable of understanding basic health information.  I often think of questions in advance so I remember to ask them. On occasion I think of a question after the fact that I wish I could know the answer to.
0.850000	I feel very strongly that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions
0.583300	From all the questions that i have answered i feel like i have some good capacity to understand basic health problems and i can figure out health information to a bit extent
0.883300	I feel that I have the capacity to take care of most of my health related stuff on my own but I do wish that doctors would be more precise and explain a lot more about the medication they give me. I understand basic information though, just not when they use very technical words or medicine names. 
0.827800	I feel that I am fairly competent when it comes to understanding basic health information and services. I have had a chronic illness since I was a child and spent several of my teenage years very ill. It took several years for doctors to realize what was wrong with me so I spent a lot of time doing research of my own, asking questions, and learning about my health and my condition. My mother has also had lupus my entire life and as a child I was educated very well on that and how her condition was treated and I often went to the doctor and hospital with her.
0.738900	i feel that I have at least an average capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I've never had a major issue attempting to process said information, and any minor issue has been quickly resolved. 
0.577800	I think I have the capacity to understand most things that are related to my health. If I do not understand something, I also have the capacity to seek out extra information through sources available to me. I sometimes feel a little nervous about asking doctors questions because I almost feel like I should know what something means if they tell me.
0.833300	I don't have problems reading or understanding the information given to me by health practitioners. Sometimes I may read up on a condition etc on the internet for a better understanding if I still need more answers. 
0.811100	I feel like overall I'm well equipped and capable of obtaining and understanding any basic health information I may encounter. I am a fairly healthy person and rarely visit the doctor, so my exposure has been minimal up until now. However I think I would overall be able to navigate what was thrown at me unless it was some crazy rare condition
0.772200	I think that I am fully equipped to understand my basic health information and services. Especially since I have many medical professionals in my family I can ask. However, how it pertains to insurance is where it becomes very complicated, because things like what is covered and what they pay and so on.
0.722200	I think for the most part I can handle basic health interactions. I rarely have trouble filling out the questionnaires, but I don't always remember questions I have for the doctor until I'm back at home. I think especially when they catch me off guard or there is a problem that is discovered, my mind sometimes blanks and I just don't have time to process that information and think of questions until later.
0.783300	I feel like I have the ability to be informed about my health decisions. If the doctors can't explain it well enough then I can always look it up online.
0.844400	I feel I am able to comprehend what doctors tell me. Although many times I forget some of the details because I always feel rushed. But I am able to look things up on my own.
0.900000	I'm quite able to ask questions that I might have about my medical needs and understand what is explained.  If there is any other questions that I have, I don't hesitate to ask.  Also when I get have time, I research online the information that I was given and if there is another option, I bring that up with my doctor.
0.688900	I am very capable to understand all that is properly explained to me.  I am not that familiar with many medical terms but if they are properly explained, I understand.
0.844400	I feel well within my ability to process medical and health information as I haven't stumbled on any step of the process yet. Getting to this point was fairly seamless from childhood, when my parents would fill out most of the documentation and so on.
0.900000	In general, I feel I have a sufficient capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information, services needed and make appropriate health decisions. I am comfortable in a relative sense in these situations and also do not have a problem seeking out help/resources if needed.
0.872200	I don't have much of a problem understanding medical terms and health information. If it is basic knowledge then I usually understand what my doctor is talking about. I also know more terms from taking college science classes in university. With obtaining the information I have no problem going to my doctor whenever I need questions answered about my health. Like asking why I get a pain in my chest occasionally. My doctor had no problems asking me more questions to be able to find out the cause of my problem. Now when I get that pain I worry less about what underlying illness it could be and now I know how I can get rid of it.
0.916700	I'm of sound mind, I understand everything that doctors tell me and don't have any problems comprehending any written material I'm given regarding medical conditions. The only problem I might have, and it's new, and a minor one, is trouble reading really tiny print that you might find on medication bottles, or pamphlets, without reading glasses.
0.816700	Although I do not have a background in health, I feel that have the capacity to fill out health forms, understand health conditions, and process basic health information.  Generally I know enough from the outset, but when I don't am comfortable asking my physician questions, and I think I have a good grasp of the sources that I can trust online.  It's rare that I can't find a good answer to a pertinent health question on the internet.
0.866700	I have dementia but am still fairly high functioning.  I can think things through but have problems remembering so I try to go to appointments with notes that I type up in advance to make sure things don't fall through the cracks.   I can then make handwritten notes as the doctor or nurse answers the pre-typed questions.   The times I run into trouble is when I don't bring / take notes as I can easily forget some of what was said if I count on memory alone.  That is why I prefer to get written information that I can review slowly and refer back to as needed.
0.872200	I have never had a serious issue filling out medical paperwork or dealing with medical staff when I needed information. I don't always think of every relevant question when I'm at a doctor's visit, but if I do have questions after an appointment it is never a problem to phone my doctor's office and ask one of the nurses or have the doctor give me a call back. We also have access to an online interface for asking questions and viewing test results, etc.
0.677800	I feel that I understand most of the information and forms that are required of me. I take the time to understand what information is needed and anything that they need to know about me, my conditions or any issues. I have a state of mind of getting a task done and filling out any health information.
0.838900	I feel greatly that I have the capacity to comprehend my health situation. I work in the medical field for a contract research organization and am a cancer survivor. I know what to ask and when, and I know how to translate when I receive. 
0.866700	I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. When I'm talking to my doctor and don't understand, I ask questions until I do. Alternatively, I do research on my own as well. 
0.650000	I believe that I have the capacity to process the basic information that a doctor or a healthcare professional tells me. I do not think a doctor would just leave you blindly, they would help you understand what is going on. And even if they do not give me all of the information I will still have a decent understanding of what is happening to me. I am no where near educated as a doctor is but I have taken quite a few medical classes, such as medical terminology so I have at least a basic understanding of what I would need to know when a doctor is breaking the information down to me.
0.916700	My health is very important to me and so I make sure to ask questions and make sure I fully comprehend everything that is told to me.
0.916700	I feel that I have total capacity to obtain, process and understand any and all health information given to me. I am very capable in making medical decisions for myself and for my children.
0.588900	I believe i have capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions to a moderate extent. I know i can always look up symptoms and remedies for any health concern online and if it appears more severe i can contact my doctor or a healthcare professional to fully understand and take the correct approach to any issues.
0.838900	I am very confident to understand basic health information and services. I have a lot of experience at hospitals and doctor's offices. 
0.900000	I feel that I have a good grasp of medical terminology and lingo. My grandparents and father have all had vast dealings with the medical community, which makes me feel comfortable and familiar with what happens at a hospital or a doctor's office. Medical professionals don't seem as intimidating and medical procedures as scary as they once did. That regular contact with medical professionals definitely makes me feel more confident in my ability to manage my own care. 
0.900000	I believe I am 100 degrees able to understand, process, and obtain basic health information. I have filled out my own forms for years. And for the last 9 years I have also filled out my children's. I also have my medical office assistant certificate which also helps me. 
0.750000	I feel very confident in my ability to understand most basic health information and services. My doctor is always good about helping me to understand what is said and I try to write down questions I may have before going to the doctor so I remember them.
0.672200	I feel like its possible to find the information that I need online. When I go to the doctor, I always feel like it's rushed and they just make a diagnosis and then want to leave as soon as possible, not really having any concern for any questions that you may have. I don't like this part about it. 
0.611100	i could like to be very open to every individual so as whenever i will experience a problem, i will have somebody who will be willing to help me. i will stop beaing fearful because it will never give myself courage to ask what i will be needing about understanding my health status.whatever questions i will be having i will be so much free to the nurses and doctors so as to be efficiently helped
0.816700	I think it depends on the reasons why i'm in the hospital. If it is just a regular check up i usually don't have any problems understanding basic health information. Few month ago i had some issues with my stomach and because i'm not very educated in that sphere i needed more help of the nurse to understand what was wrong with me and why i needed to take the test that i was asked to do 
0.583300	I am not fully qualified to analyze in depth about the medical topic, but I am able to understand and analyze many basic things about medicine. I have learned all these things throughout my life while I care for other people or even, I learn it when I take care of myself. That's why I consider that I can understand the things that will be discussed in this survey
0.872200	Iâm your average adult so I think Iâm doing a pretty good job at understand things related to my health and communicating and understanding health professionals. 
0.633300	I think that sometimes I do not know what to ask doctors, nurses, or pharmacists. I do not know what I don't understand sometimes. I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information, but sometimes I think I lack the underlying mechanisms and understandings associated.
0.816700	In general, I feel I have the capacity to obtain and process the info needed to maintain good health.  But I feel like I've had specific instances in my life where I had a medical condition and even after going to more than one doctor, I still didn't know what was wrong or how to solve it and researching things on my own online only added to my confusion.
0.794400	I think that I generally understand what I am told about my health and various health services, but sometimes there is fine print or things that I have some confusion about. Or things that are not written down and just told to me, so I forget. 
0.900000	I feel confident that I will understand basic health information, and ask questions to obtain clarification or additional information.  I have had a serious health scare 8 years ago (cancer) and very much trusted my doctors and nurses to provide me with the needed information.  I felt comfortable asking questions and sharing information.  This in turn has helped me for any future health adventures I might face.
0.838900	I feel I have a pretty good grasp on doing all the mentioned above in regards to filling out medical information. I usually don't find myself getting stuck very often while filling out forms. There have been a few occasions where I did need assistance though. 
0.744400	Most times when I go to the Doctor I have to get the Doctor or a nurse to go over any and all paperwork, so I will completely understand all directions from the Doctor.  My health is very important to me and I do not want to leave the office confused about anything that the Doctor has said.
0.744400	I feel like I do, but I get nervous when I talk to a doctor or nurse. When that happens, especially if they tell me that something is wrong, I get flustered and forget to ask what it is and all the questions. Then when i call I cant get them or they wont answer questions becuase they are too busy.
0.822200	I have a lot of experience with doctors as I've had to deal with them when my mother was terminally ill. Sometimes things were hard to understand, but most of the time I was able to understand everything. We had to do all sorts of paperwork and make so many decisions. It was a mess.
0.822200	i have full capacity. i understand the basics and anything i do not understand i am confident that i can get someone to explain it to me in further detail. i also have acess to internet to help further
0.916700	I know where to obtain basic health care information and services. This includes forms and documents. I know how to fill out the forms on my own and understand what information the forms are requesting without receiving any help. I'm able to understand forms and documents that provide basic health information and services in order to make informed health decisions that are appropriate for me.
0.916700	I am confident in my abilities to understand what has been given to me to read and know how to obtain additional information if needed. I also do not hesitate to monitor my own lab values and to ask any health-related questions to which I feel I require additional information.
0.716700	I believe that I have the capacity to understand the majority of things given to me. If not, then I have family that would assist or even looking online for more information. What I find to be confusing is at times, one can get different recommendations or advice from the health field, as in getting a second opinion, etc. I do my best in making healthy choices in my life though.
0.827800	I think I am extremely competent to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I usually have no problem understanding what doctors and nurses are explaining to me and if I don't I will ask questions to make sure that I have a full understanding.
0.883300	I feel like I am very able and comfortable obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, using resources such as my spouse, friends and the internet.
0.916700	I know how to analyze data properly. Also its very basic just listening skills not really much to explain there, so not sure what you are looking for with this. 
0.916700	I feel I have a great understanding of what I need to make good health decisions. I don't get shy or nervous about asking questions when I feel I don't understand something. Part of a doctors job is to educate and explain things that you may not understand or fully grasp.
0.661100	I really like my Dr so getting the information I need is pretty easy.  The issue is sometimes remembering everything that was said.  He does give me the results of blood test so that helps. Remembering why and the importance of what he said is the issue.  I can always call the nurse however at any time and get a brief run down on the visit too if needed.  I feel like my Dr knowledge is what helps me make appropriate health decisions.  Plus he breaks it down pretty good.  
0.916700	I understand my medical conditions and have done a lot of research on health issues.  I do research before I even go to a doctor if it seems a new health issue has popped up.  I have also studied medical information and terminology to help out my parents with their medical conditions.  I try to be as informed as possible before any doctor visit.  I have always been able to absorb and understand medical information easily.
0.866700	I feel I am capable to obtain the information I need to make my health decisions the majority of the time.  My mother was a nurse so I was exposed to medical terms at an early age.  I am also a college graduate, English is my native language and i read and comprehend well.
0.800000	I feel that I am mostly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I have learned some information in high school and college about basic human health and over the years I have had encounters with government and health services.
0.822200	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand my basic health information. I do utilize the internet to look up questions I may have about symptoms and diagnosis. I will also ask my doctors if I do not understand or if I have more questions. Also, I ask my doctors so I can confirm what I have read online.
0.844400	Regarding all the questions I just answered, I feel that I have a very high comprehension level to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate Health decisions
0.850000	I consider myself above average when it comes to understanding basic health information. I can read and comprehend, and have no qualms about asking for additional clarification when needed.
0.900000	I feel that the doctors and nurses do a fine job helping me understand, obtain and process my health information. Health care coverage is completely confusing (even for the people providing the coverage), but the actual information and services are always more than sufficient for me to make decisions.
0.855600	I believe I can find most information on the internet. I think I can also ask for a second opinion from a professional if need be. I have had documents mailed to my house that explained my coverage very well. 
0.744400	I am able to process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions without difficulty. My problem is, I am hard of hearing and have trouble collecting all the information the doctor provides. I always take my spouse to my appointments so she can later relay any of the things I may have missed.
0.777800	I believe that in my experiences I have not needed much help with the entire experience of going to the doctor and anything related to it. I have been able to understand directions, fill out forms, and ask good questions. 
0.888900	Pretty well. If the doctor tells me something i make sure to keep it in my mind or even write it down. Health is not something to joke about and i have any questions i'm sure to tell him. But overall i understand why i need to take something or do somethin.
0.744400	I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions based on my own health curiosity and a detailed family tree of health issues. 
0.916700	I have the appropriate knowledge regarding my past health to be able to fill out any and all forms presented to me before and after any appointments. Should I ever have any questions, i do not hesitate to reach out to a nurse for assistance if there is any confusion. 
0.633300	I believe that I understand most of what the doctor is saying but when it comes to results of blood work or test like the MRI or Cat Scan there is little to no explanation given. I usually have to do additional research online to try and correlate the issues that I have with the test results that are given. The doctor most times comes in and seems rushed. By the time you are on the table, undressed and being poked you have forgotten all the important information that you need to obtain in specific. I have access to my records online so it helps a bit to review and then try to process the information. However, there is much that I do not understand and wish I had more assistance.
0.900000	I usually find it not too difficult to understand medical terminology.  Thus I don't have a problem with understanding what is being told to me in medical situations.
0.844400	I'm no medical professional, but so far, I've never had to fill out more than basic forms, so I rarely need help with anything.  The only sticking point I've ever had was trying to remember the name of an antibiotic that I've taken before (I didn't know that there was more than one at the time).  When I did find out the name, I couldn't spell it.  Luckily, there was a co-worker with me who studied pharmacy and spelled it without a problem. For the most part, I don't have any problems, though.
0.800000	I feel relatively well versed in health related matters although I am not in the health profession. I read a lot about health and fitness.
0.527800	I would say that I do have a pretty decent understanding once something is explained to me. But if I have to make a decision without any knowledge of the subject I struggle. Health insurance especially is very difficult for me to understand.
0.794400	I can get easily overwhelmed with new information at appointments. I often forget to ask questions during appointments, and think of them later. This makes it difficult for me to make decisions when I am asked to make decisions while AT the appointment. Also, I don't always know that I am not being offered all possible options when being given options, and I don't always think to ask if I am being given all possible options. I think I have too much trust in my providers to actually do that. 
0.916700	I feel like I have the fullest capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make my own appropriate health decisions, as well as for my children. I know what to ask, where to go and how to figure out what I need to. My mom showed me how to fill out paperwork when I was younger when she would take me to the doctor and I feel quite confident relying on myself to take charge of health matters.
0.916700	I feel extremely capable of coming up with good questions, asking those questions, doing independent research, and understanding information I receive in order to make good health decisions for myself.
0.883300	I believe I have a very thorough and deep capacity to obtain, process, and properly react to medical information. First, I rarely have difficulty making some connection with the medical professional (or professionals) with whom I am working. So, I can usually formulate a question in such a way as to permit the professional to make an intelligible, intelligent answer. Second, I believe that the internet and other library sources have material which can aid me in understanding medical situations (yes, there is also much misinformation out there, but there are also reliable sources).
0.883300	I'm an educated woman, and intelligent, so I have a good grasp of basic health and medicine issues and the ability to understand a doctor's explanations.
0.916700	I feel that I am more than equipped and knowledgeable to be able to obtain, process, and understand anything regarding my basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision.  I have been taking care of myself via doctors and health care providers for over a decade and have never had any issues understanding or not knowing who to ask appropriate and valid questions to.  I am comfortable in the medical arena as I have had previous work experience in the medical field and was premed for two years in college before switching my major to business/accounting.
0.705600	I believe my understanding of the English language helps me to understand most forms. If I do receive information that I cannot clearly comprehend then I ask the assistance of friends and family who work in the medical field to make sure I can get the language in a more simple form. Luckily most of the medical forms I have had to fill out are made so that people can for the most part understand them. I am usually 85 percent confident that I can fill out and understand most forms
0.900000	I have the capacity to process and understand the information needed to manage my own health.I know what services to access and the means to reach them. I do sometimes need assistance communicating since my hearing has gotten worse but I find ways to mitigate that situation when needed. 
0.727800	I think that for the most part I'm comfortable with making health decisions. I'm wary of doctors and I think people give them too much credit in their ability to diagnose people and prescribe the right medications. Mostly I like to have raw test results and with that I can research on my own and try to understand how to reverse engineer a physical problem I'm having and why it occurred. The body is very mechanical in nature and as such, most problem arises for very good reason. We're a product of evolution so it's best to look at our distant ancestors for clues on how to live healthily and without ailment.
0.811100	I am not always 100% confident that I understand everything I need to understand. However, I know enough that I trust I am making the right decisions for myself. Often, I lack 100% confidence simply because sometimes there is not a definite answer my physician can give me, and they cannot predict the future. Specifically I had a difficult pregnancy and really no one could give me an answer on why I had the problems I did. So I relied on my own research to try to get a better answer. 
0.661100	i believe that i can comprehend most of the medical documents i only have a problem when they require signatures and also when they use medical terminology to describe things that could be put simply. 
0.833300	I am able to read the information, or listen to the information.  I feel like I can speak up and ask questions about how my diagnosis is related to what I read.  I can fill out needed forms, with a few questions
0.838900	I feel confident obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information. I do feel some hesitation regarding a specific diagnoses that I have because there doesn't seem to be much concrete information and my doctor has to ask me questions it to gather more info for other patients. 
0.866700	I think I have a good capacity to ensure I can understand the information, provide input to my healthcare professionals, and ask the questions I need to in order to make decisions and follow directions when needed. I often have a list of information when I go in, questions I want answered, and other ideas prior to walking in and try not to walk out without feeling comfortable with what I've learned.
0.900000	To the degree that I can reference to other available, public information sources regarding the health information presented to me by doctors and nurses. I'm best at processing and understanding written information when taking the time to perform more research on the information in question.  
0.588900	I think I obtain at least somewhat of a basic understanding of the health information that was provided to me. I wish there was more explaining however, because they are times where I do not understand what is going on in some aspects of the application.
0.916700	This may sound a bit pompous, but I have a fairly easy time understanding health information for two reason. First, I work in healthcare. I have worked in healthcare for 12 years. I'm also just smart. (See? Sounds conceited, but I don't mean it that way.) I am the one that every one of my family and friends come to for medical help or advice. 
0.855600	I have all the knowledge I need.  If there is something I am unsure about I have the resources available to me as I work in the health field.
0.850000	I have the capacity, but sometimes I'm in too much pain to be able to process everything I'm being told.  And doctors don't always tell you what you need to know.  Or they mislead you and talk you into things, including surgeries, that you wish you hadn't agreed to later.  (That's happened to me more than once.)
0.655600	sometimes it gets tough to cooperate when ready books before going to bed. I need lots of light and a activity around me.
0.811100	As a patient, I am about 70% confident that I have the capacity to obtain , process and understand basic health information and services needed to make health decisions. I have BA degree and always learn new health information myself, so I am comfortable with my level of capacity.
0.916700	I am adept at reading medical reports. I remember all the medicines that I take and their dosages.If I don't understand something, I can usually ask a receptionist or a curse. I am fully versed in all my diagnoses.
0.900000	I feel that, within myself, I have more than adequate capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services I need to make appropriate health decisions. Whether or not the information and services are actually available and of a quality that will help is another matter.
0.538900	I can understand basic health information regarding my diagnosis. I can obtain a basis understanding from pamphlets that I've received from the doctor regarding my specific medical condition. The dialogue between the doctor and I usually does not go further than this because of very limited time constraints. When they had my info over to a staff after a 3 minute discussion, it brings me to square one because the nurses usually aren't there during that part of the conversation.
0.838900	I have a biology background and a little bit of hospital lab experience.   I feel like this gives me an above average ability to process and understand what doctors are saying and to research.  I will still ask questions though if there is any doubt.
0.888900	I feel very confident with everything involved with my health info and services. I have had a lot of experience with myself and my family. If I do not understand something I will research or ask a health professional to assist me. I have had to make health decisions for myself before.
0.900000	I feel that I understand most information about health conditions. Sometimes I need more clarification when it comes to the workings of health insurance policies and other related documents. Once it is explained to me semi thoroughly, I have no problem processing and understanding this information though.
0.866700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand health information.  I feel very confident in my ability to do so.  I am not afraid to ask questions when I need clarifying, and I am always eager to take the time to read and learn about my own health conditions so that I can make the best decisions for myself possible.
0.855600	I feel very confident in my ability to read and understand medical info presented for laypeople. There's a lot of information available in a lot of places and I can usually tell the wheat from the chaff, and when I'm talking to professionals, I know enough to understand or ask about what I do not. 
0.794400	Generally I feel I can understand health information needed services.  I usually pester my doctor asking questions and even repeating them if I feel that is necessary.  Often, when I get home I will research information on medications and medical issues on the Internet if I do not fully understand them.  I will also ask my spouse as she is quite knowledgable about these things. 
0.672200	I can understand basic health information. Only what I do is have a reading of my blood pressure or oxygen. Then I will ask a nurse questions about my reading. What was my reading for my high blood pressure? Is that good or bad? I will ask if my oxygen level is go or not. If it is a little low I will ask what causes it to be low. I try to learn what is good and bad about my health. I also try to learn as much as I can online by looking what I am curious online.
0.811100	I feel I am great and have a lot of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. Normally the material is written simply and if I don't totally understand I will google for answers or ask my doctor/nurse.
0.844400	I feel that I have a basic understanding of health information.  I am well read and and always seek out more information to give me a better understanding of things.
0.644400	I believe I have the understanding to make basic health decisions. However, in the cases where there are specific issues (such as dermatology), they quickly explain the condition you are facing and prescribe some medications (trial and error). Often times, they expect you to remember everything they say in the office. In the slight chance they write something down, it is often only a few words.
0.883300	I ask questions and read the information I'm given.  I have also talked to friends or relatives that have had the same or similar problems.  I had 1 minor and 3 major surgeries and lot's of tests last year.
0.916700	I have had an interest in medicine since childhood, having grown up in my father's pharmacy.  I am the gatekeeper and knowledge authority for my family's healhcare and am fully informed on all their medical conditions.  I have a kong0-standing open relationship with my primary care physician and the specialists I see.  I have also been the primary caregiver for my mother when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and advocated aggressively for her care.
0.633300	I feel like a have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I say this because besides medical professionals explaining things verbally, they can also give you information/papers to take home. There is also a plethora of information available to those who need to look up information online, given that the people looking up things online does take their research as a self-diagnosis.
0.772200	I feel I am pretty competent at being able to understand basic health information. There are times where I run into things that i don't quite understand how they work or why the doctor has to do them. I think I can feel out a health form pretty well though. 
0.822200	I feel pretty confident that I have the ability to understand health information given to me. If I don't understand anything at all I ask until I get the answer I need. Sometimes I feel like a problem patient because the Dr or Nurse get a bit frustrated but that's their job and my job is to keep track and fully understand my own health as a bottom line. I learned this all the hard way by not asking questions in a previous situation and only became more ill. I think we pay for this information so we should understand it even if we have to go through many people to get it.
0.538900	I think I have a moderate capacity to do this. I think that they use a lot of difficult terms, and that is where the misunderstanding come from.
0.666700	I am educated and articulate, but I feel like dissemination of information is so provider-specific. For instance, I have a mild condition that was recently diagnosed, and what the doctor told me in terms of how common it is was not at all consistent with what his nurse told me, and what I had found anecdotally. So while I have the capacity to process quantitative information, sometimes it's more difficult when individual communication styles come into play.
0.838900	I feel confident that I am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  If I have questions, I could speak with my doctor or nursing staff to find answers.  If the answers were too technical, I would feel comfortable asking for clarification.
0.777800	I feel fairly confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand what I need to make appropriate health decisions,  Iâve utilized the Internet, my pharmacist and my nurse practitioner when needed.
0.794400	I feel that even though I am not a medical professional, I am able to ask questions until I feel confident that I understand the gist of the information about my medical needs and care. I do not always understand what is initially said to me or provided to me in writing but I feel confident that I am able to discuss with the medical provider the information until I understand it for the most part. I also have the ability to use an internet search engine to help me understand information as well.
0.916700	I feel I am 100% confident in my health information and choices that I make.  I am in good health and hopefully I will remain that way for awhile.
0.750000	I feel like I am in a good position to do these things, but that is because I am somewhat intelligent. I feel like healthcare professionals are open to answering any questions that I may have and willing to do so in terms that I can understand. The only thing that I am not confident in is my ability to obtain all the information I need. Sometimes I am confused about where to go to obtain information.
0.855600	I think I can understand health information well enough to make health decisions. I am familiar with making health decisions for myself and my kids.
0.777800	Depending on which people I interact with I am mostly capable of doing this. There have been certain doctors and nurses I have run into that do not listen, do not believe what you say, and act like it is beneath therm to explain things to you that you do not understand
0.705600	I feel that I have a good capacity to obtain and understand such information, but the problem is often how insistent I feel that I need to be in order to get it. Another problem arises when there is more information needed to properly understand certain medical situations including specific policies and practices, but if one is not aware of the extent to which such information exists and therefore demands it and insists on thoroughly reading it, one is not offered it.
0.716700	I feel that I am confident in making health decisions. I know that I can always ask questions of those with a better understanding if something confuses me. If I don't understand something that they have said, I often look their answers up on line so that I can see it worded in normal language. 
0.916700	I believe I could interpret just about any health information given to me on my own and take actions based on my understanding and comprehension. I think if I had trouble understanding any of it, I would be able to ask appropriate questions of a provider and get answers I could use to understand it better.
0.916700	I feel I'm at full capacity to understand and comprehend any medical information provided to me.  I've had 100s of appointments throughout my lifetime with little to no misunderstandings.
0.750000	I can usually comprehend and understand most of what a doctor or nurse says. I try to have them repeat anything I don't understand. A few instances, I did not accept their evaluations or diagnoses.
0.916700	I feel that I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have always had an interest in the medical field and worked in a hospital for a brief time about 30 years ago. I read a lot of online sources and follow news about medical issues and advances so I consider myself to be competent enough about most medical issues to get and deal with any relevant health information or services I might need to make the right health choices.
0.688900	I think that what I would really need is a friend to help me.  I would probably have to repeat things back to the provider.  I'm not fully skilled.
0.811100	I am as capable as anyone at understanding health information provided to me, but health is very specific and individual and I believe often that doctors speak in generalities because to do more would require more time than they have to offer or I want to pay for.  So some specifics, or details that would make my situation different from the norm, get lost unless I continue to have a problem that warrants further specific attention.
0.655600	I think I am a pretty intelligent person and I can usually infer what people are trying to communicate with me. Sometimes the technical words confuse me a bit.
0.711100	I believe that I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel that in most situations the information is easy for me to understand. There have been times when I needed more clarity on forms and medical terms or diagnosis. The times when I needed clarity I usually turn to the internet first before I turn to a doctor or nurse to get the information I need to make it more understandable. Getting a hold of a doctor or nurse on the phone usually is a long process that I like to avoid. I like to get my information rapidly and not have to wait for a call back from a doctor or nurse. I think in my case it really helps that I took courses in college dealing with anatomy and physiology and disease. This makes it far easier for me to understand the information the doctor is telling me. I know in my own family there is often a lot of confusion over understanding health information. So I think it is a matter of having had exposure to certain terms and subjects in healthcare.  
0.916700	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information because I have strong reading and verbal skills. I can also research my health condition and look at the expert opinion of other doctors in order to come to reach a decision.

0.916700	I am able to read and understand most materials given to me by doctors. My primary care doctor is very willing to get me more printed information if I request it and sometimes does it on his own.
0.811100	Well I am pretty knowledgeable myself in medical field, as my wife is self taught health adviser. It is very easy for me to understand and process basic health information as well as services in order to make the right decision. I have hardly ever had any problems regarding the basic information about health.
0.883300	I have a science background, so the terminology is relatively easy for me to understand. In addition to communicating with health care professionals, I also do research on line with regard to my conditions.
0.900000	I feel confident when I go into a doctors office that I will get as much clarity as is possible from a provider. My mother and sister are doctors and I am an occupational therapist, so I took several years of physiology, anatomy, neuro, etc.
0.888900	To a very high degree, I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I think it helps me a bit to work in the Healthcare industry. But even if I did not, I feel the forms are really straightforward and the paperwork after the doctor's visit is very informative and easy to read as well. Even the information that comes attached to the medication is not so bad. Although, the names of the medications can be difficult to pronounce the instructions and descriptions are pretty straight forward. 
0.855600	Even though I don't have a medical (or even remotely Science) background, I believe that I understand basic information and services to make suitable health decisions. The only time this gets confusing is when there is something new/totally unfamiliar.
0.605600	I think I can understand and process a lot of the information given to me by health professionals, but sometimes I need to get an extra opinion to maybe help explain it further to me. I also like to talk things out and I could have missed something so it's always good to have someone else look at the information and try to explain it to you.
0.666700	I believe that I am very capable of understanding my health information and services. I am able to make appropriate health decisions. I would prefer to have a second opinion or confirmation from someone I trust if possible, just to be sure that I understand correctly. 
0.844400	I feel that I have the capacity to understand the information that my doctor gives me. I also have the capacity to fill out medical forms.
0.827800	The processing and understanding are rarely an issue, it's really about getting the information I need to do these things that is the problem.  Usually when I go to the doctor I am a bit stressed so I forget to ask pertinent questions.  Then realize it after leaving.  When I get home I often try to call them but rarely get a response right away.  I most often times find what I need on the internet. Days later I will get a response from the doctors nurse.
0.777800	I think I can comprehend all the basics I may need to know although I may need to ask to have some things clarified if they are told in terms that I do not understand.
0.844400	I feel like I can understand the services and basic health information without any issues. My reading comprehension has always been pretty high, so I've never needed any assistance. 
0.677800	I sometimes feel I don't understand the terms and descriptions that the nurse/doctors are telling me.  A lot of times I get off the phone or get home and feel confused about the information I have been given.  I end up thinking of numerous additional questions I should have asked.
0.750000	"I am very bad at talking to my doctors because a I often don't want to ""make a fuss"" or I just assume that there isn't really anything they can do so I let it go. "
0.883300	I am in the medical field so I have indepth knowledge about medicine. Because of this most of my professional that I see speak to me as equal and not dumb it down. 
0.916700	I feel I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself.  And if there is something I don't understand or am not clear on, I can either ask or get answers from a different source.  
0.866700	well I know abit about the terms and all that from biology and medical classes in school, so I know a bit about what they are talking about even if its in latin. figuring out all the insurance stuff is actually the biggest hassle i've had 
0.916700	I am very capable of answering the questions that the medical doctors ask me. I am able to process what they say, and if I do not I'm not afraid to ask them questions. 
0.650000	I feel that I have a good capacity to understand health information and services with someone assisting me.  I think that it is always good to have someone look things over and help you through the way.  There is so much to consider and such complexity that I like guidance through someone who can help me clearly understand.  
0.633300	I have no medical background, however I have been to the doctor plenty of times. I feel I have the mental capacity to understand the basic information, some of it just confuses me. Thankfully, my wife is a nurse :)
0.694400	I usually understand everything that is in a medical document that I must review, understand and sign. However, occasionally I am in a situation (such as when I was diagnosed with prostate cancer where I did not totally understand some of the information I read or that was explained to me by the physician). In cases like these sometimes my wife does a better job of explaining the issue to me in clear terms that I understand. However, in general I usually am able to comprehend everything that is being discussed with me in the doctor's office.
0.916700	I've worked in the medical field and have a child with medical disabilities.  So, I am fully capable of understanding medical terminology and know what questions to ask if and when I do not understand.  I also know what websites provide the best answers to questions I may have if and when a medical professional is not available for me to ask personally.  I am never afraid to ask a professional when needed.
0.655600	When I have an issue I always try to do a lot of research. When speaking with a doctor sometimes it is more complicated to understand. I sometimes feel a little insure when trying to be so accurate about the information everyone needs to help diagnose.
0.883300	I feel i am above average in my understanding of health care and health care related issues, also i have a decent understanding of some basic biology which makes understanding a lot of issues more intuitive. I like to ask pertinent questions and try to challenge the doctor when i am experiencing an illness, and usually by the time i am talking to a doctor i have a list of questions i have derived from my own research before the appointment, many times my guess to the diagnosis proves to match that of the doctor. Sometimes even when the doctor disagrees and offers his own diagnosis in the end my guess proves to be correct after some trial and error.  
0.800000	It it not the hard nowadays to understand medical advice or diagnosis. This is due to th wide ranging information available on the internet
0.900000	I feel VERY confident that i am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am not yet of the age that any dementia has set in and I feel i have full mental capacity to obtain and process that information

0.883300	I feel that I can get basic health information when needed.  When I go to the doctor, I make sure to have all my questions and concerns written down so I do not forget them.  If there are any issues with medical forms, I am sure to ask a secretary for that information.

0.733300	 While I have some familiarity with medical terms from working in a hospital while going to college that was many years ago. Some of the new diagnostic terms are new to me and I must have them explained by a health worker or doctor. In particular tests present a challenge when I try to interpret the results. If a battery of tests are given to me I need an explanation, not just of the normal parameters but, of how the results as a whole relate to my health. I have very little difficulty taking my meds as directed but sometimes, if I miss a dose or take too much, I must call my medical practitioner for assistance as to what to do next. 
0.744400	I feel like I am able to adequately obtain, process and understand basic health information.

0.916700	I think I can understand everything. I read it slowly and over again if I need to. Then I look up information that I don't quite get.
0.805600	I feel as though the standard provisioning of materials is sufficient for me to understand what information is important and needs to be factored into any decision.
0.672200	Iâm not a doctor and Iâd never like to be, it scares me just thinking about it, but I like to investigate everything thatâs concerns my health like how my body works, how it reacts to certain medications, what I need to be healthy, so I pay attention to all and try to learn about it so I know how to make future decisions.
0.661100	I feel fairly capable of understanding basic health information. When that information goes beyond the basics it is a different story. Anything I am still confused about I will usually search for online.
0.777800	I know I have the ability to process and understand basic health information because I have a degree in Biology, so I've taken some classes that help with that. However, it's still hard to fully know what choice to make on some health decisions or what some things mean. I would say I have an above average ability but some people are significantly better at it.
0.900000	I absolutely have the capacity to make my own health decisions. I'm very familiar with medicine and healthcare and am very comfortable understanding jargon and no problems with the settings.

I also understand the importance of providing the most up to date and honest information in regards to my personal health, to the best of my knowledge, to my physician.
0.816700	Getting and understanding the information is the easy part. Having the money to pay for the services is the hard part. I usually understand what I'm being told without asking a lot of questions. That's just me though: way back in high school, my biology teacher asked me if I learned by osmosis because I did well in class but never asked questions.
0.816700	I am 41 years old, and also a parent to 2 children.  I have had to take myself and my children to the doctor many times, so I feel confident in understanding basic health information.  On top of that, I lost my mother to cancer, and have since had to accompany my father if necessary to some of his appointments.  My brother is a nurse, so sometimes I ask him for medical advice.  If I am not sure I ask our doctor to clarify anything I may not understand.
0.700000	I have been able to make good choices so far in life.  I expect that I will continue to make good choices.  If I doubt myself, that's typically when I ask for someone else's opinion.  If I do not understand something, I typically would call my doctor for advice, or use the internet to expand my knowledge on certain subjects.

0.816700	Every time I am finding myself interacting with the medical situations I make sure I ask the physician all the necessary questions. I listen carefully and make sure I have things written down. I also make sure to get everything what's needed from the front desk, such as follow-ups or appointments.
0.900000	I am always the one in my family (even with my husband) who goes over the medical information about each family member. I was there every step of the way and made all the decisions when my husband was in and out of the hospital two years ago. I think I have a pretty good understanding of how the health information and services work and how to make the appropriate health decisions for me and my family.
0.850000	I feel that I am highly capable of obtaining the help I need to make appropriate health decisions. When I pick physicians I look for ones that are personable and beyond willing to make me fell comfortable. All of my physicians go over and beyond to make sure I have anything I need and understand all medical information. I am also prone to research things that I am unfamiliar with via the internet. 
0.411100	It is very hard to obtain it all. With my condition I cannot remember a lot of things and cannot understand the terms that the doctor use. I get afraid to ask them for simple terms or written information so that I can go home and read lated
0.738900	I feel like I have a good capacity to understand health information, since I am going into a health field. I sometimes find it difficult to tell doctors everything I planned to
0.822200	I feel like I am very well informed to be able to make my own decisions.  I may need my doctor to fill prescriptions but I am capable of doing my own research on my health.  I believe the best patient is a well informed patient.   While doctors might have the education, I know my body and how it reacts to medications.  I wish that Doctors listened to their patients more than just listening to what testing show them.  If doctors were taught listen to their patients I think they would have a better relationship with their patients. Those patients would also receive better care and would live a better and fuller life
0.811100	I believe that i am more than capable of obtaining and understanding information about conditions that i have had and basic information about medications that i need to take. I have in the past asked for additional information about prescriptions and uses and side effects of them at time
0.611100	i think every time when i visit doctors office i probably understand them about 50% or less, most of the time when i come back home i ask my wife to explain more in details or i start looking online for explanations 
0.872200	Firstly, I am a retired registered nurse so should be able to effectively read and understand medical information.  But, as any patient, I sometime don't want to give all the necessary information to my provider (silly, I know), but it's human.  Sometimes also, because of my medical background, I don't ask questions I want to because I feel the provider thinks I should already know the answer.  I sometimes have to remind the providers that they can't assume I know something about my medical condition because I am a nurse.  There may be new information I don't know or I may have forgotten the information.
0.761100	I think that I need to learn more to understand clearly the medical terms and in that way to have a broader perspective of the diagnosis to evaluate each possibility and obtain more recommendation as far as my health is concerned.
0.872200	I feel very capable of obtaining and understanding my health information. I know how to find services to use to make health decisions when necessary. If I need help understanding something I use resources provided to find out the meaning.
0.722200	At times I have a little bit of brain fog that keeps me from comprehending things immediately. Iâm not sure where this comes from. Usually, if I re-read things a number of times I will comprehend it. It helps if I read with a pencil so I can underline, or make notes. Most doctors visits go ok for me, but if I think it will be an important appointment I will take my wife with me to help me think and ask questions. If I donât bring my wife I often forget everything that was said in the appointment after about five minutes.
0.883300	I have a high degree because I am of sound health of mind and have resources to back me up. I have people close to me who are MDs and know how to find information by myself.
0.661100	Sometimes I struggle with diagnosis and medications given. Sometimes I feel like the medical decision is black and white no gray. They donât give you a chance to explain your side that already have their mind made up about you food intake and weight
0.888900	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions to a great degree. On the rare occasion I don't understand something, even after asking for clarification, I reach out to my mother who is a registered nurse. 
0.822200	"I am a relatively intelligent person so I'm confident in my ability to process information in general. The problem arises when medical terminology is used and not explained. This is particularly true of lab tests where I may be told ""X is high"", but not told why that is or what that means for my overall health. I have a chronic health condition that I had to read the medical literature on myself because doctors never explained things. "
0.888900	I feel that I can adequately understand and process the information I need. I usually don't need help with it wither.
0.866700	I feel that I am fully capable of both understanding and knowing how and when to ask question so I do.  I work for a hospital so I am very familiar with a lot of the instructions.  I also always make sure I understand as I do not want to have to come back later.
0.838900	Yes, I understand the basic issues. I do know that I may not ask all the right questions. My wife does, though. I feel like I should just deal with things. I know that isn't the best way to handle health issues. But that is why my wife comes with me.
0.916700	I am capable to understand basic health information.  I have to deal with it with my parents, with someone I took care of and a friend.  I can also find out information on the computer when needed for basic health information.  I also have a cousin and a friend who are nurses but I did work in the medical field for about a year.
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information because I have a degree in the healthcare field. I also obtain knowledge by asking the important questions of my doctor. I also go a step further to research information provided to gain further understanding. I feel it is important to obtain a doctor that doesn't mind taking the extra time to make sure you understand the information they are providing. 
0.761100	I think there is a lot of information on the internet.  I also know enough people in the medical profession that I can get clarification on anything that I didn't understand.  
0.705600	I usually have little issue understanding most medical information my doctor or medical staff tries to pass on to me. On the occasions I do I have my wife explain everything to me in layman's terms as she is a medical assistant and can generally give me a good enough understanding to be able to launch further research if needed.
0.888900	I believe that I can understand health information when it comes to prescription drugs and I have some idea of a possible diagnosis because I always go online beforehand and do a search if I'm having symptoms that I'm not familiar with. I also feel that I'm competent enough understanding instructions on my own.
0.783300	I believe I can make appropriate health decisions if I ask the right questions and have good doctors and medical staff available. Sometimes doctors don't want to give direct answers because, I believe, they are afraid of lawsuits or my claiming they said something they did not. I would like it if they would put everything in simple language so that everyone could understand exactly what they're talking about. 
0.844400	I feel I have the (mental) capacity to obtain, process an understand medical information presented to me and I possess the ability to ask questions of medical personnel when needed.  Additionally, I have access to medical sources online and I have a niece who is local and is a certified nurse.
0.827800	I feel like I have decent capability to understand health information enough to make decisions about my own health. I try to ask my doctor about terms and diagnoses that I have difficulty understanding and see what he thinks it will mean to my future health decisions. I do research about about my health issues online as well, but mainly to help further understand medical terms and such, not as a primary source of information.
0.916700	Whenever I speak to a medical practitioner, I generally take notes. In between visits, should a question come up, I write it down and keep it in my medical notebook so that I remember to ask. I am not afraid to ask questions regarding my health, but I feel that sometimes doctors or nurses are so overwhelmed by their duties that they don't give much, or very clear, information. I have no issues retaining the information, it just needs to be given.
0.766700	I feel that I am completely competent because I ask for insight regarding medical terminology that is confusing to me. I think it is important to ask the necessary questions with healthcare providers because they may feel that they are being understood. Thus, when I am in doubt I seek help from nurses, doctors, and pharmacists to provide me with information regarding any health concern. Additionally, my courses in speech and hearing and my medical terminology course have helped me to understand some basic health information. 
0.788900	I feel I have have a large ability to process basic health decisions. I am biased though, as I have a degree in human physiology, was an EMT, and am about to attend physician assistant school in May. However, before going to college, I did have a very hard time understanding what was being told to me by PCPs and felt what they told me was poorly explained. It seemed they did not care to explain conditions to me since they were in a hurry. This, in addition to complicated medical and insurance forms, made it very difficult to gain anything from visiting the doctor.
0.616700	I've never really had any confidence in dealing with this kind of stuff on my own. I've always been a rather sheltered and dependent person, so depending on the importance, I'd prefer it if someone were to go over it with me or walk me through it to minimize errors. I don't do anything like this that often either, so I'm sure if I had more practice, I'd be all right on my own.
0.816700	Iâm pretty confident of being able to do what was described above.  So far my medical issues have been minor and doctors have been able to explain the information to me.  If I ever need to deal for more complex information my father has had plenty of experience.  And I frequently look things up on the internet. 
0.733300	I feel like I have a decent understanding and comprehension of basic health information and services. I have gone to the doctor a handful of times as an adult on my own and thanks to a very helpful reception, I feel very capable of making choices and filling out health forms.
0.883300	I think when it comes to making decisions about my health, I feel that I'm fully capable of interpreting what the doctor's are saying and asking a lot of questions.  I tend to ask about alternatives to treatments depending on what the recommendations are.  I tend to trust what my doctor's say because I have a long standing history with them and they have a proven track record of having positive recommendations.  Any literary information I receive I'm fully capable of reading and understanding and usually do additional research myself.  The only thing I do is I have my husband take care of understanding the side effects of my medication so I don't get super anxious and dwell about the side effects.  I just let him know if I start feeling weird. I also make most of my decisions with my husband so that I have a support system.
0.916700	I don't have any difficulty in reading or processing or conveying any of the health information. I am at ease with it.
0.655600	I have a great capacity to obtain basic health information. There are many different sources that I can use to get an opinion. I have a good capacity to process and understand basic health information and services, but it could be better. I could ask more questions to have a better understanding but I sometimes do not ask when I should. 
0.850000	I think that most of the information I'm given is fairly easy to understand. If I don't understand something I will ask the Doctor or Nurse to explain it to me as easily as possible.
0.855600	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand issues regarding my basic health. I am able to read and understand documents and instructions given by my doctors. 
0.666700	It depends on the information, I need help understanding it sometimes when there is a emergency my mind just does not process the information and get confused on trhe details of it.
0.888900	Prior to my cancer diagnosis in 2012, I had a 10 year work history in the emergency department of our local hospital.  Also, in my 20's I worked for 5 years in the same hospital this time as a nursing assistant in the pediatric ward.  I do believe I have a substantial understanding of most health issues, not counting my own.  I also raised 4 daughters alone and the youngest has a history of severe asthma, so hospitals, dr's and nurses are second nature to me.
0.794400	I think I have a sufficient capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. Sometimes I feel the need to look online, ask a family member or contact the doctor for further information. However, I am usually confident in making health decisions myself. 
0.588900	I have some capacity  to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Sometimes I feel like i would need some help from others.
0.750000	I don't feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process the health information I need. I always feel rushed at the doctor's office. I get nervous and forget to ask the important questions I should ask. I get my blood taken every 3 months because I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I take medications to control these conditions and both are hereditary based. My understanding is just okay at best. Because it is hereditary and not based on foods I eat, it is difficult to get a full explanation of what I can do differently other than changing my eating habits and daily exercise. I want to know more about my risks and they really don't go into that. 
0.916700	I feel extremely confident of my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decision. I had been in situations where I was provided with information about some medical procedures and I was able to make the right decisions. The last situation I remember was my tuba ligation. I sat down with the doctor first then the nurse they give me all the information about the procedure and give me the chance to ask questions that they answered and no one helped me understand or make any decision concerning the procedure.
0.883300	My father was an M.D. as was my maternal grandfather. I was raised to become an M.D. I chose physics. Regardless, I grew up surrounded by medical discussions and spend a great deal of time with health-care professionals and as a consequence am extremely comfortable with them, asking them questions, and challenging them. Obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information to make appropriate health choices is something I'm very comfortable with.
0.688900	I believe that I can understand most information that doctors tell me but sometimes i ask family members who work in health care so they can advise me. I also look up information online and then I make the decisions.
0.700000	I feel like I have a moderate ability to understand things on my own immediately.  But, there are many times that I will have to get on the internet to do the research so that I understand things completely.  I am the type of person that needs to make a list to take with me so I don't forget questions I have, and to list symptoms.  Sometimes though there are too many choices and I feel like I want to do the correct thing, and wonder if I will.  
0.816700	I usually understand everything medical professionals tell me, and I try to do research on the internet before a visit so that I can speak with some degree of knowledge. Still, it's not like I'm a medical professional myself, so I mostly give the symptoms and leave it in the hands of the professionals to decide how to proceed. Results vary from doctor to doctor.
0.866700	I feel confident I have the capacity to understand, obtain and process basic health information and services needed regarding my health decisions.  I am able to focus and retain information and I when I don't understand something, I do not hesitate to ask the provider.
0.916700	I have been reading about health my whole life. I am very interested in my health so I try to obtain as much as I can to make sure I stay healthy. When my doctor tells me something I listen to make sure that I stay healthy.
0.661100	I feel that I often have the capacity to understaind and obtain basic health information and services, but sometimes I feel rushed and leave not fully understanding what I need to do or what is going on.
0.733300	I think I can make appropriate decisions but I have lost faith in the health field as far as being understanding and taking the time to hear you and then fully explain diagnosis. I've had a specialist prescribe me medications with telling me the name of it and cut me off and walked out of the room when I had questions. I have to rely on the internet to get info I need
0.672200	I usually don't have issues getting advice or finding help when I need it. The problem lies within the words used. I have to ask a nurse or a doctor often to get clarification on things. I can some times call a hotline to ask but I prefer in person explanations.
0.866700	I am disabled right now and have had health problems so I'm not working but I am a Registered Nurse.  The health care world has changed in the past 5 years so some of the questions have changed and it seems to be more difficult to get the time and answers needed from health care professionals. I usually have the knowledge to obtain, process and understand basic health information and usually am able to obtain services needed.
0.883300	I feel I can communicate well with medical staff.  I Don't have problems reading or understanding things, an I make sure I ask questions about anything I don't understand.
0.844400	I do.  I feel confident in my ability to understand what a doctor says to me and also in my ability to research health topics on my own.  I also feel that I have access to people who are more well-informed than I am.  There are several nurses and doctors within my social circle who I could ask for guidance if I needed it.  I do have a slight amount of distrust in the medical community because of my experience giving birth in the hospital versus giving birth at home.  This makes me feel like I need to do a little research on whatever has been told to me by a medical professional.  
0.833300	I feel I have a great deal of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I can read very well and I am very good at asking questions. Usually if I have any problems I can use the internet to help me if needed. 
0.888900	I'm young and don't experience any significant mental impairment that would impede my ability to comprehend information presented to me, health-related or otherwise. I am in fact diagnosed with a mental/psychiatric condition, but it does not impact my capacity in that regard. I have always been able to independently seek out and obtain any necessary health-related services without an issue.
0.700000	I feel like I do a good job at asking enough questions to understand what is being told to me and if I have to do something to fix it. I usually do my research and would call back to talk to my doctor or a nurse and understand more if I have questions. For the most part I think I retain a lot of what they say to me. 
0.761100	I am an intelligent person who unfortunately has had to deal with health issues, info and services for many years. This required me to become a very pro active patient. I keep abreast of everything to do with my health issues and am up to date on everything including medication and treatment options and services available to me.  And when I have a question or concern I consult with my physician or my husband who was in the health care field for 30 years.
0.883300	I feel that I have a big ability to fill out required paperwork and if there is room questions about my health. I also feel that I can ask health personnel any questions to clarify anything I need clarification on.
0.744400	Sometimes I get confused by the jargon and procedures. But in general, I can go to doctors appointment by myself and be fine. I can communicate and get the help I need. And doctors are usually good about explaining the important facts. If there is medicine or procedure I'm not familiar with, even after asking about it, I'll look it up online when I get home. 
0.677800	recently i had a kid. After he born we are going to take him to doctor for monthly checkups. We came to know the process of handling kids and each time we go for checkup nurse provides us a plan for next few months. I think this will help us to know all things. There are few instructions as well if baby is facing any health issue. It simply helps us to know how to treat babies while they are not feeling good. Pediatricians also helps us to know things. I came to know and understand the process how they are treating.
0.727800	I think I still have a good mind and can remember most things and I am not afraid to ask questions if I don't understand something.
0.600000	I have no trouble understanding basic health information as it's given to me as long as its in layman terms.  My problem with comprehending health information is when they don't translate test results into basic english and leave it as medical jargon. Also, I find that a lot of the times when it comes to payment it seems like they intentionally leave is as hard to understand as possible, to get you to give up and comply. 
0.916700	I am an intelligent person. I am not bragging when I say that. I am able to understand mostly anything that is told to me regarding medical information. If there is something I do not understand, I ask the proper questions until I am fully comfortable that I have received and understand all the information I need to have.
0.616700	When I go to the doctors or hospital, I feel there is a lot of red tape that we usually have to through with paperwork and our insurance information.

If you want to your chart or personal information, you always have ask like it is a big secret. We rely on the healthcare officials to assist us if we have questions.
0.900000	I feel confident in my abilities to gather information regarding my health and ask appropriate questions of doctors if there are things I do not understand. 
0.783300	An average person does have difficulty filling out medical forms. I am only knowledgeable in this due to the fact that I have an associates degree in medical billing and coding. I often need to help patients fill out their forms on a regular basis. Some of the forms are very hard for a person to understand. I myself have not yet figured out why the forms can not be written in plain text that patients can easily understand. 
0.883300	I feel very confident in my ability to understand basic health information. I make sure to ask questions if I don't know something and always hold my doctor accountable for the information they give me.

0.783300	I am fairly confident I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health info. Sometimes the info can be overwhelming and I may seek clarification or explanation from another source but after going over things a few times I am sure I can get the gist of it.
0.711100	I'm pretty good at absorbing information, as if my brain were a sponge, especially when it comes to my health or the health of others. I am quite confident that I'd be able to process and understand basic information regarding health because of this care that I have for other people and myself. Therefore, I'm confident that being able to understand this basic health information and services, that I'm also confident I'd be able to make appropriate health decisions.
0.616700	I have really bad anxiety, especially about my health. Unless my husband is in the room with me, or it's something routine like my psychiatrist appointments, I usually forget everything the doctor said right away. I'm always too scared to ask questions. 
0.883300	I have no problem understanding information that's been given or told to me when speaking with a doctor or pharmaceutical technician

I've never left an office visit feeling lost or confused due to medical jargon.
0.627800	I feel like I somewhat understand basic health information. It really helps when I ask questions and they answer it clearly. There have only been a few times when I truly did not get the help I needed.
0.827800	I do feel that I have the ability to make appropriate decisions. If something is confusing, I may search for more information on the internet or ask people for their opinions/experience. Sometimes I might not realize I have a question until I have left the Drs. office, and that is when I will look elsewhere. If I'm really not sure, I would call my Drs. office back. 
0.883300	I am an educated person with no mental deficiencies; at this point I feel capable of getting the information I need. However, I find it very difficult to navigate medical insurance issues, possibly because the industry seems to make it deliberately difficult for the consumer. And I am not confident that I will be able to function in the same way in my old age.

0.783300	I feel that I am moderately capable of understanding medical things. I do not feel overly confident in my knowledge, but I have always had the ability to ask questions and get clarification if there is something that I am unsure of. I feel like doctors often use big words that are complicated to understand, when in fact it can be simplified in a way that can easily be understood. Often if I do not understand those big words, I will ask them to dumb it down for me. 
0.705600	I understand some of the medical jargon they spit at at me. I know my body and my medical needs. This makes it a bit easier to understand what i need.

I'm able to understand and have enough medical background that I don't have many problems at doctor's offices/hospitals.  Pharmaceutical information can be trickier, but it and other complicated medical information which is harder to understand can also be ""googled"" nowadays, which I have confidence in."
0.455600	Im pretty good when i go see a doctor.  I usually alwaus have someone with me who can help me understand what is being said and what information is given to me.  I do not always understand medical terminology that is why someone is always with me.

0.744400	I feel that I am very literate and have an easy time understanding things so long as they are explained in terms that I am familiar with. What I mean by that is if you use the word contusion I am less likely to understand than if you use the word bruise.
0.866700	I am a highly educated women who has a lot of knowledge when it comes to my health.  I know that if i dont ask questions that I will not learn everything that I need to know about my health and condition.
0.783300	I feel that I have the knowledge, vocabulary to understand basic health information. I might at times need some help with unfamiliar terms but basic stuff is not a problem.
0.838900	I feel I am capable of making correct decisions and understanding what is being told to me.  I also have no problems asking the doctor to elaborate or explain in simpler terms if I do have an issue. 
0.866700	I feel I do a good job asking for clarification on any points that I don't understand when it comes to basic health information. I try to make sure we cover all the bases and want to always do my best to provide a good informed decision when making a health decision. 
0.527800	If your goal is to get a degree without paying for it, itâs highly unlikely youâll be able to do that. However, online sources, schools without walls, and external degree programs are becoming increasingly common, and will only continue to increase in our digital world. Many colleges, even some of the best, offer online courses you can take for free, or, if you pay for them, you can get college credit for taking them. For instance, the University of Massachusetts (Amherst) has a University without Walls program that offers online courses and grants credit for experience. However, youâll need to pay for your credits. Even Harvard offers a number of free (non credential) and paid (credentialed) courses.
0.838900	I think for the most part i understand well.  Sometimes the medical jargon is confusing and sometimes prescriptions are contradicting, but all in all i understand well enough to know what i am being told. 
0.855600	"I believe that I am 95% competent in regards to obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services when needed. I reside with a nurse so most questions I have can be filtered through her.  Anything she is unaware of she can research to gain a broader understanding of the information needed and I go from there. If there is anything that neither of us understand, then the problem is generally past the point of ""basic"" and a specialist needs to intervene.  The only time I ever had issues obtaining and processing information about my health and the services rendered was when I was in labor with my child. To be fair, I was a bit preoccupied with the pain to really understand what was going on around me at the time."
0.916700	I feel like I am competent enough to ask the questions that I have to the medical professionals. If I don't understand the answer I will ask them to explain it better.
0.794400	I feel like I can understand the information given to my by healthcare professionals, however, I still find it nerve-wrecking to ask all the questions that I need.  Sometimes I feel like the physician is in a rush to get to the next patient and thus, I feel like I'm being a burden by asking too many questions.  The physician seems unwilling to truly find out the source of my issues.
0.855600	I feel like I have full capacity to grasp and obtain all of the needed information. I also have full ability to research on my own. The thing I struggle with sometimes is trying to absorb all of the information when the doctor is talking to me. If they rattle off a bunch of values from my bloodwork, for instance, sometimes I have trouble remembering what they said an hour later.
0.705600	When im not sure about a medical term I go online and i get as much information as i can. Before i would go to a medical appointment without preparation . As soon as i was in front of my doctor i would forget everything. Now i take a notebook write down all the symptoms i have, in addition, i write down all the questions i have. Lastly, I believe my basic knowledge and what i can gather from online and what my doctor tells is what gives me the knowledge to make health decisions for myself.
0.916700	Yes I do believe that I can handle any information that I am given by any medical professional or any professional at this point in my life. I am intelligent and can grasp the content of any discussion.
0.900000	I have the full capacity to understand basic health information because I know how to read the information given to me and compute it as well as answer any health related questions that are needed of me. I also have the ability to ask questions if anything is unclear or confuses me 
0.805600	I am fairly efficient at getting the information I need from a combination of asking questions and looking things up on the internet.  I will check definitions of words and terms if I am having trouble.  I am comfortable with most language and when I have trouble I have a good friend who is consistently able to help me. 
0.866700	I feel like I've gone to the doctor enough that I understand how to communicate with them. I've had to present questions before or ask for clarification and I think gotten better at it/gotten more confidence as time goes on.
0.683300	I feel i need to ask around a little bit to really get the information, but it's usually very easy to obtain
0.888900	I feel that I am completely capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.  I may forget to ask a question at the doctor's office but I'll do the research to figure out an answer.  I'll research online, ask a friend with a medical license or call my doctor's office.  
0.916700	I am smart aware person. I don't have any mental issues that keep me from understanding instructions given to me from a doctor or nurse or any medical professional. I feel like a competent person who can handle anything.
0.838900	I have asthma and over the last 20 years I have learned to be an advocate. I read and learn and when I am with my doctor, I ask very concise and direct questions. I want to know about better medications and any side effects. 
0.811100	I feel that I absolutely have the capacity to obtain and understand health information.  My main issue is that I don't always ask clarifying questions because it takes me a while to process information.  
0.888900	I can understand as well or better than most people what medical conditions or treatments are described by doctors and nurses. I will ask any questions needed to clarify diagnoses, recommendations or treatment options. I have a pretty good understanding of how the human body works and what can go wrong. I do not need any help reading or remembering directions and instructions regarding medical care.
0.805600	I feel like I do have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information and use this to make health decisions. However, I didn't always, and I feel as though the fact that I am constantly reading things online and that I work in the medical field (not clinically, in marketing though) helps me understand a lot of things in a better way.
0.672200	I would begin with educating nurses about using a universal precaution approach. Always use plain language when speaking with patients. Nurses should use plain, jargon-free words when discussing medical information. Individualizing the teaching by using words the patient is familiar with will enhance a patientâs understanding. All patients benefit from the use of plain language. Assess patient's understanding of the information provided.
0.711100	Sometimes medical vocabulary is quite technical and only familiar to those within the field. I usually will refer to the internet or family members that work in healthcare professions to clarify any doubts. I do not trust myself 100% to understand and make decisions based on my knowledge only.
0.655600	I often have troubles with the doctors information and procedure explanations. I understand about fifty percent of what they tell me. Often a nurse will help me understand. I also go on the internet for more information. 
0.827800	I understand as long as it's explained in layman's language. I tend to think of questions after it's too late to ask them.
0.883300	I am almost always capable of understanding health information, but when I am not, I quickly resort to my smartphone to research any and all information necessary. I will also be sure to write down any questions I may need to ask.
0.838900	I have very little medical knowledge, but I am able to understand and process what a doctor or nurse tells me as long as they take their time and define medical terms.  When I know I have a procedure coming up, I take a notepad with me to the doctor's office so I can write down the process I need to follow - such as blood testing, pre-admission testing and so forth.
0.644400	I feel like I understand most of the information that I get from doctors and nurses but sometimes I don't know exactly what they're talking about so I have to ask extra questions or ask them to help me. 
0.883300	Quite good. I'm quite interested in and pretty knowledgeable about science and health. Even if I'm not familiar with the specific topic, I can usually grasp new things quickly. The internet is a great resource, and I'll usually do a lot of research there. I'll ask the doctor questions when needed as well, but I've learned that doctors are not as well-versed in all aspects of health as some people may assume, and I always look beyond the doctor's opinion into scientific research and other resources.
0.694400	I have an okay understanding of the human body and the mechanics that happen within.  I know how to google things to help that understanding where it's vacant. This helps partially illuminate for me some health information that other people when exposed to it would be oblivious to.  However I'm no doctor or nurse and I struggle to really get to the bottom of things that ail me.  Additionally I don't know what's the appropriate questions or information to ask a doctor or tell a doctor to help them better diagnose any health problems.  Some times my terminology might off and there's misunderstandings from using the wrong terminology.  I really suffer from also not understanding all the specialists such as neurologist ( i know that one, but don't know most of the other ones).
0.916700	I believe that I possesses an adequate ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I don't recall ever needing help understanding this information as an adult. 
0.916700	I feel totally confident in my capability to obtain ,process and understand basic health information.As someone who is highly educated, having obtained a Masters degree , though have never been in the labor force I do think I have the proficiency to the needful.
0.827800	Overall I would say that my capacity for understanding and processing basic health information is very good.  I find the reading material easy to understand, if I have questions I can usually ask the nurse or doctor at the time of my appointment.  I also can look online for questions regarding my condition.
0.822200	I think have the ability to access the information I need to make good decision about my health and the health of my family.
0.672200	I believe that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, especially when my daughter is with me to help me fill out certain forms and explain certain things to me. I have needed her help many times, especially with documents with small print.
0.761100	I can understand different health conditions by reading about causes, symptoms, and different treatments online.  If the doctor told me something about a condition I had I would do my own research on my time.  I understand the risks when taking prescription medication.  I have also filled out forms applying for health insurance and have filled out other official forms online.
0.794400	I feel that I am very well equipped to handle these basic health information and  services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I always take my time reading the information presented for me and ask the right questions. 
0.900000	I completely understand what my medical professionals says to me because I am always asking questions throughout the whole process so I clearly understand what is been said and I generally go over the main points with the professionals at the end of the conversation so we are all on the same page when I  leave and if something is still not clear  when I get home I call and get it clarified
0.705600	I feel I'm easily able to amalgamate and coalesce basic health information, although I may not have the technical understanding of the information. I haven't had many hospital experience, but the ones I have had were pleasant apart from the circumstance.
0.777800	Most of the information that I receive from my doctor is directly explained to me without any problems. My doctor is very understanding that I may not understand MD's talk so she explains it to me more easier. I feel there isn't a problem and that I get all the information I need.
0.705600	I think that in general I am able to get the help that I need in understanding health information and services. At the hospitals that I go to, quite often the information that the doctor conveys is backed up by written reading material. My main trouble comes with pharmacy medications. It is not always clear how to go about taking it - for example, suppose I want to switch from taking something in the evening to taking it in the morning, can I do that? Additionally,  suppose I suspect something is a side effect of pill X, then i hate going online to figure it out because its just not the same as seeing a doctor. 
0.883300	I have trouble understanding technical jargon that some health professionals speak. When I do not understand I have the abilities to ask questions that result in the health professionals explaining these issues so I can understand. 
0.916700	I am absolutely confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself. I always ask my doctors all questions I feel I must ask in order to fully understand any information I was given during medical visits. 
0.783300	I feel that if I am presented with a medical situation that I do not understand by myself that I know where to go for help.  A family member, have the question ready for a nurse, the internet or my insurance call center help line.
0.872200	I feel pretty competent in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.916700	"Although I've made a few trips to the doctor, and my children were delivered in a hospital, I primarily manage my own health. After dealing with chronic, and ultimately fatal, illness in both my parents, I was motivated to educate myself on proactive means to maintain my health so I don't need to see health care professionals. This has worked very well for me for 30 years, and I hope it continues to do so. But yes, I have a lot of knowledge about the current western medicine, to the point I had one of my mother's doctors ask if I was a medical professional. I said , ""No, but I guess you could say I am a 'lay' professional. :-)"""
0.833300	The problem is with the fact that the basic health information itself that is so dumbed-down it gets in the way of making appropriate decisions.  Health services are then rendered based off of the inadequate information.   There's never any mainstream knowledge given to the public to help them understand how to implement knowledge to help themselves from the ground up; a perfect example of this is with nascent iodine, which helps the thyroid which is the master gland of the body responsible for balancing all other organs.   Without nascent iodine, fluoride, intentionally put in drinking water overwhelms EVERYONE'S thyroid.  But from an allopathic perspective, 'if ain't broke and the test doesn't say so, don't fix it'.  The Rockefellers taking over medicine in the 1940's and helping create the modern version of allopathic medicine is disgusting!
0.672200	I have zero difficulty understanding, processing, and obtaining appropriate health information that concerns myself. I have confidence in myself to figure out what I need to look up and how to go about obtaining the information or services .
0.761100	When it comes to processing and understanding all the health information that pertains to my own well-being, I believe I am confident in my ability to understand most of the jargon. However, since I'm no expert, there is some material which I will not always fully understand, and I am usually confident enough to ask doctors/nurses to give me some guidance.
0.677800	I feel as if I generally do understand everything that Is being said to me. At times though some things do get confusing and having anxiety I am sometimes scared to ask questions if I don't always understand what is being said. I feel I am very capable to make decisions without any help though. 
0.516700	I think I am average when it comes to this kind of stuff. But there is some things that I just do not understand. So I ask for help when needed, even if that is often.
0.883300	I am fairly educated and can grasp a large amount of information relatively easily however some medical information is provided in such a way that A medical professional is needed to translate into layman terms.
0.916700	I feel I have the full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am a registered nurse and have been volunteering and also working in health care as a medical scribe prior to becoming a registered nurse.
0.588900	I feel that I think I know what i am doing, but it is hard to be sure that what I think I know, is actually correct. I think this is done on purpose.  I think the forms should be written in a way a high school graduate could understand. Alot of the material on these forms are overly complex and does not make sense.  Help is hard to find . 
0.511100	I think I feel more comfortable if I have help from someone else when going over these things regarding the process of obtaining and carrying out various things concerning health care. I understand the basics and how they relate to me personally, but anything beyond that I usually ask my mother since she has dealt with these types of things for her entire life and she is very knowledgeable about them.
0.738900	I believe that I am perfectly capable of filling out documents or even asking the questions that I need. I typically write down things so I don't forget them, especially those that are important questions. My doctor is patient and provides answers in a thorough way. And if I don't quite understand things,  they will put it in less technical terms. Some things are easier to get than others.  If I still feel lost, I will Google terms. 
0.711100	I think I have the ability to process and understand basic health information given my background in chemistry and biology. For terms/concepts I don't understand, I tend to Google the information to learn about it. 
0.822200	I think that I would be able to retain as much information initially. If there was anything that seemed confusing I would then write it down for later so that I could research it myself to the best of my ability. However, before it would get to that point I would ask as many questions as I could.
0.761100	I believe that I am capable, perhaps not highly, to understand basic health information and to what degree I may not be I use the internet to seek further information and guidance. This has helped me greatly improve my knowledge of various health issue
0.833300	I read a lot of content outside my field of expertise. I've also had experience interviewing various artists and technicians about subject I'm unfamiliar with. 
0.805600	i'm not senile. i just turned 56. now i know how old people feel. i think i'm able to get and understand health info as well as anyone 
0.900000	I always make sure I read any document medical or otherwise that requires my signature completely thoroughly. I read quite a bit in general, and do so at a practiced leisurely pace to ensure I process what I am reading. Medical information especially is extremely important to understand everything pertaining to what you're getting involved in the moment you step into a doctors office or hospital. Health decisions are some of the most important decisions we make in our lives, considering these decisions literally do directly effect our life and livelihood. I know there are a lot of people who don't tell their doctors enough information, and don't read enough into the pros and cons of medical decisions for many reasons, but I know that I'm not one of those people. I am still young and health is important at every age.
0.827800	I believe I have a good capacity to obtain all of the information/services I need to make health decisions, because I constantly ask questions when something is unclear, or do my own research later (online or second opinion, etc.), and I have a fairly good ability to process this information as well. I have good listening and reading skills, and a passing knowledge of basic health information myself.
0.883300	I have no problem understanding my condition when I talk to my doctors or nurses. If they use a term I am not familiar with I would ask them to explain it to me in a way so that I could understand. When I am confused or unsure I always ask questions until I get a clear picture. I don't mess around when it comes to my health since it's one of the most important things I value.
0.677800	I am of sound body and mind right now so I don't need help supplying basic health information.  There are periods that sometimes my mind draw a blank and I might need just a little push in the right direction.
0.688900	 I do not feel like I am adequately prepared to deal with a health issue. The facilities near me are very bad and most people I know refuse to go to them in anything short of an emergency. The one time I went they told me to drink some tea and use Nyquil. They charged me $350 for that information. I asked numerous questions and the doctor just didn't them and seemed more interested in getting me out of there. From that experience I took it upon myself to start researching  and learning what questions to ask and where to go that would provide adequate healthcare. The internet is great source of information and I feel I have benefited greatly from using it for answering some minor medical questions. 
0.722200	I feel fairly confident that I understand most basic health information. I don't always remember everything so I like to have things written down so there is no confusion.
0.883300	I feel that I am fully capable of making the appropriate health decisions. I make sure to ask the doctor any questions I have by making a list beforehand. If the doctor gives me information that I do not understand, I always have the doctor explain it to me. If there is a question with medication I do not hesitate to speak with the pharmacist. I will generally read a lot about anything that I have been diagnosed with as well. 
0.872200	i work in healthcare so i understand lots of medical terms and procedures and what i do not know or understand i simply ask for clarification on. when it comes to my health i always make sure i am 100% sure of all the information needed to avoid any situations.
0.438900	I feel like I have a basic understanding of most medical terms, but some of the jargon remains opaque to me.
0.916700	I can read well, i can see well, i have enough intelligence and experience to know who to call for help and information if i need it. i have 100 degree confidence in my ability to call whoever needs to be called or asked a question if i need it.
0.866700	I feel that I am very capable of being able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services I need to make appropriate health decisions. I make sure there is clear communication between my health care providers, and do what I need to do to become literate as possible to maintain a healthy life.
0.794400	I obtain information most of the time, although I may have to study and ask questions to completely understand what I read or hear.  I usually need the doctor to take the time to explain everything and to take the time to answer my questions.
0.866700	I feel that I am able to understand nearly all of what the nurse or doctor says to me. The only exception is if I start to get anxious I get a little bit cloudy, but other than that I feel nurses and doctors explain things in an easy to understand way. Also, I have some medical knowledge that helps. Filling out paperwork I typically find easy as well.
0.833300	I'm very resourceful when it comes to my health. Either information from my doctor or researching online, I can obtain the majority of what I need to know.
0.888900	I have full faith in my abilities to understand my health information and what services I require. I am of sound mind and judgement to take care of myself in these issues and any concerns regarding my own health.
0.900000	I feel I have a full capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as I often do read all of my material from my provider. I also will ask questions if I am unsure of how to complete any forms. I also make sure to answer a health questions so that I have a better understanding with my health care provider. 
0.900000	I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Although I am not a medical professional, I am intelligent and educated. I'm pretty good at navigating difficult situations like the health area, even though I don't have an insider perspective.
0.638900	When I am meeting a doctor or health professional face-to-face, I feel fairly comfortable with obtaining and understanding health information as it applies to me.  This normally involves me asking several questions and occasionally asking for clarification.  There are also times when my doctor (who I've established a relationship with) will give me examples and scenarios as that is more in-tune with my learning style. When I am reading health information on my own, I often find the information overwhelming and hard to process as I can interpret the details in many different ways - or might find the text to be vague and hard to understand in general.
0.633300	I think that at least half of the time I can obtain all of the information I need to made appropriate health care decisions.
0.866700	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed. I am very adamant about understanding before I leave and if for some reason I don't or forget a question I meant to ask, I will call to ask it.
0.883300	In general I feel that I can understand everything the doctors tells me about my health. At times when it comes to my husband's health conditions it is more complicated so I do ask my son to accompany us to the doctor to make sure that I do not miss anything that I need to know. I think as I get older sometimes doctors treat us differently like they do not have faith in us understanding them and that gives me doubt at times even though I do everything I need to do in my life without any problems. But as far as basic health instructions and decisions I feel very confident at this point with regards to my health. My husband on the other hand hates going to the doctor and turns his doctor off without listening to anything he says because he does not want to hear and doesn't believe most of it. 
0.766700	I feel like I've got a good degree of understanding but medical literature can be confusing and a lot of times I forget what I want to ask the doctor or I feel too nervous to ask him
0.688900	I am fortunate enough to have a father who was a paramedic, one brother who is a nurse anesthetist, another brother who is a physicians assistant, and a fiance who is attending medical school. I have opportunities to constantly get in contact, ask questions, and have multiple opinions on a single matter. This being said, I utilize this perk often, as many times I do not understand or get proper answers from medical professionals at offices, hospitals, and urgent care centers. There are times that I feel as though words are purposely being used to go over my head about things, to avoid detection of a unsure opinion. I don't normally have problems understanding material and pill descriptions, just on occasion, problems with the professionals themselves, and their explanations. 
0.850000	I think I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I usually write down questions I may have and the answers I'm given to make sure I have all the information I need.
0.755600	I feel I need to ask most of the time about a small part of the forms when filling them out but most seems fairly easy. If I have questions they are always helpful in answering but I do feel at time I need to ask. I also have others I can ask and do research for myself. 
0.916700	I feel I have a high degree in understanding these things myself. Ive had to make important medical choices by myself including surgery
0.838900	I am generally able to understand information that is given to me, but sometimes there is a lot of information given all at once, and verbally, and it is hard to process it all at the time, particularly under the stress of being ill, so questions may not occur to me until later, or I might forget some of the details when there is a lot of information given at once.
0.855600	I am quite capable to ask all of the needed questions regarding my condition while providing my doctor and nurse with the details necessary. So far , in my life, i have not had any incidents of not understanding something.
0.900000	I'm young enough, reasonably smart, and have an internet connection so, yes, I certainly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.
0.883300	Because of my own ability to research and my ability to tap the wisdom of others in my personal life, I feel confident about my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. 
0.866700	I feel I have a very good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  When things get beyond basic and into more complicated subjects, I may need a medical professional to help simplify things for me.  If I read things enough times, I generally catch on to things.
0.900000	I do understand my health record because I do write and speak English. I am also a nurse so I can understand my record with no problem. I understand when the doctor talk to me about my health issue.
0.916700	I feel that I'm very good at understanding basic health information to make appropriate health decisions. Anytime I'm confused or don't understand fully I ask questions and doo research.
0.916700	My mind is sound and I have a B.A. degree in English (literature), so I can easily read and understand medical instructions and information about health services. If I need to know more about a health condition, I ask my doctor or nurse, and research the topic online.
0.805600	Most of the time I get enough information to make informed decisions regarding mine or my loved ones care. I feel that I'm at a good level of understanding. 
0.677800	I'm somewhat good at get the information i need to make a right or appropriate decision .i used the internet and my family doctor when something arise and try to understand the possible course or  treatment and to know which is best suited for my need and necessity and i seek help from my family member that have medical experience 
0.827800	I think I understand everything doctors or nurses tell me about my health. If I don't I usually ask lots of questions until I understand. Understanding the information about my (or my son's and husband's) health is very important to me
0.900000	I am confident that I have the capacity to understand health information that is shared with me, and the ability to make appropriate decisions based on that information.
0.861100	I feel like I never have any issues when I am given instructions or information from my doctor. I would say that the only issue that would keep me from telling all of the information behind something that is bothering me is having a lack of comfort with the specific doctor or nurse I see that day. This usually only happens during urgent care visits. I always ask questions even if the doctor does not seem interested because, as the patient, I deserve to know exactly what could happen to me. Health is something that people should have a blasÃ© attitude towards.
0.872200	I think I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Although I sometimes don't understand things, for instance what the difference is between a new medication and the one I'm stopping, when I ask for clarification I can generally understand the answers given to me.

0.766700	If I dont understand what a doctor is saying I can research on the internet. Services are dependent on my finances, so if I have the money I have the services. The bedside manner of a doctor matters too because if I feel like their agitated then I wont want to ask questions or share health information.
0.850000	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision to a high degree.

0.900000	Based on some poor health care experiences in my teens and twenties, I rarely use doctors except for acute situations (i.e., where I need a prescription for antibiotics). When I think I need a doctor, I collect the symptoms, figure out my best guess for what's wrong with me, then go to the doctor with a careful explanation of what's wrong and what I likely need. Doing my own diagnosis to then get it confirmed by a doctor is a pain, but it has resulted in a lot better health care for me. I believe I can competently obtain and understand health information. I have also been successful in obtaining the few services I need. I make a point of trying to manage chronic conditions (such as obesity and obesity-related issues) without pharmaceuticals.

0.833300	I feel pretty confident in my ability to process information and comprehend what is being told to me by a medical professional. If there is something I don't fully comprehend, I do not hesitate to ask the health professional for clarification on the issue and subsequent treatment.

There are also so many resources available now to people online which makes it easier for anyone to obtain basic knowledge and/or clarification on any health issues that might be occurring. 
0.816700	I feel to a high degree that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.

Moreover, I do online searches to understand as much as i can about the health issue. 
0.916700	I do try to keep abreast of medical information, and am in the habit of asking my doctor questions. I feel that although he is the professional, it is my life and he works for me.
0.900000	Besides my own level of education (the equivalent of a BS, MA, and MSW), I grew up in a family of physicians and have been around the medical world for my entire life. I frequently get advice about my health decisions from family but I feel comfortable in my ability to understand the information and access what is needed. 
0.855600	I think i do not have an issue with basic health information. The more difficult things or if it is my first time with a new medication I might need a little assistance figuring out how to take it but other then that I d not find it difficult.

0.916700	Most times when I am given medical information related to my conditions or the prescriptions that I may have to take I usually have a good understanding of what I am told. However, when I do have questions I still like to ask general questions in case there was something that was omitted or missed accidentally. Usually when I have an ER visit I definitely ask questions because it seems as if the doctors only care about getting you out as fast possible unless your in need of life support.
0.916700	I'm pretty good at understanding health stuff. I understand vaccines are important, second opinions are important for any major health issues/procedures, and I have a firm grasp on information. For example, I have a fibroadenoma, and I understand that it's a non-cancerous tumor that is actually very common, and I understand the ultrasound, sample-taking, and other information that led doctors to conclude that there is a 9999/10000 chance that there's nothing bad going on.
0.705600	I think I have a good capability to engage in the health care process. I have no problems understanding information that medical professionals convey to me. I understand what they are looking for when they ask me questions and I'm able to be a good patient as far as my volunteering information.

0.888900	Having gone to 90% of the Doctor/dentist visits by myself I have learned to fill out all the info and ask all the questions I need to. The only time I have needed help was when I was coming out of surgery and had to have my mom sign paper work.

0.661100	I would imagine that I would grasp and understand most of the basic information. Some topics might include information that goes over my head. I might need further explanation on some issues. 
0.816700	I feel fairly confident that I am able to obtain and understand basic health information to make appropriate health decisions.

0.866700	I believe that I am pretty good at understanding health information, and when I don't understand, I ask more questions or come home and do more research about the issue.
0.844400	I feel I am extremely confident in receiving, understanding, and communicating when it comes to medical records or issues. I have never had a problem in any of these areas. I even help with the my grandmother when it pertains to her medical information.

The only areas I feel like I need help with are insurance-type information, as I have trouble understanding it.

0.900000	"I've worked in health care, and know the kinds of things that make a difference when doctors and others are making decisions.

0.855600	I believe that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I understand these the most when presented in Layman's terms. I have difficulty when medical terms are used exclusively and assumed that I understand the meanings. Because I feel like my doctor is rushed at appointments, I think it's very helpful when given a printout summary of my visit when leaving as well as the option to access my medical information, test results, etc from an online portal. That way, I have my diagnosis in writing and can do further research later if need be in order to make a more informed health decision.
0.644400	I feel that i have a moderate amount of ability to obtain process and understand basic health information. I listen and read information carefully sometimes more then once.

I have spent 10 years working in the medical field so I likely have an advantage, but I have never really struggled with any of this to begin with.

0.883300	I believe I am self-sufficient when it comes to this regard. I do not depend on anyone but  myself to get the information I need.
0.772200	I feel that overall I am able to process the information I get from my doctor or nurse.

As for my basic health I have a good understanding of what I am told. 
0.750000	I feel like I'm capable of managing my health and understanding basic information. I do feel like I don't ask all the questions I need to to truly understand because I feel like I'm a bother to doctors and nurses.
0.616700	 I withhold information that I believe will be used against me or give the doctor the idea to refer me to other doctors because that is a slippery slope.

My mother is a nurse so I always have someone to ask and I write down all my questions before I go so I don't get nervous and just say ""it is fine"" like I used to. I have tried many doctors and FINALLY found one who speaks in plain english and is clear and not rushing me out. I have decent insurance and it gives me a better chance to go to the doctor and get what I need. "
0.405600	I would say my capacity would be in the middle, a lot of what is said is foreign, but If someone is willing to take the time to thoroughly explain everything it would be alot easier to understand and be capable without anyone else's help.

0.916700	I only have one body, one life in this world. I know that doctors are not fail-proof, so I ask all the questions I need to in order to make sure I am getting the best care possible.

0.811100	I feel fairly confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make appropriate decisions. There have been few times I needed to ask questions for for a demonstration, but my doctor was able to provide me with the information for me to do it properly.

That being said, I've never had a serious medical condition to have to deal with.  Most things that I have ever been to a doctor for have been fairly innocuous.  I'm sure if there was a major life threatening illness or something requiring an invasive surgery I would have more questions.
0.816700	I feel like I am able to ask for clarification from medical professionals but am also fortunate to have a mother who worked in the medical profession who I can ask additional questions after the fact if I need additional assistance processing information.

0.866700	I feel that all the information is available.  Most important is to be completely honest with the doctor and do proper research.  Googling an answer is not the best way to get information.  Proper research into peer reviewed papers from the top of each prospective field is necessary.  This is not to discount the information that is obtainable by each doctor.  These professionals know more about your individual circumstances than anyone.  It is important to ask for and get information from many different resources.  So, in total I would say that I have a good understanding, am able to process and am able to access the necessary information to better inform and care for my needs.  I do however feel that with all the in formation available, there is a tendency to miss use or miss diagnose oneself.  Although very dangerous, this can be solved by trusting the professionals with all of the relevant information.

0.850000	I recently had numbness in my right toe due to a pressure on my L5S2, occurring from when I had to lift a 300lb person after finding them intentionally overdosed. When I realized that the problem wasn't circulatory - neither bathing in warm water nor going for a walk helped - I hit up urgent care. When I arrived, I succinctly described my issues as above. They immediately send for a neurologist, because they could rule out other causes due to my ability to explain in sufficient terms.

So I have had my share of procedures and Doctors in the past couple months. I can honestly say I do not have to have someone go with me as I can understand everything they say.

0.850000	In terms of my own ability, I do have pretty easy access to my doctor and obtaining help that does not require me to go into the office or schedule an appointment.

0.761100	I feel I have a reasonable ability to make basic health decisions. I feel as though I understand most of what I'm told by my doctor or can ask for help if I don't understand. That said, sometimes it is embarrassing to admit what I don't know, so I might use Google to get the information I need instead of asking the doctor.
0.311100	I have physical impairments that stem from a car accident that prevent me from doing specific things. The disability or impairment has had a severe effect on memory and I am often times unable to remember what I was doing or going to do just moments ago.

I will remember that I read something, but have a vague idea of what it was that I read .
0.883300	I try to be as open and honest with my health care provider as I can. When I visit the health care provider I accept the fact that in the end they are the expert in the field. I may have some limited knowledge and will give what little I know and ask questions based on that. However, I look to them as the person who can best understand and explain things. It is their field of expertise and seek them for their knowledge and help.
0.750000	I think I can understand most of what I am told.  If not I will ask for a clearer explanation and if I don't get it I will look it up and try to find out more about it.
0.733300	"I know that my doctor and every other healthcare provider I encounter are motivated by money and pressure from insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. Often I want to ask my doctor things like, ""how much would you profit if I do this procedure you are suggesting?"" Or, ""did a sales rep promise you a trip to a conference in a vacation destination if you prescribe this drug?"" But, blunt questioning about conflicts of interest is likely to antagonize a doctor and his guilty conscience, so I stay quiet. "

0.794400	I am currently a college student and decently educated in biology and chemistry, along with anthropology.

I can usually understand what a condition or illness is doing, or why, at its core. 
0.883300	I feel pretty confident in my ability to read and understand basic and even slightly complex medical and health information and services in order to make good health decisions.

If I don't understand something, I will ask, but generally my doctor or health provider is able to answer my question in such a way that I can understand afterwords.
0.833300	I believe that I have a good understanding of the medical field as my wife is a nurse and I also have a background in IT.  Since the body tends to work like a computer and much of the same logic can be applied in different ways, I believe that I am a person who can understand how different parts of the body may interact with each other.  Also, taking the time to understand the body, which is our survival tool is very important and everyone should have a basic understanding of certain medical terms and logic.

0.827800	To make the appropriate health decisions  and understand basic health information  I feel like I'm pretty confident I could handle it by myself.  Sometimes if I do need help I will just find somebody and have them explain it to me.   I would say 75% of the time I could figure it out.  However I never sign anything that I do not fully understand. Because me and my wife work separate shifts  I have no choice to go to the doctors myself and fill everything else as well as take my 2 children to the doctors and fill their information out.   Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%. Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%
0.422200	Well recently I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and my doctor just gave me a pamphlet. I was not sure what to ask or what the next steps were and it was not explained to me either.   I felt like this was pretty serious and me having no knowledge of it should have been explained in detail but it was not. I would have to say i would really have to experience in obtaining information when it comes to my basic health information or what exactly i should be doing. I would rather hear it from a doctor then to have to google what i should be doing. 
0.600000	usually when i have a health problem and visit a doctor, I give all the symtoms to the doctor and try to explain them as detailed as possible and ask all the doubts i have without any hesitation and when any form is to be filled out I usually need a help as i dont understand all the things asked for and complete the form.

0.577800	I do not really have a lot of medical knowledge about the anatomy so when a nurse or doctor is trying to explain medical conditions or what needs to be done, it is a little difficult to understand what exactly needs to be done. I put my trust in them that they have my health and well being in their best interest but sometimes I wonder, especially with the billing they are going to send to my health insurance career, it might be a time where they want to add some dollars in their pocket. Luckily I have my wife who is a nurse who can explain everything in a much slower manner once they leave. This is very helpful because then I have time to process what exactly is going on and then we can come up with the best possible decision regarding my health.

I may not be the smartest person around, but I often make up for that with persistence. I'd consider all but the most complicated of topics within my reach (and those complicated topics out of reach simply due to not having the resources available to me to study them farther). Since the question here is in regard to ""basic health information"", I feel confident in my ability to come to a solid understanding, if needed."

0.705600	I feel like sometimes the pamphlets and print outs are way too much information and it's so much to read. I'd rather have the cliff notes. Sometimes I worry about giving too much or too little information while talking to the nurse or the doctor. Or I forget things and then I remember after the fact. Sometimes I think doctors are in a rush and they also dont always take the time to explain things to you in an easy to understand manner. Or they don't give you enough options or time to decide on options.

My doctors sometimes do not use ""layman"" terms - they use long huge medical terms and don't really dissect it for you to understand, which leaves you to google which can be a severe panic attack in the making to do your own research."
0.705600	I feel to a certain extent I understand most health information but usually seek help from experts to make important decisions when it comes to my health. There's so much information out there, so many terms, that it can be difficult at times.
0.838900	I feel I can understand basic information given to me but I do sometimes have a problem obtaining information when I need it from my providers. I also don't always have the time to ask certain questions. I ask what I can but sometimes I will think of something later and by then there's no one to ask
0.827800	When it comes to my health conditions, I understand the basics. If itâs a new health issue that I might have, after consulting with a doctor I usually go online and gather more information if necessary. I also talk to my family or friends who might be suffering from the same illness and get their take on the matter. Iâm pretty okay when it comes to understanding what is going on with my health.

0.766700	I can understand and fill out quite a lot about my own health. I have been doing that ever since I was a kid. My parents did not help me much as they do not speak English very well. So I even had to fill out their medical form when they are at a hospital or just a simple doctor visit. Thus, I have more experience about this than anyone in my family. Plus, I want to know the condition of my health or any of my family health thoroughly. I don't want to miss out any little details that would delay the healing process. 
0.672200	Obtaining and understanding information had become easier since the invention of search engines. Asking this of my physician is sometimes difficult. At times I feel and embarrassed asking the Dr to go over what I donât understand.

Occasionally, I find things confusing and I try to get an explanation from the doctor or nurses. However, they sometimes have a difficult time explaining medical terminology in terms that average people can understand. If I am unable to get the answers I need, I often rely on the internet to clear up confusion. Unfortunately, the internet does not always have the correct information about certain health issues and this can cause more issues in the long run. That is why I always try to get good information from the source, like the doctors or nurses themselves. 
0.844400	I feel that I have the ability to understand basic health information and services. If I am unsure about something I will typically ask the doctor or one of his nurses to clarify, in the event that i don't ask them to explain further I will usually read up on the subject online. I can't recall a time when I have had difficulty understanding medical information. 
0.827800	I feel that I have a high capacity for learning about and understanding such things. I worked very closely to medical professionals while doing medical registration and billing for a while and also had a very strong interest in neurobiology, anatomy, medical diagnoses, and pharmacological pursuits just to scratch the surface. I'm quite sure I can make appropriate decisions concerning my health.
0.655600	I'm the type of person that if I not understand something that they are telling to me or something that I read over and over again and I no understand I ask until I'm capable of help myself or help others. I prefer to ask I have the knowledge and help that don't ask and make a mistake.
0.722200	I don't think I'm that great at it.  I typically search stuff on the internet and get myself overly worried about it.  Then I do ask questions of the medical staff but usually it's kinda brushed off.  I do ask questions a lot which they probably don't like, and I try not to come off as a know it all because I definitely see them as the experts.  
0.844400	I feel very confident that I can understand and process basic health information.  Most of the time i have no trouble understanding what the Dr or nurse is explaining to me.
0.805600	I feel pretty capable.  I can mostly handle it on my own, but I do need help with medical terms some times.
0.711100	I believe I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process and understand health information. The terms I do not understand I can always look up.
0.750000	I feel I have the capacity to obtain and understand basic health information given the wealth of information available. I however feel most doctors are uninterested in being thorough and want to get patients in and out so they don't provide or unwilling to provide good medical care and just want to order some tests and prescribe something to treats the symptoms of whatever ails someone based on some robotic intepretation of test results. 
0.900000	I feel well-equipped to understand the materials given to me. My educational background is in Psychology and Pre-Medicine, which means I've taken a good amount of coursework in the sciences including biology, chemistry, and (obviously) psychology. This material challenged my reading and information-processing capabilities and has taught me to understand medical information more thoroughly, though I am no physician!
0.772200	I think every time you try to obtain medical information in a clear and understandable manner, it is a challenge. I ask a lot of questions, but I seldom get the straight answers I desire and feel I deserve. What I am often forced to do is find another company or provider that handles this process more efficiently and thoroughly.
0.800000	Since I have a good grasp of medical wording, and I am willing to do my research and ask questions, I feel confident that I can make appropriate health decisions. Since I don't everything about the medical world and medical conditions, I would say I'm confident and not very confident
0.494400	It's important because u never no when u are sick.An could be dieing.My coworker just past didn't no he had cancer
0.672200	I believe that if I do not understand something about my health I have the ability to ask health experts the right questions. I am usually capable of understanding the benefits and risks of any course of treatment. I am capable of understanding the costs also. Overall I think I can make informed decisions.
0.866700	I feel I am highly capable mostly because I have worked within the medical field and psychiatric field for the past twenty years.  
0.577800	I feel like I can comprehend the information to a certain extent. I tend to go through it with someone I trust to make sure I understand the information and that I'm not missing anything. I feel like I have the capacity, but still rely on others to help me. 
0.677800	I feel fairly capable of understanding, and obtaining the proper information related to my healthcare and any conditions I might have. My background in partial medical helps me to better understand things than most, however, this can sometimes lead to me not asking questions that I should because I believe I understand something when I might not have the full (or most up-to-date) information on the subject matter. But as a whole, I find I am capable of understanding, and asking enough questions to get the information I need to decide and understand what care is being offered.
0.777800	I feel that I have some capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information based on my own intellectual capabilities. However, I am pretty educated and still find some information confusing and hard to understand. I feel that I have a limited ability to make health decisions based on what I can understand, but there are still things that I need to ask for clarification about. 
0.816700	I am extremely intelligent. I can read and comprehend what I read. Even though I don't claim to know everything, but I know enough to fill out a medical form with my information on it.
0.750000	I feel I have a high degree of knowledge obtaining,processing, and understanding basic health information. This is due to my experiences. 
0.533300	Due to the group of people that I have around me to support me, I have no problem getting medical information without having to go through my doctor.  Generally I do not easily make health decisions for myself and use this group of people close to me to help.
0.633300	I understand what is common knowledge. Some medical terms stump me,.. others are common sense. I think that if i look up a few things i would be able to process and understand the basic information to help me make the appropriate decisions. 
0.872200	I feel I have a general understanding of information on my health. If there is any information, I do not understand, I make sure to ask questions until I am confident that I understand. 
0.816700	I think I do. I worked as a pharmacy tech for a while, so I had to know what I was doing for basic health information. It helps me make any choices I need to make as far as health concerns go.
0.916700	I think that I am capable of understanding anything provided by my health care providers.  I am capable of learning about new information and doing my own research to go along with it.
0.616700	I think that I do I just am sometimes worried that I'm going to miss something that they are telling me. There has been a few times where I've not understood what they were telling me but I made them explain to me again.
0.888900	I feel I have the capacity to understand all health-related documents almost every time I read one. I take time to read the directions/information and ensure there are is not any ambiguous wording. I am able to understand all of the necessary abilities that I need to get the information, how to process it in my mind to think about and determine what is needed from me whether medical records, insurance or even authorizations that I need to give to other healthcare providers or to other people. I understand that the doctors use the information I truthfully give them in order to make detailed decisions about my personal health. If I am ever unclear on what decision is being made about my health, I make sure to ask the doctor  - even if it has to be asked in multiple different ways for me to understand.
0.866700	I sometimes have problems with forms, but I can always ask the receptionist for clarity. I have no issues understanding procedures and so forth. 
0.666700	I feel somewhat confident in getting the basic services and information needed in my life.  Sometimes I feel rushed in the doctors office which makes me shift into anxiety mode.  When I'm anxious, no matter how intelligent I am normally it's hard to comprehend the forms and information given to me.  I need time to calm down and process things.  I often feel frustrated with understanding forms when I'm in the frame of mind.  When I'm presented with new health information, I need time to process and research to know what questions to ask.  At the time, I feel too agreeable because I'm just trying to get the appointment over with and the doctor is in a hurry.
0.900000	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. If at any time I am unsure of the information I have been given I am lucky enough to have been going to the same medical professionals for several years now and am confident enough with them to ask any questions I need to ask for clarification. I also grew up with a mom in the medical profession and have a basic understanding of the health problems I specifically have and/or may face.
0.722200	I believe I understand most of what I am told. I used to work in healthcare for over a year. I went to college for medical billing and coding so I know most of the medical terminology.
0.388900	I believe that I am more than capable! Sometimes, the problem seems to be that the doctors are in a rush and some times I feel guilty keeping them longer by asking my silly questions. Also, sometimes the paperwork side of healthcare can be so confusing! I can understand them, but I always have someone go over them with me as well so that I feel that I am 100 percent understanding the information that is given to me.
0.816700	I believe that I can read, talk and understand any medical info given to me by a nurse or a doctor and be able to repeat that information to someone else, such as my spouse, easily.  
0.555600	I feel like my ability and capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision is about average or slightly below average. I feel many health care professionals are rushing and do not take the time to explain or allow me to ask the questions I need.
0.900000	I have a background as a health care social worker, but even before that time, I have never had problems with processing fairly complex written material. Not only have  worked in a hospital, my mother was a nurse and we used to look at her books. From that exposure I have a reasonably good grasp on medical terminology. I have more difficulty in following verbal instruction, especially if the person giving them does not do it well.
0.705600	I believe that I'm maybe average in terms of this type of basic health information processing, and how to understand it in order to make informed health decisions.  In the case of something that I don't understand from medical literature or perhaps something I hear a medical professional share, I would say I can obtain the information I need.  Its important to me to make the best decisions so I try to get information from different sources.
0.844400	I am a nurse, and I know the importance of understanding your own medical condition.  When I see a healthcare provider for myself, I try to be sure I understand everything.  But sometimes I forget to ask questions, or feel rushed.
0.600000	I think I have all the tools to find the basic information I need. I can either call in to my insurance and have one of them aid me or I can find information online regarding my questions and requirements.
0.588900	I'm able to read basic health information and services, but I have difficulty with filling forms out without leaving out vital information.  I have someone else fill out the forms and I just sign them in order to avoid the hassle and confusion.
0.500000	I would say to a very, very small degree. Everything about the process is puzzling to me and unless it's something basic (ie something like a simple cold), then I'll have am extremely hard time understanding. I don't know why but perhaps it has something to do with a fear of going to the doctor or hospital which makes it even more difficult for me. Usually I have to rely on my doctor, mother or partner to assist me in understand the information and making decisions. 
0.916700	I'm quite comfortable obtaining and understanding the necessary information.  I have also helped several others by attending medical appointments and explaining the medical information given by the doctors/nurses to them.
0.805600	I feel more confident in my understanding of details only if I find the healthcare provider has listened to the details I have shared.  That is not always the case.  Typically feel they are rushing me through.
0.650000	I do not have a full understanding of health information, especially since I am not in charge of insurance and live over 50 miles away from the nearest medical center.
0.800000	I can make basic health decisions. There are times when I may not understand everything if they use technical language, but I just go along with it. I have not had any serious medical condition where I need to be on top of my care.
0.577800	I feel relatively confident in my ability to fill out and submit both hard copy and electronic health forms, however, sometimes I do not feel that I fully understand the content of these forms. Also, when I visit a doctor, I don't always know what questions to ask, and sometimes feel that I do not receive effective treatments as a result. Typically when a doctor explains something to me, I can develop a general understanding.
0.900000	I feel confident in my ability to ask questions of my doctor or research conditions online to gain a full understanding of my health status. I regularly ask doctors follow up questions so that I can fully understand
0.755600	I feel like I can understand my doctor or nurse most of the time. However, there have been several occasions when my doctor tried to explain something to me that was over my understanding, or he simply didn't care to try and explain it in a way I could understand. Sometimes I leave with more questions than when I came in. My doctors tend to rush out of the room and I feel like they already have one foot out the door when they speak with me.
0.794400	I feel that I have a fair understanding of medical terminology in regards to my own health and medical needs. If there is something I do not know and a medical professional is not readily available to explain the term, I can usually google the term I do not understand and educate myself for future interactions. 
0.844400	I believe that I can understand and process basic health information to make my health decisions.  I tend to not ask enough questions.  I tend to depend on internet research to fill in the blanks.
0.572200	Well it is all so complicated, not even just the medical information but the information needed to navigate the bureaucracy so that one can begin to have medical coverage and have things set up the right way to afford coverage. Then you have to do not only what is medical best for you based on what the doctors tell you but what works out with your work schedule and is covered by your insurance but often to find these out it is a waiting game. So you might pick one option in the hopes that you are covered but then find out later that you are not. Plus you might have to go out of work depending on what choice you pick and then you don't have a job and that makes future medical even harder. Plus I worry too about changing insurance standards because everyone seems to think that healthcare should be about making money instead of taking care of people. 
0.872200	I can understand a good amount of medical terminology as well as the treatment process.I took a couple of classes and have worked in a hospital before.
0.916700	I feel like I have enough confidence and understanding to understand the basic health information and what I need to know to understand what's going on and what I need to do in order to take care of myself and make myself feel better. 
0.855600	I have access to medical professionals in my family, as well as a background in a tertiary medical field.  I am able to access information via the internet if I encounter any terminology or diagnosis with which I am unfamiliar.  I am very confident in my capacity to understand information provided, ask appropriate questions for further understanding, and research any additional information if help is immediately unavailable.
0.900000	I feel like have the capacity to a large degree to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. I often use my health insurance webpage or the doctors group page for additional information.
0.644400	I guess that I have a very basic understanding of the human body and medical procedures.  The only health class I have taken was back in high school so I don't remember to much of it.  I have to ask a lot of questions at the doctors office because I don't understand a lot of the terminology.  Medicine has always been a mystery to me and I feel out of my element when I'm expected to grasp it. Prescription drugs make me nervous because there are so many side effects and sometimes I don't understand all the jargon on the information sheet so I have to ask the pharmacist.
0.788900	I feel I have adequate knowledge and research skills to be able to understand my basic health test results and findings. My largest knowledge gap relates to pharmaceuticals, specifically with regard to understanding alternatives, standard of care, side effects, and potential for dependency. Since I lack this technical knowledge, I usual ask the doctor, a friend in the medical field, as well as the pharmacist about the prescribed medication.  
0.916700	I am a 40 year old women with a college degree. I feel like I am a very independent and intelligent person. I have absolutely no issues understanding, obtaining and processing health information. I helped an aging father through a cancer diagnoses and death at a young age. I have also helped my mother with many inpatient and out patient appoinments concerning her mental health. I also have three children who have had a variety of childhood illnesses and injuries. I feel like I have the tools to make appropriate health decision concerning myself, my husband or any of my children. I do think my life experience has helped with this comfort level with those in the medical field.
0.861100	I think I am extremely literate when it comes to medical and health information. I've studied it in some college courses I've taken, I also have friends in the medical field who showed me everything I would ever need to know in terms of keeping myself informed. I have a pretty good 'know-how' when it comes to making appropriate health decisions.
0.794400	I feel very confident that I can obtain, process and understand basic health information. I like reading all the material that is given to me at the Dr. Office and usually write down my questions before going but sometimes I do forget and find google to be very helpful. I find most of the time the nurse and dr both explain everything at least 3 or more times. After having Kids and going to the Dr a lot you learn the process very quickly and it's usually the same every time.
0.588900	I feel like I can understand basic health information. But when it gets more complicated, I start to get confused. I feel like doctors rush through and don't tell you things thoroughly. 
0.844400	I feel I have a solid capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make my health decisions. I have a good understanding of anatomy and physiology so if something is wrong I feel like I know the appropriate questions to ask. I have no problem requesting that my doctor run certain tests if I feel they are missing something. I feel strongly that it is my responsibility to be accountable for my own healthcare and I do not rely solely on the doctor.  I don't trust that doctors have the time to do thorough physicals on their patients unless the patient pushes the point, especially with the healthcare provider that I have. So I would say that I take the reigns in making sure my healthcare needs are taken care of  
0.777800	If it came to a serious decision I could definitely ask questions to make a determination.  I understand basics of what doctors are saying and mostly I just wait for results from tests in order to determine what more information I need. 
0.883300	I feel that I have the basic understanding of health services and information, as I am a retired RN. I very much have my wits about me and stay up to date and current on health issues through nursing journals and by staying in contact with fellow co-workers who are still employed.
0.794400	I generally don't care too much about going extremely in depth about health issues, but I understand enough, ask enough and communicate enough to cover the most important things.
0.872200	I believe that I have a very strong capability to obtain information that I need regarding my health. I also can process the information fairly easy. I can understand quite fully basic health information and services presented to me to be able to make appropriate health decisions. I am a pretty good reader and I always ask questions if there is something that I don't understand.
0.622200	I find the world of healthcare to be fairly opaque and difficult to navigate. I tend to avoid going to the doctor because I don't fully understand my health coverage or how various medical professions work. Luckily I am in good health and do not find the need to visit a doctor very frequently. It does cause me some stress when I need to go to the doctor, because I don't know my options.
0.861100	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information in order to make informed choices. While at a doctor's office I am willing to ask questions regarding test results that are unclear or which I cannot interpret the meaning of. I also feel confident in my abilities to research through qualified articles and writings if necessary.
0.794400	I FEEL I HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER GETTING ANY INFORMATION I NEED. I FEEL MY MEDICAL PROVIDER OR INSURANCE COMPANY OR WHOEVER I NEEDED WOULD HELP ME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION NEEDED CONCERNING ANY HEALTH DECISIONS 
0.811100	I feel I have great capacity in filling out forms as well as comprehending information given. That which I do not understand I tend to research online to the satisfaction of my comprehension.
0.844400	I am young and have good reading comprehension skills; I rarely need help understanding forms and info given to me as long as I take the time to read carefully. Sometimes I might feel a little rushed and not ask as many questions as I should have but I generally make time if I feel the issue is important enough.
0.916700	I can understand completeley as long as they do not use too many technical words. In that case, I ask them to explain with more day to day wording.
0.605600	I feel like I obtain information quite efficiently. Theres not too may times that I find myself asking doctors to much about things I dont know.
0.794400	"I feel like I have the information I need because I have a background in healthcare so it's a little easier for me to understand the medical terminology and paperwork. As for others, I feel like certain things should be broken down for patients who don't understand. Doctors and nurses should use ""Layman's"" terms when talking about health conditions so that patients will understand the seriousness of everything and not be left out.   "
0.472200	I feel that I possess the skills necessary to understand and process basic health information provided the medical professional takes enough time to provide the information.
0.883300	I am able to go online to my physcians's portal and read my chart. I can ask for refills for my prescriptions and have them call it in. I can see all my Lab tests and what the doctor  and I talked about.
0.855600	I have a bachelor's in biology so I feel that I have a fairly good grasp of basic biological functions and how medications work. I also work at a veterinary hospital so I feel that I have a pretty good understanding of medical terminology and diseases.

0.833300	I feel that I have access to regular healthcare and services, which allow me to get treatment whenever I feel that I need it. I also know that I can call my healthcare providers and will be responded to in an efficient manner that is easy for me to understand. 
0.916700	I believe I can acquire all available information about making a health decision, and then evaluate and understand  that information in a way that leads to the best possible decision.
0.544400	I understand written health information better than verbal. When it is explained to me generally I have to ask them to repeat it to me. Overall,  I understand written information very well.
0.844400	I don't always understand healthcare professionals, so when I go online and do my own research.  I take the information that I'm given and search out whatever other information I need to know.
0.677800	Well, my wife helps me a great deal in understanding some of the mumble jumble.  I have a fair grasp of things but sometimes it does get a bit technical or there is too much junk in between the important parts that I get a bit frustrated with the paper work.

0.805600	I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions but i do run everything y my wife.  She has been an Operating room nurse for over 15 years and extremely well versed in the medical field.  I defer to her knowledge when it comes to medical knowledge.
0.850000	I think I have the basic knowledge to understand most health information, but there are sometimes areas where I need additional information or clarification. In situations where I need clarification on something, I am comfortable asking my doctor or nurse or pharmacist to explain more fully or add to what I already understand.

0.916700	I know that my health is a very important issue. At my age, I understand that Iâm at risk for things that I wasnât risk for earlier in life. A severe issue at my age would be worse than the same issue at a younger age. I want to be on top of any issues and know exactly what Iâm dealing with. 
0.611100	I have a degree in Biology so I have a slightly higher level of knowledge but still can be unsure depending on the type of appointment.
0.844400	"I am about 95% proficient at processing the information needed. This is in part due to ... sorry ... being intelligent, my family history to see trends and what happens when you don't treat illnesses, and knowing that ""if you don't understand, ask, instead of walking out."" "
0.750000	I think I have great degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make the right decisions for my health care. I work in the health care field so I am around a lot of the terminology and understand most of it. When we get into specific diseases I will sometimes not understand the terminology because it isn't something I work with often, but as a whole I usually have no problems filling out medical forms, it is pretty basic information they ask and if and when I have problems I simply ask questions and usually get the help I need.
0.838900	I feel confident in understanding most all situations. I am a person who listens to and accepts logic. Most of my interactions with health professional has been more than adequate.
0.850000	I see doctors often because I have arthritis in my back that I need to have an operation for. I asked a lot of questions. My doctor showed me my MRI when I saw him the last time. I understand my health problems because I have had them for years. Now my records are on the internet because many offices keep them on patient portals. 
0.644400	I google things when I do not understand them. I also get a second opinion most of the time not only for my condition but for my family as well since we have a doctor in the family. He explains us information that we forget to ask our doctors.
0.755600	I am typically able to understand all the information and am able to ask questions until I fully understand. However, it's definitely helpful to have somebody who is more experienced there to help out. I sometimes struggle with processing information for the first time so I often need something to be repeated. It's nice to have somebody else take the responsibility on occasion.
0.850000	I feel like I definitely contain the capacity to understand the information that is given to me. Being young and relatively healthy, I do not have to visit the doctor often and have never had a complicated medical condition or disease.
0.900000	I have worked in healthcare in the past, so I feel I understand most basic information given to me.  Also, if there is anything I don't completely understand (or even find interesting and want to know more about) I feel I know where to find the resources I need.

0.694400	I think with the boom in online information (which is pretty easily comprehensible, i.e., you can tell what's fake and what's reputable,) people have more ability than ever to assess details about particular medical conditions. I feel confident in this, at least.

0.805600	I am able to process information and fill out required forms. If I leave an appointment still having questions, I google the condition.
0.883300	I feel that I have enough of a knowledge of both my own health history and what questions I need to ask what I need to.  Many times I am not hesitant to ask for clarification if I don not understand what a medical professional has told me.
0.511100	I think that I have a great understanding of medical information when it is presented to me. I find it interesting and important to understand
0.861100	I feel confident in my ability to answer questions relating to my health. I can read basic information and understand it. I feel capable of asking questions to my provider. However sometimes I think of questions once I leave or don't like my provider enough to ask.
0.794400	I feel like I can understand basic health information.  I work in the healthcare industry so I feel like I have a better understanding than some people.  However, I feel like sometimes I don't get all the information I need about my own health from my healthcare providers.  I always feel as though they are just rushing through everything and I don't get all the answers  and explanations that I want.
0.644400	I think I do have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  There are times when I have been confused by a medical professional's explanation, however, I am okay with asking for clarification or assistance to better understand  what I do not know.  Also, I can look things up online if a person is not physically available to assist me.
0.872200	I think I am definitely able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate decisions. I can usually comprehend everything I am reading in materials and if I do not, I can easily ask the doctor or nurse to answer questions and fill in blanks for me.

0.722200	I believe I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I myself studied most of this terminolgy, so for me it wouldn't be a problem. I also enjoy learning new things and asking questions is the best way one can learn.
0.688900	I think I only know the basic stuff that every average citizen knows.  I'm not a medical professional and I don't know much research my conditions or anything I have problems with.  However, with enough time and dedication, I'm sure I can look over information to get an understanding of some basic health information to make appropriate health decisions.  
0.727800	In general, I believe that I have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions.
0.772200	I can understand most of the basic information about condition I may have  . I usually can navigate online to earn some more, but i like to discuss with health professional , for my particular case. Than I feel the doctor addresses my certain problem. Discussion with doctor makes me make my final decision about how to address health issue
0.827800	I believe I have all the necessary information I need to process and understand. I don't believe that doctors or nurses have enough time for me. I often avoid going to the doctor because I feel I am bothering the doctor with my problems.
0.750000	I have no major health issues or constraints, so I am perfectly able to seek out, obtain, and comprehend any available information. 
0.900000	I have no problems with the health information, medications or interaction with the doctors. However occasionally i do use the internet to get additional information and that can be an interesting quest to figure out what information is pertinent to my case. 
0.827800	I feel like I am pretty well equipped to get and understand the information I need about my conditions to make health decisions.  Though sometimes lack of knowledge on part of health professionals makes it more difficult to get all available services.
0.861100	Medicine has always been an interest of mine, so I have no difficulty reading detailed medical reports or understanding the significance of the numbers associated with blood and other test results. If I do not know a term, I look it up.
0.916700	I feel as though i am very able to gather information about any health information that i may have, and even understanding it is not a problem for me. From my experiences i have learned to get better at this process and have narrowed it down onto what exactly to ask in order to get the answers that i am looking for.  
0.816700	I believe I can understand basic health information and services pretty well - well enough to feel confident about the decisions I make if I am given all of the information.

0.655600	I believe that a lot of the terminology used can sometimes be difficult to comprehend. What makes it worse, is that I can be shy and don't ask the proper questions.
0.566700	I have at least some ability to. Sometimes I have trouble processing what's told to me if it's too much to handle at once. It feels like I'm just being bombarded with info and my brain shuts itself off to protect itself. 
0.711100	"In the past I've had difficulty getting the information I need because the nurse or doctor just seemed too busy to care. I felt like a burden or just another $$$ to them. They barely checked me out, barely heard what I was saying, disregarded it because ""they know best"", and sent me on my way. Recently I've gotten another health care provider who are a lot better and seem to genuinely care about their patients. Yes, like many places they still feel rushed and busy but they try their best to help as best as possible and even if they can't address the concerns at the time of the appointment encourage their patients to call or reach out to them through the online messaging system. Previously I felt too burdening or even afraid to voice my questions and concerns, but now I feel welcomed and even encouraged. They want to make sure I'm fully aware of everything and they want to know everything so they can provide the best treatment. I feel like I'm both informed and have the ability to get the information and understanding I need. We're a team in this."
0.916700	I feel I am absolutely qualified to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.866700	I believe I can always obtain, process, and understand my basic health needs with regard to services being offered and health decisions I make.  
0.838900	I'm usually comfortable going to the doctor's office and usually I understand what is being said. But If I ended up getting a difficult diagnosis I would want someone other than myself to be there, to listen and understand what the health professional is saying because I would feel re assured on what was taking place.
0.883300	In matters of my health I will take the time to carefully absorb the information I am given to evaluate my situation. I will research any additional questions I may have and will utilize all people I have available to me that have a understanding of my situation.
0.722200	I feel that I've had enough services performed within the healthcare system that I understand a good deal of what information I'm given. I also feel empowered to ask pertinent questions where my knowledge and understanding fails me.
0.761100	I feel that I have a good understanding of the information that I am provided by my doctors and nurses, however I do not often feel that I have all of the information on potential alternatives available to me. I am also very confused by my health coverage and whether or not certain things will be covered as preventative care or if I will be billed for them to meet my deductible. This often makes me feel very stressed about talking to the doctors and bringing up additional symptoms or questions because I fear getting a large bill for tests that I may or may not have even needed.
0.883300	I feel like I have a firm grasp on how to access and understand basic health information as needed. My medical services have made both accessing and understanding health conditions incredibly easy with the use of phone apps and websites, as well as timely discussion through these mentioned means. 
0.844400	I completely feel that I have the knowledge needed to comprehend the information provided to me by my doctors.  The information is broken down into basic terms that can be understood by anyone who may be unfamiliar with medical terminology.
0.777800	I feel like I have a high degree of understanding of medical issues and what my Doctors are telling me. I am also not afraid to ask questions, if I don't understand or only partially understand. I like to take a piece of paper with questions written down with me to my apt if i have things i am curious about or don't understand. And when a doctor is telling me something I will stop them if I don't understand something. I'm not a doctor so I don't have to understand things, thats why i have a doctor and why it's important to ask questions when they are explaining things!
0.805600	I have a lot of trust in my doctors and will ask them to explain anything I don't understand. I'm also always free to call their nurses and assistants and they are always happy to be helpful. I'm good at researching things I might need to know as well, so I always feel I'm well informed when I need to make a decision.
0.916700	i feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make decisions for myself.  i have no problem understanding any information received from a doctor, and often do my own research online. 
0.822200	I feel pretty confident that I can get the information I need. I usually search the internet thoroughly before a visit, so I go into the meeting with a pretty good set of questions, and hopefully a decent understanding of what the situation is. I always try to listen pretty carefully when speaking with my doctor in order to ask the appropriate follow up questions.
0.588900	I'm competent, just as much as the average person. I know the basics about health to relate any problems and I've had enough experience getting hurt on how to either treat it or find someone who will treat it.
0.794400	I have been dealing with health problems for many year with my own and family members. I have taken on the care of my grandmother and mother from doctors appts, test, hospitals and caring for them  until they passed away also I have a child with special needs from birth and deal with his care daily along with my health issues. I don't not know everything but I know I can try and find the help I need online and with doctor, aids and help with other family members.
0.705600	I currently am injured and disabled and have been in this state for over 2 years. I see a doctor once a month minimum and see multiple doctors, physicians and health care professionals. Since i have been dealing with this type of stuff so frequently I have a pretty good grip on health care forms. The information gets a little more complicated as I have multiple doctors working with me and they all have a different opinion so in that regard i usually require more information from each individual doctor because I get so much new information every time. Deciding which services are needed is also a little more difficult since my problem falls into the chronic pain category so no one really knows exactly what to do to treat my problem so this gets a little tricky too since everything seems like a guess to see what works and what doesn't work.
0.744400	I feel that I can obtain the necessary information through reading provided materials and asking questions. Often, if I find something confusing I ask and get an in depth response that explains it
0.833300	I feel confident when i interact with the medical service providers like doctors and nurses  and ask them to clarify if anything is complex to understand,  in some instances I may need some help if i am filling up or reading the content related to medical condition 
0.805600	The one thing I feel I don't have is an advisory function from the doctor.  They are really good at recommending a TON of tests and a million other things, but they rarely tell you how much that is going to cost, which is all out of pocket these days any way, and if it's really needed at all.
0.600000	I feel that I can be able to get the help I need to process and understand information, but I do feel I miss out on a lot of information. I feel that when you go in doctors and nurses are on such push for time that the rush through a lot of the information. The often hand you paperwork when you first walk in that the rush you through. Next doctor are handing you paper work and talking really fast because the are behind schedule  and you are still try to process everything they just told you.
0.755600	I feel as though I am adequately empowered to make my own decisions when it comes to my health. In several instances, however, I have been complacent with what my doctors suggest despite not fully understanding my diagnosis.
0.872200	I feel that while I may not know the right questions to ask in a medical situation, I have the capability and knowledge to get the information I need to make health decisions. I am of sound mind and can fill out my own forms without feeling the need to fabricate or gloss over my medical history.
0.827800	I think I have the right tools and mindset to understand this information and for what I do not understand I would ask someone.
0.883300	I feel I am very capable of understanding basic health information. I am not afraid to ask question and get clarification when needed, I also research information for better understanding.
0.855600	"While I may not know that I am not asking a certain, necessary question of a doctor or nurse, it's simply because I don't know or understand enough. It's not that I'm not capable of understanding what the doctor/nurse is saying, It's just that I don't know I need to ask. I also issues with ""making waves"" so I will sometimes just ""go along to get along."" I do have a wife, who loves to ""make waves"" and a mother-in-law who is a nurse with nearly 40 years experience so even when I do miss something, one of them will usually understand it or figure it out."
0.700000	I am semi confident, I dont have alot of experience dealing with doctors so it is a little intimidating and I may not understand everything they are asking for or explaining. I feel like if I were to receive some type of document that was not completely clear I would ask for clarification regarding the questions. Maybe some of the terms used would not be something I know and dont want to sound dumb and would ignore but really important things such as conditions I may have or steps I need to follow I would ensure a clear answer from my doctor.
0.822200	I do not always feel confident that I am getting sufficient information from my doctor or nurse, so I always follow up with reputable medical websites. I especially find it important to review medication information because no one ever explains side effects.
0.883300	I feel that I am in a stable state of mind and am physically sound enough to deal with any condition I face. And as such I will be able to fully grasp and understand from my doctor what needs to be done of me to deal with the condition and fix it.
0.816700	I have my B.S. in Biology. I went to the college health center quite a bit and go to the doctor now for regular checkups where we have candid talk about whatever health issues might be occurring. 
0.777800	My family physician goes above and beyond to spend plenty of time with me during my visits. He makes sure I understand everything being said. Also, I am very versed in internet searches and know I can find a lot of useful information there.
0.916700	I am a bookworm who loves to read, I've been like this ever since I was a child. Therefore, reading and comprehending information, medical included, is not a problem for me.
0.822200	I believe that i possess the capability to understand basic health information to a high level of degree which helps me make andecision as to what is going to be the best decision regarding what action i should or should not take for my health benefit. I am good at understanding or comprehending and if not inwill ask questions.
0.583300	I have a problem with it cause i got my disease at 12 and my mom always helped me with my medical conditions so i have a hard time expressing things with doctors. So i am trying to get better on making my own decisions 
0.427800	I do not feel like I have a strong ability to understand medical health information that is to be provided to me. I always find myself getting help from someone. I do not want the chance of misinterpreting something. I take it very seriously when it comes to money and health.
0.816700	I feel fully capable of taking charge of my own health and that the current system gives me, as a native speaker and well-educated person, what I need
0.750000	I feel like I have a lot of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.750000	I think that I have the capacity to do all these things. My conditions are not severe enough to disable me from being able to understand and comprehend the problems that lie within me.
0.900000	I am intelligent and I am good at coming to understandings and learning on my own how and why things work. Because of this I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.872200	I feel fairly competent in obtaining, processing and understanding the basic health information and services I need to in order to make appropriate health decisions. That being said, I find that I tend to get very emotional about health concerns during doctors' visits such that I don't think clearly. Hence, I often draw a blank when it comes to asking questions and so on. Once I'm at home and I become calm, I find that I can think about and articulate questions regarding the health information and services necessary.
0.888900	I think I have above average competence and ability to understand things.  I will generally do internet research on my own before seeing a doctor so I have a better understanding.  I generally do not need any assistance.  If I have questions I try to remember or write them down to ask the doctor.  Sometimes the doctors are too rushed and busy during an appointment.  That is very frustrating.  I am the type of person who wants to understand and ask a lot of questions.  At the same time, I am very intelligent and understand things quickly, as well as do my own research ahead of time in order to not waste time during the appointment.  Nevertheless, the doctors many times do rush me or make me feel that they are not interested in answering my questions.  The scariest thing is when they do not have the answers to my questions or are dismissive of my concerns or when I am using supplements that work that they have never heard of.
0.777800	am an adult. i do understand what the doctors say. i understand if there is a problem i am responsible and i should have all the rights to obtain any information regarding my health. that is how i can take decisions based on what is really the problem an how will it affect me
0.844400	I feel that I have the ability to learn and digest new information pertaining to making health decisions, because I listen to doctors, as well as research on my own.  
0.527800	I think i have a pretty decent capacity. I don't know much because I don't fall sick often and therefore my contact with doctors is very rare
0.861100	I feel that i am able to completely understand any information that is given to me by my primary care provider. I may not understand all of the terminology or how to pronounce many of the medications generic names, however i haven't had any problem comprehending any medical information that has been explained to me.
0.916700	Yes, I do.  However, even though I recently retired from 35 years of Nursing, I had real difficulty getting needed information when my mom broke her leg.  In most cases, I am able to figure out what questions to ask, or how to get further information.
0.722200	I feel that I get the information that I need to take care of myself. I sometimes do not feel that I can tell everything that is wrong with me as I feel sometimes that dr are judging me and I get shy about bringing things up to them.
0.872200	I think I have a very good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to help me make decisions. I am pretty smart and usually can figure things out
0.900000	I feel very competent to voice my concerns and questions with my health care providers.   If I don't understand something I have no problems asking them to repeat or put in laymans terms so that I can understand better. 
0.705600	I feel pretty confident when it comes to understanding basic health information. I took a few medical assistant classes in college because I was studying to be a medical assistant a few years ago. One of the classes was about understanding basic health information and also what some abbreviations and other important terms mean. It was a fun class. I feel that with my knowledge in this field, from school, that I have a little bit of an advantage compared to others when it comes to understanding basic health information and services. There is still some things I am probably not familiar with as I didn't get a degree in this field because I switched majors, but I feel that, overall, I have a pretty strong confidence and understanding in this area. 
0.483300	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. The problem is whether I am informed enough to make appropriate health decisions regardless of how many questions I ask. If I need to know something it should be TOLD to me, and if I need a procedure immediately it should be scheduled immediately instead of them ignoring me for a month and setting up an entirely different procedure without consulting anyone before a different doctor tells me that I needed something different the whole time.
0.916700	I know I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand all the basic health information and services that I need to make all the appropriate health decisions for myself and for my loved ones.  Recently, I have had to make health decisions for myself and I understood all that was necessary to make those decisions.
0.733300	Overall I think that I can usually understand the basic information.  THe problem is when a medical professional uses jargon or terminology that I am not familiar with.  Additionally, it is hard in those cases to even think of the right questions to ask.
0.800000	I feel like I can understand basic health info well.  I am a college graduate and a teacher so I feel my comprehension skills are very good.
0.866700	I feel I have a large capacity to deal with basic health information. Although I have never studied medicine, I follow developments in the field and enjoy reading professional journals. Though much of it goes over my head I feel I have a good understanding of medical conditions and possible treatments. I especially like to go to the doctor knowing in advance what he may say. Allows for a more detailed discussion.
0.866700	I believe that I am knowledgeable enough to understand what my doctor or nurse is telling me as well as reading the materials they give to me.  If I do not understand something, I have no issue asking for clarification.  I helped with my father's medical care up through his death as well and I was his proxy.
0.816700	I write down and keep track of any questions or new information I have for the doctor so it can be discussed during my appointments I feel I understand my basic health information and services I require based on my health information. If I don't understand something my doctor said I always ask questions to make sure I understand.
0.861100	I am a former hospital RN. I left the field more than 30 years ago so I'm out of touch but I have enough training to know how to do research. What I don't have is the confidence to speak with doctors about what's bothering me, mainly because none of the ones I've seen so far have been interested, plus I always get the feeling that I'm taking up time that they don't have much of. It's very frustrating.
0.761100	I feel I am able to understand basic health information enough to make appropriate decisions. I feel this way because I have several chronic medical conditions and have had to fill out many medical forms in the past. I have more doctor appointments then the average person. Because of this I feel that I have a good understanding of what I am reading and what information I am filling out. 
0.677800	I feel that I have a really good ability to obtain and understand basic health information. Forms are usually easy to fill out and nothing is too hard to understand.
0.733300	Sometimes I feel that I do not have a sufficient understanding of medical terminology to express to a doctor the concerns or problems I am having in a way that will help them to focus their treatment. I feel that often doctors are using a trial and error method of prescribing treatment and think that much of it could be because I am not communicating to them effectively.
0.738900	I believe I do have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make appropriate health decisions.  Sometimes, though, there are terms that are used on medical forms or prescription papers that are hard to understand.  So, I may need to get advice from the doctor or someone around me to help me understand, exactly what the papers are saying.
0.916700	I feel like there is enough information available online that most people can do research and gather adequate information to make relatively accurate decisions regarding their health without consulting professionals.
0.655600	I think it takes some common sense to read it.  It might seem difficult to understand at first,  with the exceptions of a few big words, it is relatively easy.
0.916700	I think I am fully capable of asking/understanding health information.  I worked in health care for years, and understand both terms and how things work in the system
0.822200	I feel like I have a good ability to understand and process basic health decisions as I work in a scientific field. 
0.805600	I feel like I understand and comprehend more than many people do regarding my health information, as I am an active participant in my own health care.  I also have had several medical conditions so I am well-versed in many medical issues.  However, at the same time, medical things are very confusing and there are often times things I do not understand that doctors explain to me.  I often have my husband present with me for a second set of ears so we can both discuss our understanding afterwards.
0.811100	I have an average ability to understand health related topics when they are explained to me. Often I will do research on my own that sometimes conflicts with the information my healthcare providers give me so I need that explained
0.594400	I FEEL THAT I CAN TYPICALLY UNDERSTAND THINGS BEING EXPLAINED TO ME. I MAY HAVE TO TAKE NOTES AND RESEARCH THINGS LATER.
0.916700	I believe I can fully process and understand basic health information, needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have never encountered a difficulty when filling out paperwork, or being given information. I find mostly everything to be straightforward and easy to understand. If I do not fully comprehend something, or have further questions, I have found my doctor, nurses, office staff and pharmacy staff always able and willing to help to the best of their ability. If for some reason I still have questions or would like something explained from another party, I can call my health insurances patient hotline. The hotline will connect me with a nurse or medical professional, that can answer my questions from home, or even at odd hours.i feel that I am 99% able to fully understand and comprehend and basic health information needed to make health decisions. 
0.855600	I feel like, when it comes to being able to obtain, process and understand health information and things when making decisions regarding my health that I have a better than average capacity to make a well-informed decision and be comfortable.
0.872200	I am competent  to understand the written and oral word of a medical practitioner. The only time I have had any problem is understanding why I have to take a certain medication. At first I got a lot of medical jargon that any layman would not understand. I made the doctor slow down and put it into plain English. I am still not totally satisfied with his answer not because I did not understand but I am suspect about the basic premise.

0.755600	I am not much of a verbal learner. Someone explaining something to me is far less likely to stick than if I can read the information and absorb it myself. I am a researcher.

0.833300	I do feel I have the ability to effectively understand the basic information they provide as anything that I don't quite understand I ask in detail about the information in order to form a better understanding of my condition.  I do feel that sometimes I do need things to be broken down into simpler terms but for the most part I feel I have enough of a grasp to make an informed decision. 
0.622200	It really depends on how I feel. If I am in pain or severe discomfort my ability to understand complex issues drops dramatically. I don't go into a doctors office often for a checkup, so most likely the reason I am there is that I am not well. This can lead to my understanding of complex issues and situations being less than great.
0.916700	I feel that I am very good at understanding what a doctor explains to me because always listen close when it is something that relates to my health.

I usually ask questions to expand my knowledge of what is going on with me and if I don't understand something I usually ask. Sometimes I am shocked and can't think of anything to ask at the moment. When I am at home preparing for a doctor's visit, I try to write down any questions I want to ask so that I don't forget them. Often, after talking to or seeing a medical professional, I take what they told me and do further research online to learn more about whatever is going on with me.

0.677800	I think I'm pretty good with getting and understanding information to make proper choices. It does help though if I was given a list of alternatives like similar drugs, comparable specialists, or other methods of treatment. It helps if all documents are typed out and not hand written. It is so hard to read information when they have sloppy hand writing. I also like to have a bit of time to look over all documents, ask the right questions and come up with the best solution for myself. I don't like to be put under pressure to make a choice quickly.
0.711100	I mostly can understand, but I will often search online something I may not fully understand. I will also ask questions to my provider but will often follow up with looking for information online.

0.900000	I feel that all of the information I need about health related topics is easily accessible. The internet makes getting this information very easy.
0.866700	"I understand the basics usually pertaining to myself. I had a recent total hysterectomy and it was hard to pull all the information together in terms of estrogen replacement. It's been a year and I am still trying to ascertain the estrogen at my age going away and the swelling and pain I am having. Trying lyrica but that is causing weight gain. Hard to get professionals to see me as not fat but swollen! I ask questions likely better than most because I have a child who has Cerebral Palsy with 2 VP Shunts for hydrocephalus who requires frequent shunt revisions. This has taught me to speak up since he cannot talk. I have to ask all questions and think all the time about what could be ""up."" I am not afraid to ask any question and when I do meet a stubborn provider for him I am now quick to tell them I will no longer need their services. Then I find another. For me, I usually am not as assertive."

0.733300	I feel that many doctors and physicians use very technical terms, and do not want to spend the time to explain everything.  I trust a lot of what the doctor tells me with very little questions so that I do not waste their time.  I rely on using the internet to search out or answers any questions I may have
0.555600	I believe I have a fair deal of capabilities to understand, obtain, and process basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions.

0.827800	I feel I can understand information to a basic degree. If something is too complicated, I am able to research the information myself and read it thoroughly to my understanding.
0.811100	I guess first I try to understand everything on my own. If I am still in the doctor's office I will ask a question.  Usually only once though.  I don't want to sound stupid by asking the same question over and over again, or repeated questions of different kinds.  Usually I manage pretty well on my own. but, sometimes I don't always understand medical jargon, or what certain blood reports show, but I have a couple of nurse friends that can help me.  I also know a pharmacist if I have a question about a drug.  
0.883300	I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information because six years ago I was a insurance agent. I was licensed in health care. I had to have educational training on new information(policies) that effect the client's selection of choice based on his/hers health.
0.822200	I have an extensive medical history going back more than 20 years. Throughout that time I have been in situations that called for requests of my medical records and other related transcripts of my care. I also have been in need of more materials for my own understanding, as I have had more than 10 surgeries over the years and many procedures.  I have fulfilled the requests(for legal and Disability reasons) and supplied myself with what I needed too. I was in touch with anyone and everyone including, records department employees, APRNs, to people that are part of national health help organizations to the doctors themselves in order to obtain what I needed to get.
0.916700	I fully understand what my healthcare provider has told me and I am capable of making appropriate health decisions.  The problem is that sometimes I don't tell the doctor the truth because I am embarrassed.

0.794400	When the doctors tell me about a condition, if I do not understand I will ask them questions until I fully understand everything involved
0.916700	I rarely have any issues understanding my doctor or a nurse and if something doesn't make sense to me I ask them to elaborate on what I don't initially understand.  I occasionally have an issue getting in contact with my doctor by phone but it's understandable as he's busy and it's rare that I actually need to contact him anyhow as he tends to explain things well and answer any questions I have during my visits.
0.850000	I can usually understand and process the information that I'm told or reading. Sometimes when reading, it's explained in such a way that is a little confusing, but when talking to someone, it's usually an easy concept to grasp.All in all, I generally understand the information I'm given pretty well.

0.866700	I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG FIBROSIS IN 2008 AND SINCE HAVE BECOME PRETTY ADAPT AT OBTAIN INFORMATION THROUGH THE INTERNET AND ASKING QUESTIONS OF MY DOCTOR AND NURSES. I GENERALLY KEEP SEARCHING OR ASKING QUESTIONS UNTIL I KNOW OR UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH MY CONDITION.
0.805600	I feel like have the capacity and understand to understand medical information. However, I always feel like doctors do not take out the time to answer questions properly because I always feel rushed to get out. A lot of the time I find my self researching what the doctors were rushing to explain.
0.838900	I think overall I have a good capacity to understand and process basic health information that medical staff present to me. Obtaining the information is relatively easy in my opinion. In terms of making proper health choices I feel that that is more of a grey area. The reason I say that is because I feel most doctors are very biased and will recommend things that may not be the best possible option for me.
0.705600	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions a little more than the average person. I understand most things the doctor tells me, and ask doctors or nurses to explain things I don't understand. 
0.827800	I feel like I'm more competent than most when it comes to the capacity to understand my health information. When doctors are not clear, I usually feel comfortable questioning them. I also feel comfortable researching my health issues independently. 
0.850000	I definitely feel I have the ability and capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information and services because my health is incredibly important to me and I am always diligent.

0.794400	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed very well as long as the information is not given to me in terms that I don't understand, such as by using the name of a specific bacteria instead of just saying bacteria.
0.816700	I'm a fairly intelligent person, with good reading comprehension and critical thinking. On the rare occasion I need help understanding something, I have no issue asking for assistance. 
0.788900	I have taken enough health related classes and done enough research to know the questions to ask.  I know the basics of how my body functions and reacts.  This knowledge helps me to communicate better with my health professionals and get the help that I need
0.688900	I feel like I understand most of what is told to me regarding health information but sometimes I need help.  I rarely go to the doctor or get sick so I am not familiar with a lot of medical terminology or how processes work so I usually have to get either my wife or mother to help me understand things.  I usually consult someone if there is a big decision to make although that is extremely rare.
0.811100	I feel I have a good understanding of most medical terms and I often do research before I go to an appointment.  I usually have an idea of what treatment will be recommended and I have my questions and concerns written down
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I try to be an informed consumer / patient when it comes to my health and do my best to take care of myself.  I try to learn as much as I can about health conditions I may have as well as the best ways to take care of myself.  I like to stay healthy and live as healthy a lifestyle as possible.
0.644400	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions to an average degree. Sometimes I have questions that I do not have the answers to, but if I am motivated enough I will call or email my doctor to find an answer. Sometimes I will simply look up my question online to find a good answer. Other times I will ask my significant other or  a family member for advice.
0.800000	I fee confident in my skills regarding basic health concerns and information. I usually want more information about how medicine works, why I have to take it, what damages it can cause and things of that nature. 
0.650000	I feel that I have a reasonable understanding of health information and services; however, I do feel that there is a lot that I do not know or understand.  Sometimes I feel rushed and don't feel like I have the time to ask all of the questions that I would like.  
0.855600	I feel I have good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Generally medical professionals are helpful in that regard, as if you ever have any questions, most are willing to explain it in detail. Also the age we live in, any questions about medical stuff are only a google search away. From the google search you can find actual medical documents explaining certain things, or just find other people like yourself suffering from the same thing who will share their experiences. Also not trying to brag but I've also been a smart person, so I find understanding things like this, isn't that tough. Generally though, I just try to make sure my Doctor and/or Nurses are fully informed of what is going on with me, and make sure to ask any questions I have.
0.883300	I understand what I need to understand and what I have trouble with I will inquire about until I do understand. I was never one to be shy about asking questions because there are just too many things out there to expect that any one of us could know all the answers ourselves.
0.522200	I have a biology/medical background so I feel somewhat more prepared than the average person. I get frustrated when I feel like I am being talked down to by medical personnel.
0.827800	I comprehend most basic health information. I have been given diagnosis that I have had to say âwhat is thatâ on numerous occasions. The doctor explains and sometimes I fully understand and sometimes I donât. I have written down the diagnosis and researched further on Internet from Home. 
0.777800	First of all, I usually will do some major indepth investigation upon my own to examine the facts, and then compare to what my medical staff is telling me, or suggesting that I do in their care. I absolutely do not put all of my faith in any one doctor or health professional, as many are simply wrong, or just doing what they are told to do by their superiors, which often is in the best interest of the pharmacutical and insurance companies. We as patients are sold to the highest bidder who then have control over our medical decisions. The outcome of my life is of no concern to these corporate entities, only the bottom line which determines the lowest cost factor for them, and the highest profit margins for the pharmacutical companies which the insurance provider can accept. It is in my best interest to know what these corporations are deciding, and through proper investigation, only I can really know if the medical care that I recieve is in my best interest.
0.883300	I feel that I have excellent ability to understand and process basic health information. I worked in the pharmacy field for several years and have medical professionals in my family and this helped me understand some medical terms and jargon much better.
0.811100	I usually am able to process the information that is given to me at the doctor's offices. I try to research as much as I can about what I do or might have before a visit that way when I actually go it's not as much of a surprise. There are occasional times I have a doctor explain something more in depth. There was only one time that I had a foot surgery and the surgeon was in and out in a minute I didn't even know what to ask. 
0.794400	I feel like I have a good understanding and capacity to obtain information I need. I always ask lots of questions to make sure I understand everything and when prescribed any kind of medicines I ask about side effects and comparable medicines, benefits and drawbacks of each, etc. I definitely like to be very well informed when it comes to my health.
0.883300	i am pretty knowledgeable on health issues. if i dont know something, i am quick to research it on my own. google is my best friend and i use it a lot.
0.772200	I am fully capable of understanding and processing information given to me regarding my health. I have no mental abnormalities that hinder me from assessing the situation and making judgements about any medically related situation. 
0.883300	I feel that I am extremely qualified to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I am a retired pharmacist with 40 years of experience. Hope this won't disqualify me. I have to say that I am EXTREMELY grateful for my education and background because of the health care experience I had from July 2016 to Feb 2017. I have very good knowledge in researching information when I need to.
0.783300	I feel truly confident in my capacity to make appropriate health decisions. I can understand what the doctor says, and if I do not understand I am able to ask questions and clear my doubts. 
0.855600	If I ever need help understanding anything at the pharmacy, they always are willing to take the time to explain any side effects or questions I have about specific medications.  When I see my doctor, it can sometimes be a little more rushed because he has so many patients during the day he has to see and he runs a very tight schedule.  However, I never felt like he answered any of my questions inadequately.  I usually do research on my own (online), before I go in for an appointment, so that I am better prepared to ask relevant questions regarding my potential diagnosis or ailments.  Therefore I know what to ask and usually have a good understanding of the health information presented to me.
0.738900	I feel I can understand medical information if it is laid out in a comprehensible format. However, I often think that important details are left out of the information I get due to lack of time by my medical professionals or a breakdown in communication due to the bureaucracy of the healthcare industry.
0.838900	I feel very confident in my own capacity to obtain and process basic health information. I have never had a problem with this in the past. 
0.900000	I find basic health information easy to obtain and understand. If the information that the doctor or nurse provides does not make sense to me I ask questions until they can explain it in my terms. As far as I know, I've never had an issue gaining information for basic health decisions.
0.783300	I feel I have a reasonable ability to understand basic health information and services and that I have the basic ability to make decisions about my health.  I feel I have an average ability for comprehension and if there is something I do not understand I have the ability to look up the information I need to know. 
0.833300	I haven't experienced many hospital visits, but when there I haven't had a difficult time understanding my medical issues. I have experienced long wait times even when I have had a scheduled appointment.
0.844400	I have a high degree of understanding. I'm confident in my ability understand basic health information. My family has a history of diabetes that has included multiple doctor trips and different doctors. This includes filing forms for new doctors or new patient check ups or getting into the urgent care clinic. I've paid out of pocket and I've used insurance when needed. I seldom experience any issues.
0.666700	I know how to get the information or help I need. I do like outside imput when there are medical decisions to be made. In the past Iâve felt Drâs donât adequately explain issues.
0.833300	I feel as if I have a decent understanding being able to understand the term of medical terminology. I also understand when my health is declining i know that I will have to go see a doctor to check on my health and receive treatment. 
0.627800	Although I can understand every day conversations, medical info can be difficult to read and interpret. There is often a lot of language that is unfamiliar and concepts that are not common. Sometimes when a doctor is speaking to me I don't feel comfortable asking questions as it seems as if I should be following.
0.672200	I feel like I have an above average understanding of medical terms and technology, although I'm not in med school or anything.  I feel that a lot of the information available assumes that we are doctors and isn't really put into terms that the typical person can understand.  Some information is missing too, like how nasal steroids can cause dependence and shouldn't be used for more than a week or two.  These spurts of missing information can lead to very misinformed decisions.  I feel like the medical community could provide better resources.
0.788900	I think I have the ability to understand all of the basic health information that I am provided, and to use that information to make decisions about my health. I also have the full capacity to understand the various health services offered. 
0.883300	I have been thru enough doctor and gospel visits that I can surely read and comprehend everything in the paper work and when speaking to a healthcare specialist
0.838900	It is fairly easy for me to understand what is going on with my health. I subscribe to my hospital and physicians' online service which supplies me with results of lab tests, clinic notes, and appointments. I have learned to navigate this online service fairly well. My biggest complaint is that some of my doctors don't adequately use the system so I still have to contact their offices for simple or routine matters.
0.838900	I feel, I understand most of the medical information I am given. If I do not I either ask the appropriate professional (Doctor, Nurse, Pharmacist, etc.) or I use a reputable website such WebMD.
0.744400	I think I am capable but hesitant when it comes to gathering health information. I can definitely do it but I am unsure because of the frequency in which I actually make use of certain information.
0.833300	I think I have full capacity for to make these decisions. I am also confident in my  judgement for knowing what I don't know and identifying whether or not it is important to learn/seek more information.
0.866700	I have a pretty good understanding.  I have studied anatomy and physiology and my mother works in a medical field so I have someone to call if I have questions.
0.866700	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I will not approve of services that I don't fully understand the reason for or fully agree with the risks. i.e.risk vs. benefit
0.866700	I have very good nurses and doctors that are always willing to help and answer any questions. Our insurance also provides us with a nurses hotline if we need to ask any questions. When I fill prescriptions the pharmacists are always very helpful and make sure I understand everything. I also have several nurse friends that are always willing to answer any questions. 
0.800000	I think that I have the ability to gain the knowledge that I need about my health. My personal issue is that I am shy and I don't like bothering anyone with my problems, which extends on to speaking with doctors.
0.888900	I feel good about receiving and looking for any health information that is given to me. If I have been diagnosed with something, I always ask as many questions as possible as well as looking up information on the Internet and library. 
0.566700	I have the basic understanding of medical services. Most times if I need help to understand something I ask a family member or I go on  the internet. I live by myself so I usually call a family member with my questions. I find that the internet is really helpful with my meds and diagnosis that I have received.  Online it is really easy to understand. The only problem with that is that there's a lot of information on the web and it can get confusing sometimes. So mostly I will ask my family members or the doctor.
0.794400	I have a degree in kinesiology - an above-average knowledge of anatomy and physiology - and I still sometimes get lost in what doctors are trying to get at. I think sometimes doctors oversimplify in an effort to connect to patients and miss out on key words and important information. 
0.594400	I feel confident in understanding basic health information, but when the information presented is more complicated I tend to reach out to my mother who works in the medical field. 
0.661100	I feel to some extent that I comprehend the information that they relay to me, however some medical terms are hard to follow, so I most of the time would do online research after leaving the appointment, I also google any prescribed medications so that way i'm well aware of what the side effects or outcome will be. Once I feel comfortable with the treatment prescribed then I will follow the recommended doses information.
0.661100	I prefer to talk about my health issues, concerns, problems with my husband. Often he sees things in a different light and his input helps me see all of my options and understand things better. I do feel I am capable of making any decision on my own but I'm more comfortable talking things over with my husband.
0.900000	I am responsible for taking care of the healthcare needs of myself and my kids. I have become capable of making any and all decisions. Anything the Dr. may mention or diagnoses I see on forms I receive, I will go out and google to get information on what may have caused it or what other recommendations for treatments might be offered other than those offered by my physician. I take care of my kids' needs and I am not afraid to ask questions when it comes to their health. There have even been times where I can't make it to their visits with them, but I am on the phone when the Dr. is talking to them and directing them to ask questions so that I feel I'm fully informed.
0.900000	I am quite confident that I can understand many aspects of medical terminology. I rarely have problems when speaking to doctors, nurses or medical staff and have never had a problem filling out forms.
0.861100	I'm positive I can obtain and understand basic health information. I'm a medical assistant, it's my job to have a basic understanding of human health and to ensure that our patients have an in depth understanding of their own health issues.
0.544400	I feel that the degree is difficult. I think most information is presented in a manner mentioned to confuse patients about what the real cost involved are.
0.705600	I feel like I understand most of the processes and information regarding my health. There are times that I don't completely understand, but I have my mom help me with those instances. I have a rare illness, so sometimes it's complicated to answer certain questions just due to the severity of my illness and the fact that my illness isn't completely understood by medical professionals.
0.861100	Filling out forms and explaining symptoms and circumstances are not a problem. I only ask basic questions when it comes to medical visits. As a fast paced person, I do not ask extra questions.

0.916700	"obtain 10/10, I can research or ask them if I can't find it online; process 10/10, like I said, I can search texts for relevant information; understand 10/10, with the caveat that if it's the actual science it'll take a lot longer than if it's just ""treatment x versus treatment y"" type stuff"
0.888900	I can understand whatever the doctor tells me, whether spoken or written, If I need to I can research further online later. But a lot of that depends on the doctor too, some doctors explain things well, others just kind of assume you already know.
0.866700	I think I have a pretty good ability to process health information. Most importantly, I am not hesitant to ask questions. I go in to a lot of appointments having done research online beforehand, so I am typically prepared with several questions already in hand. Once the health professional gives me more and/or better information, I repeat it back to them in simpler terms to make sure I've understood correctly. With online resources, a close family, helpful friends and quality insurance provider who gives me access to good doctors, I feel like I have the ability to obtain knowledge and support pretty easily before making any health decisions.

0.827800	I believe I can easily understand general and common medical terms and I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision. I usually seek for a second opinion or wait on exams before making any decisions pertaining my health or procedures I agree upon. I am very prone to do extra research should any health issues appear and try to gather all the information I can and bring all questions to a doctor, although it mesmerizes me the lack in tests and exams I see in the health industry, most diagnostics are given based on symptoms and not exams. 
0.727800	Health information is so important that sometimes it may be overthought of something too simple. However, in most cases there are times where I do need help in regards to medical forms that need to be filled out of have questions for the doctor. therefore, a lot of questions that can be given in a written format may require too much of a distinct jargon that couldn't be understand.

0.555600	At times it becomes difficult to understand what is wrong with me and I need multiple explanations to try understand what to do and where to go from there.I feel like I can understand what is happening but only at the bare minimum since I get lost at times when the doctor explains in an understanding where I have no clue what is happening so I need explanations that I can understand. At times I don't have everything to make a health decision.

0.733300	I feel that when I have the time to discuss my health with a doctor or nurse that I can generally understand the information they are giving me.  Sometimes, when time is a factor and I have been given written information, that information is not always clear.  In those instances, it can be confusing and difficult to get a hold of someone to answer my questions.
0.888900	"I have no problem understanding health information that is given to me.  The problem is when doctors are more concerned with a ""treat and street"" philosophy merely going through the motions to check off boxes for insurance companies than actually LISTENING to patients and taking the time to ask the questions that need to be answered in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.  Patients often do not know that a symptom is just that so when a doctor fails to asks the right questions there will likely not be an accurate diagnosis.  Another issue is when a doctor blatantly ignores my questions.  How many ways to I have to ask the most basic question of what does this diagnosis mean?  More often than not it's just easier to go home and search webmd or the Mayo Clinic website.  Problem with that is I generally end up with even more unanswered questions.  Ultimately I am quite capable of understanding information when it is provided and if my questions are answered with more than a couple of words.  (The correct answer to ""what does the thyroid do?"" is NOT ""Pep"" and after a look of disbelief ""You know, energy"")"

0.788900	"I feel pretty educated on my health conditions and feel confident in my doctors.  However, there are times when I still don't feel I have all the information I need to make health decisions.  Often, doctors are unable to ""dumb down"" language to the point where a lay person could understand.  Additionally, I feel that my time with doctors is limited.  I rarely feel that I have had as much time as I wanted.  Insurance forms are also very difficult to understand.  I almost feel like I need to have a lawyer look over everything!  Often the receptionists do not seem educated in health language."
0.800000	I was a certified CNA at one point and have worked in the healthcare industry for several years. I have a high capacity to understand basic healh information to make health decisions for myself. I will always ask doctors to explain anything I do not understand until I can understand it fully.

0.711100	I am a visual learner, yes, but I have more than enough competency to ask and re-ask questions that I need until I have information that is not only useful but coherent. I will read instructions and carefully write myself notes so I don't forget anything.

0.777800	I feel I can get all information I need and understand instructions. The problem area that I usually have is when it comes to insurance papers. Luckily I have a sister that works in the insurance dept. of our local clinic and am able to get help from her. I often think of what the poor people do that don't have access to someone like that and what I would do if she wasn't there to help.
0.883300	I'm a senior citizen now I'm told. I'm 63 years old. I have always tried to make sure I communicate with my doctor, dentist, etc regarding anything to do with my health. I do ask questions or I call, or e-mail people to explain things to me. I also do this for my husband who is 69 years old. Since he signed up for Medicare I had to make many phone calls to understand different things. 
0.561100	Reducing hospital load, meeting better needs of medical examination and treatment of people is an important target has been set by the Ministry of Health for many years. To realize this problem, the Ministry is focusing on combining many solutions on health financing mechanisms and policies. In particular, solutions to mobilize resources from the society to invest in facilities, equipment, cooperation on management, improve the quality of the health system is expected to bring efficiency positive.
0.744400	I feel I have a pretty good capacity. I am too shy to ask the questions I should of my provider. And I rarely share all of my concerns with my  psychiatrist because if I do he'll probably have me change my medications or increase my visits. And I don't give my general practitioner all the info she needs to help me as it may cause more tests or drugs.
0.916700	When I go into the doctors, I always have a list of questions that I need to have answered and hopefully I can come up with more if I am very concerned about the condition. Most of the doctors or nurses that I have encountered have been very helpful and open to answering all my questions and relieving any concern that I did have. I have taken health courses and do have a general idea of what is going on. Also, I try to do as much research as possible before an appointment so I don't go in there completely naÃ¯ve to the condition. 
0.850000	I believe I have a huge capacity to understand basic health related information. I have worked in the health care field since I was 15 years old and have had many hours of training in medical terminology. I enjoy health related topics and understanding human anatomy. Itâs a passion to heal people.
0.772200	I feel strongly that one, due to the get them in and out in 15 minutes has to often go to outside sources to help with their own health care. It often takes longer to fill out forms pre doc visit than the time that is spent with a person and that they only glance at the forms. Thankfully there is google and many other seach engines and websites and forums where one can practically, at least with simple maladies, get all the information they need.  I feel personal I have the capacity, I feel strongly that doctors and nurses do not take the time to explain as they should. 
0.700000	I think my only concern is the way that technical terms are explained to the patients, since they don't know educationally

0.794400	I feel that I normally comprehend about 90% of the information that is given to me, however, there have been occasions that I've had questions about drug interactions that I found difficult to get direct answers about.
0.883300	Between google scholar and the amount of time I spend reading about health and medicine I feel fairly confident that I know what the doctor is talking about, and when I don't, that I have the base knowledge to ask the right questions. 
0.827800	My doctor is very good at taking her time and explaining things. My family is in a few health occupations and explain a lot to me too. I read about staying healthy.
0.883300	I believe that I am capable and qualified to understand basic health information and services needed and to make appropriate health decisions because I have a scientific and medical background which has familiarized me with a variety of medical concepts and terminology. My familiarity with medical concepts comes from my undergraduate degree in biochemistry as well as my prior professional employment in the pharmaceutical industry.

0.883300	I think I'm pretty good at understanding things. I usually repeat the information back to health professionals in my own words so they can correct me if I haven't gotten it right. I read written information provided by hospitals or doctor offices; I don't always read all the prescription fine print. When I'm back home, I look online (usually WebMD) and read up on topics that were raised.
0.916700	"I have had to learn to advocate for myself with all healthcare people and specialists. About a fourth of those people are apathetic, overworked, inattentive, abusive and/or neglectful. I realized a long time ago that they mostly guess ""conditions"" without proper testing. I have been given ""band-aid"" medicine for decades and much of that medication has caused me further harm. I will no longer take anything without further testing and more proof that it will actually improve my quality of life. "
0.916700	I feel that I am fully capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and the services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  
0.900000	I feel I understand the majority of the information given to me by my providers. I have studied in the medical field and therefore already know the basics and a lot of speciality information. The information that I have trouble with or know nothing about I know to ask my provider to fully explain and tell me what values are suggested for lab/image results if a part of the diagnosis.
0.633300	I am somewhat familiar with health terms and can pretty much figure out health related material on my own. If there is a term I don't understand, I ask a professional.
0.900000	I understand my medical history and my doctor has taken the necessary time to discuss it with me.  I am a member of a good health group and can also find a lot of information on the website.
0.916700	I feel that I have a great capacity to understand basic health information that is provided to me. I'm also a fairly healthy individual so I don't often find myself needing information given to me in the first place.
0.900000	I feel most confident regarding my healthcare and health conditions. I worked in the field of medical care for over ten years and had the privilege of working with many great physicians and nurses. I have a good understanding of medical terms and feel comfortable with reading medically focused materials, including conditions or diagnoses that I may be faced with.
0.900000	I feel highly confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. If I ever have any questions, I make sure to ask either a health professional, someone who has personal experience with what I am inquiring about, or check online for further explanations/information. I have a personal interest in health care (i.e., taking proper care of myself and others as well as attempting to understand things that I may hear about and could be something of use in the future). Both my father and brother work in the medical field and I actively listen(ed) when they share what they know. My educational background is primarily in Psychology, but I have taken a few medical courses as well. I feel that having a good understanding of how the human body works is important and know that, if something is ever slightly difficult to understand on my own, I can find answers somewhere.
0.900000	I feel that I have a high degree of confidence in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic healthy information and services I need to make appropriate health decision.
0.833300	I feel I have enough experience with going to many  Doctors that I can get most of the information that I need to determine what is the best way to approach the medical situation.
0.916700	I believe at this point in time, health information is there if you are willing to seek it out. The web is ever expanding in regards to the information available, health provider apps are becoming more robust, and I happen to work at a call center (Carenet) that works to fill gaps in the consumer healthcare experience through providing various health provider services. However, for most people, I believe they are somewhat in the dark. The doctor's offices I've always been too do a terrible job of providing knowledge unless it's a doctor trying to prove they know the jargon. Clerical staff usually seem to avoid customers at any cost and ironically have terrible customer service (for the most part). Most offices have the same 30 year old graphics of the inner ear workings alongside  numerous posters advertising designer drugs. It'd be nicer if doctors offices were part medical care, part personal medical library. Plus, nobody really likes to reach out for health/insurance related information. I think it takes the external people who have a stake in that persons health (insurance providers) reaching out with info and care plans.
0.750000	I feel for the most part that I am intelligent enough to grasp basic health concepts and am able to make choices based on the information provided.  If any concepts are above my head I am able to communicate that and confirm what are the facts.
0.733300	I believe in listening to what my doctor tells me about my health. When I don't understand the information I'm given, I ask for it to be explained until I get it.  I like to know what type of medicine to buy, what to eat, what not to eat, what I should be doing for my health. Also the internet helps a lot, if I need more clarification on something I research it more and get more information
0.777800	I have access to many resources to be able to make health decisions. Those resources include doctors, nurses, medical books, and the internet.
0.783300	I have a severe traumatic brain injury and get a fair amount of mental health treatment.  I don't necessarily understand all of the information I am presented, but I always have someone that can explain things to me.  Either the doctors or an aide that helps me with handling everyday tasks.
0.916700	I think my ability to understand and comprehend medical terminology when it comes to reading medical information given to me by a doctor is sufficient.  The majority of times  I get information from a doctor though it may have some medical terminology most of the information is easy to comprehend.  This is what gives me the confidence to say that I can be able to understand most of what the doctor writes me in a medical form.
0.772200	Are usually donât have any issues when it comes to reading information documents reports that concerning my medical issues it is pretty much easily comprehendible and usually thereâs always somebody on standby you call his ass questions
0.888900	I am pretty confident with reading medical materials I constantly freeze proof read every documents and ask a lot of questions anything I don't understand I always Google it
0.672200	I feel that I have the intellectual capacity to comprehend what I'm told.  The problem is that both I and the medical professionals I'm speaking with are working with a time limit that does not allow for an actual question-and-answer session or a real mutual understanding.
0.827800	I feel that with the internet and the ability to call my hospital with any questions, I have quite amount of information in order to make appropriate health decisions
0.677800	I am very in-tune with my own physical and mental health, and when I believe there is an issue I need to discuss with a doctor I seek out the appropriate resources. The internet is a wonderful tool to research different things and determine the right questions to ask. I also work in the medical field so I understand the logic and reasoning of doctors. So when I am told something about my own health, and if I don't understand any aspect of what I'm told, I know to ask them t explain in a different way until I can make an informed decision.
0.900000	I think I have a pretty good understanding of many conditions, especially those that I am dealing with. I have diagnosed myself long before a doctor could. I enjoy learning about medicine and feel confident in my decision making.
0.916700	I feel confident that I can obtain, process and understand all the basic health information to make the appropriate health decisions. And if I do not understand something then I would ask my doctor.
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to completely understand and process basic health information. I always ask doctors relevant questions during medical appointments. If I donât understand something I always ask the doctor to explain the material until I do understand. If I were to go to a doctor that didnât thoroughly explain things then I would discontinue services with that doctor and find a new one. 
0.755600	"Yes, because there is this thing called Google.com. Google.com is a search engine that allows anybody to have the world's knowledge at the tip of their finger. You can search for ""How to walk your dog?"" to ""How to implement brain surgery?""."
0.788900	I do a lot of research online usually before I see the doctor. I am sensible about it though and just use the information so when I talk to the doctor I know what they are talking about usually. I think medicine is very interesting but I do have an anxiety disorder that prevents me from seeking all the proper care I need. I generally understand what I am told and if I don't I usually ask or research it later. 
0.850000	I do research ahead of time so I can try to ask the best questions. I have good enough mental fortitude to process the information given to me and ask the right follow-up questions. I can think about things afterwards to help me best.
0.794400	I do feel that i have the ability to read, understand and process all basic health information that any doctor or nurse may give me or anyone i know. If there is something that i dont fully understand, i will ask them for some more information and any other questions related to whatever they are trying to explain to me. If i need or want more information after my visit, i would then google it and do my own research. 
0.805600	I feel as though it's completely in my control in how I obtain and understand my health information and the services provided to me. I don't have any issue asking for help and if I don't understand something I'm not afraid to admit it and ask for an easier explanation in terms I can fully understand.
0.616700	Sometimes I feel like I do not understand some of the documents given to me. They might ask things that I am not sure how to answer or if I am making the right decision. For example, if the doctor gives me a document about a vaccine he is recommending then I like to have someone look over it with me and I like to look up information about it instead of giving an immediate answer by myself. Other times, I completely understand the information given to me and I can make an immediate answer without hesitation. 
0.883300	I feel like I have basic general knowledge about medical needs.  If I have questions and need additional information, I will either ask my doctor or nurse, or look up the information online.  Normally I can find out the information easily and without much issue.
0.916700	I think that I have the capacity to understand any of the basic and non basic health information from any of the services and am able to make good decisions also.

0.844444	I am able to process and understand basic health information with minimal problems.  I believe that I am able to comprehend everything that is needed to understand when a doctor or nurse explains something to me.

0.916667	I am the type that pays extremely close attention to my medical needs. I am always totally prepared whenever I visit a health care professional. I always have a list of medications, a list of tests and vaccinations, a detailed written description of recent concerns, and all necessary ID's and insurance cards. I always ask relevant questions about my health and treatments. I have several medical app.'s on my smart phone including Web Md. 
0.811111	I, of sound mind and body, am capable of filling out my own forms. I could use help in translating doctors vernacular.

They can be VERY difficult to comprehend sometimes but other times they can be very simple. I would say it's hit or miss, but I'd say more times than not I get confused or have to ask for help in order to fill out a form.

0.800000	I feel that I am more comfortable receiving information than giving it sometimes. Sometimes it can be hard for me to word things how I think about them and to make sure I'm coming across how I want to, but I'm generally good at understanding health professionals and their instructions.
0.900000	I use to work at a hospital and I took medical terminology , so I just about know what to ask when in doubt and if its something that I don't understand I ask. Then I will go home and research it for myself.

I have two RN's and a medical assistant in my family
0.661111	it depends on my medical condition and the information that I am reading. It depends on how long I have had the condition. I am a very long term chronic insomniac and am almost an expert on insomnia but when it comes to my spinal stenosis, that is another situation.  
0.900000	I feel I have full capacity to process basic health information and to make decisions appropriate for me.

Sometimes the nurse calls. When I see her she rushes me out of her office because my insurance only pays so much which I think stinks, but i don't blame her. If I have a question I get a better response from the RN assistant. It takes forever to get a referral done. 
0.800000	I think for the most part I understand what doctors tell me. The problem is that most doctors either dismiss what you say, or they're in a rush to get out of the room. I feel that most doctors see us as a number, instead of a patient, and communication gets broken.

0.588889	It seems as of the doctor's do not talk to the patient so that they can understand what they are talking about. It would be nice if they would speak to the patient in terms that the patient can understand.

0.550000	They give potential job applicants a sense of whether they should apply for the job. The clearer you can be about the requirements, duties, and responsibilities of the job and what kind of person you're looking for, and the better you can represent these in your advertising for the job, the less time you'll have to spend reading applications from inappropriate candidates. The act of developing job descriptions and selection criteria forces you to clarify your thinking about the position, the kind of person you want for it, and the organization itself. Organizations often have to include job descriptions in proposals for new programs or positions. Sometimes, the act of composing the job description changes the whole course of the proposal, as people realize that they can use a position in ways they hadn't considered, or that what they had originally conceived was, in fact, unworkable. A job description can sometimes serve to define a whole program.

0.672222	I mostly do, I'm just not good at asking doctors questions or speaking up about my conditions. It's hard to talk to people in positions of authority, and sometimes it feels like they don't listen when I do talk. I can generally fill out forms on my own without needing help, unless they contain a lot of complicated jargon.
0.522222	i feel like i always ask the right questions and they always give me the right answers they are always nice about it never mean or inpatient
0.761111	There are often things that I feel need further information about.  I come home and read over the medical terms on the computer.  If there is something I need clarified I contact the doctor's office and tell them my concerns.  My family doctor is a wonderful person who often calls me out of the blue to just review my chart and send me for tests he thinks will be helpful.  My daughter also is a help and records whatever is said during the appt. so we can review it at home. My church also has volunteers to help in this manner.

0.650000	I let the health professionals explain the condition to me . If I have any questions I will ask them at the appointment. When I go home I process what they told me and if I need to mske another apt I do so and ask them to calify and issue I have 
0.811111	I am fairly certain I can understand and process most information I am given about my health and the decisions that need to be made for my health. I provided care for my diabetic father, his mother who had cancer, and my mother who had COPD, diabetes, and cancer.
0.644444	I do very well understand most of everything that is told too me. When I don't I ask and if I still don't i look it up,
0.916667	Always am able to ask and understand health issues or to ask for clarification from the doctor. This is not an issue for me.

0.900000	I am very confident when I am given information in print. Understanding or remembering oral information can be more difficult and the person giving the information may leave something out, but I still hear well and understand.
0.900000	My wife was an RN and I was involved as her caregiver for over a year and a half.  Measured doses and administered her medications as directed bv her Dr. or NP.  Been on my own for over 2 hears and have had some medical problems I had to take care of on my own.

0.672222	I can answer the basic health need questions that are asked if its in multiple choice or given a list of what they want to know.. most of the time i only have problems when it comes to the family history part and what all kind of illnesses my family has had
0.833333	I feel that often times it's easier to read the information that the doctor's office gives you, than it is to hear a doctor talk about it.  Oftentimesâ doctor's tend to use very technical terms that most people cannot understand.
0.916667	i feel extremely confident in my ability to comprehend things that im told in a healthcare or hospital setting

0.811111	I can almost fully understand what the nurse or doctor says to me. if i don't then i ask them to word it simpler to me.
0.494444	It depends on what they are saying.  Some times they speak with you, some times they speak at you.  The doctors some times look you in the eye, and some times they do not.  Some times the doctors are compassionate and give you the time that you need, some times the doctor's offer advice, but most of the time they give you a script and send you on your way. Once in a while a doctor will listen to you, understand how you are feeling and send you off to another doctor.  This doctor will some times give you the amount of time that you need, give you another script, as well as give you another appointment. Now you are seeing two doctor's, the original doctor who referred you to the second doctor - making certain that you are happy with the referral doctor, and then you go back to the referral doctor for treatment.

0.833333	I feel for the most part I have a good enough understanding of the medical terminology involved in my medical issues and I don't normally need help with certain terminology but sometimes I do and usually I can find the answers on my own fairly quickly or I will ask a loved one that I know has had experience with whatever it is I may be filling out.
0.900000	I understand my health quite well I do not need any help understanding any issues that may arise with my health I understand my doctors instructions and any diagnosis that may be given
0.855556	In my experience, my doctors have always explained things in a way that I have understood. There was only one time back in 2012 when I had to get a minor surgery that I had to look into my options and the process. It wasn't that my doctor wouldn't have been willing to explain it better had I asked, it was that I wanted to hear from people who been through it.

0.672222	I feel like I have the capacity, but that it would take a lot of work. Usually people seem too busy to just offer some help, and seem inconvenienced by the interruption. If I really needed it, I would bother them. But my default is to try alone.
