Dentist would tell me to not do one of the those ""crazy"" grape diets. Yet that style of eating is the ONLY that reverses extreme acidosis in people.

I was starting to experience a lot of odd symptoms like dry brittle hair, constipation, dry skin and being cold all the time.

1.000000	That is really hard.  I have torn the ligaments in my ankle several times throughout my life.  So after it happening a time or two, every subsequent time I know right away when it happened, I could just tell the way it felt and I could differentiate between that and just a sprain. I have taken first aid training a couple of times.  
0.857100	I have studied different foods and vitamins that are beneficial for my body. At one time I had high cholesterol.

0.642900	When I was a teeger my Mother cut her hand while cooking. I immediately found something to make a tourniquet to stop the bleeding and we got her to the emergency right away.

This demonstrated that I had knowledge that I had learned in first aid.
0.642900	A few years ago a friend of mine had a really bad boil. I had experience with draining and getting rid of boils. So I showed him how to drain it and it went away.
0.857100	I would say every time I get a cold or the flu(rare) that I demonstrate my knowledge of health issues. I actually try to avoid taking any medicines unless its necessary. I think the foods we eat play an important role in our health. So when I do get sick I know that my body needs lots of rest and fluids. I'll take some time off when this happens and I'll get lots of bed rest. I have a juicer and a Vitamix and I'll make lots of fruit and veggie juices to beat the cold.

We were talking about how the medical community has recommended low-fat, high carbohydrate diets for patients with heart problems or at risk for heart attacks for the past 45 years or so, but the evidence that this diet has been effective for reducing heart problems (or for losing weight, for that matter) is poor. They agreed with me, and we further discussed how cutting out sugar and reducing your carbohydrate intake while increasing dietary fat is likely to be the most healthy diet.
0.928600	I am triage/first aid certified, and on one occasion I was able to help someone who was had been in a car accident.  They were in shock and bleeding and had broken their leg.

0.857100	My husband had to have major surgery a few years ago.  He was in the hospital twice for a week each time.  I studied up on all the factors around his illness, and how to help him recover when he got home.  The doctors were very helpful and caring.

0.714300	I had a burning sensation in my esophagus that lasted for days.  I called my (then) doctor.  He prescribed me something over the phone without seeing me and said it would be ready at the drug store. When I went to the drug store, there was nothing there.  I trusted my instincts, did the research on the medicine he was about to prescribe (which I would have had to take consistently for GERD).  I looked up tural altertives to this problem.  I had arugula salads, and 100% pure aloe vera juice, and the problem was gone in a day, forever. Things like this is why I don't trust doctors entirely.
0.857100	Nothing in particular, just life experience.
1.000000	Understanding that high TG was due to my intake of sugar, decreasing my intake of sugar by avoiding soft drinks and switching to black coffee, resulting in a 60% drop in my TG and a lowering of my blood pressure.
1.000000	When I gave birth to my second child, I felt I had a much better understanding of newborns and what sort of conditions might crop up. When the doctor told me he had high bilirubin numbers and was slightly jaundiced, I didn't get upset like I did with my first son, because I knew that this was a common occurrence that rarely turned out to be serious. I was able to understand what the doctor was telling me and able to enjoy my son's first few days instead of stressing out.
0.714300	I have basic understanding of medical knowledge of simple diagnoses. Plus I can use my common sense to calculate the rest.

1.000000	I suppose having had the flu throughout my childhood has shown me when I should panic, or when it is just general symptoms of the flu.

Altertely if the symptoms were different or more severe that I'm used to, it would be indicative that maybe I should look further into it, and perhaps seek medical professiol assistance.
1.000000	A friend had been given antibiotic eye drops for her son's pink eye. She told me that in the past they had worked well, but this time they were not working as quickly.

0.928600	While I have my own health issues, my husband has even more of them. And since he's a bit less capable of taking care of everything himself, I am the one who takes care of coorditing a lot of his healthcare. This means compiling information for new doctors, doing paperwork, and giving information. This experience has given me the insight (generally) to know what kind of information is important to a doctor.
0.785700	As a child I had sinus and ear infections almost monthly which led me to doctor visits very often. I believe I kept getting them because they over prescribed me antibiotics and lowered their effectiveness. Since I have been on my own I have never been to a doctor once.

Taking tests in those classes helped me to remember and establish the things I've learned through those classes, especially when I had to do research papers for those classes. It was my freshman year of high school, and I didn't save the work I was doing for much longer after the school year was over (my laptop at the time broke down by the time I went into college anyways), so I can't recall it exactly now, but I remember acing the course.

My doctor refused to do a hysterectomy at age 42 on me (although I already had two children and was divorced and not looking to have any more children).  I had to go to another doctor and they found I had 15 cysts in my uterus and did a hysterectomy for me.  So getting a second opinion really helped me.
0.500000	When I was having chest pains, I knew it was because of the birth control pill. Because birth control can cause you to be prone to blood clots, which is a early symptom.
1.000000	I went to the beach with my best friend.  He flatly refused to use sunscreen, despite my advice that he do so.  He ended up with a bad sunburn, while I, who used sunscreen, did not.  
0.857100	I demonstrated knowledge of health issues when I identified symptoms I was feeling as needing medical attention.

1.000000	I don't really have much knowledge. My mind runs away with everything and makes me think symptoms are more serious than they really are. So over the years I've learned to deal with that. I suppose that's my best answer. Whenever my heart skips a beat or I get chest pains I've now learned to ignore them and that's it's just my anxiety. Problem is what if it isn't? I just hope if and when it is more serious that I'll be able to tell the difference. But as far as medical knowledge goes I have very little. The use the internet which is my best friend and my worst enemy at those times LOL.

I then ran out of the car to the closest store and screamed for them to call 911 for an ambulance because my dad was having a massive heart attack.  I then got back to the car, tried to get his arms raised and undid his tie.  He couldn't respond and was having major difficulty breathing and I made sure he hadn't swallowed his tongue and gave him mouth to mouth until the ambulance came.  He did die later on that night despite everything that was attempted to save him.

Recently, a friend began complaining of similar symptoms. I ran through all my previous experiences with her and she headed off to get it checked. Sure enough, she had gallstones. I'm no doctor, but was glad my experience could help someone else. "

0.928600	I was never stupid enough to try to evaluate myself. I always let the doctor diagnose me even if I thought I knew what was wrong with me.
1.000000	I went for a testicular cancer test, and they used a sonogram to look for lumps. They said that I had a lot of weird veins and arteries down there, so that's what was feeling lumpy, and I shouldn't worry too much because it wasn't cancer.

1.000000	One day in the shower, I felt a lump in my breast.  I knew that my mother and grandmother had cystic breasts and that a cyst feels round and soft compared to cancer which can feel more irregular and hard.

0.928600	I had for years digestive issues and a sour taste in my mouth in the mornings. I also seemed to have a slight cough. I pretty much knew it was GERD, but held off for years going to the doctor for it. When it got unmageable and filly went through the tests, I was correct in my thinking.
0.785700	I had a dog who was dying of heart failure. He was on lasix and something else for a year. He slowly declined until he could no longer get around. He could only have so much lasix or his kidneys would shut down, too little and he would swell with fluid. Less than a year from that. The exact same thing happened to my grandfather. So I knew the stages that would be happening to him because of the dog's issue. Lo and behold he lived a year just like the dog and passed away the same way as the dog.

I was blessed to be able to get to go to a doctor that prescribed me Suboxone (new medication treatment for heroin addiction) and because I did a lot of research on treatments for my particular issue, I knew to alert the doctor that I did have Hep C because the ""blocking agent"" in the Suboxone (keeps you from being able to experience euphoria from opiates besides the buprenorphine in the Suboxone), the loxone, has reportedly effected liver function in some people. Now the doctor is going to watch my blood labs to see whether or not I can stay on the current medicine or if I need to switch to a similar version of the drug that does not have the loxone in it."

The doctor said i was right and calmed my family the immediate concern was the infection and the heart.   
0.642900	The research I did on my own issues and the books I read. I looked at WebMD, Wikipedia (even though it's not secure), and other sites. I even took an atomy course where we picked a disease relevant to the chapter and wrote a short discussion board post about it.
1.000000	On one of my doctor's visit, the appointment had to end early because of an emergency.

0.857100	I had a liver disease issue. I looked up information on the matter. I became knowledgeable. I discussed the matter with my doctor in an informed manner.

As a result of being told this, I would not allow my children to flush the toilet until they were past the age of 10 so I could check their stools each time they went. If they had a loose stool, I varied their diet. If their stool appeared hard, I varied their diet. Also, when they had too much energy, rather than assume they needed medication, I had them exercise - it worked every time. And one other instance, my younger son was slow to talk. An in-law suggested something was wrong. I explained he had no problem communicating what he wanted or needed and, thus, nothing was wrong. I was right; she was wrong.

0.928600	My mom went to the ER thinking that she was having a heart attack or at the very least heart problems.  I accompanied her to the hospital although I told her her symptoms were not necessarily heart related and that she really just needed to relax and work on stress reduction.  The doctors agreed with me but went ahead and performed heart stress test.  There was nothing found.
0.785700	I've taken a few atomy classes in college. Besides that, I don't have too much experience.  
0.571400	When my aunt was experiencing lymphedema, fatigue and body pain I knew that she was experiencing blockages of her lymphatic system and that she should see a doctor. As it turns out she had metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes.
0.428600	When my younger son was sick I remember taking him to the emergency room when he was a baby. He had a fever of 103 and it scared me! I was told that if his temperature went above 104 than to bring him in, other wise I didn't need to. So now if he has a fever I alterte Tylenol and Ibuprofen. 
1.000000	I interned at a cancer research center where I read a lot of documents on health/medical issues.
0.571400	I have worked with children for over 15 years.... In that time I have seen many many cases of teething, ear infections, and even hand foot and mouth. I can spot these symptoms and many times I have told a parent I thought a child had hand foot and mouth in the very early stages and they do have it after seen by a doctor . I am also great with ear infections after my years with kids, if a kiddo is teething and fussier then normal and the parents are worried about ear infections I tell them to wait since there in not a runny nose.
0.857100	I have asthma. When I was about 15 someone explained that my difficulty breathing was due to too much air in my lungs, not as it seemed, too little. I used this information to train myself to breathe in more shallowly and breathe out more completely. It seems to help when it gets bad.
0.428600	Like I wrote before... my wife was diagnosed with cervical cancer and we both fought that diseases....  I was on a phone call with all kind of specialists, doctors and technicians...  we got some more experience than we wanted. 
1.000000	"A few weeks ago, my brother hit his head at work. He'd had several mild concussions as a child and pretty much self-diagnosed himself as having another one this time. (Yes, that's wildly irresponsible. Yes, he should have gone to the doctor. You know what, tell it to fucking Nikki Haley because it's her fault he's not insured.) He did some research about concussion and painkillers and said he needed to take something other than Excedrin, preferably Tylenol. He was pretty upset because we didn't have any Tylenol and his head hurt. So I realized that often, different me brands of the same medicine will have similar mes, and another painkiller that ended in ""ol"" might have the same active ingredient as Tylenol. I looked up the active ingredients online and checked the bottle to make sure, and then gave him a Midol from my supply. So most of the medical knowledge in that scerio came from him, but I was the one who realized that Midol would probably help and did the research to verify it."
0.928600	When my aunt was sick with cancer a few years ago, I read up about information from John Hopkins to see how I could help help and then told her about it and provided literature. It showed her how she could alleviate pain through a lot of methods that I persolly assisted her with, and later it her cancer went into recession, happily.
0.571400	I had to go get a mammogram so I researched online about it and learned stuff.
0.928600	As a teeger when I felt a pain in my right side I knew that I needed to get to my doctor as soon as possible, because it could have potentially been appendicitis. It turned out to be something different, but I knew enough to get to a doctor and have them give me an examition. 
0.928600	Someone had fallen at my place of work and was a pale yellow color and also was clutching his chest. I called 911 and had the people that were already on the floor with him trying to see if he's okay, to prop his head up and leave him still until emergency services arrived.
0.785700	When I had an abnormal papsmear, I knew it was possible that it was a false positive. I went through the extra testing and listened to everything the doctor told me and understood thoroughly the process.
0.500000	When my mother in law got sick with cancer she needed alot of support.  Since having going through it with my mom, I was able to tell her some of the things that she would possibly experience with chemo.  We were able to go to the store to get some things to make her comfortable throughout the process.
1.000000	My daughter frequently has rashes and I have taken her in a few times to have them checked out but they are just eczema. Now I am able to diagnose that myself. We also are able to handle small issues at home like colds and mild fevers with confidence.
1.000000	I guess any atomy exam I've taken would fit this since those literally involved demonstrating medical knowledge, but outside of school I guess the most fitting thing I can think of was when a friend of mine wasn't feeling well and wasn't sure his symptoms meant. I sussed out based on what he was experiencing that it was probably a UTI that was progressing towards the bladder and kidneys, and recommended he see a doctor immediately. It was indeed a bladder infection, and he was able to get effective treatment. I'm glad that my knowledge of that particular health condition helped, as he might not have sought treatment right away otherwise.
0.785700	I worked in a residential care facility for 11 years as a certified medical aide. It was my job to dispense medication according to doctor's orders, as well as provide medical care to patients who had medical procedures done like surgeries, for example. We also had clients who would have to do certain things to prepare them for the procedures, which usually included a list of doctors orders like fasting, colon cleansing, etc.
0.500000	I was having inflammation in my sweat glands and I researched what my symptoms were and I found out I actually had a skin disease and my doctor ended up diagnosing me with what i had found
0.857100	An experience that occurred that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues would be when my mother was telling my about some symptoms she was experiencing which raised some red flags.

0.857100	When my daughter fell and hurt her ankle, I was able to stabilize and care for her until we were able to get to a night time clinic for professiol care. The doctor on staff confirmed that I had provided the correct temporary care for her.
1.000000	I have some experience dealing with IBS which hasn't responded that well to conventiol treatment. I have been able to learn about ways to mitigate it without having to take drugs.
1.000000	I was sick with flu and stuck on work/travel.  I filly insisted home-time so I could rest, eat fruit, granola, yogurt, and take vitamin C.  I was better in less than a day after being sick for a week.
0.500000	I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol so I am familiar with medical terms and how they affect my life. I was a corrections officer in the infirmary and had several cases that I was able to help because of recognizing certain symptoms.

0.785700	I have  had issues with my teeth. due to that i have some knowlage or antibiots and pain killers.

0.857100	When my mother doted her kidney to my aunt, I feel like I learned a lot about medical issues. The entire family felt the need to educate ourselves on the issue. Overall, I feel like I became much more comfortable with the medical environment as a result.
0.642900	I had to take an MRI on my knees to look for problems. The nurse was trying to explain to me how it worked but I already knew how because I had read about them. 
1.000000	In the past, I have had kidney stones. During the emergency room visit, I was given an IV of an anti-inflammatory drug. I was also told to drink plenty of fluids and was forced to urite. I was able to successfully pass the stone.
0.571400	When I went to the doctor and I understood what he was saying without Leigh man's terms 
0.785700	I once was able to explain to my friend some of the details of childbirth. This only sticks out in my mind because they had no idea about the process at all. I also had a decent amount of details about the process. 
1.000000	
0.714300	When I needed emergency surgery after a twisted intestine due to gastric bypass I was able to follow along with what tests and procedure information my doctor was going to do and perform.
0.928600	My youngest daughter fell and she thought she broke her wrist. It was swollen but not deformed and she was able to move her hand and fingers. I iced it and waited a day and saw no bruising, so I assumed it was sprained and not broken. I guess I could have been wrong, but in this situation I was right. The swelling went down with ice and the pain was gone in a couple days.
0.142900	When I tried to eat salads
0.857100	My wife burnt her arm on the stove.  I put it under cool water and then applied aloe vera to it and bandages it.
0.714300	I recently had kidney stones again. I had them once before a year ago, and when I started having pain in my back I knew that it was most likely kidney stones. I went to the doctor and it took a while for them to do tests to find it but eventually they found the stone in my ureter. I was right about my diagnosis. 
0.928600	Strokes and high blood pressure run in the family. When my mother called and said her right eye vision was blocked like a curtain had been pulled down half way I knew we had to get her to the hospital quickly. She was having a TIA. She had many of them during her last 2 years alive. They usually lasted only minutes.
0.857100	A time that I demonstrated knowledge of health or medical issues in my life was when I was with my friend David. David suffers from diabetes and fainted when we were out walking the streets of shville. I was very aware of his condition and ran into the nearest restaurant and got orange juice. We rushed back to David and gave him the orange juice and some food and he was able to get oriented pretty quickly after that before checking his sugar and insulin levels. 
1.000000	I have given birth 4 times. Each experience was different and I had to know about what I needed to do in each situation. The options open to me for pain relief and how they could affect me and the baby. 
0.714300	A friend of mine was displaying all the symptoms of anxiety but didn't think anything was wrong, that it was just a rough patch she was going through. I helped her and showed her medical stuff that made her go to the doctor and get treatment. She's feeling much better now.
0.642900	
0.785700	When I was diagnosed with thyroid disease and the depression that is often related to the disease did not go away after being medicated and having normal results, I researched and found that I may need an addition medication to help with the absorption of the synthroid. I spoke with my doctor and he prescribed me the additiol medication to help me absorb the synthroid better. As a result, my depression did go away... which could have been due to my request...I also have had other chronic health issues that I am knowledgeable about only because I have been undergoing treatment for decades. I also noticed a friend having neurological side effects from long term haldol use. I told this friend that I thought he may have tardive dyskinesia which, as it turned out, he did...   Other than that I do not believe I have a great knowledge of health or medical issues.
0.857100	When I birthed my son, I took no preparation courses and I handled the birth well. I understood the progression of labor to delivery and knew what to expect without educating myself otherwise. 
0.500000	"An experience that demonstrated my knowledge was at my friends place. My friend's father complained about swelling on a bruise located on this kneecap. He apparently still believes in old methods of injuries and says that there is bad ""chi"" blocking. He would take a slipper to smack the bruise and this gives him relief. I was really shocked at this thinking and I had to stop him and explained that the swelling is because the vessels are damaged so the blood is clogged in the area which gives the swelling look. His solution should be massaging the area so the blood flows away."
1.000000	My daughter was stung by a wasp last August. We were celebrating my ex-wife's birthday with her when this happened, and she has a tendency to panic about things. I thought she was just comforting the little one upstairs, but when I went to check she was on the phone with 911 concerned about allergic reaction. It had been long enough that it was pretty clear our daughter wasn't going to have any kind of serious 911-warranting emergency reaction so I helped the operator convince her that she was overreacting and calm her down.
0.928600	I have a undergrad degree in human biological sciences. This degree is essentially a pre-med degree. 
0.857100	I enjoy reading articles on health from many sources. My mother is also a doctor and tends to explain things to me about medical issues. Even if I ask her a general question, she wants to give me much more information than I asked for.
0.714300	I got salmonella poisoning one time, I was very sick for 5 days. I filly took my temperature and it was at 105 degrees. I knew that anything above 104 could be deadly, so I arranged a ride to take me to the emergency room.

0.857100	I 'm not sure that I really have one. I am on medications for anxiety and depression. Before they figured out what worked for me, I went through a long list of medications that did not work, so in that sense, I was able to determine what worked for me. 
0.928600	I had bronchitis and was told to take a medication. I took it as instructed and the symptoms went away in about a week. But, I continued to take the rest of the medicine as instructed, despite feeling good.
0.928600	I cut my finger while working in the dirt. I had to keep working, but i knew mi finger would get infected if I did without taking care of it. So I washed it, cleaned it with peroxide, bandaged it then put a glove over my hand. It healed fine and never got infected
0.714300	When I was diagnosed with asthma, I had no idea what it was and it really tested my knowledge.
0.928600	I was able to help my mom choose the correct insulin when she was faced with a choice of switching medicine. I was able to help her read and understand the benefits and side effects of each drug.
0.857100	After a mammogram showed an area of question, I knew not to panic right away as there could be different reasons for this. Sure enough, after a follow up, it was shown to just be folded skin.
0.500000	Well one occassion where i was having severe headaches everyday for about a week without stopping i knew something was wrong. I went to the doctor and i already was hoping for them to do a head scan to see what was wrong. They showed me i had severe chronic migrane and i needed to start taking a few medications . I totally understood everything when it comes to my health and how much i know my body
0.785700	I went with a relative to the doctor for a medial emergency. The doctor made assumptions and gave them the wrong diagnosis. They began ordering all kinds of tests that were for the wrong things. I told them what to really check for based on the symptoms and I was correct. They canceled the tests and changed the diagnosis. 
1.000000	It's less a specific experience and more a general one; about ten years ago I generally felt awful: constant aches and pains, low energy, difficulty breathing, bad mood, poor concentration, frequently sick with colds and sinus infections. It didn't take a lot of knowledge to know what was wrong - I was out of shape, had a poor diet, smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol. I set out and learned a lot about nutrition and exercise, I quit smoking and drinking, and I put a plan in place to gradually change my lifestyle in a way that was sustaible. Today I'm in perfect health, happy, energetic, focused, and haven't so much as had a sniffle in over two years.
0.857100	A couple of years ago, I began to feel extremely anxious. This is a problem because it told me my anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medication was no longer doing its job. My doctor chose to make no adjustments. I knew, from being told by several different therapists, that eventually mental health medications can either stop working or bring your brain chemistry up to a level where it's no longer needed. That I might need off the medication or to be switched to a different one. My doc seemed uware of this. When I couldn't get the help I needed, I changed docs.
0.785700	I was a witnes of a car accident,two weeks ago. I stopped to look after the drivers and there were no bad injuries at first look.One of them was limping and complained about some pain in his leg.I told him to sit down ot lie down,while we were waiting for the ambulance.
0.642900	When I decided to get into shape. I did all my due diligence and learned the value of eating clean and exercising regularly. By learning to restrict my calories and exercising to create a caloric deficit. This not only helped me drop the pounds but helped with my asthma. 
0.785700	My wife had a tooth pulled and it would not stop bleeding. I told her to put a tea bag pver it and that would help stop the bleeding.
1.000000	When I was diagnosed with Trigemil Neuralgia, my neurologist was surprised to find that I actually knew what that was, and what the treatments for it were.  I had done some research prior to going in to see what could have been causing such terrible pain.  My research came up with the TN diagnosis.  However, I wanted a professiol's opinion before deciding with any certainty that TN was indeed what I had, or requesting treatment for it.
0.928600	When dealing with my children I have to fill out all there medical forms and deal with there illnesses or injuries.   I would say just having children you learn a lot by raising them about what is severe and not.  You know when the doctor needs to be called or visited.
0.857100	I can't say there has been an experience in my life that would demonstrate medical knowledge. 
0.857100	when i found a lump in my right chest  just below my nipple. I knew that breast cancer is rare for males, but not impossible. So i went to the DR. to find out what he thought. He fealt it was nothing major, but had tests done just to make sure, which i figured was likely when i went in.
0.857100	A few months ago my son had a sinus infection. After trying traditiol over the counter options we had little result and made a doctors appointment so that we could get an antibiotic. The doctor confirmed that it was a good idea to try to clear it up without antibiotics first, but that he would most likely need them at this point.
1.000000	I guess I would return to my earlier statement in that I am a mother who spent a lot of time dealing with everyone's health issues in my family. I have also taken care of helping my parents because they are aging and get confused. I wouldn't say that I feel completely comfortable with everything related to health decisions, but if I have questions, I ask and I also do a lot of research before I make decisions. I have had to do additiol testing in the past for health issues, and I felt comfortable with my choices after I dug deeply into the issues myself. Ultimately I am the one who wants to decide what happens to me, either good or bad.
0.642900	i was diagnosed with high colestoral, I was given Lipitor and took the drug as proscribed.  On the next vist to the doctor my colestoral was within acceptable limits
0.214300	I do not have much medical knowledge.
0.785700	Having gone to my first doctor who approved me for operation on my septum, felt the need to explain things to me about the process as well in simplistic terms and when I explained to him that I already knew it made him angry and then later refused to perform the operation on me by constantly pushing me back until I had to change medical carriers and could no longer get him to perform the surgery.
0.857100	A co-worker cut his leg at work one night and was bleeding like a stuck pig.  I got a flatbed cart and told the boss.  I ran with the cart to my co-worker, had him lie on the cart holding a towel to his leg to apply pressure, and got a cardboard box for him to elevate his leg.  By the time the boss got there, he was ready to transport to medical.
0.571400	I was able to detemine if some one has a cold has opposed to an allergy, by the type of symptoms and the pollen count at the time.
0.714300	I used to work in a pharmacy and was presented with various customers on a daily basis that would have questions about recommendations for various ailments. I had confidence in my ability to direct them to different over the counter medications. Of course, however, there are limits to what I was legally able to say to them. 
1.000000	I diagnosed myself with cholecystitis. I had an episode of severe right upper quadrant abdomil pain and gastrointestil symptoms a few hours after having a large meal with a high fat content. It happened again several days later. I figured out what the cause was and made an appointment with my doctor. I told him my symptoms, and what thought the diagnosis was. He ordered an ultrasound to confirm it, and I needed a cholecystectomy. My doctor at the time was one of my favorite doctors, and I think he would've diagnosed me properly, but I know that cholecystitis is missed sometimes and getting an accurate diagnosis can sometimes take quite a bit of time while other diseases or conditions are ruled out. 
0.785700	My father is a doctor and my mother is a nurse. I'm not the best with math however. 
0.928600	A friend of mine actually recently had a mammogram that came out positive. I told her there was a good chance that it was a false positive and might just be a cyst or something. It did in fact turn out to be a false positive.
0.714300	I got bit by a tick and contracted Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever so I went and looked it up and learned as much as I could about it and even offered information to my own doctor.
0.571400	Probably when I had to go for lab work and had to find out about my thyroid. I knew I had a high TSH level, but my Free T3 and my Free t4 was insanely low too. So I had to tell my doctor about those and she was shocked and said I was right. So now we not only look at my TSH , we also look at my Free T3 Free t4 too. Because you can have a normal TSH but have low Free T3 and Free t4 in hypothyroidism. I feel my best when my levels are optimal, not just normal.
0.714300	When reading the paperwork on a new medication, I discovered that it was Not advised in someone with my other conditions. Called and told the doctor.
0.928600	A FEW MONTHS AGO MY DAUGHTER HAD A SORE THROAT, FEVER, AND HAD TROUBLE SWALLOWING. BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN A FEW INSTANCES OF STREP THROAT IN HER SCHOOL, I HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SHE DID TOO. I KEPT HER OUT OF SCHOOL, MADE HER REST AND DRINK A LOT, AND I TOOK HER TO THE DOCTOR. MY GUESS WAS CONFIRMED, AND AN ANTIBIOTIC WAS PRESCRIBED.. 
0.785700	I was diagnosed with a chronic disease a few years ago. I searched a lot of medical information and knowledge online, and consulted with many peoples about this disease. Now, i am taking some medicines to control this disease. I could adjust my medicines based on the self-testing results now. 
1.000000	I honestly only think of times my children were sick, just knowing from experience what was a serious symptom and what most likely was not.
0.785700	I have high cholesterol that I mage with diet, exercise and homeopathic remedy Polycosil. I understand that my LDL is very good, so that helps my HDL even though it is over 200. I get annual blood tests and track my HDL and LDL and compare it to weight. My doctor and I also discuss these results. As long as my LDL stays high, I do not need to start taking a statin to reduce my cholesterol.
0.785700	"At one point, I was reading on the appearance of ""floaters"" in one's field of vision out of curiosity since I experienced them very irregularly.  Within a few months, my mom complained to me that she was seeing them very frequently, and I tried to explain to her the potential causes for them, including retil tearing.  Because of this, she went to the doctor and was told she had almost experienced a severe reti tear in one of her eyes."
0.857100	I started being seen by Dr.'s at a very young age, around 5-6, due to gastrointestil issues. Later, as a teen, I was diagnosed with mental health issues such as bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety. Now, as an adult, I believe I am suffering the consequences due to my past issues and, while still dealing with anxiety and also having other issues come up. I have had a broad range of medical experiences.
0.785700	I once had an abscessed tooth which caused major swelling in my gums. I remembered that peroxide worked as a mild antiseptic agent and salt water tends to reduce inflammation. With the combition of both of these things, I was able to reduce the swelling.
0.857100	I have always been interested in medicine, I have training as an EMT/Medic and have worked as a Vocatiol Rehabilitation Counselor
1.000000	My youngest brother is a diabetic, has been since he was two years old.  He came to live with me as an adult.  One morning he knocked on my bedroom door and said he felt funny.  His neck hurt, he had blood on his t shirt and on his lips.  I asked him to open his mouth.  i could see teeth marks on his tongue.  I knew he had had a seizure.  I got some juice into him and called an ambulance.
0.928600	When I received a spider bite from an unknown spider, I knew that I should keep an eye on the bite in case it became serious. I drew a circle around the bite and watched to see if it became bigger. When it did, I went to the doctor and got treatment. I had an infection that was easily treatable.
0.928600	I have a genetic predisposition to kidney stones. The first time they occurred, I ended up in the emergency room because I was in great pain and didn't know what was causing it. I learned as much as I could from the doctor and online information so that I could prevent that situation from happening again. Since then, I have only experienced one reoccurrence and I was able to alleviate and reverse it by taking the proper steps as soon as I recognized the symptoms beginning. It kept me out of the hospital and hopefully free of any future issues. 
0.857100	I have a minor in Community Health so I am a bit more in tune with medical issues than most. Whenever I have any medical problem I research it on the internet heavily so I usually know quite a bit before getting to the medical office.
0.928600	     I have severe headaches all the time.  I was given topomax (spelling?) and was promised it would help.  It made the headaches worse and caused a number of bad other side effects.  I did research and found this to be commonly known.  It seemed like my doctor just wanted to write a prescription and get me out of there.
0.714300	I have high cholesterol myself and educated myself on the effects of statins and eating right when I discovered that I had it.
0.857100	I had never had an abnormal mammogram until I moved to a new area of the country, and my old mammograms were lost due to flooding. For the next several years I was told I needed further screening after every single annual mammogram. None of this further screening revealed any signs of cancer. I discussed the situation with my doctor and asked to be sent to a different provider for my next mammogram. I have not had an abnormal mammogram since.
0.714300	The 2nd time I got cancer I pretty much knew what I would have to go through. I knew it was not going to be fun and I knew I would have tons of tests .It was not a good time in my life.
0.714300	It was just a few days ago, I got a sore throat. I knew I gargle warm water with salt it would go away. Then few days later, no more sore throat.
0.928600	my mom had a bulge on her aorta. The doctor wanted to watch it and use medication, but when I searched info online we found out it was borderline for surgery, so my mom asked for surgery instead.

0.928600	When I asked to be induced with my first son.  I knew something was not right.  My glucose test came back fine but I had every symptom of GD and the OB would not listen to me.  Once my due date hit, I was able to be induced.  At the time of delivery, I had gained 100 lbs, had a ton of swelling, high BP, extreme thirst and ended up having an 11 lb baby,
0.928600	I have worked during the summer at a Day Camp for elementary aged students for a number of years.  One day a camper bumped their mouth on the edge of the pool jumping in and I needed to give them first aid.

I was thought I knew the causes so I asked them if they were running everyday and if they continued running after pulling the muscle. When they answered yes on both counts I explained that they needed to add rest days to their routine and that the hip pain was the result of the body making unconscious corrections in running style due to the pulled muscle. I recommended they take a week off to heal up and some NSAIDs to keep swelling down. The recommendations were effective.
0.928600	I really don't know how to answer this question. I really can't say I've had an experience that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues.

0.857100	I woorked in a hospital as a night shift computer operator. Part of my function was to print the bills. What an eye opener as to the horrible cost of medical care in the US.

I did my own research online based on signs and symptoms and the swelling turned out to be a acne cyst. I look up treatment for cyst and treat the problem myself. the pain disappeared and the swelling went down flat.
0.857100	It seems that regularly I am able to self-diagnose many problems and make necessary changes that get me on the correct path before I even see my doctor to get his opinion. I have adapted my diet and lifestyle to combat symptoms in advance only to have my doctor commend me on being proactive with my condition.
0.928600	About two years ago I awoke one morning with a large bump on my back.  It was very painful and pus was oozing out of it.  I went to the minute clinic because that was fast to get into.  The lady just said it was probably a bug bite and nothing serious.  I hadn't ever had a reaction like this to a bug before and knew that where the bump was, on my back near my spine, that I needed to get another opinion.  I got into my normal physician about five hours later.  he said it was good that I came in because it was severely infected and the infection area was getting very close to my spine and getting into my blood stream.  If I hadn't known something was worse than was diagnosed at the minute clinic I could have easily ended up in the hospital.
0.571400	I kept having very severe reactions after eating certain types of food or consuming certain drinks. It was very painful, like being punched in the stomach from the inside.

0.785700	I am overweight and I am always told that I probably have diabetes before they ever test me. They always just assume and I tell them every time that I don't.

1.000000	Years ago I had problems with my stomach. Based on the symptoms, I was pretty sure that I knew what the problem was.

0.857100	When I spilled ravioli on my arm, I was able to identify the burn as a second-degree burn and I knew that I shouldn't put a cotton bandage directly on the burn because that could result in harm to my skin. I ran my arm under cool water, took ibuprofen, applied an antibiotic cream, and bandaged the burn loosely to prevent infection.
1.000000	I have borderline high cholesterol.  Although the doctor did not go into detail with me about my cholesterol levels, I understand the relationship between HDL and LDL and triglycerides to know that my high cholesterol reading is not necessarily alarming.  I also understand what I need to do to improve my cholesterol reading and independently (without medication) took some measures that lowered my cholesterol level by 11 points over a year.

1.000000	I was diagnosed with diabetes three years ago. I took a diabetes education class at the local hospital and did lots of research on my own about diabetes.

Through carrying out these changes I lowered my A1C considerably and brought it back into the normal change. It has stayed there and my blood sugar levels have been consistently in the normal range. This is partially a result of the medication I now take but also a result of eating a much better diet and exercising more, which I learned how to do through my research.

I'm also aware that allergies can develop or fade away at any age, or stay the same for life.

0.428600	Changes in the body which are not pleasant
0.785700	My wife was rushed to the hospital in extreme pain. She was worried it was something serious.

0.714300	No experience with this type of medical issues
0.785700	I'm not sure I can think of one. My cat was diabetic  so I had to give him insulin and when he went into kidney failure I gave him fluids so I understand the technical process but I don't feel I have a proper understanding of the actual disease.
0.857100	The second time that I got pregnt I felt as though I had a great knowledge of the process. This is the only medical issue that I am very familiar with. Now that I have friends who are pregnt I get to show my knowledge.

0.785700	I have not had many experiences in my life to help my knowledge of health or medical issues. I am studying to become a nurse, so I have taking a couple of Atomy and Physiology courses that have helped a bit. My grandmother is also a nurse, and I am sure just talking to her has had a little bit of an effect on my understanding.
0.785700	Most of my knowledge of health issues would have to be because of my husband who has several of the health issues that you listed in your examples/questions above. He has diabetes, high cholesterol, has had stints put in twice and was diagnosed with prostate cancer, high blood pressure and others. He doesn't fit the norm for most of these, not overweight, gets plenty of exercise and is active, etc. So I have learned quite a bit through his treatments and issues. 
0.642900	Once I had a tiny growth on my thyroid. One doctor (who was slash for cash happy) wanted to rip it out. In light of the fact that I'm a singer, I instead elected to monitor it once a year. There has been no change in the 6 years I have been monitoring it.

0.571400	I was diagnosed late in life with beta thalassemia minor; up until that time I had always been considered anemic but no one ever considered the cause.  With my current doctor he asks for blood tests every 6 months.  Every time he discusses the results with me he gets concerned about the anemia.  Every single time I have to remind him that it is the thalassemia minor which is NOT treatable, especially not with iron supplements.
1.000000	When my father was still around, he tripped over a shovel in the backyard. he couldn't get up, so he called me with his cell phone. I only lived about 10 minutes away so i drove over and entered through the backyard. his ankle was swollen pretty badly. So I helped him up and brought him inside. I knew we probably had to take him to the hospital to get it checked out, but him being a stubborn old man, he refused. I had him sit in a chair and brought another chair over so he could elevate his leg. I put a pillow under his foot and taped an ice pack around his ankle. We them argued for about 15 minutes about going to the doctor and I eventually convinced him to talk to an advise nurse. The advice nurse told him to elevate his leg and keep it iced. If it didn't improve within a half hour, to come in to be checked. 3 hours pass and nothing improved, so I eventually got him to agree to go to the hospital.
1.000000	I have some friends in the medical field and have helped my family with their persol health.  This has allowed me to become more familiar with different types of health matters and working with various areas of health care system.

I quickly sought the assistance of a health practitioner that commended me for recognizing the dangers and not trying to remedy the situation myself.
0.785700	Having children made me a pseudo expert in diagnosing health issues and adding to my health knowledge. Many times, my children would exhibit symptoms and if they appear benign enough I would go online to check symtoms to self diagnose. While doing that, I've read up and gained a lto of knowledge on many different illnesses and its treatments. 
0.714300	My fiance had 3 strokes in 3 weeks in March of 2017. Fortutely, I was aware of the warning signs, and got her help before things got too out of hand. I've also helped her with her other medical issues, so I know what meds to go for when she has a problem.

0.928600	This is kind of a hard question to answer. I have never had any serious medical issues persolly. I have extensive knowledge of many issues my father had prior to his death. He was a diabetic, along with the majority of his siblings and mother. I know that there could be a high probability that I could acquire diabetes myself if I don't take care of my body by watching what I eat and exercising  regularly.
1.000000	I had blood work done and my glucose level was 130. My doctor was worried that this was elevated. I explained I had just eaten shortly before my blood work.

0.500000	I persolly have been very lucky as far as my health goes. I have pretty good health for my age. My sister had cancer, I learned a lot while being with her at the hospital. My son was in a coma for thirteen days, I gained some knowledge while he was in the hospital. I do not think I have a great deal of medical knowledge. I did sell health and life insurance for a few years so I know some of the terminologies but not that much on what each condition details.

As a person who is treated for depression, I have read up a great deal about the condition, where I even volunteer to counsel other who also experience depression. I knew the signs right away, and talked to her.  Luckily, I referred her to a licensed mental health specialist to get the care and propoer diagnosis that she needs.

There is a class of drugs called 5-ASAs which are prescribed for maintence of my condition.  I'm taking Lialda, which is a 5-ASA, to reduce flareups of Crohn's Disease.
0.571400	I went through many years of doctor's trying to figure out a mysterious illness that I had. After some time, I decided to start doing some research on my own. I was able to come up with something that I thought fit my symptoms very well and was able to find a few doctors who agreed with me and gave me an official diagnosis. 
0.785700	One day my mother told me she was having severe stomach pain.  The pain happened when her stomach was more empty.  Drinking milk relieved the pain.  I had heard of this and told her to go to the doctor and tell them she probably has an ulcer and needed some antibiotics.  She did that and came home with the antibiotics.  Her stomach pain went away for several years before flaring up again.  
0.714300	I went to the doctor who was having a hard time explaining the pain I was feeling in my breast but I was able to help him articulate what he was trying to say. We laughed about it afterwards. He was a newer doctor.
1.000000	For several years, I helped my parents with chronic health conditions including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. I learned a lot about those conditions and was constantly applying what I learned to daily situations including maging high and low blood sugar, confusion, and activating community resources for their situation.

This did the trick as I felt better in 2 days (but continued to take the antibiotics for a week).  A few weeks later I got the rest of the tooth removed at a dental school on the cheap.  But yeah I knew what to do in that instant without going to the emergency room and getting a huge bill and prescription I couldn't afford.
0.571400	I knew my symptoms were aligned with a certain diagnosis. I explained it to my doctor and he realized that I was correct based on my symptoms. 
0.642900	"The first time my husband and I were expecting a baby, we found out that we had lost her at 13 weeks.  I was scheduled to have a D & C at the end of the week on Friday, but began to bleed on Wednesday.  The doctor had me come into the hospital to have a D & C on Wednesday evening.  On Friday, the doctor had me come back to the office for a check up.  I asked if I had been given RhoGam (since I have A+ blood) and was told I was not.   The day I was seen was right before the office was going to close for the Easter weekend.  Had I not asked about the RhoGam and had they not rushed to filly give it to me, the 72 hour would have been missed due to the Easter break.  This doctor knew my blood type but ""forgot"" to give me RhoGam until I asked for it!"
1.000000	I hurt my wrist and had to decide whether or not to make an appointment with my doctor or go to the emergency room at a hospital. I called my doctor and described my symptoms. They asked me about the location, appearance, and other details, and I chose to make an appointment rather than go to a hospital.
0.928600	I used to have to help my grandmother often with her diabetes issues so I am familiar with what most people typically have to do. One day while I was at work, an older coworker of mine started to feel faint because of low blood sugar. I was able to get her something to eat and helped her restore her blood sugar levels back to normal.
0.857100	This one here has; it's likely shown how inept I am at math.
0.571400	When I had a bunch of fertility tests done. I had to go over everything from my cholesterol to vitamin deficiencies. 
0.714300	My son had a sore throat recently.  He had the sniffles due to allergies and I thought that was the issue at first, but when I took a flashlight and looked at his throat, it was very raw.  Also, he was running a low grade fever.  I knew it must be strep.  Sure enough, the doctor confirmed it.  
0.642900	I have had a lot of UTI and kidney issues over the years. i was diagnosed with a UTI a few years back and took medication for it but i didn't feel that was right and kept researching my symptoms. Everything was pointing to stones and a few days later i passed a kidney stone. I learned all about the causes, effects, and preventatives to kidney stones
0.928600	"I guess I would have to say one of the million or so times I had to deal with medical situations with raising three sons.  Looking back, it seems like one or the other of them was always hurt or sick!  They did keep me on my ties.  if we had ran to the doctor every time they ""stubbed a toe"", I would still be paying off doctor bills."
1.000000	I have worked in a parasitology lab.  This has given me the knowledge to know the symptoms of various parasitic diseases as well as the ability to positively identify various blood stage parasites in blood smear. 
1.000000	My mother had an inner ear infection that led to an absess in her brain. She was hospitalized with quite a few surgeries, and spend a couple of months in rehabilitation. There were several doctors explaining several things over the course of her treatment and recovery. 
1.000000	I once had a severe earache. I also had a sinus infection. I deduced that I had an ear infection. The doctor confirmed I had an ear infection.
0.714300	My son has minor asthma symptons so I did some research and ended up understanding the causes and treatments.  There was a time when my son was having some chest pains and having a hard time breathing.  I couldn't find his inhaler so I had him stand in front of the freezer where I learned that the cool air helps with the breathing.  
1.000000	One experience I had that showed my knowledge of health issues was dealing with the hospital when I had a kidney stone. It took 8 visits to get them to listen to me, and search what should have been the first step. I knew they were wrong, and being neglectful, so I pressed them further, and made them do their jobs.
0.571400	I will say it was when grandmother was diagnosed with brain cancer. Her brain swelled up and there was a medication that could be given her to lower the inflammation on the brain but she had diabetes and this will increase the glucose level. She was 75 years old and I expl to the doctor that based on what I read online the chances of her going into a diabetic coma were almost none. Based on what I read there is a little chance of a person with a high glucose level who is over the age of 70 going into a diabetic coma almost non existing and also she was going to die anyways, the tumor was not operable and it did not respond to radiation.
0.571400	I just do a lot of research. I read a lot of books on medicine, illnesses and the medical profession and ethics. I watch a lot of documentaries on the topic also and my mother was a nurse.  
0.714300	I was able to take a basic health class and passed it with a high grade, as well I have learned CPR and basic nutrition. I am able to take my own blood pressure and keep records of it and take my basic vital signs.
0.785700	I helped my mother through a breast cancer fight and pallative care for pancreatic cancer.
0.785700	I felt congested and had pain in my chest.  I could feel it when I inhaled.  There was a gurgling sound.  I went to the doctor and told him I had pneumonia.  He said he'd be the judge of that.  When the x-rays came back.  He agreed.
1.000000	I have ran many marathons successfully and taken care of all recovery that had to do with it without any outside help.
0.500000	Well, my parents is not very healthy person.  When their was sick, I always took them to see the doctor.  That doctor later become my neighbor and friend.  So he kind of explain and teach me about the medical issues. 
0.857100	"I recently learned I have the MTHFR genetic defect from both parents (homozygous). I researched the genetic mutation issue and came to understand that my body does not ""methylize"" properly. In particular, my ability to convert folate to a useble form is compromised by about 70%. This has an effect on the efficiency of many methylation and detox pathways in my body. This also means I am more suspectible to certain health issues (fertility issues, depression, heart and vascular disease, Parkinson's). Some experts believe there are dietary and nutritiol options that can help to offset some of the effects of the ""mutation."" I am pretty well versed in what they are at this point."
0.857100	I have never had an experience like this before. 
0.428600	when I was having an extremely hard time breathing I knew something was wrong, I went to the hospital and discovered that I had two PE's in my right lung. I knew it was more than my asthma and I knew it was in my right lung.
1.000000	My daughter has had recurring fevers over the last few years. We've been to our pediatrician and specialists multiple times trying to discover the cause. It's led me to do significant research on auto-inflammatory syndromes, comparing her symptoms to those of the various recognized disorders. While certainly not a doctor, I feel fairly knowledgeable on auto-inflammatory disorders as a result.
0.642900	"My son while still in highschool got a concussion during practice and I was called to come and get him. I took him to the emergency room. The doctor gave the typical instructions on what not to let him do. I asked him if getting some of the amino acids that act as neurotransmitters to the brain help speed up his recovery. He looked at me as if I had three heads and answered I guess in disbelief that I actually knew something. His response was"" yes""."
0.857100	"I've been dealing with back pain for a while (over a few years) so throughout my pain 'journey' i have researched anything from sciatica, plantar fasciitis (which caused this whole thing from the beginning) as well as knowing different terminology for my symptoms as well as the body parts...like explaining to my (new) chiropractor and/or physical therapist which part of my body that are having problems and what kind of exercises i've done. I actually have gone to my doctor at one point (for a follow up visit) and he started our conversation with ""So, what did your online research find?"" and after I explained what I've found he confirmed yes/no on what I read and it was quite a good and efficient meeting."
0.857100	I was feeling a shortness of breath. The doctor thought I was having an asthma attack but here it was just because I had not excericsed in a while and this was catching up to me. I had to slowly bring my excercise up rather than jump in right away.
0.714300	I had a pain in my neck that was getting worse and I figured it was because I was using my tablet and my head was at a angle that was causing me problems. I started setting my tablet at different angle and over the course of a couple of weeks my neck pain faded and then completely went. If I would have still had the pain after a couple of weeks I would have went to the doctor, but since that time I have never had any problems with it again.
0.714300	when my husband had to have surgery i had to help him fill out the paperwork and try to explain to him when was going to happen and how i would take care of him
0.785700	A close friend developed high blood pressure and prediabetes. Doctors put him on medication that he didn't want to take, and they gave him a (truly) lousy diet and exercise program that would've ensured he stayed on the meds forever. I cleaned up his diet, got him on a sensible training program, and now he doesn't need to take any medication.
1.000000	My exposure to medical topics began when I was very young. I grew up on a dairy farm and when I was about 10 I started helping the vet when they came to do herd checks, etc. I have worked in hospitals as a med tech in the ED and lab so I am very comfortable around it when I am not the patient. In my late 20s I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and that was when things began to go downhill health-wise. I had to learn a lot about autoimmune diseases and honestly believe if I hadn't fired my docs at the end of 1999, I would be dead now.
0.714300	I play basketball a lot. I was also interested in sports medicine. I have twisted my ankle numerous times over the years. My knowledge on how to treat sprains was an asset to me. 
0.928600	Several years ago I had a problem with my left shoulder. I would feel intense pain in my shoulder when I would to certain motions, but at other times it was not a problem. I thought it was shoulder impingement syndrome. I knew about this because two of my birding friends had the same problem and talked to me about it and the symptoms and the physical therapy treatments for it. So when it happened to me I thought I knew what it was right away. When I went to the doctor (who is NOT the same doctor I have now) he sent me to an orthopedic surgeon who confirmed that. But I already knew what it was, I just wanted to get the referral to start the physical therapy. I wish my doctor had listened to me more carefully and had given me the referral himself because I would have started treatment two weeks earlier.
0.714300	i sometimes kinda diagnose my aliments using google,however i am not very good at it. when i was a teeger.my girl friend at that time was babysitting a 7 year old boy,who fell off a swing and broke his arm.she called me first since i was only a few houses away,and asked me what to do.i went over there and his arm had a u shaped fracture.i told her to call an ambulance.thats it,thats all i got.
0.714300	I learned knowledge of health or medical issues as I was raising my children.  Also my parents had health problems early on because they smoked, ate food that was high in cholesterol so I've learned what not to eat and to exercise to stay as healthy as I can.
0.928600	When I talk with doctors, I seem to understand medical terminology. I notice how similar conditions have similarities in their me. Also, I notice that drugs that control similar aspects have similar pre- or suffixes. 
0.571400	I take my kids temperature and if its high i give them medicine.
0.714300	My friend told me about a disorder they had called celiac disease and I already knew quite a lot about the disorder. 
0.642900	My blood pressure was high. I began to eat better and exercise. When it remained high, I talked to my doctor and started blood pressure meds.
0.500000	a coworker complained of have the worst sore throat he had ever had i told him he need to get that checked out because if strep  is left unchecked it can damage the heart  he went to the doctor and he had strep
0.928600	When my mother was diagnosed as diabetic, we were told to limit her carb intake. I spent time reading several guides given to me by her doctor and attending two classes given by a registered dietitian. Through diet and medication, we were able to lower her fasting glucose levels significantly.
0.928600	My mom had ALS.  We cared for her at home for 10 years with nursing help during the day.  She was non ambulatory. She was on a ventilator and feeding tube for the majority of that time. I knew how to administer her medication and feed her, change her catheter, change out vent tubing, suction her throat.  She needed total care.  I could care for her myself when we did not have a nurse.  
0.857100	My niece called me and asked about symptoms she was having. I had a good idea of what could be wrong. I told her it was my best guess and that she should see the doctor. It turned out my educated guess was correct.
0.785700	I was being evaluated for high risk pregncy due to a blood clot early on.  I had done a lot of research prior to visiting the doctor so that I would have knowledge to understand what the doctors were going to recommend in relation to how my pregncy would progress and how my birth would be.
0.857100	When my son broke his hand and required surgery I needed to be able to understand the doctor as well as the aftercare, etc.  
0.785700	I cant think of any one specific incident.  There have been a few times I have administered first aid like the heimlich maneuver or recognized someone needed to go to the hospital because of a fever or difficulty breathing, etc.
0.928600	I woke up with a cramp in my leg one morning. I took a spoon full of mustard and the cramp went away within 2 minutes and never returned.
0.857100	There hasn't really been just one significant experience that demonstrates my knowledge of health and medical issues. There's just small things that I do to alleviate or resolve medical issues that pop up. For example, I take apple cider vinegar for my indigestion because I know that I have low stomach acid. And I take frequent breaks and move around to prevent my sciatica nerve from acting up.
0.428600	I care for my mother moderately. She is independent and usually takes care of herself but doesn't have information on important health facts. One afternoon she described to me how she had had difficulties pouring her coffee, she explained how she had to hold one arm with the other to even lift minimally. I insist recognized the symptoms of stroke. We went to the ER where they did find she had a stroke.
0.857100	I had two C-sections. Once when I was 23 and one when I was 27. After the first one I tried to look up a lot more information about C-sections and surgery in general, because I figured I would need another C-section with my second child. I was a lot more informed by the time I had my second C-section, which made the process a lot easier and more comforting for me. I knew what was about to happen, so I did not have to worry as much as I did with the first C-section.
0.928600	My fiance was out of town visiting family and he started feeling sick. Each day that I talked to him he sounded worse. I filly convinced him to go to an Urgent Care and he was diagnosed with an Upper Respiratory Infection.
1.000000	I don't know a lot about health or medical issues.  When I have questions I refer to professiols or any other reliable source of information.
0.857100	I found out I have Restless Legs Syndrome a few years ago. My doctor had some recommendations, but I did a bit of my own research and found out that low-normal levels of ferritin (stored iron) can exacerbate it. I was then able to follow up with the doctor and get a ferritin test, and confirmed that I should reduce my frequency of doting blood and take an iron supplement when I do. That helped reduce the intensity of my RLS symptoms.
1.000000	I can comprehend health materials as I am very good in science and math. I always look at ways to reduce my risk.
0.428600	I was not feeling well one day and could not figure out what was going on. So I went online and pulled up WebMD and searched for all the symptoms I was having and was able to rrow it down to 2 possible things. In doing this I was able to give my doctor a better account of what I was going through.
0.928600	Using online resources I determined that I had a zinc deficiency. So I purchased a zinc supplement and shampoo containing zinc to improve my general health. 
0.571400	i was shoot in the leg and i know to tie my leg up to stop the bleeding
0.642900	When I had my spil cord tumor I did a lot of research.It has come in handy with  neurologists I have seen over the years.For the fact some are just not experienced with that type of tumor.I have probably taught them a thing or two.
0.857100	When I was told I had high cholesterol not only did I understand the changes I would have to make I also further researched the issue to make sure I was on the best diet and treatment possible and brought up with my doctor a couple of concerns I had. I was proactive in trying to understand this issue and with work, I did.
0.642900	When I started breaking out in like a rash and skin kept growing I thought it was psoriasis based on what I had seen before and I turned out to be correct when I went to a dermatologist.
0.571400	I whought I had a sinus infection, went to the doctor, and that was confirmed 
0.571400	I received training as a home health aid and participated in certifications such as CPR and First Aid training.
0.928600	Once I remember seeing a medical category on Jeoparody!, the game show. I think I got almost every answer.
0.785700	My best friend found some thickening bellow her collarbone. I told her to immediately go to the doctor because I knew there's a big possibility that it's a breast cancer. It turned out to be nothing scary but the doctor told her that I gave her a good advice.
0.571400	We often have health fair's at our church and when i checked a child's temperature it was at 102. I knew this was kinda high and alerted the nurses. 
0.857100	After an off-road motorcycle mishap I knew that my leg was seriously damaged.  My leg had been wrenched around under the heavy bike, and I had actually heard a sp.  Once we were able to get the motorcycle off my leg it was obvious to me that there was a serious fracture, perhaps a compound fracture, as any movement would result in a feeling of bone grating together.  I decided that the best thing to do was to keep my tall, heavy boot on to stabilize the lower leg.  I was uble to walk due to the pain, so my friend carried me to the shade so that I'd be out of the hot sun and we elevated the limb.  He went for help leaving me with food and water, I was hungry, but resisted eating much in case surgery would be necessary when I ended up in the hospital.
0.928600	This is a tough question for me.  I dont ever remember an expeience that has demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues.  There were a few times when I knew that one of my children needed to see a doctor, but in these times, my knowledge was intuitive rather than inherant.
1.000000	I studied and researched and read a lot about different forms of birth control before I went to my OBGyn and talked about the best method for me. I think she was impressed that I was so knowledgeable. 
0.785700	A few years ago, I had to watch my mother die of a disease that should have been treated years before, but none of her doctors could ever diagnose it until it was too late. I found it appalling how little the medical professions knows and how much they say they know. It was left to me to care for her, almost without their help. I had to literally demand palliative care for her.
0.642900	Someone close to me started to freak out about a bump in their buttocks--from persol experience--that sounds like hemorrhoids. I was quite surprised that she was freaking out about such a thing, but it indeed turned out to be hemorrhoids. Another one that comes to mind is that a friend said he had abdomil issues and other related symptoms of appendicitis--I only thought of it because I did some research myself in fear of having it. When he went to his Doctor, it turns out I was correct.
0.642900	I cannot actually say that I can. After basic stats like one out of ten are mingled with ideas like false positives I lose confidence in my ability to be certain of their meaning. I think I actually deal in comparative strategies like value judging. For example 30% blockage of an blood vessel sounds terrible in and of itself but if the info accompanying that is stents are not used until 55% then that is how i gauge it.
0.428600	I was given a choice to get a flu shot I was told of all the side effects and I decided to get it.  Later I felt awful.  I called the doctor he stated that it happens sometimes.  I should just drink a lot of fluids and rest.
0.642900	when my boyfriend was complaining about symptoms in his hands, i suggested that he had carpal tunnel. i knew this because my mom had similar issues with her hand/wrist and it was very likely carpal tunnel. he went to the doctor and he indeed had carpal tunnel. 
0.785700	I try to stay abreast of my health knowledge on different topics. I especially try to stay abreast of my own health issues and concerns. I read on online and see what the current news is in the medical industry.
0.714300	I am working to lower my A1C count due to being pre-diabetic along with trying to lower my cholesterol. I am exercising and cutting back on sweets. I am also cutting back on my fat intake. I have been working on this for the past 5 months. I will be tested again in one month. I have read many articles and talked with my doctor regarding these tests.
0.571400	I spent a half a year researching if I had diabetes or not.  I found out a lot of things that contributed to diabetes, so I lost weight and balanced out my hormones. I also looked into people who reversed diabetes.  This saved me from the disease. 
0.857100	One of my coworkers sees the same doctor as I do.  She was telling me about a recent visit and had a question about some of her blood work.  I was able to answer her questions because I had experience in similar blood work.
0.642900	When I was in health class and gave a presentation on joints and arthritis.
0.785700	The best example that I can think of was when my young daughter started having bed-wetting issues long after she had learned to go to the bathroom herself. The doctor did some tests and ruled out a UTI, which I was familiar with, then wanted to rule out constipation. She did this by doing some x-rays on my daughter. Sure enough, she just hadn't been drinking enough water and was really constipated, which was putting pressure on her bladder. This whole thing was pretty easily understandable, and was explained well by our pediatrician.
0.428600	Never
1.000000	When I helped a family member that had very serious issues I took the family member to all the medical appointments and stayed in the hospital through all the surgeries with them.  I don't know if that demonstrates knowledge but I learned a lot of knowledge doing it I think.
0.785700	My mother was having back problems, anemia and hair loss. The doctors didn't know what was wrong. I did my own research and asked the doctor to test for a genetic condition that was not common in our racial group . The doctor agreed to run the test and it turns out, my mother had the condition, also so do I.
0.714300	There was a time I had an ear infection but since it was my first in my life, I didn't exactly know how to explain what I was suffering from to the doctor, this made my diagnosis hard because I didn't really know what was going on but my glands in the neck region were swollen, so my doctor tried treating different stuff till I actually found out on my own with the help of the internet that I had an ear infection, then went back and told my doctor for proper medication.
0.571400	When I was diagnosis with cerebellar ataxia.  I never heard of this disorder nor did anybody I know.  I have done a lot of research over the past five years including a couple facebook groups.
1.000000	When my mother was diagnosed with stage 3 endometrial cancer I knew there wasn't a study or trial for her to participate in because I was transcribing for an oncologist at the time. 
1.000000	My significant other had serve pain in his back for sometime and they gave him an MRI. We received a copy of the CD and looked at the imagery at home. I was able to tell him what was wrong with his spine prior to receiving the phone call from the doctor. At the appointment I discussed with the doctor the options for treatment and percentage wise how rare the condition was. Already knowing about some issues and being able to research and learn about the possibilities of treatment, it was easier to understand what the doctor thought was the best option and for us to make an informed one confidently and in a short period of time.
0.214300	just what i eat and looking at labels. trying to stay within the 2k calorie of a daily intake of food and try to eat more healthy.
0.785700	I have chronic shoulder pain that has been worsening for 25 years.  I know nothing can be done except pain pills.  I do not take them because I know I might become addicted.
0.785700	An experience was when I was having high blood pressure. I am at a normal weight and exercise regularly. I went to the doctor and he wanted to put me on some pills which I read had bad side effects. I went home and read about it and found that l-arginine lowers your blood pressure and since it's an amino acid there's no side effect. I started taking it and my blood pressure got lowered and I didn't need to take the pills that were prescribed.
0.642900	When i had a stomach bug. I knew that steps i had to take in terms of what kind of food i should eat and which ones to avoid.
0.785700	I went to the doctor for a cut on my hand, I needed stitches but the blood wouldn't stop. The doctor didn't know why and was about to give me medicine to make my blood clot. But I told him that I had taken aspirin. I knew that aspirin thins my blood and makes it harder to clot. So I told him and it saved me from having to take medication I didn't need. 
1.000000	I had a colonoscopy at 32, that showed and removed several polyps, two pre-cancerous. I was told to have a repeat colonoscopy every 3 years, even though my 2nd generation family has a genetic defect that causes a greater, aggressive risk, and the fact that I was only 32. I researched the subject and decided to have one every year. Good thing, because for the next eight years, they always found some. Now I have one every three, if they don't find anything.
0.928600	"I found a mole on my back that met some, but not all aspects of looking suspicious. When I brought it up to my PC doc,  but he wasn't really convinced.  I had to insist on a derm referral,  because I was fairly certain based on my research that the markers it did have meant it was bad. I did get the referral and the derm took one look at it and said,  yep that's coning of today. Though it eventually turned out to be ""really weird"" but not cancer,  i still felt I made the right call by insisting. "
0.928600	I had a class in college that medical questions such as these on this survey. I did pretty well in that class. I was able to finish with a 87 in the class.
1.000000	I took my mother to a health clinic to have them look at a problem she was having with her foot. there was a sign on the wall telling people they should report when they have been outside the country. I asked the doctor why weren't they interested when and if people traveled to Florida and may have been bitten by a mosquito. she agreed that that would be a good idea, but I doubt they printed up new posters or asked anyone then or now
0.928600	I had premature children that were 10 weeks early and were male. The fact that they were male they had a lower survival rate then if they were female infants since female infants tend to be stronger. My sons were on oxygen and until they were down to 20% and weened off a respirator they were at risk of vision and other health conditions.
0.857100	My husband was having pain in stomach and he was useous, and he was bloated. I thought it was an ulcer but the first doctor he went to could not find anything. My husband wanted to just take aspirin, and wait until the pain went away. I was adamant that he not take aspirin because it would do more damage. And that he go to another doctor. He went to my doctor, and she found the ulcer. 
1.000000	I was able to successfully perform the Heimlich maneuver for a gentleman that needed my help.  I was able to successfully pass CPR courses which demonstrates knowledge of medical issues.
0.571400	I have administered first aid and CPR to several individuals 
0.714300	When I had a job working with kids for the city. I was able to tell when some of the kids were sick.
0.714300	Just having minor health issues throughout my life I have learned to tell the minor from the major issues. The advent of the internet has also made information more accessible and readily available.
1.000000	I found my mother passed out on the toilet.  I knew there was something about pressure on the vagus nerve that could make you pass out.  I remembered she needs to get blood to her head so I put her head down.  She came to a little and we were able to get her to lay on the bed.  Then she became totally awake and  responsive.  We still went to the emergency room, but she was fine.
1.000000	I had gone to the doctor for a checkup and was told that my cholesterol was borderline high and that we needed to keep an eye on it, and that I might have to take medication. I laughed and said that I was not going to take cholesterol lowering meds, and that I could make it go down just by changing my diet. the Dr. gave the usual spiel about genetics and how that was not always possible and I went on my way. A couple of months, at most, later, after eating mainly vegan, I went back and it had gone down 20-some points.

0.642900	I once had a friend who was going to start taking a newer version of Acutane and I helped them steer clear of that drug because it had caused a colon condition in me. The ability to help them with my past experience gave me some knowledge on this issue.

0.928600	When my kids are sick I know how to take care of them, like if they're running a temperature. I know when they need to be checked out by the pediatrician and when it's just a regular cold that they can't do anything about.
0.928600	I had multiple concussions growing up. While playing college football I sustained my 4th concussion. As a result, I had to get multiple tests run and was told I should be done playing football.

0.857100	I can't think of a specific experience off the top of my head, but when I was seeing my psychiatrist, he often tried putting me on anti-depressants I knew wouldnt work because we had disagreements about my symptoms. After several months, he realized I was right. 
0.500000	I have taken multiple health classes and biology classes throughout high school and college despite none applying to my major of psychology so I believe I do have some set knowledge of them
0.857100	In the summer of 2015 I was diagnosed with optic neuritis and monitored for MS.  Many tests and specialists later I was eventually diagnosed with RA instead.

1.000000	"A new acquaintance here in Chicago was telling me about some spots on his skin that he gets during the summer. He said he is really worried about it.

0.928600	I was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure, so I came home and spent time researching it and finding out what I needed to do and was able to implement those changes and actions. 
1.000000	At a music festival, a friend of mine suddenly fell to the ground and started convulsing, which I had never seen him do before. I had no idea what was going on but immediately thought it might be an allergic reaction. I started yelling for an EpiPen which was luckily pro-offered by someone and administered, stopping the issue quickly. It turned out he had a bee allergy that he was unaware of.
0.785700	I don't have any personal or firsthand experience, but I remember hearing a friend talk about how carpal tunnel affects people and, having done some reading online about it in the past, I corrected them on how it really affects the body.
0.571400	When I became seriously ill from my gallbladder, I had to be transferred to an outside hospital to receive treatment. I understood what was happening and the possibility of what could happen.
0.500000	All I know is what I have and have learned by doing research on it.  My bones are thinning so I researched on the medicines that help stop the process.  I looked it up and asked doctor questions whether it can be taken with other medicines and how long.  
0.857100	I went to the emergency room with a dislocated knee, but the doctors insisted it was something else, until I was able to pop my knee back into place while waiting for x-rays.
0.571400	I have the knowledge base because I am a nurse but I am not that good at math. The percentages are throwing me off and therefore I am not doing well. I do know a lot of the medical conditions. 
0.928600	My brother called me because my father was having chest pains, so I told my brother to find an aspirin and crush it up or have my father chew it, because I knew aspirin was recommended for heart problems and I learned from a neuroscience class that crushing it up gets it into the system faster.

0.857100	When my doctor told me I have high blood pressure and asked me if I knew how to lower it I told him I did as I had done my research no high blood pressure. I told him about my eating changes and exercises that I could do and he was quite impressed.
1.000000	"I went to an urgent care with the same symptoms as my husband.  My husband was seen by one doctor, prescribed an antibiotic, and felt better within 24 hours.  I was seen by a different doctor, told I had a virus, and sent home with no medication.  I continued to worsen as my husband got better.  I sought out a second opinion and was able to convince the doctor that something more was wrong than just a virus.  I was reluctantly given a chest x-ray and found that my ""virus"" had manifested to pneumonia."
0.714300	I had an inflammatory issue which cause my skin to turn very red.  I believed it was an immune response to foods so while I took a steroid, I also researched and found an anti-inflammatory diet which brought my skin back to normal.
0.571400	I started having chronic health issues 20 years ago. I tried to seek help from my doctor, and also a university medical center, but was given no explanation for my symptoms. I researched my own symptoms online, and after much research was able to figure out a little of what was going on with me. I brought this information to an out of town doctor, who was able to connect the dots for me in some areas. So, doing my own research helped me to at least get a medical professional to take me seriously.
1.000000	My mother who had a history of hypertension and, recent stent placement in a renal artery, was noted to have several syncopal episodes.  Her blood pressure meds had not been changed since her renal artery stenting and I suspected her meds needed to be lowered due to increased renal blood flow/improved blood pressure control.  I contacted her internist office and they agreed.
0.857100	When my son was young he got in a wreck on his bike.  He was wearing a helmet and hit his head.  We still watched my on the next couple of days and he should signs that he had a concussion.  He was having headaches and dizziness.  I took him to the doctor and sure enough he had one.
0.714300	When I was pregnant and had low iron I needed to receive 5 iron infusions so I needed to learn about the iron infusions and the side effects, etc. Also I have a blood clotting disorder so while I was pregnant I needed to learn about the precautions that would need to be taken in order to have a safe birth.
0.714300	I frequently get messages on facebook from old friends and family members asking me about health related issues, and they usually thank me for the help, even for things as simple as helping them find a local doctor and getting the right number to call for access to help.
1.000000	I have 2 kids so my wife and I are always considering medical issues when they are sick. I have used my knowledge of things like safe temperatures and the look of rashes and other symptoms to determine whether or not they need to go to the doctor and have been correct so far.
0.785700	I was at the hospital with my girlfriend and they gave her too much IV fluid. She began swelling up and i let the doctor know that she was becoming overhyrdrated

0.571400	My mother and grandmother are nurses, so growing up I was aware of the body and medication and diseases. Iâve also been to the doctor regularly. 
0.714300	I got sick with pneumonia once, and was given lots of things to read about how I could have contracted it. I was able to read and understand them all, and throw them all out because none of them fit.
0.642900	I feel like I have a good feeling over my body. When I get sick my wife always pushes me to go seek medical help. At this point I'm able to tell here exactly how I feel and if I should seek medical attention or not. I think it's important to know your body 
1.000000	My husband wasn't feeling well, and his medboard (military sick call) told him to just go home and sleep. However, I knew with his symptoms, (fever, sore throat, white spots on throat and tonsils), that he most likely had strep throat and needed antibiotics. He went back to see another doctor, and they diagnosed him with the strep.
0.357100	I've had a few surgeries and  treatments in my life and have seen many doctors in different cities, and I have done a lot of research about my medical issues that helped me a lot. I have also gone to school to be a certified CNA and have worked in the medical field for over 14 years. I'm no expert my any means , but I do know certain things.
0.928600	I have many times pulled muscles that I've self-treated using RICE. I have also self-diagnosed colds vs allergies. I've also modified my diet to improve my slightly high cholesterol. 
0.785700	I visited my doctor recently to review blood test. I noted that my A1C is good for a diabetic, at 6.7 and she agreed. I then told her that my glucose meter was giving me morning readings of 175, and  asked for a new machine because the old one was not properly calibrated. I was right! The new meter just gave me a morning reading of 124, which is more realistic.
1.000000	I started having weird chronic adult acne in my mid 20s.  I figured something was wrong because no one in my family have this issue, and acne in general is not normal for someone in their 20s.  I went to my primary care physician who referred me to a specialist.  The specialist told me everything is normal, and prescribed a strong acne cream which damaged my skin, but also helped with the acne.  The specialist ignored all my concerns of me having abnormal adult acne to begin with, saying she only dealt with the skin - possible bad digestion or hormonal issues, all of which may cause acne, are not her business.  I spend the next few years dealing with the acne and being told by my PCP that maybe it's just normal for me.  I got sick and fed up with this, went to a holistic hippie doctor, who said I had issues with digestion, and prescribed a change of diet and probiotics.  With the hippie doctor's help and a change in my eating habits/supplements, I no longer have acne.

0.642900	Whenever I take my children to their pediatrician for something other than well-baby check-ups (which is rare as my children are extremely healthy and do not get sick often), I'm always able to reiterate the doctor's information for my husband, who always has a ton of questions for me when he gets home from work.
0.857100	I woke up in the middle of the night with an extremely sore throat and swollen glands. It is unusual for me to be woken up in the middle of the night by anything, so I was concerned and went to get a glass of water. It hurt to swallow, so I decided to see what my throat looked like. When I found that there were white spots on the back of my throat, I knew that it could be strep throat and went in to the doctor. The test came back positive for strep throat. 
1.000000	A couple of years ago, I stepped off the front porch of my new home and into a hole that was covered in leaves.  It was instant blinding pain for a few seconds, then I crawled into my house.  My ankle was huge and I couldn't put any pressure on it.  Everyone insisted that I go to the ER, but I looked up how to test fractured/broken vs. sprained ankles.  Canada actually had a great write up on it, apparently ER visits due to sprained ankles seriously hurt their socialized medicine policy due to costs.  I did their tests, and correctly diagnosed my sprained ankle then treated it accordingly.
0.642900	When I was younger and my mom was sick. I did a lot of reading and research because I wanted to make sure my mom was going to be ok. I took care of my mom knew what medicine she needed. I knew when she needed it and when she had to go to the hospital I knew what to tell the doctors and nurses.
0.714300	i went the doctor once because i was having some problems. i had googled my symptoms and done some research to see what might be going on. the doctor diagnosed me with the same thing that i had suspected i had, so i felt like i had done a good job looking into it myself
0.928600	I can't say that I've had a significant experience that would demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues. I have a general knowledge and attempt to get some regular exercise, but always ask relevant professionals because it's better to understand what I don't know than to not know and think I know.
0.714300	I fell out of a tree and hurt my neck. I didn't actually think I was hurt that bad but I made myself stop what I was doing and think about it.  Then I realized I could have hurt myself badly even if it didn't feel like it at the time. I ended up having somebody take me to the hospital (they didn't think I was hurt much either).  I ended up have a shattered vertabrae in my neck.  good thing i went to the hospital.
0.928600	I don't really have any experiences that demonstrate medical knowledge.  I just try to do what my doctor and the government tell me to do to maintain good health.  Overall, the strategy has worked, and I feel that I am in good health.
0.928600	A few years ago, I found out my dad had diabetes. Now we know more about it and my sister and I are more careful with our health so that we don't get it in the future.

0.714300	I actually do not have very much experience about any particular medical issues I have had many medical issues as have my family but we were so busy trying get to figure out how all the systems worked that it was hard to focus on the actual medical issues.
0.928600	I don't have any extensive training or education on health or medical issue. My experience is very limited to just what I learn on the internet and from my doctor. Basic diagnosis of a typical cold, fever, flu are very simple to figure out. Any abnormal pain in the body will require a doctor visit. If it's just something I am not familiar with, a visit to the doctor will usually answer the question.
0.500000	When it comes to physical there are not that many. But it's more of the emotional ones that I have a better understanding of.
0.785700	I once had UTI in a row within couple of months.  Before I sees the doctor the 2nd time, I research information from the internet.  I don't use FB, I use Mayo clinic or Wikipedia.  Anyway when I met with the doctor and I start to ask him questions and telling him about when I find from online.  His answer to me was, you possibly know more than me since you researched the topic.
1.000000	After becoming dehydrated my heart was beating more rapidly and harder. After drinking plenty of fluids it went back to normal.
1.000000	I had a swollen lymph node a while back that was not tender to the touch, and I had no other disease like symptoms.  the doctor thought it was best to remove the lymph node and biopsy it for lymphoma.  the results were negative.
0.714300	I had some issues with anxiety attacks after eating. I realized that these were happening when I would eat a lot of carbs. It led me to learn about hypoglycemia and the effects of low blood sugar on the adrenal system
1.000000	During my last visit to the PCP's office, I was asked to fill out a new form of medical history. I found that most of the terms showing on the form seemed to be familiar. I did not have any troubles to complete the form. This was very different from the first time when I was asked to do such a thing.
0.785700	I had cancer at a younger age and through that episode I learned a great deal about treatments and the advantages of lifestyle changes, proper nutrition, etc.  I read about my disease and gained enough knowledge that when my Dr's spoke about meds and treatment I understood fully 
0.857100	I saw the history of weight gain within my family, and also saw that I was starting to gain weight. I decided that while I had not gained a significant amount of weight yet, and while my schedule best allowed for it in the stage of life that I was in (i.e., I had a lot of free time), I wanted to take matters into my own hands and gain control of my weight before it became harder to do so. I exercised and took better care in terms of watching what I ate, and was able to gain control over my weight.
0.500000	The only situation I can remember right now is that once I helped my mother understand the instructions for a treatment that she needed to have at home
1.000000	In my early 30s I got serious about taking care of myself. I started going to the gym consistently. I started building muscle, my cardiovascular fitness improved, I could do more activities without getting tired and stopped having dizzy spells. I started reading diet-related articles, reading nutritional labels and cutting out saturated fat and excessive sugar, and increasing protein intake. I replaced fat with muscle and my energy increased.
0.928600	Several years back, I had an outbreak and tested positive for herpes. I knew that the virus can have long dormant periods so I did not jump to conclusions about my wife because it could have been either one of our previous partners that transmitted it.
0.857100	My husband and I are currently trying to get pregnant. We tried a new method called invocell. During the process, 12 eggs were able to be retrieved and inseminated. At my age, 80-90% of those should have become embryos. Unfortunately, only one did and it did not implant. This means that something is wrong with my body that caused so little of those to become embryos.
0.857100	I am diagnosed with schizophrenia and am fairly knowledgeable about the disease. I enjoy learning about it and having knowledge about it.
1.000000	One night about three months after I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, I took 20 units of Humalog (short acting insulin) instead of 20 units of Lantus (long acting insulin) before bedtime. My boyfriend got upset and called 911. I ended up in the hospital for three hours having my blood sugar tested every half an hour, and paid $700 for the privilege. The next time I took the wrong kind of insulin at night, I did the math, made the appropriate amount of toast, slathered it with honey, and didn't tell the boyfriend.
0.928600	When my sister was very young she choked on a marble. I had my little brother start the Heimlich maneuver right away while I called 911.
0.642900	A time when my cousin was worried that he might have a serious health issue. I told him to calm down and to stop reading things online and to just go to the doctor.
0.571400	I have an auto-immune disease and I researched to learn what to do, eat and which medication would make me feel my best. I also spoke to others with the disease and got input from them as well. I also found a doctor who helped me understand my disease better. 
0.857100	When I delivered my third child, I went into the hospital knowing exactly what to expect. I was prepared to fill out all the paperwork given to me, had all my medications noted, and had a very seamless delivery since I had been through it twice before. I was even allowed to leave after one night instead of the usual 2-3 night stay since I knew what to do. 
0.857100	Started eating diced garlic for a cold about 17 years ago and...I haven't had a cold, flu, sore throat or any similar illness since then. There are of lot of studies that back up the use of garlic as an anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal medicine. Dice 2 cloves finely, let it sit for 20 minutes, eat with some peanut butter or other fat. If you already have a cold repeat for 3 or 4 days. If you're not ill do it occasionally anyway to boost your immune system.
1.000000	I was seriously injured when I was 24. I subsequently had to go through many tests and medical procedures which has given me much higher than average knowledge of doctors and medical procedures. I have an artificial disc in my back, arthritis in the facet joints, scarring on the nerves, and other problems that I still suffer with due to this injury and it has been over 16 years. 
1.000000	I fell on my right hand one night and heard a pop. I knew I broke a bone in my hand - not just a sprain or minor injury - because my finger was unable to bend without pain and my knuckle was misplaced.
0.928600	One time I demonstrated knowledge of health issues by helping care for my cousin who has diabetes. I researched and asked questions, and learned where her blood sugar levels should be and what she could eat and couldn't eat at certain times and helped her measure her blood sugar.
1.000000	I explained to a doctor how h. pylori causes gastric cancer and is considered a dangerous carcinogen by the World Health Organization.
1.000000	I have to keep track of my dad's health information such as weight, body temperature, and medications after he received a liver transplant last year. The anti rejection medicine that he takes has to be taken every 12 hours for the rest of his life and he has to adjust the dosage based on his monthly blood work. I help him a lot because I want him to stay healthy and I enjoy helping him.
0.857100	I am able to help my mother manage her blood sugar by testing it after a meal and ensuring that it is less than 180 mg/dl
0.928600	When I started having pain in my elbow and forearm, I did some research and discovered it was possible I had cubital tunnel syndrome.  When I went to the doctor, they confirmed this diagnosis.
0.714300	All of the years I have worked as a nurse. Twenty years is how long I worked on  medical floor in acute care. Experience is everything.
0.928600	When I recently went to the doctor for mild depression, the doctor discussed several different treatment options with me.  I was already familiar with the different types of medications used to treat depression which helped me to make a decision with the help of my doctor.
0.642900	Taking care of my mother's medical issues. She had lung cancer and never smoked a day in her life. Six long years and over 125 chemo treatments. spent a lot of time in doctors offices.

0.571400	I cant say for sure that I have had an experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues. I prefer to trust my doctor and/or nurses that are available to demonstrate their knowledge.
0.214300	When I was pregnant with my daughter. I was given instruction to perform the test at home and needed to calculate my intake of sugar and carbohydrates. I was able to do it my self and I was able to understand everything
1.000000	I recently had to tape off of some medication. First by taking half my dose for the first 7 days, then  1/4 of my dosage for the next 7 days. After the first 7 days I also started my new medication. I was able to tape off the old meds and begin the new meds exactly as prescribed. 
0.857100	First, I have a degree in Psychology and i'm a certified Professional Educator in the state of Florida with certifications in Biology and General Science.

0.928600	I went and got a flu shot to lessen the chance of getting the flu, and also lessen the symptoms if I did get the flu. It's important for everyone to get vaccinated, especially to protect those who can't.

0.785700	A few years ago I had a friend that was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and she was admitted into a cancer treatment center. She was very worried about what kind of processes and procedures she would go through. I was able to talk to her about what she may experience because my father was also diagnosed with cancer and I watched him suffer through it for 6 months going through all sorts of different treatments. Because of my experience with my father I was able to talk to my friend about what she can expect and how hard the process is going to be.
1.000000	I can tell the doctors the side effects of many antibiotics and what drugs you shouldn't take with them. I know drugs in clinical trials that the doctors don't know about. I am the mother of two children with serious health conditions. This is a huge part of my life. I run a support group for others dealing with the same things. 
1.000000	i noticed i had some sort of rash under my arm when i first started college.  i did some research online using several reputable websites.  i figured out what i probably had was a mild skin problem called eczema.  i saw that a doctor can prescribe a cream for this.  i made an appointment and my doctor prescribed a steroid cream and it worked great.
0.928600	A partner I had at the time was starting to show signs of an Addisonian crisis (she was diagnosed years before with Addison's disease), and was starting to become delirious. I injected her emergency medication into her thigh and we went to hospital. 
0.928600	there Was a time that I caught a food borne illness and was throwing up every five minutes for 5 hours. I was so pale and so dehydrated that I knew I had to go to the hospital. I had my husband drive me to the hospital so they could give me nausea medication and rehydrate me. They said that if I hadnât shown up to the hospital there would have been dangerous being so dehydrated.
0.714300	I used the best statistical anaylsis I could to determine the answers to the questions.  I really don't know how any medical knowledge would help in this scenario because these were all math problems.
0.785700	I've had 2 children delivered vaginally via induction and had stitches afterward. I take medication for depression and anxiety and hypothyroidism. One time I cut my leg open and had to get 15 staples to close it.

0.857100	Once when I was visiting my father he began to have numbness in his extremities and moderate chest pain. He believed it was just heartburn, but I convinced him to go to the doctor and he did in fact have a mild heart attack. From that point on I was instrumental in maintaining his cardiovascular health by helping him maintain a diet and exercise. He is now much more conscious of his health and willing to consult a medical professional about any questions he may have concerning his (or any immediate family/friends) overall wellbeing. So, by demonstrating applied knowledge concerning heart health I have effectively prolonged my father's life and very likely those of the people he spends his time with.
0.928600	I know when i catch cold, what I need to take and what to do. I do not need to go to see a doctor while I had a fever.
0.642900	When I was 24 years old, I went to the doctor to get my yearly physical exam.  Up to that point, I had been having them for 6 years without any issues but this time, the doctor called me the following week to tell me that I had an irregular pap smear and that the pap had shown that I had precancerous cells.  Because I had taken anatomy for 3 years and I was pretty enlightened on how the different type of cells all line up in  woman's reproductive parts, I instantly knew that it was serious.  I did not complain or argue when he got me into a specialist for the following week.  The specialist advised that he had to do a LEEP which again, I was familiar with so I had some comfort only because I knew what the process entailed.
0.357100	Not too long ago I was told that I had scar tissue on my liver.  This was caused years ago when my gall bladder ruptured.  I already knew what scar tissue was and how it could affect my liver.
0.571400	I have very little knowledge of medical issues.

At the time, a doctor I had did not tell me to make any lifestyle changes, instead just put me on medication which had me sleepy all of the time.

0.785700	I was told all kinds of things by emergency clinics but they could not pin point a certain condition I had. For example, I would experience flu like symptoms for days and even weeks before the symptoms would slowly go away.

I elected to go and went into cardiac arrest before we got to the hospital

0.928600	"A few years ago, I was experiencing extreme pain in my left testicle and found a lump on the back of it, which I know isn't an indicator of testicular cancer. I looked up problems with the epididymis and found, unsurprisingly, that there is a condition called epididymitis, and I knew right away that ""-itis"" means that something is inflamed, so I knew from the name that I was experiencing an inflammation of some kind. I went to the doctor who confirmed the diagnosis and gave me an antibiotic. After my first time taking the medication, I recognized that I was having an allergic reaction and took Benedryl to help slow it down until I could get ahold of a doctor, and I managed to get through the situation without needing to go to a hospital or back to the doctor's office."

1.000000	I have been on clonazepam for years (for insomnia). Due to a mix-up, the prescription lapsed. Due to the fact that I had been on the drug for so long, my body experienced withdrawal.

End of withdrawal, which can be scary even if you know what is going on.

1.000000	"A common situation is when a friend of mine asks for advice on dealing with a running-related injury, such as ankle or knee pain.

0.857100	A few years back there was a time where I had an abnormally large lump on my lower back that constantly itched, had a pain around the lump area. Aware of what it may be a cyst of sort, I searched on the web symptoms as to what it actually could be whether or not it was one. Through a thorough search I noticed all of the symptoms were lined up with what I assumed at first and waited it out a few days since it said that it could possibly burst on its own accord and there's not much to worry about aside from going to the emergency room of it actually does burst. So when it finally did on that day I was not only relieved that it wasn't any other sort but confident in my own initial observation.

I was sick for months and kept telling people it was that (since I get it a lot) but people doctors included, kept saying it was just a bad cold. I mean, I know myself and I knew it was bad.

0.857100	I recently went into the doctor to get tested for allergies and had to have some pretty high level conversations with my doctor regarding what causes my allergic reactions to medication. I felt that I grasped about 90% of the conversation.
0.785700	I used to work as an assistant in a dentist office many years ago. My primary duties included sanitizing work, but I was also able to shadow the head dentist on numerous occasions. 
0.928600	My boyfriend at the time was having stomach pains.  They got worse and worse until finally I convinced him to go to the ER.  When the doctor pushed down on my boyfriend's belly and let go suddenly and my boyfriend gasped out in pain at the release, I knew immediately they were going to prep for surgery (and they did - it was appendicitis).
0.571400	I have had some personally specific injures and illnesses that I think i know a little more about than other ones but aside from that I dont have anything to go off of.
0.500000	I always have been very careful at getting valuable information on health issues. This is the reason I always have a solution when it comes to people who suffer from something and need advice.
0.571400	I had to go to the doctor last year when I was having upset stomach and feeling very anxious. The doctor thought it had something to do with my kidneys, but I just had a feeling it was anxiety. I think I was right because it went away when the stress went away.
0.785700	Being pregnant with twins gave me multiple opportunities to demonstrate my knowledge of health and medical issues. I had to ask lots of questions and advocate for what I knew was best for me. 
0.785700	Once I caught a nasty GI bug which came on suddenly and caused a lot of fluid loss.  Due to previous experiences with dehydration, I was able to recognize when I was losing too many electrolytes and got a friend to take me to the emergency room, where I spent 9 hours getting rehydrated.  If I hadn't known the signs (rapid heartbeat, weakness, skin not snapping back) I would have been in more serious trouble.   
0.714300	I was having an anxiety attack, but knowing what an anxiety attack is, I was able to calm myself down and work through it, without the feeling of dread like I was dying
0.357100	I have always liked reading about these topics. Besides i have dealt with some sick familiars and I've been part of their medical visits so I've learned a few things in the last years. 
1.000000	I went to nursing school and earned a degree (associate degree in science,  nursing). I have been a Registered Nurse since 2010. I am now a Nurse Case Manager.
0.857100	I went to a doctor and he told me I had type II diabetes. He recommended some drugs to me, even though I knew it was caused by being overweight.

0.571400	When a friend ask me about an issue that she had. She was told that her child had problems with nosebleeding that occurred rarely. I told her that he looked fine and to get nasal spray soften his nose. It worked perfectly and he felt even better after that incident.

1.000000	I was in a bad car accident several years ago and have had multiple abdominal surgeries up to this point.  I can and have talked to the doctors about what previous surgeries and procedures were attempted, why they theorized they failed, and I know what options I have to treat my underlying issues moving forward and have explained these during the consultations.
0.928600	My relative had two strokes last year and I assisted her with her recovery. I attended doctor appointments with her and I explained things that she did not understand to her. I helped put the doctors words into a language she could relate to. Also, I helped her ask questions so the doctor could understand what she meant. 
1.000000	When my doctor and I worked together to figure out my anxiety.  For the most part, I was telling him what I thought and he was agreeing.
1.000000	When I was pregnant, we found out my son was breech, and could not be turned because he was stuck in on one side, the doctor was explaining the c-section procedure, but I was already familiar with the procedure because my wife, who carried our other children, had already had one.
0.857100	I have my Master's Degree in Chinese Medicine. In order to obtain said degree, I had to learn a good bit of Western Medicine. In the state I graduated in and practiced in I was considered a primary care physician. I was able to diagnose diseases and refer patients out to western doctors when I felt the need to do so. I have learned a good amount about health in general and medical issues.
0.571400	There have been several times that either me or someone I know has gotten sick or hurt, and I have treated it myself long enough to drive to the doctor's office. When I get there the doctor says that I treated the problem correctly.
1.000000	Since I like to read about psychiatric illnesses and pharmaceuticals as a hobby, this knowledge is demonstrated whenever I visit a psychiatrist.

0.857100	i work in a doctors office, i see charts, systems and patients all the time. I also talk to doctors and nurses all of the time. Most of my knowledge is from school as well as work experience. I have experiences all day long with his. 
0.857100	Anything I know about health comes from  my own research on health issues.  I do not come from a super health conscious family so it was not something I learned growing up.
0.571400	I teach  preschool.  I often provide health information to parents of young children.  My information is based on current CDC information.
0.428600	Basically anytime I'm sick I know that it's because I've been in contact with sick people and they passed it on to me via some form of contact.
0.714300	When I went to take my test to sell health insurance. I studied very hard and I passed it on my first try. It wasn't easy, a lot of tough questions were involved.. But I managed to get it done and it really proved how much I knew because I passed it and got my licence. 
0.428600	I have been going to the doctor for a long time know and I have taken a lot of health classes in my lifetime. Therefore with my combined experience and knowledge I feel comfortable addressing certain medical issues with others. 
0.642900	I can't really think of anything that describe an experience, but I guess the awareness to know when to go to the doctor and when not to. 
0.785700	any of the doctors I have had over the years had little to no knowledge of the type of kidney disease I had and I was forced to explain my condition and provide littiture about my illness 
0.785700	As I ave mentioned in early blobs I have Congential Adrenal Hyperplasia and Dystonia both conditions I wa born with.  In my early teens I developed asthma and mental health problems and since have had way to much interaction to come away less than jaded.  Though these questions are more about maths than healt.

0.928600	My aunt was diagnosed with diabetes after she retired from work. Through this period, I helped her to properly measure her insulin and inject it and I also made sure she kept on top of her pill medication and prescriptions. I often took glucose readings for her and explained how important proper eating and exercise was for her condition.
0.500000	When my sister was little she had a lot of issues.The doctor would diagnose her with inner ear issues (not infection) to behavioral issues, but I read about sensory processing disorder and thought it sounded like what she might have. I told my mom about it and she asked the doctor how to get her tested. The doctor said it was a made up condition to explain behavioral issues but my mom asked for another opinion. That pediatrician referred her for testing and she not only got a diagnosis of SPD but a few years later we found out she has autism. If I hadn't pushed my mom to have her tested it she might have missed out on early interventions and her sensory issues would be labeled behavioral.
1.000000	I have a young daughter that had food allergies when she was very little.  It took many doctor visits and some research on my own to figure what was going on
1.000000	I was recently diagnosed with pre-diabetes. I learned that having blood sugar under 100 is good. I now test my blood sugar twice a day and know if my readings are good or bad.
0.642900	I mean, most of it is common sense. I'm no where near as knowledgeable as a doctor. For the last 10+ years, instead of spending a bunch of money to go see someone who is only worried about getting through the day, I will just look online. If something weird is going on with my body, I will look online and gather knowledge. 
0.928600	I went over the paper work when bringing my daughter into this world.  Filled out all the insurances.  Worked with my wife in signing documents in the hospital and squared away every issue the doctor brought to us.
0.857100	when the doctor told me of my arthritis and ha i would have to do to cope with this condition and how to live with it.

0.714300	I went to the doctor and they told me I was at high risk for high blood pressure. They told me to decrease my intake of salt to a certain degree but didn't explain further. They also told me other factors can relate to HBP but didn't further explain. I had to rely on the internet and was overwhelmed. 
0.857100	I cannot recall a time when I was solicited for medical knowledge until now when I took your survey.  I would only casually discuss such things.  I have no professional credentials.  Only my own knowledge.
0.928600	I rarely seek medical advice from doctors. My last two visits were completely a waste of my time and money. So I have no such example to give you. 
0.642900	When I was pregnant with my kids I always did a lot of research.  Whenever I went into doctors appointments I always knew what could be wrong and what the treatment would be.
0.785700	I'm not sure if this really counts but a while back in college I noticed that I had put on significant weight and I was more out of breath than usual. I also noticed that I became a lot more thirsty and lazy than usual so I stopped and considered my risk factors. I know that my family has a high history of diabetes and hypertension (and high cholesterol), so I took it upon myself to buy a blood pressure monitor and measure my blood pressure over a period of a week. It was not favorable, so I talked to a nutritionist and made a healthy eating plan as well as an exercise routine. By monitoring it further, I successfully decreased my blood pressure significantly and it has remained in safe levels since I have continued my routine.
0.857100	My dad had problems with his foot after having surgery. This was many years later. He couldn't walk on his foot. I had a coworker that had gout and was experiencing the same symptoms a couple years earlier. I told him that might be what it was and it turned out to be gout.
1.000000	I honestly don't really think that I have any. Outside of regular checkups I haven't ever been to a hospital. I guess the closest thing would be that I have a daughter, and I've had to read and talk to doctors about her. However she's only been to hospital once for something other than I regular checkup so I don't know how much experience that really gives me either. Overall I think just my general ability to understand things is probably my best experience.
0.785700	In my younger years I have been a Master Scuba Diver. That implicated that I had to be up to date with Medic First Aid, Rescue Diving, and I am also a license Oxygen Provider and trained in Enriched Nitrox Diving. I have had a few real rescues in that time and fortunately they all worked out good.
0.785700	Last year I had an extremely sharp pain in my gut on the right side. I thought that I might have a kidney stone. I knew that it could be serious, so I went to the hospital. I ended up having a kidney stone, but it would be passable. They offered me opiate pain medications but I decided not to take them because I know that they have addictive properties.  I ended up passing the kidney stone several days later.
0.785700	I GAVE BIRTH TO 2 SONS, AND BOTH BY VIRGINAL BIRTH. I ALSO BOTH TIME GOT THE EPIDURAL TO HELP WITH THE PAIN. I AM LUCKY THAT I AM NOT ALLERGY TO ANY OF THE DRUG SO IT'S FINE FOR ME TO GET THE EPIDURAL.
1.000000	My brother was shot in the chest in an attempted robbery and i had to help my parents discuss with the doctors everything that was going on. I had to help them understand the complications and the permanent effects that he was going to have. 
0.785700	My doctor prescribed some pills for me. Before taking the pills, I noticed that the pharmacy gave me the wrong dosage. I returned the pills to the pharmacy without taking any of it.
0.857100	I had a situation where I had athlete induced hematoma. Because of this past experience I was able to recognize when I was having a side effect from that in a future event that happened.
0.785700	I guess when discussing different medical problems with my husband.  I have a different knowledge base than him.  We both bring different knowledge to the table but, I know more about things that I suffer from.  Also, different problems in my family.
0.785700	I have recently been experiencing very bad insomnia. I discussed possible factors with my doctor, and asked for bloodwork, which came back normal. I started charting my cycle, my alcohol consumption, my diet, and also considering my stress levels. After three months of tracking, I determined that alcohol was the main factor. I stopped drinking alcohol, and my insomnia has gone away.
0.928600	I think I learned some information when I started going to the gym regularly years ago. Terms like resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, pulse rate, etc. where in the fore when I took on the aerobic portion of my workout.
0.571400	When I was 35 I was feeling really bad all of the time.  I fell generally unwell, dizzy, headaches, thirsty all the time, unable to sleep well and just feeling blah.  I had a weird feeling I was diabetic so I started to do some reading about it for a few weeks and got as much information as possible.  I then made a doctor's appointment and told my doctor what symptoms I had and why I thought I had diabetes.  My doctor was impressed with my knowledge and scheduled a test.  A couple days later I found out I was indeed diabetic.
0.714300	When one of my daughters was ill, I knew that she was in a medical emergency situation as her fever shot very high. Though she was an adult, I knew she was incapable of handling this herself and rushed her to the ER, which the doctors said was good and immediately gave her treatment to bring down the temp safely and quickly. I was her advocate and wouldn't stop explaining her other symptoms, which they ran extensive tests on after I insisted and found the root cause. It was at that point they were able to correctly give her the medicine to properly treat her condition.
0.857100	This is difficult to identify. I can only describe it definitively as the moment that I had children of my own to take care of. I care so much about them that I learn about things that I would otherwise ignore. I want them to be healthy; therefore, I learn as much as I can about health and medical issues. While not objectively logical, it is a function of love.
0.857100	My son had some kidney problems related to an infection and had blood drawn to test his kidneys. I received the lab results via email from the hospital laboratory was able to read and interpret them myself before I received a call from the doctor about them.
0.714300	When I go for sinus infections and bronchitis.  I always know that is what it is.  And I'm right most of the time.  I already know what treatments will be given.  I usually know how long it will take for the meds to kick in.
0.285700	Being in the military has given me a little bit more exposure to the medical and health issues. We practice a lot of medical procedures. Also going to Afghanistan has allowed me to work on casualities. 
0.500000	I have not had major medical issues, I'm not sure how to answer this question. I guess I know about eating healthy and some about how the body works, but not really medically related.  
0.928600	Recently my elderly aunt fell in the snow and suffered frost bite on both hands. After spending three days in the hospital burn unit, she was discharged home with both hands bandaged. The next day I went to visit her and saw that her hands were in poor condition. She had removed the bandages and several of her fingers had open, weeping wounds. I thought a couple of them might be infected. She refused to return to the hospital. Later a visiting nurse came and confirmed possible infection. She also convinced my aunt to return to the hospital. Fortunately she was able to make a full recovery.
0.714300	I knew the technical terms used by the doctor during my husband's cancer treatment.  I also knew the doctor was not keeping up with the latest science and he confirmed that to be true, given his schedule.
0.857100	My brother had been in the hospital and he didn't have insurance. We lived in NJ at the time and they add an additional amount onto your bill as an uninsured patients fund. I believe it was about 50% of the bill. I called around and after much effort discovered that uninsured patients weren't required to pay this part of the bill. It was only for insurance companies. I eventually received a form from the state of NJ and had my brother complete it and he mailed it. After we received the response, I still had to travel to the hospital and show it to the billing office because they were still refusing to adjust his bill. After I provided them with a copy of the response, they eventually adjusted his bill and he was able to pay the rest of the bill with the assistance of a plan he had that paid him for every day he spent in the hospital (about nine days). Sorry, this is the only experience I had that was related to your question.
1.000000	One time I was not feeling well and I was able to go online and look up my symptoms. The tentative diagnosis I gave myself matched what my doctor thought.
0.785700	A few years ago I got in shape and lost a lot of weight. I had a chance to demonstrate my knowledge of health when I helped a friend to also loose a few pounds with healthy eating and exercise. 
0.571400	When I had an STD scare, I had to look for issues and symptoms in certain places. I had to research and use my common knowledge on the issue.
1.000000	I wasn't feeling well and I went to the doctor. I had been feeling extremely tired and lacking  energy. I wondered if I had mono so I ended up going to the doctor. I ended up having mono, so I guess I was right.
0.928600	I have absolutely no idea what you're asking. But I'll give this a shot. I recently saw a neurologist for another shot at figuring out what's causing the muscle weakness I've been experiencing for more than four years now. I was able to give her a timeline of symptoms, severity of the problem, list the tests that have been performed, and ensure that she understood everything. I asked her about a specific test, and she agreed that would be a logical next step. 
1.000000	while at a restaurant, a patron was signalling that she was choking after eating a chicken wing. i recalled learning the heimlich maneuver in school, and i was able to successfully perform the procedure.
1.000000	One time, my nephew cut his hand and was very nervous.  I proceeded to not only stop the bleeding, but give him a lesson in basic first aid.  This involved methods for stopping bleeding, barriers to infection, and treatment of bruises or sprains.  He found this lesson interesting and informative and demonstrated these skills later on when injuring his ankle a few weeks later.
0.714300	Once my gums above a certaion tooth became swollen and inflamed and it really hurt. I had no idea what it was but then I realized that a cavity that I had neglected to get taken care of was to blame. I went to the emergency room and they took an x ray and confirmed that it was an abscessed tooth.
0.857100	I don't have any experiences that demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues. I have never faced a life experience that required me to know anything. I do know about basic health issues such as obesity or what it feels like to have high blood pressure but i've never been in a situation where i had to demonstrate it.
0.857100	A few times, I had feelings in my chest that might've been mistaken for a heart attack, but I knew I didn't have any accompanying symptoms, so I didn't panic just yet and call 911. Only once did I nearly have to use my CPR training on someone before EMT arrived. 
0.571400	I canât say that Iâve ever had knowledge of medical issues that Iâve been diagnosed with before being told about the issue and what it is. As far as health issues I know that itâs not good to smoke or drink a lot. I know that keeping active and eating right help aid in staying healthy things like that.
0.428600	I have a thyroid issue where my body doesn't produce calcium. Ive had this issue for about 15 years. I have to see the doctor regularly because it can cause seizures.
0.857100	Having gained some basic medical knowledge over the years I have learned to listen toy body. Specifically in response to stress. I have multiple autoimmune diseases and have learned much needed stress management techniques.
0.928600	An experience I has that demonstrated my knowledge of medical issues was when I cut my finger, and due to a rather large snowstorm, was unable to leave to possibly get it looked at. I went ahead and washed it out with hot water, and disinfected the cut on my finger. I also went ahead and elevated it slightly and applied pressure until most of the bleeding had stopped. I had somewhat skimmed the top layer of my skin off, so it looked a lot worse than it actually was, and in this situation I was able to control my thoughts and use basic first aid, rather than freaking out about the situation and causing myself to panic.
0.714300	My brother was recently in a car accident and in the years preceding I volunteered by Special Olympics, therefore I understood how to work a wheelchair, transfer a patient from a bed to the the chair, and other such apparatus know-how. 
0.714300	I have been dealing with persistent colds and respiratory infections and recently, I looked up what I can do to get rid of them and have been taking steps in making sure that I no longer deal with them.  I have been eating healthy, exercising and sharing my tips with friends and family.
0.928600	I had an auto accident a little over two years ago. I was rear-ended, and although I had no scratches or bruises, I did hit my head hard on the headrest and the rear impact caused pain in my back within the hour. I knew to apply ice and knew to rest until I could be checked out by a physician, which somewhat controlled swelling. Plus I knew to seek treatment immediately for rehabilitation and to reduce any muscle damage/scarring.
0.857100	When I started working out I learned that muscle building is most effective when gaining weight. After researching the topic, I found that weight gain is decided by one factor only: calorie count. The weight u gain is the difference between the calories you intake and the calories you consume. 
0.571400	I was seen by an orthopedic surgeon for a chronic ACL tear and osteoarthritis in my left knee. I did physical therapy, and when I was released from therapy, he told me I'd be back in a couple years for a knee replacement. I told him not to hold his breath. Came home, and started walking longer distances - 4-6 miles a day. I lost 20 pounds, and took several anti-inflammatory and ligament strengthening supplements, and kept walking. That was 16 years ago, and I still have my knee, thank you. By the way - the doctor I saw needed to lose about 50 pounds.
0.928600	Several years ago my father was in the ICU after being unfortunately caught in a store robbery. He was shot 3 different times and the medical issues were immense. I was successfully able to listen and understand the doctors as they were explaining everything to my family and I. Other family members came to me to explain it better in layman terms to them. 
0.714300	I had some heart related issues early on in life so I think I learned about cardio matters a lot earlier than most people which has helped me stay informed with health matters.
0.928600	When my wife had a baby I knew when to take her to the hospital due to the fact that we had had multiple children before hand.
0.642900	"My husband had severe pain in his left side after a pleurodesis procedure. He also had a fever, an elevated white blood cell count, and constipation. The doctor insisted it was just ""residual pain"" and the body's response to the procedure, while I kept arguing that it was more likely he had an infection of some kind. The doctor refused to do any blood work or send him for a CT scan to be sure, so we left that hospital AMA and went to another facility's emergency room. They found out my husband had a ruptured intestine, which required emergency surgery. He died 22 days later of sepsis from that rupture. Doctors don't always know everything and should learn to pay attention when their patients say something else is wrong."
0.928600	I damaged my toe nail. Based on a previous experience I understood that the doctors would only help to rip off the damaged nail. I opted to do this myself to save time and money.
0.785700	every week, when we have exams, my knowledge on medial issues is tested in more ways than i can explain. Boards, are the ultimate test of my knowledge i guess, and thats in 3 mnths. 
0.785700	I hade to remove my gallbladder afte experiencing pain and found that I had multiple gallstones so I went through many tests and a medical medical surgery
1.000000	In the past 1.5 years, I have lost 95 lbs. I had to pull from my knowledge of exercise and nutrition to achieve this. Additionally, I have had to understand how this affects my blood sugar, cholestrol, pulse, and heart rate. I have also had negative effects from my health goals in terms of exercise causing me injury and extreme pain. I have had to pull from my knowledge of how muscles, bones, and cells work to design plans that have gradual enough progress to prevent injury.
0.928600	I don't have a good knowledge on health medical issues. I take my doctor's advise or someone in the medical profession like a nurse. I know that because I am diabetic I need my blood sugar to be between 180 to 80 to be normal after eating 2 hours ago but within 4 hours or eating. In the morning before I eat it should to between 80 to 120. I know I should eat between 45 grams to 60 grams of carbs per meal, and 15 to 20 grams for a snack.
0.857100	I honestly cant think of one where I have but Im always willing to go the doctor if something is wrong
0.785700	my brother is a diabetic so once my friend was telling me he wasn't feeling well and he described  his symptom and   from my experience i could tell he had low blood sugar
1.000000	I went in for a gastrointestinal issue and it was deemed that I needed a colonoscopy.  I was given a list of medications to consume in preparation as well as a process to follow for the surgery.  Without any assistance, I took the list and prepared myself for what turned out to be a successful procedure.
0.785700	My family has a long history of diabetes, heart disease and breast cancer knowing this has helped me recognize sysmtoms, prevention and care for those disease also.
0.928600	I researched and implemented a medical protocol (long-term, low-dose antibiotic) to recover from the affliction of undifferentiated monoarticulating HLA-B27-related spondyloarthropathy, in which I eventually went into remission after 3 years (that was 20 years ago, so I'm calling it permanent remission), avoiding becoming a certain cripple with a compromised immune system, or dead, as my colleague's husband ended up, from T-cell lymphoma, having the same doctor as I but actually following his advice to take methotrexate.
0.928600	I was a caregiver for my mother-in-law when she had cancer. So I would go with her to her appointments and I always took along a notebook and made sure to ask questions and write down the answers. It was really important that we understood and remembered everything that was said. I am not sure if this is the kind of answer you are looking for, but I believe that the communication between a doctor and patient is the crucial factor. My knowledge is that I know that I don't know, so I have to depend on my doctor's knowledge and expertise.
1.000000	I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder several years ago. I had already suspected that diagnosis before going to to see the therapist as I had recognized panic attacks I was having as such, and also thought about other recent symptoms. I had looked up anxiety related disorders online, as well as various treatments (types of therapies, various drug treatments) before making my appointment. When the therapist diagnosed me and asked if I was interested in drug prescription as well as therapy I was able to ask about the various options, how they would affect my life, and what the possible side affects would be.

I felt myself over the course of a two week period becoming less energetic and more and more out of breath doing simple everyday things.

We were discussing antisocial behavior, and like most people mistakenly do, the people in the group thought that being antisocial meant that a person dislikes socializing.

In preparing for the visit, I listed out foods I had recently eaten as well any outdoor activities that may have had me come into contact with any plants or insects. In talking through the situation with the dermatologist, I mentioned that I had eaten a cherry pie very recently to which he noted that certain red dyes in such foods can cause random rashes.

0.642900	I started getting painful bumps along the left side of my forehead and over my eye. At first I didn't know why but by the second day I realized that this could possibly be shingles given that it was painful and only on one side of my face. I went to the doctor because it was so close to my eye and that concerned me and she confirmed that I was correct that I did have shingles. Everyone was worried that they would contact this from me but I knew that if they had previously had chicken pox they would not get this and if they didn't have chicken pox they wouldn't get shingles from me but would actually could get chicken pox from having contact with me. My dr. confirmed that this was correct.

1.000000	When I went to a doctor last year about painful anal fissures and haemorrhoids, I was already pretty well informed about them. This was due in part to having researched them in the past, both in how they relate to poor diet and how they can be caused or exacerbated by anal sex. I already knew going in that these would take a long time to heal, so I didn't expect a quick recovery. Furthermore, I was able to ask better clarifying questions during my appointment due to my prior knowledge, which helped me understand what I needed to do as well as diagnose the cause more quickly.
0.928600	I was a caretaker for both my mother and my father in the last years of their life while managing my own health issues.

1.000000	I was told that I am underweight for my height, as such that I needed to eat more. As such I had decided to exercise in regular intervals as well as I did not want to experience negative side effects associated with overeating. So with the help of online resources I formed a meal plan that fits within a recommended nutritional profile/caloric intake for my body size. As with the previous questions it involves some light mathematics and a bit of research, but it is very much worth it knowing that I am in as much control as I can get in the maintenance of my health.

0.500000	When I was younger I babysat for a friend of mine who neglected to tell me that her children just got over chickenpox.  Because of my age, she thought that I would have already been exposed to it.  At point, I had spent very little time around children and during my childhood, I was not often around a  lot of children because I grew up in the country.  On my way home from her house that night, I became very ill and knew right away that I needed medical care because my body did not react in the normal way this illness would have affected a child.

It definitely helped learning anatomy, otherwise I would be of no help to anyone.
0.642900	An experience would be when I was younger my mother was hospitalized and during that time my dad was living in a different country. He was not able to be here with us because of money issues, so I had to care for her for over a year and I had to learn how much medicine she had to take and every how many hours. When I would take her to her doctors appointment I had to make sure that the doctors knew that she was allergic to a few medicines so that they wouldn't prescribe her those and I had to memorize the medicines that she was already taking. This expanded my knowledge on medical issues and health. 
0.928600	Prior to my first spinal fusion, I had a list of questions for my doctor. He was surprised at the amount of research I had done in order to be informed. I asked specific questions about the XLIF procedure that he had proposed and what the difference in recovery times and success were in relation to other procedures. I asked specifically where the bone marrow would be drawn from in order to create the fusion. We had a great discussion and he was happy to answer what he referred to as very intelligent questions.
0.500000	I just had an xray done on my back to see if my scoliosis has worsened, i now have a double curved. It's still not bad enough to do surgery but they recommend physical therapy or it may worsen over the next 5 years. Knowing the risks, I can't afford physical therapy sadly, but if it gets bad enough my insurance covers surgery.
0.571400	I used to teach mentally ill about their illnesses in a group setting.  I have a bachelors degree in psychology which helped in this.

I wanted to go to the clinic, but he advised against it, as he thought it was just allergies.  I went anyways, and was ensured by the clinician that it was pink eye.  I was given medication to help get rid of the pink eye.  I think this demonstrates my knowledge of medical issues, because I was almost certain it was one thing, while a peer of mine thought it was something else.

Watching my intake I was easily able to lose 5 pounds with diet alone before changing my exercise to lose more.

0.714300	Having my dad ill and needing medical attention at home after a total knee replacement. He needed heparin shots and saline flushes through an IV.  
1.000000	I had a miscarriage. the dr was right away going to have me get a procedure, but there was no need for it. I knew this from my research... that it could happen naturally. When I told him that is what I wanted to do he said that is better (He never should have suggested it in the first place and I left him after that)
0.928600	I have learned a lot due to personal experiences with family members. My father had heart disease, and my mother, a brother, and my son have all had cancer at some point, which caused me to research and learn as much as I could about their respective conditions.
0.642900	I have asthma and my son has asthma. We were following the doctor's action plan but it wasn't working. I knew right away that he needed to go to the emergency room. He was admitted and they didn't start him on steroids. I told the doctor I knew he needed them.
0.928600	There was a time where I was having serious sleep issues and problems keeping my energy level up. I pretty quickly identified it as not normal and that I needed to get it looked at, and was able to see a doctor for it. I was able to get a diagnosis for hypothyroidism to help with my energy problems.
0.642900	My daughter was diagnosed with laryngomalasia which was her airway not completely opened. She eventually grew out of it. When i took her to the hospital they did a good job in taking care of her and describing everything that was happening.
1.000000	I volunteered as an ambulance worker in a conflict zone several years ago. We had to deal with injuries from bombings in the immediate aftermath and pick up of the people to be transported back to the hospital. I have no medical training, but I learned how deal with traumatic wounds, bleeding, concussions, and how to triage effectively. I also learned how to administer painkillers and tie tourniquets properly.  
0.642900	Two years ago, I twisted my ankle, and it immediately started to swell. I could still bend my ankle, and walk on it, without much pain. I thought I had a sprain, and applied ice for a few days then warm heat. Within a two weeks the swelling went down and able to walk without much pain. 
0.214300	it all started in high school  there  were  diffrent courses tooken and it just stuck with me all my life and by seeing what others have gone through .ive done alot reasearching on diffrent topics so i have better understanding about this stuff and had a gpa 4.0 3 years i got that from my mom..plus i know my diagnoses were .lots medical dental.oh heart condction ,athsma ....
0.571400	doctors are not always right. i was in a nursing home at 35 and told nothing could be done. through my parterns research i was treated off study and walk totally unassisted now. 
0.785700	I had a severe stabbing pain in the lower right side of my abdomen. It was unlike anything I had ever felt before, and left me literally doubled over in pain crying. I had a suspicion it was a kidney problem. I went to urgent care and they said, no it's nothing, just take an antacid. Less than 5 hours later, the pain was completely unbearable and I almost fainted while waiting at the ER. Sure enough, I was about to pass a large kidney stone and had an infection of my kidney as well. I was admitted overnight, given 3 bags of IV antibiotics, and a mild painkiller or antiinflammatory to hold me over while the stone passed.
0.785700	I had a hunch that I was a test subject for a certain rare disease and had to go through a lot of hoops because I couldn't exactly pinpoint what was wrong with me, it included a colonoscopy at age 21 and various other random bullshit since I had no idea what was wrong with me. I learned about various random problems and diseases that may have been unrelated until I eventually dropped everything and continued to live my life as if I didn't have any of those problems. Usually a doctors visit is really simple but I had one that made me rethink my health choices for a couple years in various ways. The disease was called PNH.
0.500000	I knew that i had something wrong with my uterus so i went to the doctors. They did a hysterectomy because i had a polyp as big as a grapefruit. They did a total hysterectomy because they weren't sure if it was cancerous.
1.000000	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health was when my girlfriend passed out due to low blood sugar. She became conscious and I instantly gave her candies I had nearby to bring her levels up and she slowly began to feel better. 
0.928600	I had kidney stones that I needed to pass, and I went to the hospital and told them that that's what I thought was happening. They told me that was not the case and that I had Swollen kidneys and that they need to put an IV in my arm to make them go down. 15 minutes later I started passing kidney stones.
0.714300	im not sure what to write here because i do not have a time in my life where i demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues.  
0.857100	reading of a ct scan of my lungs in search of cancers or other abnormalities and having the doctor explain the purpose and function of lymp nodes and what leads to calcification.
0.857100	I had a mysterious allergic reaction that I went to the doctor for. I was having a very delayed reaction (5+ hours later) so I started keeping a food log everytime this happened. I went to the doctor with my food log so I could show her exactly what food it was. I had also researched why the reaction to this particular food happens and what to do about it and talked to her about that. I went in pretty much knowing what the problem was just looking for a solution. 
0.285700	i dont understand any of this stuff so now i have to respond to what i dont know. what kind of survery does thats. i only know my health has gotten better in the man months and i feel better as well. so how do i respond to statistics that mean nothing to me
0.785700	many members of my family have health issues that I had to learn about to help them keep on track. I have had to look a lot of information up also to make sure my kids are going to be alright when they are not feeling well. 
0.857100	I have had parents and siblings in the hospital a few times throughout my life, which has helped me gain experience speaking with doctors and nurses.
0.928600	I recently went to the doctor because I had lost 20 pounds unintentionally. My doctor thought it might be related to a thyroid problem but I want to get my cortisol checked to see if it was an adrenal issue. She then ordered both of those tests. 
0.714300	thankfully most of my knowledge of medical issues has been fairly innocuous things like how to tell the difference between cold and flu or what foods are best for sinus infections. 
0.714300	My brother was diagnosed with Muscular dystrophy and I use to help with him by providing nurses who were unfamiliar with disease with relevant information on how to deal with certain that issues that arises with dealing with individuals with muscular dystrophy.
0.500000	I don't really think I have had this other than knowing when not to, or when to call a doctor depending on the symptoms I am having the temperature. I haven't had this happen other than this though, so I'm really not sure what else to say about it. 
0.857100	I was able to tell a coworker what condition that they might have. They told me about some symptoms that they were experiencing. I was able to help them reach a diagnosis. 
0.642900	A time I demonstrated knowledge is when I became pregnant again, and because it was my second pregnancy I was more experienced. I knew of the issue and what steps to take for each trimester.
0.642900	My brother was once hit by a car when we were biking to school, and the driver got out of the car to help him. I ran to his side, and made sure to tell my brother not to move his head/neck, and told the driver not to move him as well. I knew in doing so, much more damage could be done. 
1.000000	I had major heart surgery in 2006 to repair an aortic aneurysm, replace an aortic valve, and install a pacemaker.  Within a month of exiting the hospital, I suffered a DVT and had a bout of ventricular tachycardia.  After 12 years of ongoing monitoring and medication, I have gained a significant knowledge of the state of my own health.  I have also had other surgeries, and currently suffer from an arthritic damaged knee that needs replacement.  At sixty five years old&lt; I guess it is just the cumulative knowledge that a person gains through these experiences which has added to my health knowledge.
1.000000	After much research and review of my symptoms, I was fairly certain that I had multiple sclerosis. Soon after that, I was officially diagnosed with the disease.
0.928600	A few years ago I was experiencing a lot of pain, swelling and redness in one of my legs. I was knowledgeable in symptoms and causes of blood clots and that they can be deadly if not treated immediately. I went to the ER and I was correct that I had a blood clot in my leg.
0.928600	I just had shoulder surgery. I researched recovery periods, alternative treatments and risks of doing nothing. In the end I chose surgery.
0.571400	I had a pap smear come back abnormal once. I knew not to get worried till after I had it done again. I was right not to get worried about it.
0.571400	I somewhat have knowledge about my diastis recti. I would look it up on the internet before asking my doctor and I found out what I had because I didn't know if it was a tumor or cancer. My medical issue was easy to diagnose and I understood way more about it before going to the doctor
0.857100	I really don't have a good example.  I have become knowledgeable with MS because a friend of mine has been diagnosed.  I researched and become more knowledgeable on the subject because I wanted to help her. 
0.857100	I went with my dad to a doctorâs appointment because he has high cholesterol. The doctor told him that he needed to lower his cholesterol to a certain level. After we left the office my dad looked at the results of his blood work and believed that his number was within the range of what the doctor recommended. I showed him that he was looking at the recommended amount and not the results of his test. His actual cholesterol was way too high. He would not have known that if i did not get with him
0.928600	I noticed one tiny drop of blood in my urine a while back.  I had a long bout with bladder cancer years ago so I first made an appointment with a urologist for a cystoscopy.  That was negative so I then went to a gynecologist and it was discovered that I had endometrial cancer and I had a hysterectomy.  One little drop of blood would have been ignored for a time if i hadn't had the bladder cancer experience.
0.928600	Lowered blood pressure by changing diet. Found foods I liked that helped lower my blood pressure thst I enjoyed eating. Grains, fruits and vegetables are good for you.
0.857100	A handful of years ago, I was a bit overweight and decided to shed the excess through monitoring my calorie intake. I intentionally consumed around 400 calories less daily than I was previously taking in and lost the excess weight in a matter of weeks.
0.714300	I started doing a lot of research when I started having children. So I became very aware of different remedies and modes of service out there.
0.857100	I took the test to detect the presence of the prostate cancer antigen knowing the high probability of false positives.  I was prepared to consider not taking further action if the test came back positive unless further symptoms occurred.  The test was negative, so no decision need to be made.
0.571400	I used to take care of my grandmother. Her mind was starting to go and one day she started having really bad hallucinations and talking nonsense. At first, I thought maybe it was dementia, but then I remembered that strange behavior and hallucinations can often be a symptom of UTIs in the elderly. I called her doctor and was able to get antibiotics. 
0.857100	I was able to diagnose the issue when my cousins child was very sick. I was able to tell that she had early stages of typhoid fever and told my cousin to take her to the doctor as soon as possible because of the symptoms and the seriousness of the condition. 
1.000000	My father was a surgeon for decades and I read shelves and shelves of his medical books as a child and teen. In addition I take care to read medical information, good health habits and keep up to date with medical news.
1.000000	While practicing jujitsu I have helped a fellow practitioner that was injured make a sling and gave advice on heating and icing practices. In most sports I have done I have helped people out when they receive injuries, as I have experienced most of them myself. 
0.714300	An experience in my life that demonstrated that I have knowledge of health or medical issues is when I knew I needed mental health help and sought treatment for myself.
0.642900	I hurt my lower back quite badly, I knew that heat would relax the muscles to stop my back muscles from spasming so much, but its wouldn't help with the inflammation. So I decided to take ibuprofen for the pain but also because I know its a NSAID.  After the pain became more managable, I switched to acetaminophen since it would be easier on my stomach than ibuprofen. 
0.714300	I listen and learn when I go to the doctor. I read information on the internet and what the doctors give me. 
0.928600	A few months ago, I was searching for a new dentist that could do everything I needed, from cleanings all the way to endodontics and surgeries. After selecting one after a few weeks of research, I went in and was able to discuss a plan for my dental care with them. We were all on the same page because I knew what I needed and what I wanted from them and they were upfront about what they could offer me and payment. I've been to them a few times since and they've been great, haven't disappeared me, so I'm glad I did my research and was knowledgeable about what I wanted
0.857100	"This was many years ago but my mom kept getting these burning, itchy rashes accompanied by hot flashes in the middle of the night.  She went to an allergist that checked her for everything and told her it was allergies.  I was reading about vitamins one day and saw that high doses of niacin is used in cholesterol medicines and causes ""flushing"" as a side effect.  I asked her when she takes her cholesterol medicine and she said ""right before bed"" so I told her what I'd found out.  She had her doctor change her medicine and hasn't had an issue since."
0.642900	For years I have had to take regular PSA tests to determine if I was susceptible to prostate cancer. I additon levels that have gone up and down, I had an enlarged prostate which is a problem in itself - it can affect one's lifestyle since going to the bathroom several times a night can lead to tiredness and other problems -  but not necessairly life threatening. My doctor originally put me on a medication that dealt with the problems caused by the enlarged prostate but being uncomfortable with certain medications (this one I would have to take forever), fearful about the cost and after effects, I took myself off after one bottle. To make a long story short, after two bladder stone surgeries, I eventally had TURP surgery to deal with the problems caused by the enlarged prostate and while it was painful, I do not have to take any life long medication to deal with any problems.
0.500000	When I became very ill and everytime I ate I had pain in my stomach and had bowel problems I had hpylori and i had to go on a strict clean healthy diet no yeast and strong medicine I really  learned about my body and health and how to take care of myself I still struggle with stomach issues but have learn ways to keep myself healthier day by day 
0.714300	When I was due to give birth to my oldest daughter I was given the option of having her turned in-utero because she was breech presentation and I was a week overdue.  Because the Resident that I was dealing with told me there was only a 50% chance that the baby would stay head down until delivery and she had never done this procedure before, I chose to have a C-section the next day.  When my daughter was born, she was quite large and all agreed that my decision was the safest and most appropriate for the circumstances.
0.500000	I have read about mammograms doing more harm than good. I read about studies and made my own decision not to have one due to the false positives and stress that goes along with it.
0.642900	I was having very serious nausea for 3 weeks, I couldn't eat anything. Several people told me it was stress, or acid, but I knew it couldn't be that. I did lots of research and my symptoms were very similar to an under functioning gallbladder. I went to the hospital and had a test done, and it proved that my gallbladder wasn't functioning properly. I'm glad I went by my gut and not what others had assumed. 
0.714300	My grandmother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and I learned a lot from spending time in the hospital and hospice with her.  I would ask the doctors what things meant in her chart so I had a better understanding of what they were doing,
0.928600	When I had to talk to my mom about a rare lung disease she has. She doesn't know much about it and wasn't sure that she was getting the right treatment. I had to research it more, which I could do because I could understand what I was reading.
0.642900	When  I was experiencing pain in my jaw I instantly knew that it was an infection in my gums rather than the molar itself. I began to search for treatments and cleaned in between my gums and found a chunk of food that was causing the infection. I then cleaned my mouth with an antisceptic solution and the inflation went away in about a week.
0.857100	When my dad started displaying symptoms of pneumonia, I immediately had him rushed to the hospital.  If I didn't know the signs, he would have gone into septic shock.  My knowledge of health issues likely saved his life.
0.857100	My son complained of numbness in his pinkie finger. I asked him how his neck felt and he said it was stiff from using the computer. I told him he might have pinched his ulnar nerve and to raise his computer monitor. He did and the numbness went away.
0.857100	The flu hit my family last week.  We had our flu shots so our fevers weren't extremely high (less than 101).  The accompanying symptoms were severe fatigue, cough, nausea and an extreme sore throat.  I was concerned because in the past my children have had atypical symptoms for strep throat (pain, nausea but no fever). However, I knew that a cough wasn't typical either.  I watched my son's throat for a few days and there weren't any unusual signs until last Thursday night when white spots started showing up.  At that point, my usual wait and see on a fever and cough symptoms turned into a doctor's appointment.  I've learned to wait out viruses but not to mess with what could be a possible strep.  Thankfully it wasn't strep but I knew what to look for and be concerned from past experience.  
0.928600	I once treated myself for a sexually transmitted disease by ordering antibiotics I had looked up (by affect to body region). I found ciproflaxin for my bladder and urinary tract, and I found doxycycline for my STD health. After looking up how long a trial is of each, I was able to complete two weeks of dosing both. I then paid for a std test at my University Health Center and I tested negative twice, to which I was very happy. In my opinion you don't need a doctor, it's just 99% of people (including myself) will never share the same knowledge as one and medicine in it's concentrated forms can be very hard to dose and apply to select cases. I am glad doctors are around, as anything more complicated than the pills would be beyond me.
0.857100	My son had a sinus infection as a child and was having trouble breathing and my wife and i weren't sure what to do.  I turned on the shower, brought him into the bathroom and shut the door.  The steam helped clear his sinuses so he could finally go to sleep.  My wife was happy. 
0.571400	My experience of knowledge about medical issues is related to a heart condition I have. I am knowledgeable in general about it and about the medication I take for it. I know what the medication is supposed to do and what effects it has on my body.
0.714300	I had just had my third baby and was nursing him one night when I felt my left side go numb. I knew something was very wrong and the feeling lasted into the day. A few days later I could not walk and was slurring my speech so I went to the ER. I was positive I was having a stroke based on my symptoms but I passed the stroke test. After my MRI results came in they indeed saw that I had suffered from an ischemic stroke. 
0.571400	Honestly I probably get the most knowledge from watching documentaries on health and medical issues. Also two of my siblings are nurses and another one is in nursing school, so I never here the end of medical issues.
1.000000	I don't have much knowledge of health or medical issues, but I'm confident in my ability to figure out what I need to know when I need to know it, so I never worry about trying to figure medical stuff out ahead of time.
0.500000	When my mother passed out on the floor I made sure she was breathing. I did mouth to mouth CPR. I also ended up calling the ambulance because she was unconscious. 
0.785700	I have kids that get sick sometimes and we always have to make a decision about when they need to see a doctor or when they don't. I use my past experiences and current symptoms to make that decision. 
0.785700	I have virtually no knowledge of health or medical issues.  I once learned, in a community college course, how to do the Heimlich maneuver. I've never had any opportunity or reason to use it outside of that one instance though. 
0.928600	I have had eczema since I was a teenager, and I know that when I have a breakout that I can't control at home that the best thing for me is oral steroids. I have had doctors that have wanted to prescribe something else, but I usually insist that they give me the oral steroid.
0.857100	All of my knowledge is done through the internet. With how the internet is today you can search anything and many accredicted doctors will have information on what these symptoms can mean. People can also post on forums who have had the same issues and they openly discuss them for the world to see and learn from.
0.928600	I I had an abnormal cervical screening.  I was diagnosed with PCOS, inferitility, and IBS.  You just kind of pick up knowledge as you go.  The older I get the more I am diagnosed with.  You just pick up knowledge of your body as you go along.
0.857100	well, I think this survey very much demonstrates my lack of health knowledge.  I can't figure the majority of these what % of people got false positives.  I just don't know.  I don't know that it really matters to me, the statistics of it all.
0.642900	When I took a long flight I ended up getting a blood clot in my leg. This helped me learn a lot about blood flow into the extremities and the damages a blood clot can have on the human body. I also learnt how to lower the rick of getting one in the future. 
0.714300	I have an understanding of endometriosis pain, and getting endometriosis cysts because I have had them in my life. Before having kids, I never had any problem, but after my C section I developed pain that I could not control in my abdomen. After several tests I went in for surgery and ended up having a cyst.
0.642900	When my father developed blood clots in his legs - I was able to recognize the symptoms: pain, swelling, discoloration, warmth.  He thought he'd just pulled a muscle, but I convinced him to go to the ER.
0.714300	When I had my baby he had to stay in the NICU for 2 days. At first, I didn't understand exactly why, as it could have been a few reasons. It could have been because he had pooped before he was born so there was poop when my water broke. It could have been because I tested positive for Strep B. And it could have been because I had a fever during labor. I later figured out it was because of my fever.
0.785700	A time when I felt I had medical knowledge was when my child was very young. Her doctor told me that she had nothing wrong with her. I suspected she had a milk allergy and acid reflux. I took her to a different doctor and they confirmed my diagnosis.
0.714300	I am a type one diabetic on an insulin pump and medication to lower my cholesterol. I go to my doctor once every three months for check ups  
0.857100	I look up the side effects to my own medications to ensure that I am not having any symptoms that could result in me having serious complications in the future. A lot of major issues with medication start as minor ones.I saved my own life about a year ago knowing these signs. If I had waited any longer to go, or did not notice the symptoms, I would have died. 
0.928600	I started to be plagued by weakness, tiredness and shakiness, I noticed that the ends of my fingers were slightly blue/purple and remembered that that usually indicates iron deficiency, I started eating more iron rich foods and my symptoms went away in a few days.
0.714300	I worked at a retail store. Customers would come in and ask me for advice about what medicines to take since I worked around the over the counter medicine section. I was able to recognize the problems they talked about and was able to successfully recommend medicines or supplements.
0.928600	I had a sore throat for a few days. Then I looked at my throat and saw white dots and realized I had strep. I knew I had to go to the doctor.
1.000000	My doctor casually mentioned Kleinfelter's syndrome and was surprised that I knew what it was. I don't have Kleinfelter's syndrome, and I really can't remember why I read about it in the first place. We talked about it for a little bit and then moved on with the checkup. I have also printed out pertinent medical studies that I've found interesting on several occasions only to find that my doctor knew something about them already. Those moments were probably the times that fit this question the closest.
0.714300	I've done a lot of research into aerobic exercise and improving your heart health. I even knew a few things about the way potassium effects your blood pressure that my doctor didn't know.
0.857100	I was a psychology major in college so when I was diagnosed with Depression I knew what was happening to me.  It still affected my judgment and made me reluctant to seek treatment but when I did I knew I had to trust my doctors because of what I learned.  I knew medicine and therapy would be helpful for many with my condition but it does not always work for everyone.  I was more prepared for it than some others may have been in my position.
0.500000	After my mom suffered a stroke, I spent an extensive period of time learning about the condition and how to reduce its reoccurrence as well as the measures necessary to take if someone around you suffers from the event again.
0.928600	A time when I got a very serious cut and knew to tie a tourniquet to reduce excessive bleeding until I could get to the hospital.
0.928600	I have always believed to have reactive hypoglycemia. Doctors always told me I have low blood sugar but not as bad. Yet I lived with the risks and symptoms all my life. Finally 3 months ago after having a bad symptom, I found a doctor willing to do all the tests possible (unfortunate for me financially). He finally confirmed I have reactive hypoglycemia. And a lot of other health concern no other doctor informed me about before.
0.928600	Several years ago, I had what appeared to be a bull's eye rash on my abdomen. Having read about Lyme Disease in the past and having spent significant time in the woods in recent weeks, I reckoned that it was likely that I had a tick bite which should be investigated. I went to the doctor before any symptoms (other than the bite) of the illness manifested.
1.000000	There is not many experience where I had to deal with knowledge of health or medical issues. At times I have to read nutrition labels, or sometimes in college classes I must execute hypothesis testing where the scenario is often a new drug attempting to fall below the 0.05 p-value threshold
0.714300	I was diagnosed with B12 deficiency. I know that my grandmother had pernicious anemia. I assumed that I had inherited the gene that causes this from her and I was correct. I have pernicious anemia.
0.714300	I got tested for a couple of things some weeks ago. I knew all the procedures that needed to be taken and I did them myself. I also stayed calm knowing nothing was wrong
0.857100	A time in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues was when I began to get the flu and I knew that all of the symptoms I had were those of the flu and my diagnosis was correct.
0.785700	When two of my three children had breath holding spells as infants. I knew to hold them upright so they wouldn't faint and get hurt. I knew to then give them fluids and rest after.
0.642900	In basic training we had to know cpr and how to decontaminate contaminated people, animals, and objects. It was fun, but also serious. Not knowing the right steps could mean someone losing their life or a more serious outbreak of the contamination in question.
0.428600	I gave birth by c-section. So I know the procedures for that and the way in which things are done concerning that. 
0.928600	Any time I try to explain neurological disorders, every face goes blank. I try to break it down even further and make it more simplified, but it seems as though thinking on that scale of body processes is something most people I've come across just can't grasp. Most do not understand the ties between injury, fever, swelling, neuron misfires, cerebro-spinal fluid, etcetera. I have to know theses things due to personal medical history..
0.785700	One day I passed by a man lying in the street unconscious.  I recognized that glazed look on his face and came to the conclusion that he had a stroke.  I witnessed this before and am somewhat knowledgeable about strokes.  I immediately called 911 emergency and the came promptly.  They told me I did the correct thing.
0.571400	i was very dizzy and i knew by being told i have pots which causes issues with alot of a persons body so i knew that i had to sit down and drink water and go to the hospital  when i went i was dehydrsated and if yi stood up  wouldve passed out
1.000000	I was sick, and I knew I was sick. I didnt have the ability to go to the doctor right away, but knew that I needed to because my illness wouldnt go away. I believed I had a bacterial infection. When i finally got to the doctor a couple weeks later, he said I had a bacterial infection and gave me the medicine to clear it up.
0.785700	I recently starting experiencing very bad migraines.  I had to go through all sorts of tests to see what may be causing these sudden headaches.  I had a Cat scan of my head.  I also had blood work done to see if it was being caused by pre-menopause.  I learned a lot about my health during this process.

0.571400	I think about the time that I hurt my back. I knew that If I went to the doctor there was nothing that they would do besides tell me to put a compress on it. I decided that it would be a waste of time to go so I did the compress myself and in a couple of days my back was better. I was able to avoid the doctor.
1.000000	My partner's dog tore her dewclaw and it needed to be bandaged while it healed.  After some time of bandaging, it still wasn't healing very well.

0.928600	My son gashed his head on a car.  I remained calm and assessed the situation.  I applied direct pressure to the gash.  After a few minutes I looked at the gash and felt it was too large for me to deal with and took him to the doctor for stitches.

My mother asked me to design him a meal plan because he does not eat as he is told and as such gout is an issue he deals with regularly. I worked with him and, based upon my knowledge of how to eat with and treat gout, designed a meal plan with food that he likes and was agreeable to eating. This made a noticable difference in his gout symptoms and issues.

0.642900	I have a 2 1/2 year old so I deal with some sickness in him. I've only had to take him to the doctor one time when he was sick, because I know the ways to help your body fight the illness more efficiently. I do everything in my power before resorting to the doctor because there's only so much the doctor will be able to do. 
0.928600	I used to work in a healthcare company in data analytics. So I would have access to all of the patient information and procedural information for the tristate area to run predictive analytics as well as other things. I am pretty familiar with coding and procedures from a statistical stand point and what it means, so the numbers make a lot of sense to me. Additionally, I come from a family of medical professionals so if i had questions about a certain procedure i could always ask.
0.642900	I have had a problem with weight gain since my 2 pregnancies. I am aware that I have higher weight, higher cholesterol, and higher blood pressure as a result of this weight gain.

1.000000	My dad had a massive stroke 10 years ago and my mom and sister were in complete denial about what was happening.  They wanted me to help get my dad to his feet because they thought if he started walking he would be ok.  I recognized immediately what was happening and called 911. My dad lived but he was never the same again.  His doctor showed us a brain scan that showed only a quarter size area of damage in his right brain.  It's scary that a quarter size area of damage could change someone's entire personality.
0.857100	I went to the hospital complaining about light headiness.  The doctor told me that I had Hypertension.  He told me to diet and exercise before he considered prescribing me medication.  Ultimately my blood pressure returned to normal after following a stricter diet with exercise.

Of course, I don't have the license to clearly diagnose them and give them medical advice without an official diagnosis so I wait until the doctor can.
0.928600	In general, I would just mention that I help certain family members with their own medical and health needs. This could include doctor visits, completing paperwork, understanding how to take medication, etc.
0.714300	In my life, I have learned almost all of my knowledge of health from either my university classes or from medical websites online. The time this knowledge actually came into play was when I went to the hospital and listened to what hospital staff says to patients. Recently my father went to the hospital from an illness while visiting him with my mother the nurse came in to tell us what his condition was like. During the conversation, I had no problem trying to understand any of the basic terms or some of the more difficult medical terms that were discussed by the nurse.

It took the first repsonders awhile to get me out of the stuck car. This meant I ended up suffering from crush syndrome or Rhabdomyolysis. This is kind of a complicated injury. It required a long hospital stay and following my release from the hospital I had to do physical therapy in order to completely rebuild the muscle I had lost in my leg. During this time I was seeing multiple doctors for various problems caused by the injury. I had to  ask a lot of questions in order to find out the best way to treat the pain I was suffering through.
1.000000	A couple years ago I was discharged from the ER suffering from abdominal pain, and other weird symptoms like high blood pressure, and no insight really given as to what was causing this given by doctors. On my own, I was able to figure out that diverticular disease was leading me to experience eventual high blood pressure, and that it got worse the more that I ate, so I could avoid this by fasting when I began to have these kinds of symptoms. That's more than the doctors figured out, maybe I should be a doctor.
1.000000	I have taken many courses on biology and health in general. I think that I know a decent amount about health care.
1.000000	Over the past two years I have had two major broken bones through falls. In those experiences, my knowledge of health and medical issues, specifically related to bone and muscle healing and development, but also on a larger scale, have increased a great deal. 
1.000000	One thing that comes to mind is the fact that I show up each year for an annual physical.  While this seems like a small thing to many, people who think they are healthy should be getting annual checkups because you really can't always tell.  Even if you work out religiously and eat an extremely healthy diet, it's still vitally important to check in and make sure everything is actually okay inside of you.
1.000000	I don't know if it's really knowledge, because I did have to research to be sure and still go to the doctor for verification and treatment, but a few months after my daughter's birth I started having breast pain and woke up one night with terrible chills and fever. I thought it might be mastitis (I was breastfeeding) and after some reading online, found the symptoms sounded right. I went to urgent care, confirmed my suspicions, and got some antibiotics.
0.714300	Taking a course during college for food safety and illness prevention. We took numerous tests, courses and had information about the illnesses people can get from raw food, improper food handling and cross contamination.

0.785700	A couple years back I went to the dermatologist, but prior to that I did a lot of background search on what derms do and what they can provide for a patient. I already got a good understanding what they would prescribe me and therefore I knew how to take the prescriptions and what some of the side effects were going to be. I did end up getting what I thought I would so it really helped me out.
0.642900	When my mother was diagnosed with cancer, I was told that if I did not remove her from the care of one doctor and follow my knowledge I had on the signs and symptoms of kidney failure to send her to a new doctor. Then she would have died within days instead of her having the few months that she had.

0.642900	My son was diagnosed with fever seizures. I understood that when he had a fever that I had to watch out for this to happen.

0.642900	My experience in life would be that I was  a trained combat medic in the US Army, which in turn qualified me to be a paramedic in the civilian world if I chose to take the state liscensing test.
0.642900	Last year, I had a bout of diverticulitis. I had never suffered with it before, but I knew there was a possibility that it may show up. So I read on line, everything about the stomach, and knew that was it.
0.500000	I don't have an experience that demonstrated my knowledge on health or medical issues. I am always reliant on a medical official (doctor or nurse) to help me understand what is wrong. Short of colds, cuts and scraps I am not a professional and don't expect to understand what they know. I can tell the difference between a sprain or pulled muscle and something much worse but past that i do not have much experience.
0.714300	During nursing school, I did an internship with an Internal medicine Dr.  I was interviewing his patient before he went in to see her, and, while listening to her symptoms, I realized that she had all of the symptoms of an extremely rare disorder that I had just learned about that week in class. A week later, that Dr. informed me that my conclusion was correct, and she did indeed have that disorder.  
0.785700	My boyfriend was concerned about some sleep issues.

My husband and I researched progesterone and questioned why I wasnât on it. Turns out all the doctors thought I should be, but none of them did anything because they assumed one of the others had. So upon my urging we began daily treatment 
0.785700	One of my friends had to have a surgery because he had an abnormal swelling.

0.928600	I have a daughter and she developed a skin rash on her legs.  I took her to dermatologist and the dermatoglist said that she had allergies and prescriped a wide variety of medicines for treatment.  But I did research on the diagnosis and my daughter's problem simply didn't appear to be what was described online.  As a result, I took her to a regular doctor who diagnosed her differently and we used the medicine prescribed and the problem cleared up within a week.
0.428600	Hereditary issues arise in my family ranging from heart disease to thyroid. The thyroid issue can be affected at any age but the heart issues are later like menopause age, so i know what i can and can not help or try to minimize at best.

0.785700	My mother had diabetes. She was diagnosed in 1972. I was 12. I had to make sure she took her shot, and that she ate enough, went to the doctor and would call the ambulance when she had too much insulin. There were no blood monitors and it was a shot in the dark. Sometimes she was too high (the highest  was 1250, and sometimes she was too low (once she was 25). I grew up fast.

0.785700	I have a degree in medical laboratory technology and have spent many years working in the veterinary field. I am familiar with testing and medical diagnosis and procedures. Although, it is at times easier to talk to my veterinarian about my dog's health issues than it is to talk to my Dr.
0.571400	I had an issue with my arm feeling numb and could not use it for a few days. I went to the doctor thinking that is could have been a stroke. They ran tests and put my arm in a sling. I had read up on strokes and saw news stories online regarding strokes. 
1.000000	I had been put on a new medicine by a new doctor that I didn't really think I needed to be taking from what I had read. She was a very new doctor and I wasn't sure she really knew what to do. The next year when I went for my annual checkup, I saw an older doctor that had been practicing for years and he immediately said that there was no reason that I should be taking that medicine and I should stop. He tried to explain to me the reasoning thinking that I would be against stopping but I told him that I had thought the exact same thing.
0.500000	My mom has lots of health issues. I have worked in a couple offices that dealt with the same problems she has so I am able to help my mom understand better what her doctors telling her. When she does not completely understand or even believe what the doctors are saying are correct she can call me and I can tell her if Ive ever dealt with that before. Even though I do not have a lot of knowlegde about medical conditions I seem to know more then a lot of friends and family do. Also, as I'm sure most people use Google to search medical terms or symptoms. I search google for everything so that helps me help others and myself undersand medical stuff. I do know most doctors hate for their patients to search google for medical conditions. With that said most all medical conditions have the same symptoms as other conditions so we should  only take what we find on google or even hear from friends and family very lightly and make sure to always speak with a doctor. 
0.857100	I have explained to people what I do and use when I am not feeling healthy and or have a toothache, headache or other similar things. Other then that I don't go around demonstrating my knowledge of health or medical issues.

After hearing the explanation from him and hearing how the blood works with cholesterol, I was able to go home and explain all of this to my parents so they could understand. The ability to explain something so complex shows the extent that I understand what the doctor had told me.
0.571400	My knowledge of health and medical issues are when I had my daughter.  When I had her it was an emergency c section.  I had a condition called HELLP.  I didnt at the time know what that was until that day. I had extremely high BP.  I had to have blood transfusions and platelets.  I had to make sure from that point on I watched my intake of fatty foods so my liver would not be affected.  I have learned what fatty liver really is.  My dr test my blood now to make sure my liver is in the normal levels.  
0.714300	I have given advice to a lot of friends who have mental illnesses since I suffer from depression and anxiety disorder.  I have also researched my parents medical issues and helped educate them or clear up any confusion they have about their conditions or the medication they are taking.  Having to have surgery 4 times also helped me learn a great deal and help others deal with the same medical issue that I have.
0.714300	My tenant informed me he was experiencing chest pains.  I called 911 and had him rest.  I checked his pulse to make sure it was strong.  When the fire department arrived, I made sure that they had his medications to take to the hospital with him.

0.928600	I was able to get myself from 168 pounds as an adult to 215 pounds through diet and exercise. I was able to maintain a healthy blood pressure by monitoring my sodium intake. I was able to gain muscle by adjusting my caloric intake slowly so as not to gain fat while gaining muscle. Also dropped my LDL and raised my HDL through diet and exercise while gaining muscle through increasing protein and reducing carbohydrates. 
0.642900	When I was younger in school I remember doing health projects. I had the project boards (tri-fold boards) and my presentations were well researched and sited. Later in life, I can recall even myself having to be re-educated due to advancements in science.
0.928600	I was troubled by BPH for years so I constantly monitored my prostate health.

0.714300	Whenever i have issues with my health, i will often do my own research prior to seeking medical advice. Most of the time, if you look into certain things from reliable sources, you can find that most common health related issues can be alleviated on your own without an external help. 
0.642900	When I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis I was not given much instruction on how to deal with it on a daily basis other than to take drugs that had terrible side effects. I began to take the blood test and scopy tests results and learn what each thing meant. I went and got a blood review done and was able to see my cells and learn what the shape and distribution of my cells in the vial mean. I started to change my diet drastically and began taking natural substances such as aloe and ginger to reduce inflammation. Now I have problems still but I can better balance with the chart information and finding resources online I can go to the health store and try and help myself naturally.
0.785700	I was primary caregiver for my parents for 10 years before their deaths.  We were constantly at Doctors and hospitals with Alzheimers, MS, Parkinsons, Heart disease, Diabetes, etc.  
0.714300	I was once out camping in the wilderness with some friends and had been drinking quite a lot. We were cutting up firewood with a saw when my friend sliced his leg open pretty bad. Knowing the alcohol had thinned his blood and the size of the wound we immediately started with first aid of a tourniquet using one of our belts. Foolishly we had no real supplies for cleaning the wound besides vodka, which I knew was better than nothing. After cleaning the wound up it was clear this would not stop bleeding without some sort of suture. We decided to use a cotton strip of shirt over the cut and some duct tape to seal it shut. This held up well until we were able to make it to the hospital for some stitches. 
0.785700	"One year I went to my primary care physician and there was an option to learn more about diet.  When my doctor found out that I had checked that option, he said, ""You know plenty about diet, you don't need that info!"""
0.642900	In all honesty, I can't describe such an experience, because I DON'T have a great knowledge of health or medical issues.  I'm not a doctor, or even a med student. The only account I can give you is when I broke two of my fingers at work (due to a rolling machine accident).  The doctor said that he'd have to burn a hole through one of my fingernails.  I immediately understood why... it's a common practice to prevent clotting and swelling of that area. Sorry folks, that's it.  That's all I can think of.
0.571400	My wife likes to claim that she has cancer every time she feels sick. I keep telling her that she has 0 signs of having cancer, and that she just worries way too much about it. 
0.785700	I had to go to my doctor on 4 separate occasions at one point before she finally agreed to test me for mononucleosis, which I believed I had. At my first visit, she told me I was tired because I was depressed, and she prescribed an antidepressant. At the next appointment when I complained of pain in my side, she told me I pulled a muscle. At the next visit, I told her I believed I had strep throat as well, and she told me there was no sign of strep and sent me out the door. Two days later, I was back in her office, and she then tested me for both strep and mono, which were both positive.
1.000000	When my grandfather was in hospice care, I was able to understand what the nurses were saying about his health and how to take care of him.
1.000000	An experience that has demonstrated my knowledge of health issues is when I researched foods online, such as which vegetable are in the dirty dozen each year (have the most pesticide danger), so I know which vegetables should always be bought organic and which not so much.
1.000000	Recently I encountered (along with several other people) a woman lying prone on the sidewalk during a day when the temperature was less than 0 degrees Fahrenheit. More or less spontaneously, we made sure that she was breathing, that she had a heartbeat, that someone had called 911, and then we did what we could to make sure that she wouldn't suffer too much from the cold by warming her hands in ours, talking to her and making her comfort level as high as possible.
0.928600	"When my late father-in-law was dying of liver failure, I understood what the various symptoms meant in terms of the stage of the disease, and was aware of what would come next, and of his prognosis. For example, I realized that when he developed ascites, that this was a not a good sign and that he probably had limited time to live. When he later developed hepatic encephalopathy, I knew that his time was even more limited, and tried to help my mother-in-law in understanding this (as she was somewhat in denial about the severity of the illness). I never ""second-guessed"" his doctors regarding his treatment, I just wanted to understand what was happening. "
1.000000	When my mother in law (age 99, had a heart attack 20 years prior) complained of a sore shoulder and nausea, and her feet turned blue, I suspected that she was having a heart attack. It turned out that I was correct - she had a massive coronary and went into full arrest. 
0.785700	My medical knowledge tends to relate around lower back and foot pain. For a number of years I had experienced lower back pain at a young age and doctors just told me there was nothing to do about it. I then went to se a chirpractor and he was able to adjust my back over a number of sessions. This relieved a lot of the pain I was experiencing. A number of years later I started having really bad foot pain and was told by doctor that it was plantar fisciatus and gave me inserts. This did not help and I basically self diagnosed and firued out that problem was being cause by my lower back. Started to do a number of streches and eventually pain receded. Then went back to chripractor to get an adjustment and this totally removed the pain from my foot
0.714300	I think that the fact that I always stay on top of my health and I continue to read about health in general helps me in a positive way. I try to be in control of any symptoms I might have and to research things as much as possible so that I remain healthy. 
0.714300	When I have a headache or a sickness of some sort, I used to take ibuprofen or other painkillers like that. For the past couple of years when I get a headache or feel rough I will just drink lots of water and take it easy. I find that when I run a fever and leave a headache alone, I will usually get well much faster and even have a feeling in my body the next day like my body is no longer fighting something. I've come to feel like the pain you during sickness is literally the thing that's gonna defeat the virus and make you feel better sooner, and recently I've been around lots of sick people and haven't been sick in over a year. I feel that I've challenged my immune system like it's naturally supposed to be challenged, and strengthened it as a result. 
0.857100	I do not have a relevant experience that has occurred during my life that would demonstrate knowledge of health or medical issues.
0.500000	this has never happened to me, i always research my symptoms and then go to the doctor to see if the internet was right or wrong. then ask the dr why its this and not these other things.;
1.000000	When I went to see my most recent psychiatrist, I not only described my symptoms to her but also told her the kind of medications that I wanted to take. I had already studied a lot about my potential illnesses and what would be most helpful, and she prescribed everything I requested. I was at my most stable point after that, all because I gave my own input and knowledge about what was right for me.
1.000000	My mother-in-law was running a fever of 104 and I noticed she wasn't very coherent so made sure she went to the ER as soon as possible. I made sure someone stayed with her at all times since she was not 100% coherent.

She declined, because it was ""just leg pain."" She was in ICE 2 days later for a pulmonary embolism. The leg pain had been a blood clot. It broke free and went to her lungs. It could have killed her. Had she gone in when I suggested, things would have been much better for her ."

0.857100	I am familiar with the symptoms and numerical glucose values of diabetic persons who are beginning to have an insulin reaction so I was able to tell when a young boy I knew was in this situation though no one else around him was aware of it. This allowed me to react quickly, grab his blood sugar test kit and test his blood to see if the situation was an emergency.

0.785700	I used to be a certified nurses assistant at a past job over 20 years ago. Therefore, I received lots of knowledge while I was working with Licences Practical Nurses's and Registered Nurse's and taking care of geriatric patients on a daily basis at my past job. 
0.857100	I can't think of a specific acute experience but my mother taught me how to read a nutrition label, count calories, and assess whether said calories are empty or nutritional. I could just do better at following that info.

0.714300	I noticed spotting after menopause and knew that it could be serious so I went in for a check-up.  I did have an issue and it was caught in time.
1.000000	My mother was diagnozed with Alzheimer's disease at age 76.  At the time, I read that both high doses of vitamin e and hormone replacement therapy could slow the rpgress of the disease.  In addition, vitamin B12 shots administered monthly would also be beneficial.  I convinced her primary care physician to introduce these supplements into her protocol of care and she remained on a stable plateau of forgetfulness for the next six years, with marked improvement in her mood and sociability.  She died of pneumonia at age 82, before Alzheimer's progressed to its inevitable awful end.
0.357100	There are time when I may try to self-diagnose at home. It worries me at time when doing so, but I have to go to the doctor as well, and there are a number of times when the doctor gave me the same answer I already figured out myself.

0.785700	I eat fruit and vegitables all the time. Because of this I never get sick it seems. I think washing my hands helps too.
0.857100	I experienced chest pain on the left side of my chest, so I went to the emergency room thinking I was having a heart attack.  The tests were negative.
0.500000	My husband recently had an episode of CHF.  He's had heart disease for years.  The day he could no longer walk from one end of the house to the other, I knew he could no longer put off going to the hospital.
0.642900	I was certified for CPR a while ago.  I never actually had to use it but I was in a situation where I I was able to assist someone performing it and help remind them of the proper steps, etc to keep them confident.
1.000000	I have made sure that my kids have all their vaccinations because I know that the chance of serious vaccination side effects is much smaller than the chance of getting a dangerous disease if you're not vaccinated.
0.714300	I was a pharmacy tech student for over a year. We had tests on the subject and I did well, especially in medical terminology. I have been telling doctors for nine years about chronic back pain, and kept getting sent to do physical therapy which wasn't helping, they tell me I need to exercise and lose some weight but I actually have arthritis and 2 herniated discs shown by an MRI I finally talked someone into doing last year.
0.928600	Many years ago I found a mass in my breast. I went for a mammogram, which showed something abnormal, then I immediately had a sonogram, which also showed an abnormality.

0.928600	I check my weight daily and some days it's increased substantially despite no real change in my diet. This seems to happen most often after I've eaten at a restaurant. Knowing that salty foods can cause the body to hold water for a longer period of time, I can conclude that restaurants use high amounts of salt in their foods and that shows up on the scale as increased weight from excess water in the body.
0.785700	Previously I was thought to have hypertension.  My doctor wanted my cholesterol reduced by 15% in the span of 6 months.  I actively took medication and my cholesterol reduced by 40%
0.785700	I knew that a loved one had a bowel blockage that needed to be addressed. It wasn't because the doctors only focused on the fact that that person had cancer. They refused to look at anything else. It was a hard battle to win.
0.928600	I had to determine whether to vaccinate my child.  This led to taking the risk of having autism.  I realized that research was trash and did it anyways.
0.642900	I have had wheezy breathing since I was a kid, but it was usually only when I was doing something particularly strenuous like hiking or riding my bike. When I got older, I did a good deal of research after experiencing bad wheezing while trying to get back into exercising again. I deduced that I likely had exercise induced asthma. I went to a doctor about it and they confirmed that it was that. 
0.428600	Usually I know when something is serious or not, because I try to read a lot of medical research and articles about misconceptions people might have. 
0.785700	My son was being evaluated by a cardiologist for a heart condition. The doctor was explaining to me that his pulmonary valve has stenosis and hence had a diagnosis of pulmonary valve stenosis. Because I had recently took a course in college on the heart and how it functions I knew what the word stenosis meant. I also knew the hearts structure and functioning. Without the course I took in college I probably would not have known these terms nor had an understanding how the heart functions or its structures. Because I had prior knowledge of the heart it made it much easier for me to ask questions of the doctor about the diagnosis. It made me feel more at ease when communicating with the doctor because I knew the basic medical terms when referring to the heart. 
0.571400	When my daughter got a skin allergy reaction when she was 5, i immediately knew  it was food poison by just looking at the color of her skin

0.928600	Often I don't know much about what is going on with me medically, once I get the results of blood tests or other diagnostic information is when I start studying and trying to understand. I once got pregnant while using an IUD and being on the pill. I had an intrauterine and an ectopic pregnancy at the same time. They always teach reproduction at the end of anatomy and physiology courses (6/6 times for me it was at the end) so it's usually rushed and cursory, so I needed the doctors to explain a ton to me. Like I didn't know that ectopic fetus' (feti?) don't grow at the same rate as intrauterine ones. Anyway, all the things I learned through that experience, like that I have a bicornuate uterus that makes my IUD less effective, were things I had to explain clearly to new health care providers as I have moved around.
1.000000	Growing up, our maid's daughter had epileptic fits. One night in the middle of the night, I was woken up by my sister who was frantic.

0.857100	I noticed that I have a blue ring around my sclera. I knew that this could be due to an issue with my collagen.

0.642900	Being a nurse is obviously the most prominent example of demonstrating my knowledge of medical or health issues. Besides that, having children has been another way of demonstrating my knowledge. I have also had a few health issues of my own.

0.714300	There have been many times in my life where I was able to assess my medical problem myself and avoid a doctor's visit because I knew there was no danger and I merely needed to ride it out.

0.857100	To be honest, I'm not sick very often and I haven't had much experience with any life-threatening diseases.  I don't call the doctor at the first sniffle, but I do call if I do need to go see him.

0.571400	I have had to have many medical tests along the way. I also dealt with a sick mother (kidney disease) and a child with medical illnesses since birth (premature child 26 weeks). I have had to have more than my share of medical experience. 
0.714300	I went into my doctor to discuss my mental health options for anxiety.  I knew there was different classes of anxiety and depression medications, but I had a hard time figuring out what would be best for me.  My spouse had to help me figure out which would be safe for me so I don't have negative side effects like I had had before.  I couldn't separate the thoughts of the side effects to the physiological effects.  
0.571400	After I had prostate cancer surgery and was in the process of recovering, I developed lympidemia in my left leg. For a large portion of my life I had been in excellent physical condition.

This knowledge was gained through several sources including my doctors and previous trainers.
0.500000	When my husband had cancer I had to learn a lot of information. He had issues that were never discussed with us about his long term problems from head and neck radiation.
1.000000	My knowledge on health and Medical issues is really only valuable to one person, me. I know how i feel, i know how i don't feel, I have a vested interest in my health and well being that encourages learning about whatever symptoms i may be dealing with at any given time, due to this i usually am pretty educated as to what i may likely have and why, or what i most likely do NOT have and why. I have noticed that doctors have seem to be thankful of this at many of my appointments and maybe even a little impressed! One time in particular i correctly diagnosed my skin condition and the doctor got it wrong in fact i had to really advocate for myself to finally get the medication that would treat the condition i was convinced i had, and finally when i saw another doctor he agreed with my diagniosis and treatment was immediately successful. The prior doctor had told me flatly that the condition i was concerned about was familiar to her and i DID NOT have it, in fact I DID! 
1.000000	In boy scouts we had to learn and demonstrate first aid. I learned all the basics. Also in health class at school.
0.857100	My husband has diabetes and so i learned alot from him. I couple years ago my doctor told me that my blood sugar was borderline but i could reduce it by changing my diet. I was fully aware of what that meant and the implications of it and i knew fully what she was talking about and what to do
0.857100	MY GIRLFRIEND IS DIABETIC, WHEN HERE BLOOD SUGAR IS EXTREMELY LOW HAS THE APPEARANCE OF BEING SAD, IF YOU ASK HER A FEW QUESTIONS AND SHE IS UNABLE TO ANSWER THEM YOU KNOW HER BLOOD SUGAR IS LOW AND SHE'S NOT SAD.

1.000000	We have three kids.  Without preventive measures, if one gets sick, we'll all get sick.  Any time one of them has vomiting or diarrhea, we take precautions by sanitizing everything by cleaning and spraying disinfectant and quarantining when  possible.  By taking these measures, I'm sure we've saved ourselves hours of agony.
0.857100	My son was having lots of issues with his ears.  I suspected that he had an ear infection.  I took him to the doctor to get checked out, and he indeed had an ear infection.  I was lucky enough to be able to try an alternative therapy to antibiotics, which I had heard about from a nurse friend of mine.  The doctor allowed us to try it and come back in a few days to see if it had worked.  It did (it was mullein garlic ear drops) and he avoided antiobiotics.
0.928600	When my mother was ill I had to help her with her medical issues.  I did the best I could and I felt like a very competent person in regards to medical issues.
0.285700	When my husband died and i had to give him cpr. Which i did till medics got there then they took over. Unfortunately he did'tn make it. I was thankful that i had learned cpr in my younger days and was able to  hellp.

0.928600	 I fell and scratched my wrist in my front yard one morning. When I put my hand in my pocket about 2 hrs later I was shocked by the pain from my hand. My fingers were swollen and red in just a couple of hours. I went to the VA clinic and was told I must have had a sting because infection didn't occur as quickly as that. I went home and tried to rest but I realized I was feverish.  I went to the hospital emergency rooms and they immediately admitted me with a MRSA infection. I was told that had I followed clinic instructions I probably would not have lived.

Also we had a health issue with our family member so that forces me to learn more about medical terminology and consequences of having certain diseases. What to do in order to prevent it. Of course, nothing is 100% preventable but work towards it will help. Importance of eating habit, exercise. Regularly visiting doctors for the checkup. Same way regularly going for dental appointment are some of the few proactive tasks.

1.000000	My mother is a medical social worker and my father is a healthcare consultant. My mother in particular has influenced me knowing a good deal about medicine. I regularly went to the hospital with her from a young age and volunteered at her hospital as a teenager as well. I also had more serious medical problems in my late teen and early 20s that required a good deal of medical attention that made me more knowledge about medicine and tests and procedures than I ever cared to be unless I was attending medical school.
0.785700	I fell down a flight of concrete stairs once and got pretty banged up but felt OK to walk and did not immediately go to the hospital because I knew that I did not have a concussion.

Also, I knew how effectively to clean his ear and take care of the infected area. Soon enough, my dog got a lot better and now his ear infection is completely gone.
0.642900	There are many, but because I have a nursing background, most of my friends come to me for medical advice and to explain what the doctor told them.  Before I give any medical advice or explanations, I always ask if they have been to their doctor and what did he tell them.  
0.928600	Wow, um. I guess when my son's piano teacher was diagnosed with the same breast cancer my best friend had just beaten the year before.

Even veterinary questions. I really donât know that much about the medical knowledge behind liver transplants, but I can advise on how to approach the procedure, and what to expect to happen after the procedure (which is more important to the patient, anyway). I know I have been able to put some peopleâs minds at ease who have experienced a transplant, so that makes me feel good. In 2017 I had a kidney transplant, so now Iâm an expert on that, too.

0.857100	A friend began suffering from terrible migraines, but didn't want to go to the doctor. I asked him different questions to identify the cause, including whether he had any dental issues. He didn't see the connection, but admitted that he had an exposed nerve in one of his teeth. I suggested he stopped avoiding the dentist because that may be the cause of his migraines. Within a few days of going to the dentist, his migraines stopped.
0.928600	I had a heart issue awhile ago and I went to the doctor about it. I had a few appointments with specialists for tests and it ended up being a benign issue that has mostly resolved at this point. I researched and listened to the doctors and they were correct.

1.000000	I had a toothache and found out it was infected. They gave me an antibiotic to take for 15 days. I felt better in two days, but continued to take the antibiotic as directed, because I know that is what you are supposed to do or else a new hardier strain could develop.
0.928600	I had trouble breathing through my nose during exercise. It turns out, it was because I had a blockage in my nose called nasal polyps. I had heard about this from reading things online about congestion. I realized I needed to treat it with nasal spray so I went to my doctor about it.

0.428600	I have had to have over 12 surgery's and many more biopsy's in my life. i have had bone grafts done to breast biopsy's.. i have a lot of experience in the hospital care world. Today i do home care for a quadriplegic between his and myself we have plenty of experince.

I also know how I could improve my diet to lost weight and help my cholesterol numbers. I am also very aware of having to take care of myself and particularly my heart to help me live a better life. I have also suffered from depression, anxiety and PTSD for over 25 years, so I know how to avoid triggers and help myself so I can stay on a low dose of medicine.
1.000000	19 years ago my doctor told me I was diabetic. He knew me well, and said he'd give me 6 months to learn as much as I could about it and to see if I could control it on my own without medicine. If I didn't have it under control within that time (or wasn't showing improvement on subsequent visits prior to the 'deadline') he'd prescribe something to control it. I had it under control within 6 weeks. Through diet and exercise maintaining extremely tight control of my blood glucose level has become routine. I'm almost always below 90 mg/dL. I get a good night's rest to not interfere with my 'dawn effect.'
0.571400	When I tried to lose weight a few years ago I created an eating plan that was very healthy and I actually ate everything i needed to eat and was losing weight fast without starving.
0.785700	When I was only 16 or 17 I had a gland that was swollen.  Being that I do get nervous about health related things, I did my own research before seeing the doctor.  This was just shortly before the internet took off.  I had a book that explained what my issue was, with the specific name of the gland.  When I visited the doctor, I used that name to tell him what I thought was wrong with me.  He was very surprised that I had any idea what it was, and said that I was correct.  This example explains just many instances like this I have had in my life with doctors.  I apparently surprised them with how much I know.  I do this because it lessens anxiety to have as much information as possible.
0.928600	I was talking to my doctor after a visit and I mentioned that I saw the AHA had changed the guidelines on cholesterol. He had heard about it too and we had a discussion about cholesterol numbers.
0.642900	I have low blood sugar and my doctor explained the need for me to eat 6 small meals a day and make sure I eat complex carbohydrates and protein at each of those meals.  I understand that doing this will keep my blood sugar level and I will feel better.

0.714300	I had to have a mammagram. It was very confusing because they spoke aboout fasle positives, cystic lumps, and fatty tissue all playing a factor. I had no clue what they were talking about for the msot part. I just wanted a clear answer to if I was okay or not. 
0.214300	A time in my life when I displayed knowledge of health and science would be my freshman year of college when I passed Biology 2 with a breeze while everybody else was struggling to maintain a C average, that's when I knew I exceeded in science.

0.571400	I was losing weight and had no appetite. I continued going to the doctor but everything seemed normal. I ended up in the hospital with PE's. A month later I found out I had thyroid cancer. The only reason it was found was because a scan was done looking for clots. My labs had always been normal. I understood the need for surgery to remove half my thyroid to prevent it from spreading and that the clots were probably caused from that.

0.642900	Mostly just general information that a lot of people know. And I've also taken some classes in college that detail health things
0.928600	I was able to cure a bout of strep throat in myself without the help of antibiotics.  When I found out that I had it I researched it and discovered that I could use household products to kill the bacteria and that it would likely go away on itâs own if I waited long enough.
0.785700	When I was pregnant my Doctor always was so surprised that I knew as much as I did. He would always go try to explain things to me and I would always start before him and tell him what he was already going to tell me. And even now with my birth control I told him things before he could even tell me.
0.857100	No specific past experience comes to mind. I am no health expert, though I suffer from several health issues. However I am confident enough in my understanding of my own health conditions, so that if someone were suffering from the same symptoms, I would definitely be able to give them some good recommendations on how to treat it, and I would be able to explain the cause of the condition and how it works.
0.928600	Not very long ago I was diagnosed with bronchitis; The results showed that the cause was a bacteria so I was prescribed a strong antibiotic to be taken for 3 days only, which I took it and it the end the bronchitis was gone. 
0.642900	I've been an advocate for those diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Neurologists all over the country give their newly diagnosed patients my phone number and email because they find that I'm better at explaining things than they are sometimes because I've lived with MS for 40 years. This doesn't say that I can do percentages anymore, but I have been a great  layperson neurological and psychological source to countless people I've been told for more years than I can count:-)
0.857100	a coworker was eating some food and their throat started to close up. They were saying that they thought they were having an allergic reaction. I happened to have some benadryl, so I gave it to them. This helped reduce the swelling of their throat while we waited for an EMT to arrive.

0.928600	I think going to university helped me demonstrate my knowledge, or rather, my lack there-of. I think I only know some things about the health care industry, and I feel like they are worthwhile things to have, but they need some serious readjusting. I've only had chances to write papers or talk about these things with my friends, but never had the chance to practice these concepts in a profession.
0.571400	I was in a severe car accident and broke my pelvic bone. I was in the emergency room for 4 hours and I saw a lot that went on at the hospital.

It was a very painful recovery but with the help of therapy I made it. I am thankful.

They pumped floods in my because I was also dehydrated.  Scary moment 
0.785700	My youngest daughter had a febrile seizure. We called the ambulance, went to the ER and then followed up with our pediatrician. Because of all the information I received during that first time, when she had a second febrile seizure two weeks later, I felt confident enough to remain calm, put her on her side, and just ride it out. I knew, however, that if she didn't come out of it within 5 minutes, that we should call 911.

I reported to the operator that I believed my friend was having a stroke, and went through the standard diagnostics to confirm this, while we awaited an ambulance.

After a few triggering events everything came to a head. It was probably 3 weeks of struggling to even get out of bed that made me realize that I needed to seek help. I first reached out to ladies in my mom group who assured me that I was neither alone or losing my mind. From there I had the confidence to reach out to my doctor.

She did not suffer any additional mental episodes during that treatment.
0.928600	I was having severe headaches for a few years. I went around to various physicians/specialists for testing and everything under the sun.

I did so and within 10 minutes the rash went away. It was basically coming from the heating system of the new apartment that I had moved into.

After about an hour, I felt very nervous and jittery (I was watching a football game) which I attributed to my favorite team losing, but took some time to lie down regardless.

We went to the emergency room and the doctor said my quick reaction saved my life â and my niece's.

0.928600	Over the course of several days, I've noticed my roommate has stayed in the bathroom for long periods throwing up. His diet isn't the best, as he consumes a lot of sugary foods/drinks such as soda and candy as well as eating a lot of fast food.

1.000000	A doctor told me to get the flu vaccine during pregnancy. My friend is against vaccinations, especially during pregnancy, and told me not to get it.

0.785700	My grandfather went to the urologist and had a PSA blood test done.  I knew from his results, being over 3.0, that this meant he would likely need a biopsy to test for prostate cancer.  I also knew that these tests could produce higher than normal levels if the patient has an enlarged prostate.  I asked to see his former results.  They were up and down a lot, which is typically a sign that there is NOT prostate cancer, but instead, an enlarged prostate.

1.000000	One example that comes immediately to mind is tracking maximum heart rate of VO2 max as it applies to active fitness.  I volunteered for a study several years ago where we measured both of these metrics over the course of several months while on a fitness regimen.

I avoid going to the doctor so much and despise the thought of getting told bad news about my health that I just tough it out. It can potentially last for months at a time, and even though I know in the back of my head that if I go to the doctor's office they could probably prescribe a medication that could help me much faster than whatever is over the counter, I do not go. I know I am in the wrong and it really shows a lack of understanding when it comes to medical issues.

0.714300	I sprained my ankle.  I did not go to  the doctor because I knew that I should ice it, keep it up and stay off it.   I also wrapped it.  I did not see why I should pay money for the doctor when I knew what to do.

My baby turned blue while rooming in with me and had to be put in the NICU for 21 days due to immaturity. Ten years later when I had my son the laws had been changed to not allow my baby to be taken more than 2 weeks earlier due to the NICU cost of doctors like the one I had with my daughter taking babies too early in situations like mine where there was a previous classic c section. My son was taken at 38 weeks and was fine. He went home the next day with me.
0.571400	 I used to work in the public school system. I worked with a teacher who was a Type One diabetic. I also had a son in law at the time who was a Type One diabetic. I had witnessed my son in law's struggles with blood sugar ups and downs,and had seen him suffering from a complication of diabetes,known as Ketoacidosis. Because of my hands on experience with my son in law,I was able to recognize the signs and symptoms in the teacher I worked with,when she fell ill one day.

0.571400	I guess the only time  can think of was when I was a teenager and my friends little brother cut and scraped his knee. I knew to pick him up and clean the wound and bandage it so it wouldnt scar too badly.
0.642900	I suppose this would have been associated with my father's cancer, where I had to essentially inform myself about the things he should/shouldn't eat during that point in time, especially since he didn't clearly discuss these issues since I was a teenager (he didn't want me worrying).
0.714300	An instance in my life that demonstrated medical issues is when i was pregnant and put on bedrest  I was very aware of how to act, what to do and not to do.  I was able to carry to full term when only given a 30% chance of it

I realized the cause was actually an infection I had had a decade earlier that never completely went away.

If I hadn't figured that out, and relied upon a doctor to figure it, I might have have had the infection inside my ear pop my ear drum or worse.
0.857100	In 1995, I came down with an extreme flu-like illness that I almost died from. Several years later, after researching the information online and talking with my doctor, i came to the conclusion that i had Hanta-virus due to living in close quarters with a field mouse that infected me.

0.928600	I had a length of time in my life where I did not have any health insurance. During this time, I could not go to the doctor's office no matter how ill I became, because I could not afford to pay for treatment.

0.928600	Well I suppose one of the best experiences of my life that demonstrates my knowledge of health and medical issues is the classes I took in college.

I have a lot of family and friends who refer people they know to me when they first find out that their son or daughter is also diagnosed. It is one area I feel highly knowledgeable in without ever having gone to school for it. I once was at the pediatrician and the doctor asked if I would be okay going to the next room over to talk to a mom who had just found out about her son. They thought it might be helpful for me to come in as an experienced mom in this matter. I really enjoyed it and the mom seemed to leave feeling at least somewhat better about the future.

0.642900	I recently have been doing research on the benefits of the ketogenic diet. I talked/discussed the diet with my Aunt, who was inquiring how I was doing, knowing that recently I had started this diet. I was able to tell her about how I needed to increase my water intake because my fat cells were no longer holding onto the water your body needs to thrive properly. I also told her the benefits of cutting out carbs decreased inflammation in your body, which is pertinent information because my family suffers from psoriasis, a immune disease that shows itself in the inflammation of spots on your skin.

0.928600	I have a friend who often comes to me stating that she is sick or unwell, but usually I ask her a series of questions starting with if she has had any water that day. Usually the answer is no, and she feels better after she drinks some water. My next question would be whether she has eaten, how she slept, and if she has allergies depending on the symptoms.
0.642900	Last december, I was having some really bad pain in my bladder. It was difficult to urinate, and I constantly had a burning feeling. And an urge to constantly go to the bathroom, even though I didn't need to. I remembered these issues from a previous time that I had a UTI. I called in to my doctor and gave him my symptoms. They were able to review my chart and see that I had a UTI a year prior and instead of having to go in for another visit, they sent in an RX for the UTI.

0.571400	I have had fertility issues because of increased NK cells, more than 5 years and visited 4 doctors, nobody of them told me how to reduce the level of the cells which block the possibility for implantation. Then I found a holistic doctor doctor who recommended change in the food diet and test for food intolerance, my ob-gyn doctor started laughing at this and said this is silly. But I did everything my holistic doctor told to me, I even started core gymnanstics and acupuncture and 7 months later I was pregnant with my first child, so I read tons of books, blogs, articled, I tried a lot of things and succeed.
0.785700	 When my daughter was 9 months old she had a serious infection. I repeatedly brought her to the pediatrician and emergency room before it was finally diagnosed. Only after a doctor was convinced that her white blood count needed to be checked was the infection clear to the medical professionals. I needed to be insistent.

0.714300	I had been told by an Orthopedic surgeon that I had three bulging discs.  I tried taking Cortisone injections in my back.  They did not work to relieve the pain.  The next form of action to take would be surgery.  I question other health officials about the results of these surgeries.  I was told that I most likely will have to go back in later and have additional surgeries. I had read about Chiropractors and what they were able to do for people with back pain.  My general practitioner is an O.D..  He said that I did my homework and should follow through with my decision to seek a Chiropractor.  I have been pain free since seeing one.  
0.428600	A time in my life that I knew more in terms of health or medical issues was when I was talking to a friend about anxiety and how they were having attacks and what they should do and avoid in terms of alcohol and food that would help decrease their chances of experiencing anxiety attacks.

I had to hold something as if I was moving around too. I went to the hospital, but all they could tell me was I had vertigo. I was so desperate because that ringing sound never stop even now as I typing this. I started looking online everywhere for a treatment, but it is hopeless.

0.857100	I talk on a daily basis with my friend, who is a nephrologist. he tells me stories (good and bad) about his profession, his practice and his career. This has helped my general knowledge of medicine considerably and he even occasionally asks for my general opinion / validation.
0.642900	I have a vascular hemagioma (Port Wine Stain) under my eye, and I know why laser surgery is effective and what the best settings are. This has been beneficial because I can talk to my dermatologist about what would benefit me the most.

1.000000	When my Grandma was having an issue with her blood pressure (low, fainting) and my other family members were rushing around trying to find ways to get her to be responsive, I knew enough that she should be placed flat on the ground (an incline would've been better but wasn't available) with her knees up and held up and feet flat on the floor. This would raise her blood pressure, and in a few moments she became responsive. We still called 911, but she was responsive and alert for it, rather than having a dangerously low blood pressure.
0.428600	I have been taken care of myself for a while. I know how to fill out medical information that pertains to me. If I need help, I can ask the nurse and they will help me fill out that I don't understand.

She had a previous history of fleas but when I had adopted her, she was flea free. Then after two week of having her, she started to claw her face so I looked it online to see what is happening and if I could fix it at home. The internet said it could be a cause of flea saliva and I could try to rub some vitamin E on it to see it it would help.

0.857100	I started having a sore throat during the week at work. I knew it could be from exercising outdoors, that I needed to clean my fan, I had some type of cold or strep throat. As I weeded out the issues, I knew it had to either be a cold or strep throat. Once it really got sore, I was able to look in the mirror and see that my throat was really red and took myself to the doctor because I knew I had strep throat. I also woke up the next day (because I could not get into the doctor the same day) almost swallowing my uvula every time I swallowed. I was correct I had strep throat. 
0.928600	I honestly don't think there's any specific moment in my life where I have demonstrated a knowledge of health or medical issues that would be noteworthy.

0.785700	I've been disabled with a neurological illness that is poorly understood since I was 18 years old. I often know more about my conditions than my doctors do, because I've done a lot of research over the past 31 years of being sick. My doctor in my previous country of residence, used to ask me what treatment I would think would be beneficial for myself before suggesting anything. She told me I should have been a doctor, I used to brief her on the latest research findings into my illness and highlight relevant passages for her to help her treat others she saw with my disease.

0.857100	I was once talking to the doctors about a blood test that I had taken for past signs of Tb. Since I had taken this test before, I knew a little bit of the different ones that existed, as well as some knowledge of how they worked. This was for a job that I was applying for, and the doctor was impressed that I had some prior knowledge. I also asked questions about follow up steps, such as whether I needed to take a chest x-ray. Due to my knowledge of the situation, it made it much easier for the doctor to explain to me what I needed. 
0.857100	I don't know that such an experience exists as I have very little knowledge of health or medical issues, I only know when I feel something is wrong with my body. An example would be that once I had sudden onset shortness of breath and I knew that was abnormal so instead of waiting to go the doctor, I went immediately and was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism. 
0.642900	I was at home, alone, eating soup when I tried to swallow a lentil, but it got caught in my throat. I realized that I was not able to get it to go down and I could  feel it in my throat. I drove to the local fire station and the firefighters took me to the local hospital. After several hours, and a few tests, the attending doctor said there was nothing there. I was admitted, however, and the specialist for stomach problems listened to my story, and did a balloon endoscopy in the late evening. Sure enough, he found the lentil.

Years later, I had a friend who one time who pulled the same muscle in the yard but he was thinking he was having a heart attack. He was panicking in fear but I calmed him down and told him to let me take a look. I placed two fingers and a thumb on the location of his chest and pushed hard. It put him in even more pain which told me he pulled the same muscle as I did and it relaxed him and made him feel at ease. That was a time in which I was able to help calm a worrying friend and demonstrate my knowledge of health and medical issues.
1.000000	When a relative was ill (terminally ill, as it turned out) I attended doctors appointments with the (surviving) spouse and help to explain what had been said, what options were presented, and what the likely outcome would be in each option.
0.714300	I am the caregiver for my elderly mother. She recently had lab results that showed a low sodium level. Her primary care doctor decreased her water pill to every other day. Then my mother went to her cardiologist and after an echocardiogram, he told my mother to take the water pill every other day.  Even though her doctors are in the same group, the cardiologist had not looked at her recent lab reports and her primary care physician's recommendations.  I called her PCP's office and spoke to her nurse and explained the situation.  I requested her PCP call the cardiologist and consult about her lab reports.  She did call him and together they came up with a solution to the problem.

0.928600	I have been trying to reduce the amount of sugar in my diet. I have read that eating a lot of carbohydrates just turns right into sugar which can upset the bodies blood sugar balance to the point that it is much worse for you than fat. (As long as not excessive fat) So I have reduced carbohydrates as much as I can besides just the basic recommended level. I also try to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables to get necessary micro nutrients. I also have cut back significantly on the amount of red meat that I eat and have replaced it with chicken or pork. Some weeks all I feel like I eat is chicken and broccoli. I also try to exercise regularly and get in a moderate jog/run to exercise my cardiovascular system. I also monitor my weight to make sure to notice any changes or patterns and to drink more water. 
1.000000	I rolled my ankle pretty badly during a soccer game. I figured I might as well go to the doctor even if I knew they would just tel me to ice it and stay off it as much as possible and then give me some pills like they did before. I went in and they did the exact same thing they did the last 2 times. X-ray on my ankle, then gave me crutches and the best way to ice it.
0.500000	I had frequent visits to my doctor throughout the years, and she is very patient and is willing to give information out in hopes to helping others. I have learned a ton from her just from visiting her when I'm not feeling well or if there is something wrong with me.

0.928600	My son had a fever over 102 degrees at less than 1 month old.  I went to an urgent care, and then the emergency room for service, as this was a very unsafe temperature for child so young.  When I was in college, I had meningitis.  He was presenting similar issues, so I approved a lumbar puncture as well as a urine sample, blood sample, and sinus culture.  He was diagnosed with viral meningitis and given fluids in hospital.
1.000000	A few years ago I determined that I was feeling really lousy and that the reason was that I had gotten overweight and didn't exercise enough.

0.571400	I really don't know what to write because I don't really have very much knowledge of heath or medical issues.  I guess I try to eat healthy.  There was one time where I had to take care of a wound that my husband had.  The nurse on base showed me how to change his dressings and I did until he was all healed up.  That is really the only thing I can think off.  When I go to the grocery store I pay attention to nutrition labels and try to avoid foods with added sugar, too much salt, and loads of carbs.  Fat is ok because we are doing the keto diet right now.

0.714300	My daughter was born with gastroschisis.  I did a lot of research on it, so by the time she was born I was well aware of what to look out for, what to ask the doctors, and what things to be worried about. She was in the hospital for over a month, and during the time the staff was constantly making comments about how well versed I was in my daughter's condition. It made me feel more comfortable going home with her when she was discharged knowing that I had learned so much about her condition and was comfortable knowing when something didn't seem right or if it was something that was normal for babies with this condition. 
0.857100	I need to decide when to take my husband to the hospital when he had appendicitis.  I forced him to go when I felt his stomach and it was swollen in the same spot they always show when describing appendicitis. 
0.785700	I recently was on a flight to Philadelphia when the very pregnant woman in the aisle across from me tried to stand up and fainted, ending up in the aisle. I put my jacket under her head, loosened her coat and took her pulse which was slightly fast. I saw no signs of contractions in her belly and chalked the episode up to being too warm, possible dehydration and a drop in her blood pressure when she stood up too quickly. After a few moments she came to and after a drink of water, she was able to return to her seat and comfortably finish the flight.
0.142900	I know nothing about medical issues. I just know it's probably not a good thing to do drugs constantly and eat junk food and go for a run every now and then.

Years later my husband got sick and he was in the hospital. A CNA entered his room to take his vitals and his blood pressure was extremely high. I asked her if she was going to retake it. She said she would consult with the charge nurse, I told her - why don't you just retake them now, that blood pressure is too high. She retook the blood pressure and he was fine, but I am glad I had the knowledge I did to ask for a re-take.

I passed all four classes with A's and 1 B, I also took microbiology with the lab which I also passed with A's. My older brother sometimes says silly things like vaccines are not a good thing, and I have to explain to him that vaccines are actually lifesavers. Vaccines predispose us to a pathogen in a very reduced amount that It will not harm us, but It will trigger an immune response in which our immune system will have created memory t cells. So in the future if we come into contact of the pathogen It can be dealt with because of our immune systems memory cells. We have thus created a way to expose ourselves to a pathogen of a very reduced strength in order to prepare us for the same pathogen when it attacks us with full strength. 
1.000000	I don't think that I have a good understanding of medical issues, but through nutrition education in college feel that I have a solid grasp of health issues, meaning I know how to maintain my health.

Reducing my blood glucose also corrected other stated problems.

0.714300	Lots of medical appointments and lots of ads on tv and interest in the medical field. Good and bad doctors and doing my own research helps. 
0.857100	Well my knowledge is pretty basic. When I went in to premature labor with my son, I thought that something like that could be avoided easily. It wasn't and my son came 3 months early. So I guess that demonstrates that my knowledge isn't that great.
0.500000	I am a CNA so I have a good bit of knowledge in the health department. I do not have any medical issues though.
0.642900	After I applied for my current job, I had an interview with my current boss. She told me there were three candidates that she was considering but she chose me because of medical background. She also said I was knowledgeable about the things she asked me and that she felt like I'd be a good fit at her medical establishment. Two years later, I'm still here so I'm guessing I demonstrated a knowledge of health or medical issues correctly.

After much research into Bulimia I realized there was no chance that was my problem because I was not able to binge eat, I couldn't eat more than 5 bites of something before regurgitating food on some days as the disease progressed. I did the research and approached doctors about the possibility of something else being wrong with me and they all ignored me. After seeing several specialists one finally listened to me and agreed the previous diagnoses were completely inaccurate. 
0.357100	I am very into the natural way of living. I see a guy who is into Ayurvedic healing and he has helped grow my knowledge as to what exactly happens in your body. Most issues start in the gut. So I guess I demonstrate my knowledge when I am dealing with my own health concerns.

0.428600	I really do not know much about the medical field, medicine, I wish I knew more. My father was in the hospital he has diabetes, he went into a diabetic coma a while back and I am still trying to understand how much insulin he needs to take.
1.000000	I was having an issue with stiffness in my elbows and knees and when i complained about it to my doctor he wanted to order a test for RA.

He seemed unconvinced but ordered the test just the same and sure enough i came back positive.
0.857100	I suffered from infertility about five years ago. I had to take myself and my medical history from doctor to doctor to seek treatment. I had to understand a lot of what was going on so that new doctors could know how best to treat my case.
0.642900	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issue was when I used the same techniques i learned after my right shoulder surgery and used it to rehabilitate my left shoulder after surgery.

1.000000	I used my experience and knowledge from prior medical discussions regarding migraine headaches to research which triggers to avoid and try to find alternative options to bring relief because the prescribed medication was not working for me.

0.714300	My 92 year old mom recently fell on concrete. She had no outward signs of broken bones and was conscious and cognitively astute. There was a tremendous amount of bleeding. I felt it best to call an EMS vehicle to get her to the hospital being that she takes Pradaxa, a blood thinner. 
0.571400	One of my friends sisters was having some health issues and her doctors were having problems figuring out what was wrong with her. my friend knew of my health history and shared what her sister was going through. her symptoms sounded familiar, so I reached out to her, we talked and I told her I thought she had something I had struggled with. Gastroparesis. Her Doctor tested for it, and I was right! That was what she had! she went on medicine and felt better!
0.857100	I had never had a urinary tract infection, but I began having unusual symptoms on urination. When I went to the doctor, I suspected that he might test my urine for evidence of infection. He did.
0.928600	I saw an accident once and the guy was having some blood loss from his arm. I knew from my first aid training that stopping the flow of blood coming out was a good first step in a situation like that. I got the guy to hold his arm up to minimize the blood loss and tightened a torn shirt around his arm to help until an ambulance arrived.
0.285700	I don't have much formal training, just bits and pieces picked up over life. This knowledge came in handy when I fell out of a tree as a teenager. I dislocated my shoulder and it really hurt. First off, I knew I had to stay calm, stopped the bleeding and then proceeded to find help.
0.785700	I have spinal issues. A friend was suffering from an injured lower back. She asked what i thought.

0.500000	When I was younger and I first had to read all the information. It was hard to understand the insurance and when I had to read how much meds I had to take. I felt good about how much to take but there was still some areas that I didn't understand.

0.428600	One time along time ago when I was a little kid I had to go to the doctor for measles and the doctor thought it was chicken pox but I knew it wasn't so I explained what I knew and how I knew it and why so we could get the correct diagnosis. I think knowing and researching some yourself to help self diagnosis is a major help as doctors are human too and may not always have the correct idea based on your description of the symptoms you are experiencing  and could lead to mistakes being made early in the discussion.
0.857100	When my son had eczema, the doctor just wanted to give him steroid cream and told me there's usually no cure. Instead I had him tested for allergies and found he was allergic to tree nuts. Once we eliminated tree nuts from his diet, the eczema disappeared and has never returned.

0.785700	When my friend was pregnant and was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia I was able to guide her through the process based off when I had it myself.

0.642900	I have been taking care of all my family medical forms, records, doctor visits, etc. That includes my elderly mother who has had many health issues and several surgeries. I filled out all the paperwork, talked to doctors for her and helped her make decisions.

0.785700	There was a time when I knew I knew how to self diagnose myself medically. I had been having really sharp abdominal pains under my right bottom rib cage area. I looked up all my symptoms I have been having everything and I thought I had gallbladder issues. Well, I ended up going to the ER. After several tests, I turned out to be right. I had to have my gallbladder removed.
0.785700	I had once had really bad cellulitis in my elbow region. At the time nobody knew what it was and thought I got stung by a bug or something.

0.857100	"I felt sick as a dog, had sore throat and was exhausted. I went to the doctor's and he said I was fine. I went home and became sicker. I went back to the doctor's and he said I was fine.

0.785700	I have been getting migraines for years.  I did some research and was disappointed to find that they don't know exactly what causes them and that there is really no cure.  I started taking excedrin regularly.  I also had a facial intense pulsed light ipl treatment that made me have migraines nearly every day.  I went to the chiropracter because I though my posture and neck alignment may be contributing to neck tension and pain.  This could be leading to frequent headaches.  I wanted to continue with the chiropracter but I cannot at this time due to money issues.  I started getting what I believe were intenstinal ulcers from the excedrin, particularly the NSAIDs.  It put me in extreme pain and cramping for days which I could not get rid of.  I went to see an emergency doctor who gave me pills to stop the cramps in my intenstine.  My sister had the same issue a few years later.  I found out my whole family gets migraines at a family reunion.  I started doing more research and found out inflammation could be a cause.  I started taking turmeric supplements for inflammation.  Within a month I had significantly fewer migraines and headaches.  Now I recommend it to all the women I meet who have migraines, many many women do.
0.857100	I was hit and run by a car while riding my bike. I had no radial pulse, lost memory, had multiple broken bones, and was 1mm away from being paralyzed. In addition, my lungs were filling with fluid. I learned a lot about the anatomy of my back, my lungs and what a radial pulse was.  I learned the treatment plans for my conditions and what could be done and what could not be done. Previously, I had no experience in these areas. I had to trust the doctors and what literature they provided to educate myself. It was a long recovery with still remaining issues that I continue to seek treatment and get educated about the body and recovery.
0.428600	My experiences have been to listen to my body, as I'm getting older I realize that if you pay attention to the seasonal, cyclical, and redundant reactions to changes, you will begin to learn your own body better than any other person; you can learn to trust it.

0.857100	Most of my knowledge regarding health or medical issues is not from learning about them from doctors or reading about them on the internet, but rather it is from my previous experiences with them in my own life. When my friend was experiencing problems with frequent stomachaches and trips to the restroom, I told him that it sounded familiar to my own experience with the stomach flu. After being home-ridden for a week, he informs be that it was indeed the stomach flu and that my advice for him to take time off of school was important and necessary.
0.642900	I went to school for medical assistant a couple years ago even though I never finished it. I learned about Latin names for conditions and diseases and how they affect people. I took a test and got an A on the test.So I guess it gave me some experience with knowledge of health and medical issues.
0.714300	I recently moved and therefore, had no doctor.  I twisted my ankle very badly.  The pain was excruciating and the bruising encompassed my entire foot and went well up my leg.  I didn't really want to pay an ER bill so I took a wait and see attitude.  I felt safe in doing so because I could move my toes a little, and because I did get a little better daily.  I was soon confident that I had no broken bones.  My husband had a 50 percent tendon tear in the past, and knowing what that was like, and how it was treated helped.
0.642900	I had a nose bleed that would not stop. I remembered how a paramedic once told me, in order to stop a nose bleed; you place a gauze under the inner lip and apply some pressure until the bleeding stops. I always thought you lean your head bank until the bleeding stops. It worked like a charm when I did it the medics way.
1.000000	I went through a health care track in college and had two years of specialized school for Medical Technology.

I convinced him to let me bring him to the ER and he was diagnosed with heart failure and they had to put a stint in one of his arteries.
0.857100	An experience I had that showed my knowledge of health or medical issues is when I took my son to the doctor's office. I had remembered reading about certain signs the body gives away that are an indication of other issues during my studying in the medical field. My son was having a high fever and sweating a little and I figured he was teething because he was also drooling. Sure enough, I was correct when I talked to the doctor about it. He told me that I was absolutely right. 
0.785700	My mother was recently treated for breast cancer and just had her third of four chemotherapy sessions. She was initially told that she would not need chemo at all and would just have to do radiation to lower the rate of recurrence after the tumor and a lymph node was removed, and then a month later she had to very quickly reschedule, messing up work and therefore putting her insurance at risk. All of the complaints I've given you so far are incredibly fresh in my mind.
0.642900	Last year I was diagnosed with diabetes.  I have lowered by A1C from 6.5 to 5.9 all by myself with diet.  I am now conscious of everything I put in my mouth.  I check my blood sugar every morning and 2 hours after a meal that I feel will raise my blood sugar.

1.000000	My husband has type 2 diabetes so I had to learn how to help him manage it to keep his blood sugar under control.  I had to learn about the condition and also about the signs to look for when his sugar is too high or too low.
0.857100	My wife felt lumps in her breast. From my medical knowledge I knew that the firm nodule tha was easily moved was likely a cyst. The other one had a chance to be malignant so she had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. I could see during the X-rays that the lump was not characteristic of a cancer. Then, during ultrasound I could see the round black hole on the screen indicating all lumps wee cysts. Was able to relieve both me and the wife while we waited for the radiologist to tell us the same thing.
0.428600	I have done extensive research into my own medical conditions and I'm able to have more meaningful fulfilling discussions with my doctor's because I have enough knowledge to discuss treatment options with my doctors
0.571400	I went to and graduated from nursing school. That's not enough characters, so I'll add that it was a hospital school (they're long gone) so I'm a diploma nurse. I graduated in 1974 and left nursing in 1985.
0.714300	An experience would be when I was hospitalized for appendicitis. I learned a lot being in the hospital that one time. What I should expect from the doctors and what needs to be done while I am there. 
0.857100	I knew when I was pregnant the first morning after I had conceived because I felt different upon my walk to work the next morning.

I kept this to myself for several weeks until I was able to take a test and confirm that my personal diagnose was correct.
0.928600	I don't really have any specialized knowledge of health or medical issues. I have provided first aid to an injured employee when I was supervising them. They cut themselves pretty severely , and I held pressure on the wound until the company nurse arrived.

1.000000	I was in the first gulf war. My humvee rolled over a land mine. I was in the air and hit the ground hard. I crawled to the vehicle. My gunner had suffered a leg injury. He was bleeding from lots of shrapnel.  I stopped the bleeding and got him through a rough time until another unit arrived.
0.928600	When I had blood in my stool, I looked up the symptom online and determined I most likely had hemorrhoids.  I went to the doctor anyways because it could have been more serious.  They listened to my description of the problem (I did not change it to match the online symptoms because I didn't really have any pain) and they prescribed me fiber and told me that if it continued or became diahrrea-like to come back immediately.  I took the fiber and shortly after I no longer saw blood in my stool.
1.000000	I really can't think of a situation. I depend on my doctor for info. If I don't know something I seek out resources to help me.
0.785700	Two years ago I had my first UTI. I understood the symptoms as everyone knows the basic symptom of pain while peeing as well as the frequent feeling of having to go to the bathroom. Instead of having to go to the doctors I called the 24 hour nurse service and told them I believed that I had a UTI. I then asked for the antibiotics and after confirming I had the specific symptoms I was approved. I didn't need to go to a doctor for this because I understood the symptoms that I was having 
0.500000	After years of taking care of my grandmother's medications, when her doctor wanted to ignore her odd behavior, I made it clear in no uncertain terms that her medication could not be the cause of it, and if he started messing with it, her diabetes would become unstable. He didn't listen. Guess what happened to her diabetes? Yeah, listen to the person who has been doing it for years. 
1.000000	My mother or father sometimes ask me side effects of a certain medication (assuming it is not written on the container). I can use an online database to find out information about that medication.

He says that if you donât he will not only kill your son but some other innocent inmate as well. You donât have any doubt that he means what he says. What should you do?
0.928600	The results of an echo-stress test were mixed. The echo portion was negative but there were issues with the stress test. I knew that most likely these issues would be addressed using medications rather than stenting or surgery since the problem was in the smaller arteries.
1.000000	This is a weird and difficult question to answer. I went through a period of 6 months where my doctors believed I had early onset rheumatory arthritis.

Asshole.

0.857100	A few years back I had what I thought was a routine stomach ache from the flu.  After a few days the pain had not subsided and it didn't seem like the same old flu.  Given the location of the pain and my knowledge from popular culture I thought maybe it could be appendicitis.  I went in and I was correct.  It was removed immediately. 
0.642900	I've had issues where my tongue gets inflamed and swollen for reasons I still do not understand. Most doctors look at my tongue and focus on the top portion. I have what is called a geographical tongue. It has an odd design and looks cracked and spaced apart on the surface, kind of like the landmasses on the earth. Most doctors have not even heard of this and focus on that, as though it is part of, or the reason for the inflammation. This is one area in which I actually know more than the doctors, and frustrates me when they wont listen to my explanation.

I was able to clean her foot, apply ointment and dressed her wound. I did this for a few days with no improvement. When I went to do the same thing the next day, it clearly was getting worse. I advised my grandmother that it looks like gangrene and she should go get it checked. She did and was admitted to the hospital for gangrene. They would normally take the toe but because of her age they highly recommended we didn't opt for that solution. They ended up injecting her with some type of solution and gave her an antibiotic and dressed the wound. Whatever they did stopped the infection and she lived for two more years after that incident and passed away due to other reasons unrelated to the toe 
0.642900	I diagnosed myself of having low thyroid by doing research online. I compared my symptoms and presented it to my doctor who did a blood test and confirmed. 
0.928600	A few years ago, my dad was having some stomach pains.  My mom and I took him to the doctor that specialized in stomach and related issues.  It seemed like we filled out paperwork for awhile.  It was a lot to it.  Later, my dad was diagnosed with having pancreatic cancer.  That lead to him to having surgery which went well.

He ultimately survived longer than was expected.

0.928600	A few months ago I was lifting something that was too heavy and I heard a popping sound in one of my hamstrings. I could tell right away that I tore a hamstring based upon the sound that my hamstring made. I knew that I had to see a doctor to see the extent of it.
0.642900	My mom has always had health problems and was always in and out of the hospitals. I learned a lot by listening and asking questions.
0.857100	Let's take flu shots.  I have opted out of getting a flu shot.  I have never had one before, however this year I was tempted.  I understand that the flu shot is only about 17-18% effective in preventing the flu.  This number is not very high.  I also understand what they are telling us is that even if we get the flu, the severity would be reduced if we were to get a flu shot.  Since the flu appears so prevalent this year I am tempted, but I have taken the recommendations into consideration, along with the stats and have decided I would take my chances again this year and not get a flu shot. We'll see what next year brings.  
0.500000	My knowledge of health issue in my life that I was aware of is food combinations that give indications that there may be a serious problem... but it just eating the wrong foods together.
0.928600	My mom came home from work one day and seemed slightly confused. She kept asking me what day it was and what time it was. Since she didn't have any difficulty speaking, I asked her to smile and raise both hands over her head, which she did without trouble.

1.000000	Last year I was at my mother's. She lives in a senior facility. There is a lake on property that we walk to often. One day we arrived at the lake and there was a male resident, wheelchair bound, there. He appeared to be asleep. My mother didn't realize he was there. I immediately had concern. One of those feelings you can't explain. I decided to just keep an eye on him while we were feeding the turtles. I would look his way often and noticed he had moved his wheelchair into a different position. I continued to observe him, but I looked away for a few minutes. Next thing I know he was lying prone on the ground. It appeared that he was grabbing at a tree to pull himself up. That did it for me and I went over to offer my assistance. When I got to him he refused my help. And I realized he was using the tree to push himself to the water. He was going to commit suicide. I used my knowledge of depression (I have suffered through my own recurrent depression for 20 years) and began talking to him and listening to him all while trying to physically hold him still. I became his friend for those moments he really needed someone. I may have been the one who saved his life, but God gave me the calm and physical strength to hold him until some more help arrived.

Replacing proteins, fats, etc with carbohydrates would create US epidemics of diabetes and obesity in the US -- it has. 75% of the brain is myelin, myelin is 100% cholesterol. Statin drugs inhibit liver production of cholesterol, creating our epidemic of Swiss cheese-brained cadavers from Alzheimer's disease. A 6.4 cent 100 mcg vitamin K tablet - size of saccharin tablet - prevents required blood serum calcium and blood  serum cholesterol from bonding at the molecular level into vessel plaque. When I had to tell a doctor that I had a strep throat, he took a culture, then didn't know what to prescribe because I'm allergic to penicillin. His PDR was no help to him, and he finally asked me what was usually prescribed for me, and wrote the prescription after again checking the PDR for correct dosage by weight, after asking me my weight. I was 20 at the time. Want more? Despite foreknowledge of both grandmothers dying of uterine hemorrhage and special care being taken for my first two deliveries, I suffered a uterine hemorrhage with my third child and ""died"" and I'm here only because I responded positively to resuscitation. Further idiocy? Second hand smoke was disproved in 1999, but they keep beating that dead horse. I smoked a pack of Marlboro reds throughout all three pregnancies, and gave birth to healthy, perfect, over 8 pound babies, a girl and two boys. Start looking for the correct reasons -- like minerals missing from the diet because they're never replaced in arable soil -- for birth defects."

I have very few memories of the accident, but I do faintly recall a serious but calming face as I was gently lifted out of the car. The paramedic held my hand as we traveled to the hospital. I was in the hospital for several weeks and that same paramedic came to visit me almost every day. During my stay, I also got to know the various doctors and nurses in the hospital on a personal level. I remember feeling anxiety about my condition, but not sadness or even fear. It seemed to me that those around me, particularly my family, were more fearful of what might happen to me than I was. I donât believe it was innocence or ignorance, but rather a trust in the abilities of my doctors. It was as if my doctors and I had a silent bond. Now that Iâm older I fear death and sickness in a more intense way than I remember experiencing it as a child. My experience as a child sparked a keen interest in how we approach pediatric care, especially as it relates to our psychological and emotional support of children facing serious medical conditions. It was here that I experienced first-hand the power and compassion of medicine,
