1	I was diagnosed with high cholesterol in late 1990's.  I do not want to take statins because of possible/probable side effects, so I did a lot of research on diets and natural supplements and exercise to lower cholesterol naturally and have kept very close to my goals all these years.  
1	As a teeger when I felt a pain in my right side I knew that I needed to get to my doctor as soon as possible, because it could have potentially been appendicitis. It turned out to be something different, but I knew enough to get to a doctor and have them give me an examition.

I grew up on a dairy farm and when I was about 10 I started helping the vet when they came to do herd checks, etc. I have worked in hospitals as a med tech in the ED and lab so I am very comfortable around it when I am not the patient. In my late 20s I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and that was when things began to go downhill health-wise. I had to learn a lot about autoimmune diseases and honestly believe if I hadn't fired my docs at the end of 1999, I would be dead now.

-1	Whenever I take my children to their pediatrician for something other than well-baby check-ups (which is rare as my children are extremely healthy and do not get sick often), I'm always able to reiterate the doctor's information for my husband, who always has a ton of questions for me when he gets home from work.
-1	I really don't know what to say here. I have seems like most of my life been kinda sickly. So with that said, I have always tried to be proactive with my health.

I knew this thanks to indipendant research and told them no.

1	I once got bit by a snake and told the doctor it was a snake bite. He thought it was an insect. Finally I brought the snake into the office and proved it to him.
-1	I cannot actually say that I can. After basic stats like one out of ten are mingled with ideas like false positives I lose confidence in my ability to be certain of their meaning. I think I actually deal in comparative strategies like value judging. For example 30% blockage of an blood vessel sounds terrible in and of itself but if the info accompanying that is stents are not used until 55% then that is how i gauge it.
1	I went to the doctors office a year ago with a grand parent to help them fill out medical forms. There were 5 pages of forms to fill out, but I didn't have any issue understanding what was being asked on the forms. I was able to help them fill out the forms without issue.

I did get the referral and the derm took one look at it and said,  yep that's coning of today. Though it eventually turned out to be ""really weird"" but not cancer,  i still felt I made the right call by insisting. "

The doctor allowed us to try it and come back in a few days to see if it had worked.  It did (it was mullein garlic ear drops) and he avoided antiobiotics.

I found that if you could engage the doctor's in speaking about the disease after I first did my own research and not simply asking questions that I was able to get further with them. For some strange reason, I had to demonstrate some type of knowledge of her health and medical issues before a serious, honest conversation could take place.

The young Resident exclaimed that to put the shunt in he had to guide it with CT. This was the first time I had heard of that. He got sassy with me. I told him the machine would need to be closed down if it got vomit all over it. Eventually I got the charge nurse and I told the young Doctor to be that he was off the case. The Head of his Department came to us and said we were right, my child could aspirate if left on his back in that MRI. (He cannot sit up alone as it is.)

I have had to learn a great deal about how to care for a person in his condition, physical and occupational therapy, (mental health therapy for myself), medicines, diagnoses, possible future outcome, etc. all within the past year and in a very short amount of time.
