0.800000	I have been exposed to very well trained doctors. I usually only visit medical centers that have top-notch doctors. As a result, I trust all of past and current primary care physicians.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because he has never done any harm to me and always has my best interest at heart. I have to trust that he knows what he is doing as I obviously don't have the training that he does. The only thing that does bother me about my doctor is that he is sometimes too busy for his own good and maybe doesn't take as much time as what he should with patients. I think that his office sometimes schedules too many patients in one day and that is what causes this mind set for me. 
0.720000	I trust them for the most part. It's an extreme amount of school and experience required to be one so they aren't messing around. Though, sometimes, they are in a rush and your problem may be really low acuity in their eyes so they may hastily treat you.
1.000000	I trust her because she has always told me the exactly how she felt about any situation. She answers all questions the way she sees fit and now just because it would be what I want to hear. She is straight forward with anything she tells me. She also has never told me wrong and has helped me a lot.
0.960000	He is very knowledgeable and always puts my needs first. He often listens to my problems at our sessions.
0.960000	I really do trust my physician because of his bedside manner, his eye contact, his willingness to answer questions, the way he makes the encounter feel professional but personal. He always greets me when he enters the room, asks me how I've been, reviews the previous visits with me, asks if there have been any new updates or changes, if I've been sick lately. The tone he sets for the entire encounter is always very positive. He makes me feel like it's not just about a paycheck or a routine of his daily life. He asks me if I have any questions. If I do have questions, he's always willing and able to answer me honestly and completely. Sometimes he offers up information on natural remedies that usually have no drawbacks. His attitude is always bright and positive and I never have to dread going in for a checkup or appointment for a new issue. I also know he won't speak of it outside of the appointment. He has my confidence.
0.600000	It's not that I trust or distrust my primary care physician I'm just a very anxious and nervous type of person.
0.840000	My doctor is trained in the medical field and I am not. He also faces malpractice if he does not treat me reasonably or does something outside conventional treatments 
0.800000	i trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing them for many years and they have always been very caring and helpful no matter the situation. i also trust them because i think they want to have a good reputation so they do their best with me as a patient.
0.360000	I feel my doctor is getting ready to retire and doesn't really care about anything anymore. He just hands out pills to everyone and doesn't reall explain what they are for or what they can do to you. Time to find a new doctor that cares.
0.600000	I distrust my primary physician because all you here these days are how people are being prescribed things that they don't need 
1.000000	My doctor is the bomb he listens to my and my needs. I trust him with my care. He is firm but kind and ice been seeing him for seven years.
0.640000	I trust doctors to an extent. Not too much though. They are in business to make a profit at any cost!
0.720000	I trust them but not one hundred percent. The reason its not 100 percent is due to the fact that I feel they are in bed with big pharma. They are always trying to get you to take some sort of pill. Thats why I dont trust them completely. They at times seem to have ulterior motives with these pills. They wont hurt you, just push them like dealers. 
0.640000	because they have more knowledge, education, and training than I do and though I may think I know, they likely know better. They have seen more people with similar issues than I possibly could so I trust them mostly. I also think that they are influenced by things such as insurance and pharma companies and such. That is why I think sometimes they rely on what is convenient and makes them the most money.
0.800000	I trust my physician because in the twenty plus years I have known him, he has been very thorough and effective as far as medical treatment is concerned.
0.720000	I have not been with my primary care physician for a long time so I can't say that I fully trust him at this time.
0.360000	I used to trust my doctor until last summer.  I took my son to see the Dr. and he said he just has an infection take these pills and get some rest.  I trusted my gut and took my son to the ER and found out that he was a type 1 diabetic and he almost died because the doctor did not diagnose him properly, he spent a week in the hospital recovering.
0.680000	PCP is as good as you tell them your issues. In todays medical world they are more of a gate keeper referring patient to specialist as needed.
0.760000	If I did not trust my physician I would change and find one that I would.  I trust my physician currently as I watch how he lives his life outside of the medical field.  Church, community, family.  I judge their ethics away from work to get a feel and add it to how Im treated and the discussions at the office.  Its usually going to see other doctors (any little thing you always have to go see somebody else or 2 or 3) where I have my problems with trust, don't have many to choose from so have to use doctors that are available.
0.840000	I trust that they will make the right decision and give me options and reasons as to why. if you can't trust them to do so who can you trust
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because he has be caring for our family for over 30 years. we have had numerous family members goto see him and they all have had great experiences with him.
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician sometimes because he's made mistakes, rushed to his own judgment, and said things to me that made me feel like he was looking out for himself rather than looking out for my needs. That said, I still use him because he's been willing to admit when he's wrong, correct his behavior, and move forward.
0.480000	All he want is the money the meds he give me all of 5hem has side affect some times it might work and sometime they do Not work it just about money. Its sad
0.960000	I always trust my doctor because there is no reason not to. She went to many years of school to do what she does, and she took an oath. She looks out for my health.
0.640000	Doctors or primary care physicians often rush their patients. A visit is too quick to get to the bottom of one's needs. 
1.000000	She always goes above and beyond. She never stops trying until she finds whats wrong. 
0.760000	My doctor is new so I don't really know her that well.  I will however put trust into her degree. She belongs to a good insurance organization also. 
1.000000	i trust my doctor because i have had her for years and whatever treatment she gives me always makes me better and i always do my study on a person medical or non medical background
0.560000	I trust doctors who take the time to get to know me and my situation, but all too often doctores don't take the time to see you as a person and do not custom,ize their advice to fit your particular circumstance.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because has years of experience in the field. He has been my doctor for over 10 years and would never steer me in the wrong direction. We have a great rapport. 
0.640000	I trust my doctor i have been with her over 20 years and i feel they want you to feel better, if you talk to them and tell then what is wrong they will help you 
0.920000	I have a PCP but I answered these questions regarding my OBGYN because that is the doctor I see most frequently as I have had 2 rough pregnancies over the past few years. I do trust her to take the best care of me. Last spring / summer, she made the decision that I should take progesterone shots beginning at 16 weeks and that I needed to be hospitalized during the second trimester of my pregnancy because of complications. I spent about 2 months there and because of the choices she made regarding my care, I was able to have a healthy baby boy at 35 weeks. She erred on the side of caution because she knew my previous baby had been born suddenly 7 weeks early. Moving forward, if I have any more children I will definitely want to continue under her care because I trust her.
0.560000	I don't really have a primary at the moment. For doctors in general, I feel as if some of them are good and some of them are bad. Some are only interested in themselves and making money and other actually care. Its a toss up. 
0.400000	My doctor often says things like I think you have ......  Without any tests or proof I know I should find another doctor
0.200000	Having a myriad of experiences with physicians as a result of my background, I can say with absolutely certainty that physicians are predisposed to engaging in bad behavior and ebled by society's misconception of all physicians as a group as being compassiote, competent, ethical, trustworthy etc. Having seen shockingly horrifying and abhorrent displays of bad behavior by physicians, there is no way I have any trust in physicians as a group as they are one of the most self-serving, selfish, manipulative, and uncaring people I have come across. This is not to say that all physicians are like this, however, it is important that people drop their false notion of physicians being equivalent to saints so that patients are better equipped to deal with wily, deceptive physicians and are more motivated to be active when seeking healthcare/engaging with physicians. 
0.520000	I do not like authority
0.600000	Because she does not listen to what i have to tell her . she tells me i should go see more doctors like im made of money.
0.880000	"He goes through each option, detail by detail, explains the pros and cons, prices and impact on my health. He often says ""Full disclosure, I benefit from people being RX'd this drug."" If I have suggestions from research, he takes those into consideration and allows me to participate in my care."
0.600000	I have never had one regular primary care physician as I have moved around a lot. My experiences have varied from one doctor to another. They are all individual human beings with different persolities and flaws.
0.760000	Based on his performance and advice throughout the years. I feel confident in his decisions.
0.880000	I have complete trust in the doctors and nurses. They understand my mentally,physically and emotionally personality 
0.800000	My doctor is calm and collected and very sympathetic. She seems to care about me as a patient so I trust her.
0.600000	Doctors really don't spend much time with you then they always send you to the lab for everything when at times a lab report is just another waste of time 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he is always blunt and honest. If I'm doing something to cause the issue he will tell me, and he gives me realistic ideas of the end results or recovery time. 
0.800000	I have had the same primary care physician for over twenty years. He has shown that he intends nothing but the best over the years. I've been able to see his professiolism and he even keeps extra tabs on me to see if I am doing well.
1.000000	I have been going to him for years. He listens to what I say and tries to help me. If I am having a problem he will send me for test to see if anything is wrong. he sent me to have an echo cardiogram when someone said I had a heart mur mur. 
0.520000	I feel that sometimes my Dr. cares more about what's convenient for them instead of me. I also feel like they rush me sometimes or think just because they know me, I don't have any new issues. My Dr. is good b/c anytime I need to see him or her, I can always get a same day or next day appt. They also listen to what I have to say, whether or not I'm right or wrong
0.960000	My MD has a proven record of being a phenomenal physician. My MD has been in the medical field for many years going for people from generation to the next generation. 
0.720000	I have been with them for awhile so I feel confident that they can get the job done right and will provide me with the proper care and diagnosis.
0.600000	I do in some ways trust my doctor or sometimes if they have a lot of patients then I am not as trusting
0.680000	I mostly trust my primary care physician, because I have been seeing this doctor consistently, and I haven't croaked yet.  For the most part, I believe this doctor has my best interests at heart.  However, as a general rule, I do not trust anyone completely.
0.600000	I've had quite a few bad experiences with doctors, so I don't have much confidence in them. Plus lack of health insurance prevents me from having a primary care physician
0.920000	I trust my primary doctors because they are the profession and it would be wrong of me to not trust them. Most of them knows what they are doing and enjoy what they do to make people better 
0.760000	I have issues sometimes with the doctor's staff doing things to make my treatment more difficult. They sometimes do things against my doctor's orders.
0.400000	"I just feel that the doctors are just following what is on the screen or what the head of their department wants. For example in pregncy they do a ""diabetes blood screen"" at 6 months and they make you drink an aweful glucose gmo drink. Now it has come out there are lots and lots of different options of what to drink or even just doing diabetes testing for a few days/week but still the places go ahead and do it because ""protocol"" or like if you have a csection, they force you to a 2nd one or pay extra money to get one with only a few doctors with waiting lists. It's very stressful to have people just blindly following protocol instead of listening to what you need and want and working for you. "
0.880000	Because I've known my primary doctor for over 10 years. He makes sure I'm fine ever visit. He also calls and makes sure I remember to schedule follow up appointments 
0.640000	Overall i trust that doctors have my best interest but sometimes i don't think they take what i'm saying seriously and that could because they see so many patients that they don't have time to really hone into the problem
0.600000	They are kind and know what they are doing.  She never seems to rush and always has time for my questions
0.960000	This specialist has been my doctor for fours.  I have multiple medical issues, all complex.  The doctor has a very high knowledge of the diagnosis and treatments, and gives me all the options.  I trust this doctor very much
0.800000	The biggest reason I trust my primary care physician is because she has not given me a reason to distrust her. Her advice and treatments are well explained and they work. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to understand what is the problem. He also listens to me before he speaks on the issue. In the end he is thoughtful and goes with what i as a patient am comfortable with.
0.640000	For the most part, I trust in doctors, but I've run into situations where they are giving the minimal amount of treatment so they can be done with me and move on to the next patient.
0.720000	I have somewhat trustworthy of my doctor  I know my body more often than she does cause I don't she but once out  the year and my test 
0.600000	i'd like to think most doctors are good. some out there are terrible and just want to make more money. but there are plenty good ones out there to trust
0.560000	My primary care doctor is mostly considerate and kind but often gives me the impression that he is overworked. He has had the tendency to forget certain things about me to the point where I have needed to remind him of things in visits (ie: medication allergy). He has never directly put me in danger with any of his decisions but I would trust him more if he was less rushed and willing to spend more time getting familiar with me and my health.
1.000000	My doctor always seem to have time for me in general and she is very open to what I have to say. And she always listen.
0.560000	I think Doctors can get in the habit of following the same treatment plan over and over. Each person is different and should have their treatment tailored to them. 
1.000000	I completely trust my doctor. he is thorough and honest. he is caring and understanding. he has kept me healthy and happy for many years. I cannot imagine seeking health advice from anyone else.
0.600000	I trust that my primary care physician is knowledgeable but sometimes wonder if she has ulterior motives when she is always trying to push medications on me which I do not think I need. 
0.760000	I believe my physician mostly cares about his patients, including me. Any problems I have with him stem from his reliance on a completely helpless and unintelligent staff.
0.600000	I do not put complete trust in anyone but myself. I would like to believe them but odds are I will get a second opinion or verify what they told me myself.
0.600000	Usually my doctor has been spot on with any diagnosis and knows her stuff. Just wish she was a little  more  personable  and not rushed.
0.800000	My previous Doctor took time to explain everything to me. I never felt rushed. He knew my medical condition and always provided me with the latest and best treatment for me. 
0.480000	I've only recently started seeing her. I had an issue wrong and I feel like instead of truly trying to figure out what was wrong , she just sent me out for any test she felt could possibly solve it for her. Then when the tests didn't work, she was quickly done with me and wanted to refer me out. She has also put me on some questioble medications for this without explaining fully the side effects or that I could have a bad reaction to one of them.
0.800000	I had a near fatal stroke in 2012. After nearly 3 months in various local hospitals, I had to pick a primary care physician since I never really had one.  I picked my current doctor and haven't regretted it one bit.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician based on the relationship that developed.  She discusses the latest information.  She is also an instructor. 
0.960000	    I trust my family doctor completely because he is thorough and complete in ALL of his medical dealings with me. He answers my questions and asks me questions too. If I need a specialist, he knows which ones are better than average and will tell me who to see.
0.800000	i trust doctor in how they perform and how they work with patient's in their medical condition. All doctor's follow their protocol on patient.
1.000000	Because she is always open and honest with me. She doesnât sugar coat anything for me. And that is exactly the way I like it. She takes her time with me. She never acts like she s in a hurry or look at her watch and clock all the time.
0.600000	I feel that doctors are very educated and trained individuals who opinions should be taken into consideration. For serious medical conditions, I believe in obtaining second opinions. I am in general weary of taking prescribed medication.
0.840000	i trust my doctor, she seems very capable and have a lot of knowledge, i always follow her instructions and get better
0.720000	I trust my family doctor. He has been working with myself and other family members for many years. I am an active, healthy individual, so when something is wrong, I trust him to provide and recommend treatment.
0.600000	"Normally, I would say that I trust my primary care physician, however, there are times where they've ""dropped the ball"" on important physical issues/experiences that I've encountered, elongating the amount of time it takes to receive treatment."
0.600000	"I have a disability and I have found that some doctors will try and say that it may be related to something else, and try to prescribe courses of treatment that are inappropriate and do not work. So some doctors will behave in such an unprofessional fashion, just so they can be credited with ""curing"" a patient."
0.600000	At times I feel like just a number and a way to make them money. Other times I feel that they are truly co concerned for my well being and my health care. 
0.680000	I completely trust my doctor because he take time to explain any situation and answer any questions I have and when I check the information on Google or with some other knowledgeable person he all ways seem to be right
0.200000	I do not trust mu primary physician because im afraid he may treat me like an experiment i wish he would better understand me as well 
0.440000	Doctors usually just want to peddle bullcrap expensive medicines that are just overhyped painkillers most of the time. $200 for painkillers is not justified, obviously there's some third party putting pressure on doctors to peddle this crap.
0.600000	I believe that the doctor does know better than me about medical treatment. However, I also know that there are incentives in providing certain options over others, and cultural biases that pervade the doctors perceptions (as well as my own).
0.480000	I distrust some physicians because they are being paid by drug companies. On top of this they often receive a specific training that I may not agree with. Due to this I am more likely to want to see a holistic or alternative physician that I would trust would be open minded like me.
0.640000	I haven't been to my primary care doctor in years. I sometimes feel like doctors over prescribe and over medicalize everything, when there could be more simple solutions. For example, there is proof of doctors over prescribing antibiotics when it isn't necessary.
0.360000	I do not trust completely in my doctor or any doctor for that matter. In 2010, I kept having chest pains and the doctor said that it was nothing. I had them for about a week and then one day I almost passed out in the parking of my electric company and I was taken to the ER. Come to find out I had a blood clot in my lung. I do not trust doctors. If I have a illness I will try and fix it myself.
0.800000	I have had the same doctor since i was little. My kids go to the same doctor. I trust the Urgent care centers in case of emergency
1.000000	I completely trust m doctor! She is very kind and compassionate. She always takes the time to listen to my concerns carefully. She will in turn offer her professional advice to me. She even stays around to have a few minutes of small talk when we are finished. She's absolutely great! 
0.560000	I live in a small town and our doctors are not known for having the best track record for getting diagnosis correct.  We usually use our Primary Care Physician as a way to get to a specialist for a true diagnosis.  I do not let my children go to a local doctor, if they are ill we travel over an hour to take them to a pediatrician's office in a larger city.  
0.520000	I trust them, but I also like to form my own opinion based on my knowledge and experience. Sometimes doctors are not familiar with your entire history so I think it is up to patients to advocate for their own best interests as much as they can. 
0.920000	I always make sure the doctor I am dealing with is trustworthy. They usually have rules in place to make sure I am getting a fair deal, and if not, I can always find someone else or complain about them to the office/hospital. I have never had a bad experience at the doctor's office, and I can tell by their personality that they are taking care of me and have me in their best interests.
0.520000	"I ""trust"" doctors in general, as in, I believe they are highly educated and that this education is important for being able to evaluate complex information and make health-related decisions. I also think most doctors are conscientious about their work with their patients and sincerely care about their well-being, even if they are subject to regular human biases. Personally, though, I hate going to doctors and actively avoid them, because I am an extremely private person and don't want to share personal and sensitive information about myself, or to be physically examined. For this reason, and because I am generally well-educated myself, I strongly prefer to avoid doctors and make personal health decisions on my own whenever possible."
0.520000	I have a chronic illness. Most doctors are quick to say nothing is wrong or that its all in your head when they can't find anything upfront. Most doctors have told me this, and then my last doctor diagnosed me with Epstein Barr. I have recently started seeing a new doctor and I don't know how I feel about her yet.
0.560000	I think it would be foolish to completely trust a primary care physician. They are humans and make mistakes like the rest of us. If it's something important I will want a second opinion.
0.560000	I trust them to a certain extent, but I know they are influenced by Big Pharma, and are reluctant to tell you about natural, effective treatment, and will probably try to get you on some type of prescription that you may or may not need.  In many cases these drugs can do more harm than good.
1.000000	my doctor keeps up with current research and medical journals. she is good at reading my tests - blood, urine, etc. she is knowledgeable about all my medical conditions and the right medications for me.
0.720000	I believe they attended school for a certain amount of time to learn the knowledge needed to assist patience with their needs in a daily basis 
0.760000	As I stated previously, I haven't had any serious conditions, but I have been to my doctor occassionally in the last few years.  Whenever I have seen her she has never seemed rushed or like she was trying to just move along to the next patient. I was able to talk very easily and at length.  Additionally, the illness or issue has always been resolved fairly quickly with the doctor's recommendations.
0.840000	They are the experts in knowing your conditions and how to treat the conditions. Knowledgeable doctors are the best in knowing what is wrong with you they have to keep up to date with all the medical conditions that are coming up in the world today.
0.840000	My doctor has shown me that she is thorough and caring. In the few times I have thought that she might be wrong on something - it turns out that she was right! As far as I am concerned, my doctor has a great batting average when it comes to health, so I am with her for the long haul. 
1.000000	i've been going to my doctor for years and he knows me very well. he gives all options. if i want to do something like try a new medication he'll give me all the pros and cons and also give me other(better) options. he's never dimissive
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because I know they put in the time to learn the skill. I also trust them because they keep up on everything.
0.800000	I have been with the same primary care physician for 15 years now. We have an excellent relationship where she is honest with me about what changes I need to make for better health, and I am honest with her about what my health goals are and the treatment I am or am not willing to undergo. She never tries to pressure me into making a healthcare choice that goes against what I want to do.
0.800000	Ive known him and have been seeing him for a long time. I have no problems telling him exactly what bothers me. I trust him to be right most of the time.
0.920000	I know that my doctor wants to do all he can to make me well.  He gives me options for natural medicine and regular medicine. I know he is a Christian and that also makes me feel better about my care.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he discusses things candidly and in ways I can understand. He always answers any questions and takes my wants into consideration. He is open to exploring any treatments that might benefit me and is honest about side effects and reasons why or why not something may be a good idea. 
1.000000	She makes me feel completely comfortable and she listens. She explains everything to me and answers any and all questions I may have.
0.560000	All doctors tend to have their own way of doing thing and thinking about issues. I feel like it is safe to say that they do not know everything and can be wrong just like anyone else.
0.600000	It seems as if now the doctors are in it for the money and how many patients can be seen. The patent can't get straight answers.
0.840000	I don't have a primary care physician, but I trust doctors in general. I believe that they are extremely knowledgable in their field, and took on the job because they have the desire to help people. Therefore, I would say that I am very trusting of their advice.
0.880000	My physician does a great job of explaining things carefully and thoughtfully. He also believes in getting a second opinion when needed.
0.400000	My doctor used to really care about her patients.  It seems as though her practice has gotten way too busy and now she doesn't take the time she used to with her patients.  This makes me distrust her a bit.
1.000000	I have been with the same doctor since I was a teenager and I completely trust him. I never   feel uncomfortable around him because, i know that, i can trust him.   I love my doctor and we share a very friendly relationship with each other at all times.
0.400000	I have had plenty of experiences with doctors where they don't even seem to exam whatever concern you have, they just brush it off or prescribe something so that they can get on with their day. Rather than really looking into something, i think they'd rather just treat everything as if its routine even if it isn't. Add on the fact that I can walk into a doctor's office and see a cutout of a pharmaceutical that they are being paid to push and it makes me feel like they're here to be salesmen instead of helping.
0.880000	Because I've been seeing him for years and I haven't had a any problems, He's good and professional 
0.920000	He listens to me, seems genuinely interested in what I have to say and my opinion on how I feel.  He spends an adequate amount of time with me and doesn't ever rush through  my appointment.
0.760000	Some primary care providers are somewhat of a trust because of male practice or other issue at a specific location
0.840000	I trust my doctor because I had her for years. And she tries to make sure that everthing is done for me.
0.800000	My primary care doctor is great - she is very direct and straightforward while also being friendly and pleasant. She does not sugar-coat and is open to my getting second opinions, and she is happy to answer all of my questions (I bring lists). She never seems rushed.
0.760000	He has studied medicine a lot more then I have, but the things I have researched have aligned with what he has told me.
0.680000	The reason why I mostly trust my primary care physician is because he examines and explains all physical circumstances to the best of his knowledge. Every challenge I have encountered rendered very positive results thus far. Although I am also aware that my doctor is not perfect and is very capable to error. This is why it is important to research certain medical ailments on my own as well. Asking plenty of questions are always in order when it comes to my well being.
0.920000	my doctor is open, honest, tell it like it is, what the expected results should be; the cost, the reason for the prescription, etc.
0.880000	My doctor that I see most often is an extremely intelligent and interesting person. We have talked on many subjects over the years. I trust him to treat me in the best possible way for my situation at the time. He is very personable and open to discuss whatever is on your mind.
0.800000	having been with my primary care doctor for years, following his directives i have remained healthy.

0.800000	My doctor has several years of experience and has always been forthright and open with me when it comes to routine appointments as well as necessary test. I have had different doctors in the past who were not that way.
0.520000	I recently switched from my pediatrician to a regular doctor and the general exam was less thorough. I felt that I could say anything and he didn't seem to care.
0.800000	I have no reason not to trust my physicians. They have always given me information that is thorough and thoughtful.
0.840000	I my doctor has delivered two of my kids and before my kids I was seeing the same doctor, he is a very good doctor 
0.680000	Having worked in the medical field for many years I can conclude that sometimes doctors push a certain treatment that may not be the best possible choice for the patient. I understand doctors work directly with pharmaceutical companies whose interest is making money.  
0.800000	based on prior diagnosis I and confident in what my doctors provides a treatment or additional test to run
0.640000	I have a new doctor and he seems fine. So far he persoble and seems knowledgeable. I hope over time he will be a good choice.
0.600000	My trust is mixed. I've had great experiences with my doctor where they were very caring and compassionate and helpful. There have been other times when it didn't seem likes they cared about me at all. One time they abandoned me in a room so they wouldn't miss their tee time.
0.840000	I trust her because she is a strong female. Currently she serves in the Army National Guard and just got home from overseas. She is as tough as they come and listens well. I am a little intimidated to tell her things in relation to myself at times because she is so strong. Overall, she knows my home situation and understands being a full time caretaker is a hard job. She makes referrals when necessary and only lets me try meds that she knows will not make me too tired to care for my family member. I don't feel like a number when I see her. Nice office staff helps too!
0.800000	I trust him because of the history i have with him, between having a baby and him understanding my health goals, it helps to have someone who knows your body and the required things it needs to feel better or well.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because he has never led me astray. He seems genuine in his concern for my health and the methods I need to use to fix whatever ailment I have. 
0.760000	I've never been given a reason to distrust a doctor I've seen. I've always been given information and had my questions answered in a reasonable manner. 
0.560000	I do not have a primary care physician. In general, I always like to question my doctor though. Itâs part of my nature.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because that is their job to know what is going on. I have not had an interaction yet with a doctor where I feel they were not doing their part to help me understand something. I sometimes think some doctors care more about things they need to be doing than the patient themselves but maybe these particular doctors are more on the research side of things as opposed to patient facing.
0.520000	I feel that my primary care physician has a very heavy work load and sometimes may be in such a rush that she misses something. She missed by back pain that was actually a kidney stone, for example.
0.520000	Because hey might mix up my results and Donald trump this year I mean cmon and don't even get me started on Ben Carson like why are they even here please don't ask me this again I have arthritis hard to type I'm speaking into my laptop 
0.800000	I trust my physician because he is thorough and explaining the information about what is going on me and my health. Second, he listens to my concerns related to my health. Also, my doctor can be trusted when it comes to making decisions related to my health.
0.720000	They are experienced and i feel that they know more about what is going on than i do.  I don't feel they are swayed by drug vendors often but that thought has crossed my mind before.  Overall i feel trusting of doctors.
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because he also took care of my mother while she battled a terminal illness. We became close with him during that time and he did a lot for my mom. His care went above and beyond and that has made me trust him very much.
0.560000	too big a hurry to fully listen to what Im describing.. wants his job to be much quicker and easier while still making alot of money.
0.760000	"If the doctor is bad, it's likely that it would have been revealed by now to someone else. It's extremely unlikely that a doctor would be ""out to get me"" specifically. Furthermore, since I lack the necessary scientific knowledge to verify everything the doctor says, I have no real way to check what they say. Since it's unlikely that they're misleading me and attempting to verify them is impractical, there's little point in worrying about it. Of course, if someone does mislead me, I wouldn't hesitate to distrust them in particular."
0.800000	I DO TRUST MY NEW DOCTOR.  SHE IS RIGHT TO THE POINT ABOUT THINGS.  SHE TELLS YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND TELLS YOU HOW SHE FEELS WHEN YOU DON'T DO IT.  SHE HOLDS NOTHING BACK.  SHE HASN'T LET ME DOWN AS OF YET.  
0.560000	My doctor is a good doctor but rather conventional and not always open to some of my suggestions.  I am very chronically ill and in constant pain but he refuses to allow me to use medicinal cannabis although it is legal in my state.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she is able to deturmine my elments through lab work and any xrays I need and she takes her time with me not rushing
0.840000	I have to see doctors relatively often, and although most visits are quite short, my doctor (or the nurse) is always willing to explain something I don't understand. I believe my doctor is concerned about my health problems and prescribes the medications he feels will work the best (I often have to change medications because one isn't working or a new one causes problems with an older one).
0.680000	My doctor always makes sure to look over everything and run multiple tests if needed. He's very concerned about how you're feeling and finding an answer. On the other hand, one of the nurse practitioners likes things that are convenient for her and usually comes up with a diagnosis without further investigation. Overall I trust my doctor but not the other staff.
0.600000	I don't have a primary care physician at this time.  In general, I do trust my doctors though.  I think most doctors are honest and capable.
0.920000	My doctor wants to know about my activities and life so she can better address my medical problems not just the lab work
0.800000	Because I have been able to talk to him like a person - without it feeling like a judgment.
0.960000	I have been seeing this doctor for several years.  He is very professiol, approachable and friendly.  He also has very good reviews from other patients. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to talk to me about all aspects of my health, and helps me look into a multitude of treatment options, where applicable. He is very experienced, and takes the time to listen to me (which can be rare in doctors). I get the feeling that my family's and my own health are important to him.
0.720000	I feel that the few doctors I've had really answer my questions and take time to explain things to me. Even when I don't understand something he takes time to help me understand. Easy to talk to and makes me feel like he cares.
0.800000	I have been seeing my PCP for many years. Since I am in good health, we rarely have issues requiring lots of medical direction or intervention. However, in the conversations we have had, I trust his judgment and expertise. He has always been straightforward with me about illnesses and treatment.
0.760000	I trust my primary physician because he seems to have my best interest at hand. he listens to my opinions and when I questions his decisions and explains why
0.920000	My primary care person is actually a NP that i have been seeing for years. She gets me, my actual PCP supervises her but does not get me and i am not fond of her bedside manner.
0.360000	doctors are human beings.  their work is a job just like other people have jobs.  people are people.  you have competent ones, and incompetent ones.
0.600000	I love my doctors he really care about me and he sees my son and he cares bout him too my doctor is a good doctor
0.720000	I trust most doctors to do what's right, but I also believe that they've been taught to treat illnesses instead of trying to avoid being sick in the first place. So I believe there are tests done to people that might not be totally necessary in the first place. That's just what they're taught. 
0.600000	Feel doctors treat overweight patients a little differently.  Also led some by drug and insurance companies. Too many unnecessary tests.
0.760000	My PCP has always been very kind, thoughtful, and educated. I have never felt like an idiot while being in the office with her. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care doctor because she does a thorough check with me when I see her for daily check ups. She is always very patient and kind despite how mean some patients can be. She also suggests where I can run tests that won't cost me money. There's never been an incident where I lost my trust in her.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he is very experienced. He is very sincere and honest with me. He is very down to earth and tells me like it is, regardless of how I feel.
0.280000	"I do not trust my doctors because I have asked them simple questions sometimes and they give me the most basic answer so they don't have to waste their time answering me properly. Example, I asked what type of blood I am and the response I got was: ""Oh, now the type of blood is no longer as easy as a letter. It's complicated. It's a number of letters and numbers. Don't worry about that."" Also, my doctor put me on the wrong treatment once and it lasted for months. "
1.000000	I will always trust my doctor because he is the best at what he does plus he very honest and open minded I can ask him anything  and hes always honest
0.440000	It's not a question of trust, but I know what's best for me. A doctor is an adviser, not the end-all be - all. I trust my docs, but as they say, I trust my mother, but I still cut the cards
0.520000	The reason I cant trust my primary physician on a regular day to day daily basis is because to me it seems a lot of them are simply in it for the check. I also feel like my primary physician looks at everything from a book perspective, and the truth is no matter what schooling no book can tell you everything about real life, especially when dealing with a real life person. I feel a lot of providers just see us as a number or a insurance claim, they aren't understanding enough to realize that some things are just life not everything can be explained via a book. 
0.200000	THE MEDICAL PROFESSION HAS LITTLE OR NO TRAINING IN NUTRITION AND RELIES ON PHARMACEUTICAL POISON TO FIX AN ISSUE.
0.960000	i trust my primary care physician because they are very competent and i am pleased with them. very good prescriptions and affordable health care for me and my family. 
0.600000	I have no issues with my current primary care physician. However, in the past, I had a PCP that was not very attentive during my yearly physical examinations. This resulted in my performance anxiety condition to go undiagnosed throughout my childhood until finding a new PCP later in life. 
0.840000	They have been with me since I was young and have built a reputation 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because he has a good education and asks me plenty of questions. I have never had a problem with him.
0.720000	It is her job and she has the training necessary to give me proper information; she also seems to really care about her job rather than just going through the motions and takes time to think about questions I have rather than answering off the cuff, which seems to mean that she is giving some real thought.
0.520000	I have been given a new doctor recently who've only been to once.  Therefore, It is difficult to judge how much I can trust them.  The majority of the time spent is sitting with a nurse.
0.800000	My doctor is pretty good at giving me all of the options and making sure that I am doing what I want, for the most part. There are rare times when they are busy and ther just isn't time and they tell me to just do something and I trust they are doing what is best and know better than myself. 
0.680000	My doctor talks extensively with me about any feelings I may have regarding my health or treatment. I feel I can say anything to him or her (I have two physicians) about what I'm feeling or worried about, therefore, I feel I can trust them in my care & treatment.
0.920000	I have been going to my doctor for about 30 years.  He is also a personal friend of my husbands.  At the same time, he is a very conscientious and caring doctor so I trust that he has my best interest at heart.  He is also passionate about his profession and has been in practice for a long time so I am sure he is very knowledgeable.
0.600000	I do not trust any human being completely. Everyone can be trusted to a certain point. I can't put too much trust in anyone that's getting paid. I only have complete and total trust in God. No one else will ever earn that.
0.520000	I don't go to the Dr all the often, but when I did, it always seemed like he was in a rush. I would tell him what was ailing me, but it felt like he was just talking at me instead of to me. It felt like he never took me seriously. He has since moved on to another practice out of state, but I don't miss my former doctor at all.
0.480000	I don't completely trust my doctor because in the past they regularly suggest things that aren't necessary, but that are extremely expensive. They seem to have no understanding that not everyone can afford anything they want. They act like money is no object. I don't think they're looking out for my best interest.
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician due to actually taking the time to listen to what I am saying and talking with me about what the right path is for me.
0.800000	I have had my doctor for a while now and have been to him many times.  He has always been kind, gentle, intelligent, and informative.  I think that he really cares about his patients and me specifically so I trust what he has to say.
0.560000	I have had hard to diagnosis conditions in the past and because I go to a large HMO where the doctors have a huge client load, I feel that there is no way that a doctor can adequately diagnosis this type of condition. After a doctor's appointment, I often combine research that I've done online with what they say or prescribe. 
0.640000	Sometimes doctors are under time constraints and don't have the time to thoroughly explain things to their patients
0.760000	I trust my primary care phycician. Since coming into her care she has always been helpful as kind. I believe she helps me to the extent of her abilities. 
0.600000	I have faith i God and i trust that God will lead me to best physician for me who knows my condition if and or when i have one. I believe that dr.will be completely effecient in treatment care for me. Im optimistic snd prayerful
0.720000	I have only had my doctor for a year and have not had any new treatments or diagnosis since being her patient
0.880000	I think they tell me my options. I rely on their experience. I have rare skin disease so most doctor's don't know much about it. I can tell by their responses if I  trust them. Example - some admit they don't  know about my condition, while some try to suggest something I know doesnât work.
0.520000	I sometimes trust them because they give good solutions, and sometimes I never get the right cure. Also some doctors tend to be very well behavied and this gives me some more trust because they judge the case as if this is their case.
1.000000	each time i go to the doctor, she always explains things clearly. She gives me all the options I have to cure what ails me. If she does not know an answer she is not afraid to say it either. So I know she won't just make something up.
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for a long time. If he doesn't know the answer to my question he will find out for me. He is very caring and attentive towards me about my problems.

0.800000	My doctor has never steered me wrong before. Although he may have been quick with information i have always been able to find out what i need.
0.880000	I trust them because it is their job.  I do realize that everyone has flaws and sometimes ulterior motives. However I still trust the doctor.
0.920000	I have recently acquired a new physician.  He is young and on the cutting edge.  He cares and is very attentive.
0.720000	I don't trust doctors because their not trustworthy I always trust my gut instinct. And I don't know why I have to type so much
0.760000	I have known my doctor for years, he takes care of my family and know and trust him to make careful and thoughtful decisions concerning my health.
1.000000	They have always seemed to care about my needs and seem to be very knowledgeable. They spend as much time with me as needed. They have also never guided me wrong yet.
0.680000	I trust them because I have to, they are the medical professionals and as long as I give them all the information they need they should be able to tell me what's wrong. I distrust because they are in business to make money as well. Medical world is big business and driven by insurance company's and their reimbursements 
0.640000	I trust my doctor because she always listens to what i want and needs she helps me get all the tests I need 
0.720000	I trust my physician because he has gotten me to a better state of health, so that I will live a longer healthier life. I have leds impacting meds to take. 
1.000000	I completely trust my Dr because he has been my family physician every since I can remember. He has always been good with diagnosis, treatments and helping with affordable medicine. 
0.640000	The doctor's experience, Your level of education, Your work experience, Their industrial-level status
0.360000	I typically do not trust doctors. They seem to be rushed and not look at people's problems as a whole. I hate when doctors only want to look at one problem that you have and not look at your body as a whole.
0.920000	Because I have a good doctor I trustHer she is good and works with meWhat more do you want me to say that's all I can say
1.000000	I have been with my physician almost my entire life.  He has on more than one occasion diagnosed me with something that the hospital did not.  Everyone in my town looks up to this man as a talented diagnostician.  If I need a note, he never objects, he always helps me out of things if I need it.  I even have his cell phone if there is an emergency, and he has neglected to charge me a few times when I have been going through financial hardships.  He cares deeply about all his patients and it really shows.
0.760000	He knows my condition and what is the best form of treatment for me, always answers my questions and addresses my concerns
0.480000	The doctor I've been seeing is mean and ignort. Can't ask him questions and get scared to say anything at all around him. Even his nurses look like they Dont want to ask anything
0.520000	i mostly trust my doctors but I need to double check through independent research to have full confidence
0.600000	he ahs experience and doesn't lecture just tells it like it is and lets the chips fall where they may and the consequences of such actions.
0.440000	All doctors treat you for symptoms you dont need medical attention for. They get a kick from certain medications, so they convince you to take it. We have proven it. A doctor told (Ã) to take (said medication), and (+) didnt take it, and after 6 months, there was no difference.     I only take mine when I need to.
0.720000	My doctor is a no nonsense person. She tell it to you like it is and do not hesitate to explain why your ailment is what it is
0.760000	I like him and have used him for years. I trust him.
0.760000	I trust my doctor to the fullest and I think she has my best interest of all I don't think see would lie to me at no point at all and she never lie to me so far don't think so would now
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been seeing him for over 15 years and every time I go there it is consistent.  I have no reason not to trust him.  I cannot speak for everybody else though, because I believe some doctors could be corrupt. 
0.320000	It's my life, it's not my doctor's life. It's his job. Even if he has every intention of doing the best by me, that doesn't mean he's capable or doing that does it. Doctor's don't know everything, and it's my body and health and I have to live with it.
0.720000	I've had the same primary for nearly my whole adult life. He also has had my parents as patients for many years. 
0.800000	My doctor and I have a similar temperament and she is knowledge, down to earth.  I trust my physician to prescribe medication, inform me of treatment options and perform any type of medical procedures.
0.680000	I trust my physician to have knowledge but i distrust because in my experience in life, 3 physcians will have different opinions on treatment.
0.880000	While I am intelligent and know what is best for me and my lifestyle,  I value her education and experience in the health care system. 
0.720000	I have been seeing the same primary for years, since I was a teeger. He delivered my oldest daughter and he has always been forthcoming.  He is also the primary for most of the women in my family and has always been wonderful to all of us.
0.800000	I believe my primary care physician is trustworthy.  He came up as a PA from the previous doctor that was there at the practice and the retired doctor was very much a people person.  The current doctor has learned a lot from him but is now more of people person as well.  I trust him because he will follow up with questions and answers to treatment options.
0.400000	Typically my doctor seems to always want to do things that cost but i have no money. I feel was though she always wants me to visit but never helps me with my problem
0.800000	I have never had reason not to trust a doctor. This could be because I have always had pretty good health but event he small issues i have had were taken care of without problems or concerns.
0.800000	My newest doctor is very good.  He takes the time with me to sit in the office after my physical and address any concerns.  This is the first time I have had a doctor that takes enough time with me.  I really do trust him and he explains things to me thoroughly
0.960000	My NP seems to have a good grasp on medications I am to be prescribed, giving me confidence in taking it. If it works out not so well, she is on board with another medication that might help instead.
0.720000	I trust my physician because he has been my primary doctor for many years. He listens to me and doesn't judge me regardless of my habits. He always tries to provide the best guidance possible.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because he us experienced.  He also takes the time to figure out what is wrong.   He is also available when I need him.
0.640000	I don't know how you feel better soon to be the best for you and your mom is the best ot your life for the rest is just the way I can see the point in time for me today 
0.400000	They don't have the same helpful enthusiasm when you don't have insurance. They rush through the visit, take their time getting to you, and assume you just want drugs. 
0.840000	I do trust my Doctor, I do not think he has ill intentions, and I believe he wishes to provide me with the best care possible.
0.280000	There is no doctor that tells the complete truth to heir client. Their pockets are lined and their methods are biased.
1.000000	My doctor is very thorough and he goes over my chart with me.He also ask about how things are going with other Dr he have recommended me to see
0.760000	I trust my DR because she takes time to listen to me. She seems to really care. I've been going to her for quite a while now. My previous dr. recommended her to me and I trust him completely
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because they are experienced and very caring. MY physician takes the time to explain all the possible procedures and how they will effect my outcome. My physician from day one has spent ample time with we talking and understanding my needs and concerns
0.400000	Doctors are after the bottom line for the most part, which that is how many patients can I see in a day and how much money can I make off them. My doctor is sort of that way and I don't like having to wait hours for just 5 minutes of his time. It takes longer than that to diagnose someone and help them through that situation
0.920000	They have always taken great care of me & my family. My doctor has been in the family for several generations. He knows our history very well.
0.960000	In my case, my primary care physician is also a good personal friend that I've known since before he was my doctor.  We built a relationship of trust before we had a business relationship and that has carried over into seeing him as a doctor.  Any time I have had an issue I have honestly expressed it to him and he has given me straight answers on what my options are and what the possible outcomes were.
0.800000	My doctor always provides an explanation of why I may or may not need a treat.  He provides all of the pros and cons that help me with a decision.
0.520000	I feel like now days, doctors are in a rush to get patients out of the office, and not so interested in what is going on with the patient, only what they think or the easiest way to get the patient to leave.
0.760000	good stuff sweet things nothing like it cool product so hard and classic make it happened cool things rare stuff all day
0.680000	Because Doctors do care about my health and for my whole body to feel much better.Sometimes Doctors don't care or didn't do a good job when it comes to asking so many questions and Got me upset, about something.that's awkward.Doctor's are there to find out what's going on with my health and to learn about me getting the help I need.
0.400000	My doctor only sees me as an obese ugly woman and only wants to get to the next patient.  Doesn't see me as a person but only $$$ signs
0.600000	He seems like  a  good  person  hope  I can  keep  this one longer then a year  I hope  all goes  well  with  this  doctor  
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician. She is empathetic, thorough, and a great communicator. She always takes the time to thoroughly explain things. I never feel like she is in a rush.
0.760000	I feel doctors truly care for their patients and want the best for them.
0.600000	I trust most doctors but I have had a few that seemed like I was just another number and just tell you something to get you in and out quickly
0.760000	My doctor always listens to my concerns and addresses them in a timely manner. I don't feel neglected or rushed when I am at my  appointment. 
0.720000	I have been going a long time and always get the help I need. My doctor goes over options with me and takes the time to explain things.

0.880000	I have complete trust in my physician,been going to for 15 years.never had a problem.knows what doing.office staff friendly,clean,and askes how your doing.

0.760000	He has always given me different options and explain them clearly to me. He always stays on me about my health and wants me to be healthy without the help of any medication if possible. 
0.600000	I trust doctors to a certain extent because each individual case is different and the patients needs have to match with the doctor's orders.
0.800000	I have been going to the same doctors my whole life. They have all my info and they have had it since I was a little kid. I can trust them because they know all there is to know about me. I almost lost trust in them when they did not send one of my important documents over to my school, but then we kept calling the office until they sent this. I really do not know if you are reading this but if you are then know in a game of 1 on 1 basketball you cannot gaurd me.
0.360000	To many doctors only have book smarts. if  something isnt a  text  book case they dont believe in thinking out side the  box  
0.640000	I usually choose a primary care physician with lots of experience. I based my trust off of his experience and user review online.
0.840000	i don't know yet. Not so sure what to do but, I'll keep trying the best I can. Maybe things will get better sooner or later.
0.800000	I recently had a serious leg injury and surgery and she has been in contact with me almost daily to check on me and make sure I have what I need to get better.  She also makes sure that I am doing the things I need to do for the rehab of my knee and wrist to get full function back.
0.760000	I trust because he has been very effective in his diagnosis. His advises has always been for my better health. He is seriously concerned about my well being.If I have a medical problem, he always clearly makes me understand the situation in very simple layman language. 
0.400000	My primary care physician is not interested in my care.  He just wants me in and out so he can get to the next patient or have sometime off in between patients.  He only ever tells me one option even if I ask for another option he will just tell me the first option was better.
0.600000	I have a neutral opinion. The only time I questioned the doctor's diagnosis was when I still went to a pediatrician, and they thought I had a bacteria infection. It turned out when the sickness came back, it was actually full blown bronchitis. 
1.000000	I trust my physician because she is very thorough and is very caring. I also trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable and knows what she is doing.
0.800000	I trust my doctor. I have many health conditions going on so it has to pin point whats ailing me on a specific day
1.000000	I completely trust my primary care physician because he has gone above and beyond in handling my illnesses.  There has been times when I have gone in for a routine check up and he sent me directly to the emergency room.  Upon arriving at the emergency room I was informed that my blood level was severely low.  He has recommended me for four surgeries and I have felt a little bit better after each. 
0.800000	They have shown me options that don't cost me money at all. Something that I can do on my own to help deal with issues I may have. His last resort would be additiol treatment or medication. 
0.920000	he takes the time and effort to explain all health issues. He never seems to be in a big hurry to move onto the next patient
0.600000	I cant say whether or not if i trust or distrust my  doctor. In all honesty it depends upon the situation at hand.
0.920000	 My primary care doctor had shown diligence in researching ways to help me personally. She knows my conditions and is careful to address all of my concerns. I trust her because she's earned that trust over time. 
0.680000	I trust that they are doing the very best they know how. And I'm very aware of the fact they they are only human and they are limited in there knowledge and expertise on all subjects
0.200000	The doctors office i go to is always so busy. I normally have to wait a very long time for appointment. Then when the doctor sees me now it does not last for more than 20 minutes. They are always telling me to leave and that there is nothing I can do.
0.760000	No primary care physician, but I feel that their Hippocratic oath binds them to being the best they can for their patients
0.400000	I do not always trust physicians anymore.  I feel that money and profits are he incentive behind all medical care, and often treatments may be given that do not even help or are sure to fail just to collect the money.  I am beginning to wonder if things like cancer are just big money makers for doctors and hospitals, and there really is no desire for a cure.  I feel that now, more than ever, doctors are not curing people, they just are creating customers that have to come back repeatedly.  Every prescription drug has so many side affects, that other things go wrong with a person, and the doctor is profiting by prescribing certain drugs.  I could be wrong, but I am starting to feel this way.
0.880000	I trust them to stir me in the direction of wellness and find a cure to the issue. Do not have a primary physician.
0.680000	I am cautiously trusting of my doctor's care for me, following up with questions if there are areas I feel she has not covered or been as thorough as needed. 
0.600000	It's hard to understand and get the right answer we should try to get all the information as possible 
0.800000	The only doctor I see is my dentist.  I HATE going to the dentist, and refused to go for decades.  Pain overrides fear to a point so I went.  I still get a nervous wreck when I go; but I trust him.   So far he has been very nice and careful.  He even gave me a free filling.
0.640000	he is a doctor and he know what to do and how to treat so i trust him/her but i also do my research on it and seek out the treatment  
0.600000	I trust my doctor but due to him having so many patients I do not feel like I gte the most thorough of care. However here are not too many doctors to chose from that deal with my medical condition.
1.000000	I have never had an experience with my current primary care physician that would make me question my trust in them.  They have always been helpful, receptive and caring.
0.840000	He is honest and upfront. He listens to my needs and answers any questions I may have without making me feel rushed
0.840000	They show that they care I never have trust issues they explain everything to me that I need to know and answer all questions
0.520000	I feel like a couple of health issues that I have had to deal with have been belittled or downplayed when talking to my doctor
0.520000	He doesn't take time to listen to what is I am saying. He comes into the room, checks your breathing, look into your ears (only if asked) and then proceeds to write prescriptions 
0.840000	I've been going to see him a long time and he tells me the truth...even when it's hard to hear.  He never spares my feelings and always shoots straight with me.  I really appreciate it and trust everything he says.
0.760000	I trust my physician due to the fact of being a paitent of his nurse for a number of years in the past
0.600000	I think it is more that I do not trust the time put into me as a patient than that I do not trust my physician.  I worry that my doctor has a busy schedule and because she works for a big company she is required to keep her time with me short.  I do not believe that it is possible to come to correct, well-thought conclusions when you only have 15 to gather information, process it, and explain to the patient.
0.800000	He seemed legitimately interested in now i felt and what u needed from him. He didn't brush me aside or tell me to make another appointment when I had more than one issue to attend to.
1.000000	It's their job to be honest and to give me all of the information available
0.400000	They push medicine at me and don't look at me as a whole person so just address symptoms as separate.
0.720000	After listening to my concerns the doctor prescribed the medication that would best handle my medical condition
0.520000	I don't trust my doctor because she just looks at her computer all the time and sends me to get test done. I need to be on disability,but she thinks I don't.
0.840000	For the most part I think I trust my doctor. She always takes her time and really listens to what I have to say before making any sort of rash decision. If I have any questions she's more than willing to answer and we talk what would be best for me. She's very kind and I find it easy to discuss things with her. Overall I think  I trust her decisions and think that she has my best interests at heart.
0.800000	Sometimes I think that most doctors are honest and some give wrong diagnosis. Byt I've never been given the wrong diagnosis by a doctor everything has been accurate.
0.560000	I just do I don't have that many things to say . I'm not a very talkative person. Sometimes I think they are in it for the money and cont really care about the patients.
0.600000	All doctors, like all eople, are different. In my lifetime I had to change my doctors due to unprofessional aproach.
0.640000	I do not go to the doctor often so from my experience would require more time with the person but sometimes I believe doctors are dishonest in treatment plans as they don't give medications that will heal but rather fix the problem temporarily so that a patient returns
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because he is very friendly, trustworthy and always make sure I'm comfortable.
0.680000	I trust my doctor, because she takes time with me, making sure everything g is OK..I trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable
0.360000	I think they lie and some of them tell the truth but i dont believe nobody because i have trust issues
0.840000	She spends a good deal of time with me during my appointments.  I never feel rushed, and she appears to genuinely listen when I ask her a question.  I'm also able to carry on a constructive dialogue with her, where I share my own opinions.
0.800000	She is very open to listening; easy to talk to; demonstrates genuine concern in my health & well-being
0.760000	Doctors that I have dealt with have been upfront with me and told me what is wrong and what I should do about it. Beating around the bush is very uncommon.
0.720000	I have trust in my primary care physician, he be good on alot of care. He be totally honest about all different treatment options in my condition.
0.720000	I have a good endocrinologist that I trust with medical issues; however, when it comes to diet recommendations he does not have accurate info.  I listen to my body and know that I must eat a ketogenic diet which my doctor does not agree with.
0.760000	I really trist my primary care provider first snd for most because he listens to me and respects my decisions. He is always willing to talk in depth with me about my concerns and answer questions and respectful of my medical choices even if they go against what he recommends. In the past he has gone out of his way to look into other treatment options for me and their effectiveness. He is also very respectful of my body and perspective- to elaborate he really takes into considerstion my persol reports about things where as other medical providers in the past have blown me off and insisted Im reporting symptoms wrong etc.
0.680000	I have only been to this doctor for 2 physicals and I have not had any serious problems so it is hard to judge whether I trust her completely. She seems nice enough and she doesn't force me to do things that I disagree with her about so she seems okay. For instance I have osteoporosis and I have found a very good supplement which is used to treat osteoporosis in Japan and the doctor wanted me to take prescription meds and I refused because of the side effects. She allowed me to go the course I prefer at my own risk. We will see what will happen when the stakes are higher as far as having a more serious health problem ( which I hope does not happen any time soon). 
0.720000	He gives it to you straight.  Very thorough. Sometimes he is took much about treating the symptom rather than solving the real problem causing the symptom. He is open to alternative medicines.
0.600000	My doctor just rushes through things, but i think she always goes with the best choice
0.880000	I have seen my primary care physician for many years now. She has taken the time to get to know me personally and builds on this each visit. She offer medical advice as she would give to her own family
0.720000	i trust my family doctor because no matter what a hurry he is in he will sit and explain everything to me 
0.200000	Doctors come in an listen to you for barely 5 minutes, then do some perfunctory examinations like check blood pressure and come to a decision on your situation.  Its obvious often doctors have no clue on how to diagnose a non-visible symptom like stomach pain or neurological issues.  They just tend to prescribe yah a prescription and rush you out the door.  The prescription might do more harm than good too.  Its clear that some of the doctors I have fit this profile and aren't very circumspect or patient oriented.
0.600000	I trust my doctor to s point but when I'm recommended medicines that I know I don't need I feel as if I can't trust him.
0.840000	She is mindful of my family history and as such makes sure she keeps a check on potential diseases or disorders I may inherit.
0.640000	I am a little wary of doctors and their personal interests, and how this may conflict with my interests, but I generally feel confident in my personal doctor. He has always been straightforward with me. 
0.400000	I feel that many doctors are overworked and don't necessarily care about wellbeing of patients.  They are also at the mercy of insurance and pharmaceutical companies.  It is a sad day, because I remember when it was the other way around and doctors did what was best for their clients.
0.600000	I often get simple answers to my ailments as if wha I'm feeling is normal when it clearly is not. I would like more attention to be paid to my concerns.
0.880000	I fully trust my PCP because I feel that she is open and allows me to play a large role in my own healthcare. When I discuss my health with her, it is very natural and not uncomfortable. She allows me to make decisions together with her and she always listens to my concerns and opinions.
0.480000	Doctors are paid to tell you what they think you want to have done.  They don't really care about what is best for you, they want you to do what is going to make them the most money.  They are also paid by pharmaceutical companies to push certain drugs on you that you probably don't need.
0.480000	You can never trust a doctor all the way good or bad. Some times they out for money sometimes they want the best for you. 
0.640000	He usually explains the situation to me, asks my opinion when choosing a treatment. This way, he earned my trust
0.680000	The doctor I see most  is a neurologist.  I trust him very much, but not completely.  I have to rely on myself as well.  Ask questions, and keep asking them.
0.960000	They spent years learning their practice so I should be able to trust them.
0.800000	My primary care physician cannot and does not treat all of my health issues, but I trust him to refer me to specialists who can help me.
0.560000	I trust them because they know a lot about what they are doing and they care about the patients. They have the awareness to know how to take action
1.000000	I have been seeing my primary care doctor for almost 4 years now, give or take, and he has always been a very very truthful, and integrity based person. He tells it how it is, and he is a doctor who doesn't like to just prescribe medication and be over with it. He takes the time to sit and talk to figure out exactly what the problem is, and if some type of medication is needed or absolutely necessary he will prescribe it. Otherwise we find different ways of dealing with it or try a lower tier of medication than something that could be addictive or hazardous to health. He is a genuine doctor and I have never had any issues with him.
0.760000	She listens to what I say, she remembers or has notes about my concerns from previous visits (such as disdain for taking drugs).  Sometimes I wish she was a bit more firm with me about things like my weight, etc.
0.800000	I trust my physician because he has never steered me in the wrong direction. Every time I had a medical condition he has been able to properly diagnosis it and come up with a treatment option. He always offered multiple treatment options that I could take.
0.600000	I trust them to an extent but I don't have a very strong relationship with them and in general I'm a little suspicious of medical professiols.  I think they withhold some information from patients.  Plus I've had them tell me the wrong things before, things I knew were not true because I had found research conflicting it, so I sometimes just don't trust them.
0.720000	I don't know, I haven't been to a regular doctor for four years. I went to the gynecologist like two years ago, and that went pretty well. I've known that doctor since I was a little kid (~3-4 years old), so I do tend to trust her. I think that most doctors are probably pretty trustworthy, because they really have to work hard to become doctors in the first place, so they probably wouldn't be bad people after all of that hard work.
0.640000	My doctor most of the time so thins in my favor she make sure I do ever text she ask me to do and do follow up on my med
0.800000	Because they are well trained and experienced in their field, and they know more about my health than I don.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician and I do have a primary care physician who has always been trustworthy. They are known to have a good reputation within the community.
0.720000	I truly trust my doctor. She seems concerned is always pleasant, answers my questions and gives me lots of options.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because they are a professional and it is their job. In my experiences, they seem to know what they are doing, provide good advice, and respond to any questions and concerns I have. The person looks and acts professionally and I have no reason to distrust them or doubt their competence. They are more knowledgeable than me so I trust their advice and directions on health matters.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she has an excellent track record. She has consistently provided excellent care and treatment for myself and my family. She has proven her abilities over the long-term.
0.720000	I'm still alive!  He must be doing something right.
1.000000	I trust him because he points me in the right direction when it comes to medication and to find a specialist. He would tell me the good and the bad when it comes to the medication and the specialist.
0.720000	I've been with my doctor for 10 years and I trust her and I'm very healthy person so I tend to only see her once a year 
0.760000	I trust my care physician because they go above and beyond what I expect or what I am even interested in.  My physician is completely thorough during my physical and I feel like they want to give the best care possible.
0.600000	To be honest try to everyone a chance to know them better and its their job help feel better if know feeling well and try you in way they can.
0.800000	BEEN WITH HER FOR A VERY LONG.  SHE WALKED THROUGH BREAST CANCER WITH ME AND WORKED WITH ME TO DISCOVER  THE CAUSE OF OTHER HEALTH ISSUES I WAS HAVING.  SHE LISTENS AND DOES WHAT IT TAKES TO GET HER PATIENTS WELL.
0.840000	I have had skin cancer and my PCP referred me to a specialist which resulted in the removal of a skin cancer.  He always asks if there is anything different in my physical condition that might cause problems, and is never in a big hurry to end my appointments.
0.800000	I have been going to my doctor since I was little and he knows me and my family well. I trust in what he says and does to treat my ailments.
0.760000	I feel i can trust my PCP. She is being very honest with me about options and potential results. I feel i already established a personal connection with her
0.600000	we can not afford to use a doctor under todays healthcare costs. we pay 600 a month for 2 people our deductible is 8 to 12 thousand before any on will agree to even see us. 
0.440000	Doctors are human just like I am.  Some are good, some are bad.  It is up to me to question what I'm told and help find solutions.  If they won't work with me I'll find someone else.
0.880000	I like my doctor very much. He has always been good at listening to me and not rushing through an appointment. He clearly and thoroughly explains the problems and solutions that he diagnoses and makes sure that I completely understand and am comfortable with his actions..
0.800000	I completely trust my primary care physician. Any questions that I have had in the past have been answered. I am able to schedule appointments or talk with them when needed. Any concerns I have had about my health have been addressed quickly. 
0.960000	I trust that my doctor will provide the best care and be at the best interest of the patient. I also will research and make sure I completely agree with treatment options. 
0.960000	She maybe be running behind but she never acts like she  is rushing through my appointments.Take the time to answer questions and explain the best treatment for me.  
0.680000	I generally trust my primary care physician but I also like to back up her information with what I can learn from trusted medical websites. I have only been with this primary for a year so I think we are still learning to trust each other. It can take some time to become really comfortable with each other.
0.880000	I trust in doctors because they generally have my best interests in mind and consider all the options available.
0.680000	I think he has my best interests at heart, although he appears to be overworked with the number of patients he sees (Veterans Admin).
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician, but not too much. I always try to get answers from multiple sources, so I never fully go with what one individual says.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because he knows how to care for his patients. He also knows how to work with you to understand his patient's needs.
0.800000	I have seen the same physician for 25 years and he has a limited number of patients as he is in semi-retirement. He takes his time and asks questions and explains things in terms the average person can understand.
0.800000	I have had no negative or bad experiences with the care I have received from my primary physician.  I do not seek medical attention very often. I sometimes research on the internet conditions and  symptoms about diagnoses 
0.800000	Typically when I see a doctor, they are a medical resident. I actually feel more confident in this situation because I know that if there is any doubt, they will seek more information through their attending. I would say I usually trust the doctors I see, but I do like to keep myself informed by other means as well, just in case.
0.520000	I don't necessarily distrust my physician, but the medical field in general. I don't discredit their knowledge, but don't trust their motives. It's all about money to most medical practices.
0.680000	I found my doctor because he is agreeable to treating the thyroid with natural thyroid supplements, as opposed to most doctors (who will prescribe only synthetics, which actually harm the thyroid over time.)  My doctor recognizes my copious research into my condition, and works with me, with my suggestions, with the hope to improve my condition.
0.960000	As I do not have a primary care physician that I am aware of, I'll have to answer in regards to doctors in general. I have complete trust in doctors, because they simply know more than I do. I won't challenge or question their information as this is their profession and not mine. 
0.600000	Northface Raincoat and I appreciate every th8 mg tablets 5th 5th the actual number is not opening the door or answering my 6th and get blocked in the actual world of outlaws and get blocked in the actual world of outlaws 
0.480000	I don't like it when I go to the doctor and they can't find out what is wrong with me so they just contribute it to something else without getting down to what is causing my problems. I always thought that the doctors were there to look into things and find a cause and help to make it better, but now it seems they are only here to collect big paychecks whether they help a person or not.
0.520000	Too many doctors who practice western style medicine are not willing to accept the benefits traditional Chinese medicine, like acupuncture and herbs. 
0.280000	My primary health care told me not to read the inserts that come in your medicine telling you about side effects, they were for lawyers only
0.320000	If I'm asked about symptoms, I can barely finish a sentence before he just blurts out some answer. After that he's very dismissive of questions. I might get a printout with s cursory explation of what's going on.
0.360000	My doctor has never or has rarely asked me nor my family about exercise or diet. I know for a fact that these two things are among the greatest things you can do to prevent, reverse, or cure disease. Our doctor only puts my family on drugs and wants them to have expensive surgery.
0.440000	Primary care physician might not have enough knowledge to make an informed decision. The doctor might not be up to date with the latest treatments.
0.560000	i do trust my primary care doctor as he has been my personal physician for over year now. He always thinks good about us and give us good medication . 
0.680000	For the most part I have trust in my doctor's decisions, but I don't have complete trust  in anybody except the Lord. I value the doctor's advice, but I would not follow him blindly and if I feel he is not right on something I would not hesitate to get a second opinion or other counsel. I weigh my own thoughts with what he tells me. 
0.800000	My physician has helped me every time I had a problem. She has given me the right treatments and made me feel better. I have no reason not to trust her at this point.
0.480000	I think doctors are always pushing big pharma agendas of the latest most expensive drugs in return for kickbacks.
0.920000	i trust my primary physician because she listens to what I have to say and we decide the treatment that fits me best.  She does not make me feel that she is rushed.
0.760000	I trust her because she listens to me and genuinely wants to know how i a doing. She suggests things for me to try that fit with my lifestyle instead of pushing pills on me. I appreciate that she isn't rushing to go out the door and listens to what I have to say. She is thorough and has a lot of knowledge in the things i need answers about. Plus one of my illnesses she also has so I get that extra insight.
0.680000	"Along with the strong development trend of the market economy, many social values have been changed: social relations, morals and morality are also reversed. For the medical industry, besides a number of achievements are very proud, a small part of the doctor insensitive to the pain of the patient, against the moral, contrary to conscience, doctrine, do ""stained ""The image of the noble profession of medicine has traditioned for many generations. So what is morality? What is yoga? What is the content of ethics? What are the causes of medical ethics? How to improve ethical issues in the health sector? These are urgent issues of the society today."
0.880000	He is someone who is honest. When I have a question, I dont hesitate to ask and he is clear with his answers. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I have seen the same one for twenty years. He has always been very thorough for regarding any issue that I have. During my pregnancies he was never too pushy about what he thought was best, and let me make the decisions. He is always a good listener when it comes to my concerns, and never rushes me out of his office. 
0.800000	I trust that my doctor is giving me all the information to the best of her ability, and wants to help me make the best decisions possible. However, she is human, and busy, and human health is complicated and constantly evolving. I do not expect her to know everything. 
0.840000	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because I have been seeing him for a few years of my life. It's been enough time for me to gain my trust.
0.960000	Have had same dr for 8 years and has always looked out for my best interest and has made sure the I get the medications that I need
0.800000	I made sure to get friends opinions and also to do online research when choosing my doctor. She has an amazing bedside manner and makes me feel at ease. She does not over react and also does not under react.  I think there are some doctors that can come across as condescending and she is not like that at all.  It takes a special doctor to be able to answer your questions without making you feel like stupid!
0.720000	well sometime they have best heart for me and sometime I  feel like they don't when I feel he or she is giving the wrong information
0.720000	I  have  never had a  bad  experience  with  my   doctor   I  trust  him   completelyif  you  don't  trust  your  doctor  you  shout  not  go to  him
0.520000	I believe that my doctor is competent, but I sometimes feel like he doesn't take me seriously. I have never been harmed by a doctor, but I feel as though a doctor's convenience is more important to them than my preferences. Overall, I would like to be treated with more respect and dignity.
0.800000	I have been with my PCP for several years and I have grown to have more and more trust for him. Since Doctors are people too they can make mistakes or have errors in judgement. The one that graduates at the bottom of their class still gets the same credentials as one who graduates at the top.
0.840000	I trust my physician because he is honest and upfront with information regarding my health. I can count on my doctor to be honest no matter what
0.520000	I am not sure if I completely trust my primary care physician because he seems more concerned about liability or convenience at times rather than in the welfare of the patient. He is not as open to answering questions about medical care. He also is not as uptodate on treatments and may recommend something that he is familiar with but may not be as effective as more new or modern treatments.
0.720000	My primary case physician spends a lot of time with me and any issues I have are probably due to my inability to communicate my issues to him effectively.
1.000000	She listens to what I have to say and asks questions rather than jump to conclusions.  She also checks up with me yo see if the treatment we decided on us working or not, or hiw a consult with another doctor went.  She has never been dismissive of any issue I've gone to her with.  I feel that she honestly cares for my health.  
0.400000	My PCP is too nonchalant about my medical conditions and has ignored my high blood pressure in multiple appointments. He is also fat and diabetic, so...
0.800000	I have never had any issues with any of the doctors I have seen.  They have all seemed to empathize with my issues and appeared to care about my well being.
0.200000	Physicians, doctors, pharmaceutical industries and pharmacists are not trustworthy. They work together in their individualistic pursyits. The patient is not primary goal, their money being pocketed is. 
0.640000	They are more concerned with co-pay and treating a problem versus curing the problem. My insurance only covers a small portion of the bills and it is difficult to get solutions.
0.640000	They know what they are doing there should be no reason for them to try to mislead or misdiagnose me
0.680000	I don't completely distrust the doctor's word. I just believe that things can change for the better quite often through prayer and fasting; believing in God
0.640000	I distrust doctors because they work for big companies and the companies are in it to make money therefore the doctors have to find a way to make that money.
0.680000	I have seen my primary care doctor for almost thirty years and have complete faith in him for my medical health. He know me extremely well and is well regarded in the community for his thorough manner.
0.600000	I am not sure he takes the time to understand everything is happening to me. Sometimes I think his time is much more valuable than my health.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has been our family doctor for years, and considering my other family members are still alive he must be doing something right.
0.720000	No matter how disinterested my doctors have seemed sometimes, I still have faith in their expertise to provide me with the right evaluations. Even though you get treated like a piece of furniture in healthcare clinics, the doctors are still good.
0.800000	I trust him because he seems to know what he's doing. So far he's been right.So I trust him.
0.480000	I have change doctors in the last 6 months and am just starting to get to know them and what what type of caring person and how they work with me and the staff they have in the office. I do know they the few time I have been in the office I was not to draw in to this doctor, but mt dealing with the staff has been great they call back within a good time frame and have been very helpful with what I may need at that time
0.520000	I always feel that I am rushed when I go to the dr. The usually ask a couple of questions and make there decisions that way instead of examining or running test.
0.960000	They have many years of experience and tell me their thoughts and diagnoses without trying to put anything delicately or hiding any concerns.
0.840000	I trust my Primary care physician, because Iam still alive. My always shows patience and kindness while staying professional
0.600000	Sometimes doctors do not take the time to really look at the whole picture and just prescribe what is common for a condition
1.000000	Speaking to my doctor is like speaking to a family member. He's very open and honest, but has a very warm bedside manner. He makes me feel very relaxed, and I know he always has the best suggestions for my health and well-being.
0.560000	I've had persistent neck pain for the last decade and was prescribed all sorts of treatment ranging from medication to injections. After basically giving up I found a simple over-the-counter medication that worked and had never been recommended.
0.680000	I know my doctor is not out to harm me.  I also understand there are other exterl forces at play (insurance requirements, patient requirements, regulatory requirements, etc.) that can affect treatment.  I believe it is in both my interest and my doctor's interest to be honest with each other and have that level of trust.
0.760000	My physician takes time to talk, answer questions and make suggestions. He makes sure that I understand what is best for me and does not make me feel rushed and that he does not have time to discuss or hear my concerns.
0.560000	I sometimes get the impression from my doctor that they do want to do anything too risky, and often times medical conditions go untreated. For example, when getting colds, the doctor might just suggest that I wash my hands more frequently. That may be effective, but I could find that out by searching the internet, or even by thinking. I dislike paying medical bills for these types of consultations.
0.920000	The current experiences that I have had with my current doctor has influenced me to trust him with the handling of my case.
0.960000	I have seen my same doctor for a long time. He always has my best interest in mind. I have always been able to rely on his judgement. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he usually thoroughly explains everything to me, and is able to answer any questions that I may have. He also explains pros and cons for treatments and helps me to choose what is best for me.
1.000000	My doctor always concerned about me I can tell he usvi am very trusting of my doctor I know he cares about me by  his actions I know he is concerned about me 
0.480000	Due to issues with my health insurance and past experiences by parents have had. My mother has a rare from of kidney disease, and it took 12 years, 8 doctors, 20 procedures, and 5 surgeries to finally correct the problem and my health insurance didn't want to do their job and pay the doctors due to how many doctors my mom had to visit and had to get help from.
0.800000	My doctor has given me no reason not to trust them. They have provided me with the means to help whatever medical issues I have and have even gave me their contact info if it is after hours and I have an immediate need.
0.960000	She's never disappointed me. Every time I go to her, she's right about what's wrong. And the long term treatments help also. 
0.360000	Because if they are so rushed to see you and need to make appointments that they can't even keep most of the time, then something is wrong with their time management. I feel like I've told the doctor things before and they just brush it off like it's no big deal or that it's normal when I know that it's not. They just don't want to have to sit there any longer. 
1.000000	I have known her all my life she is my best friend that happens to be my doctor
0.720000	My Dr is very thorough.  She is willing to answer my questions regardless of the time it takes.  She is willing to schedule tests to eliminate possible illness that have not been diagnosed.
0.640000	I think doctors for the most part are very knowledgeable and truly care about their patients, but I think that the way our healthcare is run, doctors don't have enough time to fully develop the best plan of action.
0.600000	as we know little about the health concerns we have no other choice than believing doctor as we can't take risk with our life
1.000000	I trust my doctor because they have my best interests at heart because they know what is best for me.  The doctor tells me what I need to do because they care about me and my needs.  My doctor is very caring and they treat me correctly and very professionally.
0.640000	I trust my doctor because he is willing to answer my questions even as far fetched as they might be, he takes the time to listen to what I have to say
0.720000	Because my doctor asks what medications I need. He knows I do my research. My doctor knows that I am a therapist.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because so far she has not given me any reason not to trust her. She has really good online reviews and so far my experiences with her have been pleasant.
0.680000	He listens to me and if there are issues that he has concerns about that require a specialist he never hesitates to send me to one. However, as I believe with most primary care docs he is somewhat rushed.
1.000000	caring and thorough and has really helped my husband and all his medical issues always quick to respond
0.600000	I don't particularly care for my doctor and have been looking for a new doctor. She doesn't seem to take any issues seriously and in the past this attitude has caused me to nearly miss a serious condition.  
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been honest and helped me and my family in any way he could and if he couldn't he would always send us to a doctor who could
0.680000	I have not seen my PCP very often as I switched about 1 1/2 years ago and mainly have the need to see specialists.  When I have seen my PCP I feel he cared and did what he felt best and was honest with me.
1.000000	My PCP has done nothing but good in my eyes. He always does whats best for me. I switched doctors and my current doctor reduced the dosage of metformin form 2500 a day to 2000 a day during my first visit because it was an unsafe dose. My previous doctor did not know that.
0.720000	I have been with the same doctor for 3 years and she actually listen to what I have to say and offers her best remedy and prescriptions to fix what is wrong or needs repaired.
0.960000	My provider is thorough, is patient, has a good way of explaining things. She has a solid education and training and has not been wrong in diagnosing my health problems. 
0.800000	my  primary care physician always show interest in my concerns and totally honest in telling me about all of the different treatment options available for my condition. All in all, i completely trust my doctor's decisions on which medical treatments are best for me.
0.920000	My primary care physician has been honest and helpful in my decisions regarding my health.  Even though my last blood work showed I was nearing a diabetic level, I was very concerned that she wanted to put me on Metformin.  I chose not to add this medicine into my body and wanted to change my diet instead.  She approved my decision and suggested that we re-do the blood work in 3 months.  I am getting ready to make my 3 month appointment for Monday.
0.800000	I trust my PCP because she always tells me the truth, even if it is not what i want to hear. She has never lead me wrong. She takes the time to listen and do a full assessment. 
0.600000	I feel like a doctor's office is a business like any other.  They are looking to help people but with a way that will also maximize their profits.
0.640000	I don't distrust my doctor, but he's human and no one knows everything. When it comes to my health, if its a serious issue not just a cold, I always want to get another opinion. 
0.560000	Don't have a primary care doctor now but when I did I was never sure if he knew what he was doing. He once ruined a trip for me with a bad diagnosis.
1.000000	I have been with my current primary care physician for over a decade now. We have developed an excellent rapport. I have no doubt that when I come to him with an issue, that he will be thorough and thoughtful.
1.000000	I trust my doctor becauseâ I know without any doubt in my mind he knows what he is doing and I trust him to be my doctor because I know he cares for me.
0.560000	"I believe that doctors in general are not always up front with patients concerning medical conditions. Too often doctors try to "" sugar coat"" the facts, when in reality, most would rather NOT be given false information and false hope"
0.800000	I think they want to help people .That's what they went to school and training for. So, I trust that they know what they're doing and can make the best decisions.
0.600000	I trust doctors as they know what physical conditions I may have and have often been truthful to me.
0.600000	cant really say without having a doctorso how can i answer that it would be like playing a guessing game but guess in life it goes both ways
0.800000	She spends an ample amount of time with me during my visits and makes sure to answer all of my questions. She also goes over every part of my visit and blood work in detail. She also follows up with any questions over the phone. 
1.000000	I trust them to the fullest extent they are very well trained have went to college and always looking out for the best with their patients I would never have a reason to not trust my doctor they are recommended by other people I know and deal with alot people 
0.640000	I trust my doctor because they went to school and they are the experts. They know biologically what's going on more than I do and can give a name and diagnosis to my guy feeling 
0.800000	My doctor is knowledgeable and seems to know what he's talking about. He has practiced for many years and comes highly recommended.
0.600000	Seeing so many people, it is hard to have a relationship with a doctor that would be anything more than a routine visit.
0.800000	My doctor allows me to ask questions and help decide the right path for my physical and mental well being
0.600000	I do not have any medical problems. I do not visit hospitals or doctors. I do not have a primary physician.
0.960000	My doctor has never lead me wrong. My doctor has always given great advice.
0.800000	I don't see any reason not to trust him. He's a medical professional who's been to school and been in practice for many years. It's his job to know what he's talking about.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing the same doctor for various things over several years. I have never received bad advice. I feel like he listens to my statements and questions. I feel like he makes informed and educated decisions about my health.
0.480000	I don't trust the medical system at all and never will. It would be extremely foolish to trust them.
0.560000	Because of Accidents in y Life, I have had to deal with a lot of different kinds of Dr's and I have seen how Good and How Bad they can Really be
0.400000	My primary care physician is a very nice, warm, friendly woman, and I liked her immediately upon meeting her. However, during our last appointment, she prescribed a medication that has awful side effects, some side effects that I had expressed concern about with her during that same appointment, so I was disappointed to read about those side effects after picking the medication up from the pharmacy and that made me second guess my immediate trust in this physician. 
0.640000	I tend to be trusting of my primary care physician because he seems very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. It seems like he is genuinely interested in trying to help people. Not just get them in an out.
0.640000	My doctor is very candid. She always lets me know the possible effects and she has no problem telling me what she thinks. However, she just rushes too much and seems like she has better things to be doing.
1.000000	My doctor has been in business for over 40 so years. And he is due for retirement soon. He is extremely empathetic to my concerns and very friendly when I first met  him. I think his attitude and experience have given me a great gift.
0.760000	While I do think that the current health care system puts too much importance on volume of patients seen per day, overall, doctors want to contribute to healing their patients and making sure they are as healthy as possible.
0.320000	I have seen doctors talk about how canbis is dangerous and can make you hallucite, and then proceed to put my mother on opiates as if they were a safer altertive for pain (with full knowledge of the fact that she was also on SSRIs and benzos). Once she was addicted to opiates, they treated her like an addict. When she quit her pills she lost her mind. She is now in rehab for alcohol and illicit drugs. She never drank or did any drugs before her doctors put her on pills. Meth and heroin are schedule 2 drugs, while canbis/ mdma/ psilocybin/ and lsd are classified as schedule 1 (no medical benefit). I guess I distrust the system more than the doctors, but they mostly have to buy in to the system to make it through med school.
0.960000	It is very reliable since my whole family goes with it. Makes his job perfect, is an honest, responsible, caring and professional person. So I fully rely on your capabilities.
0.960000	She has been my primary care physician for a good many years and she has shared with me a great deal of her own personal information insofar as it is relatable to things that I have shared with her
0.840000	I believe there is a monetary factor connection to some of the health care decisions on the part of the provider.
0.600000	I feel like I am being rushed through appointments and that she is only half listening to what is going on with me.
0.240000	I was in extreme pain for a very long time when I finally decided to go to the doctor. I told my doctor where my pain was and how extreme it was. At first she treated me for something way off. Of course I was still very sick and hurting. I went back and told her what she treated me for was not right at all. So she sends me home with a bunch of muscle relaxers which made me sick. After 2 months of trying to follow her patient plan I went back. I begged her to refer me to a specialist and it turned turns out I was right and she was wrong.This is why I do not trust doctors. There are several times when they are wrong.
0.720000	I trust her for the most part. Any distrust I have stems from the fact that shes human and can make mistakes just like the rest of us. 
0.760000	I trust my position because they treat me as if I were their family members. They actually care what I need and what is best for me they ask a lot of questions so that they can figure out the best solutions for me and the best treatment. And often sometimes emotionally there for me during bad times. Great doctor I couldn't ask for anyone better
0.520000	Sometimes they are very dismissive of me and my concerns but will only care when it is convenient for them
1.000000	I trust my primary physician because I know that they are professional and here to help in the best way they could
0.800000	I trust my doctor or physician because they know there jilob that's what they study for and that's what there a profession in so they most likey know what there doing 
0.840000	she's caring and thoughtful. she always has my best interest in mind. she truly cares about my health.
0.800000	I trust my doctor and the medication that she give me because she know what going to help me and would wont help me
0.640000	When the physician is new I trust them because there brain is fresh from studying and learning new stuff , but sometimes I feel like they might be a little bit nervous and they might make a mistake , for explain giving me the wrong drugs.
0.720000	I trust my PCP because she tells it like it is. I have met doctors before who cautiously agree with whatever the patient says, because maybe they don't want to alienate or be subject to poor reviews. But my internist is very candid.
0.480000	She has disregarded my concerns about genetic problems in my family that I show symptoms of having.  She believes that I'm lying when I talk about back or knee pains.
0.800000	I didn't have a primary doctor for quite a while because I didn't think I really needed one.  I had to get a referral to see a neurologist, so I saw one recently for that.  She was so nice and made me feel very comfortable.  She compared some digestive issues that I'm having to problems that her daughter is having and gave me good advice on solving the problem. She seemed very down to earth and trustworthy.
0.600000	I trust doctors in general, but they are human and can make mistakes. And then there are some who are not very good at what they do. My trust is conditiol.
0.840000	I trust my doctor but have also disagreed with them over things that I knew were the current recommendations. So we had a discussion and he looked up the new information I gave him and thanked me for making him aware of it. Doctors are incredibly smart but things are constantly changing so I feel it is important to listen to them but, also advocate for yourself.
0.480000	I believe for the most part my doctor sees hundreds of patients and is on a time restraint.  I feel that the rush to get people in and out makes looking for the most convenient option the first response. That the doctor does not know me or the other patients well enough to have a relationship beyond our charts that he barely looks over as he is coming in the room and that the nurse has actually more details and stake in personal care.
0.600000	Sometimes I feel that my primary care physician is stretched too thin and sees too many patients. I realize he cannot remember everything, but he does have my electronic medical record readily available to him. I feel that often I have to repeat issues I have, and I don't think he is just testing my understanding. I think he has forgotten and not bothered to remind himself by reviewing my record. I also have to call the office because I will sometimes get test results before they call me about them. I don't think that my physician would intentionally harm me or lie to me, I just think that he is seeing too many patients - putting quantity over quality to make a profit.
0.800000	My doctor makes sure to let me know what is going on if there is anything going on and makes sure I understand everything they do as they do it. My doctor makes sure that my thought are heard when I have a questions or comment and makes sure that they understand ever question I have. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always asked me for my opinion and how I feel about doing something. He always give me options. He tells me what I need and when or if I don't need something. 
0.800000	I have gone to my primary care physician for a long time and he has always helped me get 'better'.  I have never been prescribed a medicine that has harmed me in any way, nor have I been prescribed a course of treatment that hindered my recovery.  
0.800000	While I do trust my doctor sometimes I worry that she focuses on one aspect of my health while I'm trying to get help for something new that just came up. 
0.760000	My primary doctor is my OBGYN and she is amazing. She listens to my concerns and takes them seriously. Whereas other doctors would gloss over my anxieties/fears, she will go the extra mile to make sure I am well taken care of, even if that means transferring my care to someone else.
0.600000	I like my primary care physician, but I have a certain amount of distrust in doctor's generally and don't trust medications at all. I always prefer to try a drug free option first, and doctor's often aren't on board with that point of view. 
0.840000	I trust my doctor totally    He does what is in the best interest for me and my family   He is very knowledge and dedicated to me
0.520000	My current primary care physician is only concerned about getting my appointments over with. I don't have time to talk about issues with her and doesn't inform me about my health. I'm searching for a new physician because I do not have trust in my current one.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because he has helped me whenever I went there with a problem. He has always figured out what the issue was and alleviated the symptom. He is also good at making things easy to understand so I would not be confused.
0.440000	I have experienced negative doctor outcomes with members of my family, including my husband, Mother and Father. I therefore question everyhing when it comes to dealing with doctors. 
0.520000	It is not that I have no Trish is doctors just I am squrimess around needles. I just am not a fan of going.
0.640000	I mostly trust my doctor. I think though that physicians generally think people are not smart enough to really understand medical information so they over simplify information or leave out certain information. My doctor is somewhat like this.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he has always been able to treat and cure any ailment that I present to him.  I always wonder if he (or any doctor) is sometimes motivated to recommend treatments that are fincially beneficial to him, however.  I don't believe my doctor has done that with me, but it is always in the back of my mind.
0.600000	 I feel I can trust them based on the general information , and listen to solutions where I know they are not just trying to take my money. Many times the use of fancy language and misdiagnosis lead me , and many other patience astray which is why I am neutral in that I trust most of their practice , but know they can have bad intentions and give wrong information.
0.400000	Doctors in general prescribe generalized medications with no intention of correcting an issue but merely masking the effects
0.760000	He has never given me any bad advice. He has helped me through several situations. I do trust him and do as he recommends.
0.640000	It isn't that I distrust him, but I rarely go to the doctor so I don't have many interactions to reference. 
0.520000	I think has health care been decentralized and doctor are volunteer at places where health care are provided to those who needs it instead of running a business where hospital choose drugs based on relationship with companies and profit margin, and health care industries has become so large in the United States and it seems to be an ever self revolving perpetual growth by keeping the patient close to insurance and trip to hospitals, in other words, when health care is run as a business with insurance and pharmaceutical drug companies making profit, it is hard to discern whether physician's ethics or the paycheck determine the doctor's action.  And given the high health care cost of United States relative to other country when our health and quality of life is not correspondingly as high in ranking relative to spending, I think doctors, hospitals, are interdependent with insurance and pharmaceutical industries in term of making money.  it is kind of like asking someone whether they want to do something that would pay them double or do something that would reduce cost for patients while cutting their paycheck in half, what is the percentage of people do you think would choose the second option, considering doctors are also human
0.840000	Iâve been seeing Dr Lewis for 11 years. Heâs very direct and to the point but also understanding and has compassion for what he does. 
0.800000	Because he always seen to know how to treat any illness, or problem that I have, and since I have been seeing my doctor he have never been wrong about any of my health problems that I have had.
0.520000	sometimes people have other things on their mind.  they see a lot of patients and might not be feeling good that day. they might not be as informed on new things out in the medical field. they may have been last in their class. there are many things that  can cause mistakes to be made. they are only human also
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because I truly believe she has my best interests at heart. We spent a long time my last visit just taking through all my options and making sure I truly understood what was going on. 
0.640000	Their willingness to explain my medical diagnosis thoroughly, but in understanding terms makes me trust my pcp. 
1.000000	I trust her because she answers all of my questions whether they're dumb or not. She goes through each problem I'm having thoroughly and breaks it down for me so I understand what she's saying. 
0.920000	He seems to know his stuff and has never disappointed me in the past. His attitude shows that he cares and really takes care of me.
0.520000	I think many doctors are merely motivated by the prospect of making money rather than helping others. 
0.640000	I have had the same doctor for almost 30 years.  He has always been there when I have needed him for myself or my kids.
0.840000	I am a very health individual, so I do not go to the doctor's very often; but when I do her recommendations seem appropriate and well-thought out.
0.520000	I have had good and bad doctors before. The good ones really seem to care and take the time to listen. They are able to help me thoroughly. Very few doctors have been bad. They seem to not listen and want to prescribe something that I don't agree with.
0.840000	I trust my doctor a lot. She spends a lot of time with me at my appointments and is never rushed. She listens and offers good advice when I bring up issues such as my living situation which might be affecting my health, like living with second hand smoke.
0.760000	My primary care physician has changed often lately, so this is more about physicians in general.  For the most part, I trust their decisions:  they are trained professionals with a lot of experience in their jobs, and many are also active research scientists.  However, they do have some pressure put on them by drug sales representatives to recommend one product over another, and I think that there is a possibility of their judgment being distorted by drug and other medical product marketing techniques.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he really cares about my concerns and needs. Also, is really honest about whatever questions I have.
0.600000	I've only seen her a couple times but she seems really nice but I'm not sure how thorough she is. They are busy so who know how much they actually think about each patient
0.600000	I really have no reason not to trust my physican or my doctor in general. They are all comptent medical professionals
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for 28 years he has never steered mee wrong  I haav aalwa trusted him to do what is right for me and he has never let me down.  Always  on my side not his.
0.560000	In some ways I feel they push drugs on you because they get a cut of it.  Some doctors just rush though with you and move onto the next patient for money.  
0.680000	They seem to care about the patient's well being rather than their financial benefit. Often times, some are willing to discuss concerns outside business hours.
0.720000	I trust physicians, however sometimes I believe they are too busy to fully disclose all options for medial treatments and typically provide the fastest answers as possible. Sometimes I feel like physicians could be a little more thourough, but there's only so much they can do with the time they're allotted, especially with large work loads/multiple patients.
0.760000	Well in general, doctors sometimes listen to you and sometimes have their own agenda. I had a doctor once that knew I was allergic to codeine, so kept giving me 'alternatives' that I was also allergic to, even if I told him, yes, it says if you are allergic to codeine to not take this other one. 
1.000000	been seeing my dr since 2015 after my own regular dr of 10 yrs messed up my ekg and heart condition.. my new dr found out i had high cholesterol and my old dr prescribed me pills for high blood presssure when i didnt have high bp . now i trust my new dr she never steered me wrong 
0.760000	Because with them I feel very safe
1.000000	My primary care physician has been my doctor since I was born. He always was my mom, and cousin's doctor.
0.560000	I really dont care to be honest they just doing their job and making money for their families and hopefully friends who they probably make happy 
0.800000	My doctor is very caring and open about my health. If I have questions I can expect truthful answers and not judgement.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she listens carefully to me, asks appropriate questions and does not dismiss my concerns.  She takes the time to get all pertinent information and thinks about my particular case before diagnosing or prescribing anything.
0.800000	For the most part I have never had a bad experience with my doctor. She always seems helpful and honest about what's going on with me.
0.480000	All doctors follow rules and procedures that are generalized for everyone and not for me. They may or may not take me 100% at my word when I describe symptoms and feelings and will not provide all options if they don't approve of one. I've only been able to get full information when I pressed and asked, although I have encountered some doctors that did let me make the fil decision without judgement. I feel I know my body best, and often they don't take that same attitude.
0.600000	I don't see my primary car physician that often, but when I do she always seems kind of rushed and mechanical. For that reason I don't completely trust that she's explored all of the options, or given me the knowledge I need to know what my options are, but what she does do for me I trust is effective and not harming me. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have had him for along time.There is nothing that don't trust from my doctor.
0.600000	I feel like my doctors are trustworthy for the most part but sometimes I wonder if they get paid by people like drug companies to give out certain kinds of medicine for people who have problems and maybe that makes them find problems that aren't there sometimes. 
0.960000	My husband and I share the same Doctor and there was a time my husband had an appointment and I did not and I went with him. I had a cold at the time and even though it was not my appointment and I didn't bring it upâ the Doctor noticed and asked me questions. Right then and there he wrote a prescription for me even though I didn't have an appointment for myself. He has always gone above and beyond in the care of my husband as well (who has Type II diabetes) and has always been there for us when we had questions and needs. I would recommend him to anyone.
0.800000	I have to look into what doctors say because even though they mesn well they can be qrong sometimes too
0.640000	I wouldn't say I trust or distrust doctors in general. I just believe that they can be wrong or inaccurate at times.
0.960000	He is super good the best  I had he give all kind of tests  ask a million questions  my other Drs.  just gave gave out prescriptions.
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician. She seems to know her stuff and has a good bedside manner. She is always there to answer any questions or concerns that I may have.  
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I know she has done this for many years. She's a professional and cares about each patient. 
0.800000	i trust my doctor because she has always listened and been very helpful when i needed to discuss something. i needed to get my first mammogram last year and had been putting it off. when i saw my doctor she really encouraged me to go and get it done. she wasn't mean or stern. she was very concerned for my well being and wanted me to get the mammogram done to benefit my health. 
0.600000	doctors don't take time to know their patients i don't believe that have enough information about me to give me best advice or medicine
0.800000	My doctor listens to my concerns and explains things thoroughly. If I have a concern, my doctor makes other options available and reassures me.
0.480000	I would like to say I trust doctors but I seldom see one.  I do have medical appointments but I seldom see a full-fledged doctor.  I dislike having my rare times in medical offices be with a nurse practitioner, etc.
0.520000	Sometimes doctors don't have the patients best interest in mind.
0.440000	He has his head in his laptop more than he looks at me, he doesn't talk or explain things anymore, I am changing doctors soon.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because they have excellent training in the medical field, and have a wealth of other doctors and medical resources to go to as a backup
0.720000	"My GP has been great over the years. Rarely has he said ""trust me I'm a doctor"" He has a fantastic group of referral physicians and surgeons and has never steered me wrong with any medical treatment or diagnosis, unless there is little known about it then we both work on it"
0.640000	I feel that because I am not diagnosed with detrimental medical conditions my doctor has less regard over optiol treatments for a condition. I have some regard for their opinions, but am not fine with the cost of some prescriptions written for my treatment.
0.600000	I do think that doctors for the most part have your best well-being in mind, but I'm skeptical that sometimes they may be guided by less savory interests (pharmaceuticals).
0.880000	She is always there for me. She lets me know important information about my health. She answers all my questions with patience.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I believe he has my best interests in mind. I don't feel like I'm being taken advantage of or being talked down to. I think that everything is done with the patient's best interests in mind.
0.600000	I don't have a primary care physician. I trust doctors because they paid thousands and thousands of dollars to go to school and learn things about medicine that I don't know.
1.000000	He is very open to answering my questions and spending time explaining things. 
0.800000	She was recommended to me by a friend i trust. She listens to my concerns and addresses them. She is warm, sympathetic, and seems very intelligent and competent.
0.760000	I trust my doctor implicitly. He is more internal medicine, so I have been able to see the same doctor since I was a child. My parents saw him, I even have a couple friends who were delivered by him. He has been practicing medicine in the community for decades longer than I've been alive, and he's always had excellent bedside manner. Everyone loves him. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he takes his time with me during my appointment time and and answers all my questions
0.800000	My doctor is very personable, friendly, and honest.   She does thorough tests yearly, gives me all the details and takes a much time as needed.
0.560000	I trust my primary care doctor cause she/he been there for me since the age of 7 so my bond with the doctor is more then strong
0.320000	I feel like my visits are just to get me in and out.  The last PCP I had did not ask about my condition on my 2nd visit, and ignored my intense back pain when I told her about it.
0.560000	It is mostly about making money in the grand scheme of things so it makes it hard to trust. I know that some are there to help people, but it doesn't help the corporate mindset of it in the long run. I wish I trusted my doctors more but sometimes you even question the diagnosis of some conditions.
0.800000	I assume that our doctors are trustworthy. They undergo a minimum of seven years of postgraduate schooling, pass rigorous tests and are responsible for our health and the health of our families. But in recent times there are few cases in which doctors are not considering as trustworthy. So I think it is better to check few things before preferring doctor.There are several doctor-rating websites where patients share their reviews and experiences with physicians.
0.760000	I have had bad experiences in the past with doctors and i have learned what to look out for when it comes to bad care.
0.600000	I sometimes don't trust my doctor because of her negative reviews that are public on Google. However she is usually kind to me and tries to suggest what her opinions are rather than making it sound like that's absolutely the problem. She tends to prescribe me something to see if it helps and tells me to come back at a later date if the problem still persists. 
0.640000	I trust my current physician. I just recently had a problem and my new doctor actually did all they could to find the problem. All of my searching and information I had from myself they ordered all those tests and asked all the right stuff that matched up so I trust them now.
0.760000	He seems to be open, honest and checks everything out!!  Takes the time to explain everything and gives me more than one option
0.720000	While I do trust my doctor in general, I think it's always a good idea to do your own research and educate yourself as well before coming to any fil decisions about anything. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because the last time I had a medical question to ask, I recognized his answers weren't just answers that benefitted either himself or someone he had close ties to. He informed me of options he that he personally told me he didn't agree with but made sure to say to me he understood my decision is not his yet he wanted me to understand the full picture. He didn't have to do that but he did and with a situation like that made me trust he had my best interest at heart.
0.680000	I feel like doctors usually try to do what is best but sometimes they are really busy. Also, sometimes they might recommend a certain treatment because they might get a kickback from a drug company.
0.920000	I have known my physician for over thirty seven years as I worked around him at the local hospital where we both worked .He is very informed of each and every health issue I have and if I need a specialist he is very forth coming in recommending one on my behalf
0.880000	I have had the same physician for a number of  years, so he knows me very well, and i trust the things that he tells me in regards to my health and well being
0.720000	I've been with my doctor for 15 years  I travel to my doctor n that's Because they r trust worthy n accurate plus when new things happen they can handle it
0.600000	some doctors are just wrong with the diagnosis and treatment.  Some treatments are very difficult to accomplish by me.  Some doctors just order them and don't give a thought as to how hard it is on the client
0.640000	I trust my doctor but not always 100%. Just because he is my doctor doest always mean he or she knows what's best.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he takes the time to listen to me. I never feel rushed and have to confidence to speak my mind. He also seems to care about how I am doing overall, not just medically. 
0.640000	the truth I do not distrust any doctor if they are in the position they are because something they did well I do not think they have failed
0.800000	My doctor always answers all of my questions and has never steered my wrong. I'm never rushed and am always number one when I'm in the room with her. 
0.760000	He has been my family doctor for many years. He has seen us through many health crisises. He is very  good at referring us when he feels we need specialists.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because he has been a trusted part of my personal care plan for overall twenty years. 
0.960000	My doctor treats me like a friend, breaks everything down so I can understand her. She is extremely friendly.
0.800000	In all of my recent doctor visits, the doctors have suggested minor preventative things I could perform to better my health, that were completely unrelated to the original visit's intention. It wasn't necessary, but they care in general to see less patients.
0.320000	I have had issues with doctors prescribing medication that has harmed me while pregnant.  I have a son who has hearing loss due to a medication provided to me while I was pregnant.  I later found out it was not approved for pregnant women.  I also suffered a miscarriage after taking some medication prescribed for a virus from a doctor.  I can't say that it was caused by the medication or the virus, but looking back, I still don't trust that the medication was safe.
0.880000	I trust my doctor with my health care because they take the time to explain everything and keep me informed at all times of my health care plan. It is easy to get in touch with them and with technology (email, text messages, and skype), it makes life easier to stay in touch.
0.280000	In the past four years I have been given a misdiagnosis three times because doctors failed to ask the appropriate questions or perform a simple bloodtest.  I spent months in excruciating pain while doctors scratched their heads and did nothing but prescribe medications that did not help and in fact made me feel even worse while my fingers were literally dying.  I could get a shower without literally screaming and curling up in a fetal position afterward.  There is no painkiller that can help that level of pain.  I am quite certain that if they had bothered to check my thyroid levels that I would not have endured a level of misery that makes one question what quality of life is worth living.  I have no trust in the competence of doctors because most are apathetic due in large part to the healthcare system itself.
0.440000	I feel like doctors get commission for prescriptions that vendors tell them to sell, like hey sell 10 of these and we'll give you 1k, so all these doctors all they do is prescribe shit 
0.880000	I fully trust my doctor because I know her personally outside of the doctor's office. She also delivered our child and I have seen her in action. I trust her.
0.800000	I really like my PCP. She's super nice and understanding. She explains everything really well and makes sure to focus on me while I'm there. She always asks how I'm doing and about non medical aspects of my life. I feel like she cares.
1.000000	My doctor knows me and understands me.  He cares and is very educated.  He never talks down to me and talks in words that I can understand.
0.560000	I think most doctor's have the best intentions but are rushed or pressured by external forces (billing, administration, etc) to make decisions that aren't always right.
0.400000	Be sugar coats a lot. I can tell him how ied and what I'm going through and he tells me it's all in my head. 
0.920000	I trust my doctor to give me the best medical advice, as she has always been straightforward and sincere with me.   She always seems to take my overall health into account before making recommendations 
0.480000	I hate doctors.  I feel bad saying that but I find them to be judgy and hypocritical.  Doctors seem to think they know more than they actually do and that can be very problematic...
0.800000	I recently changed primary care physicians and I have only had one visit. I am still establishing a relationship with my doctor and building trust with them.
0.800000	I trust him hes a good man. Very funny. Spends a good amount of time with me. And my health benefits.
0.800000	For the most part I trust my primary care doctor. Sometimes I feel like she is guessing and not really making an effort to help my situation. It seems like a lot of trial and error. I trust that she is getting the most current information to pass along to me. She is usually quick to respond to message also.
1.000000	I have known my primary care physician for almost 10 years. He is a very honest person who believes in treating others with compassion. He would not knowingly harm or mislead his patients.
0.680000	My primary care doctor gives me options to different medical situations; if she feels I need to see a particular type of specialist for my condition, then she refers me to one.
0.920000	Sometime they are busy and don't have time to do complete assessment of the patient have a lot to do sometimes they work long hours
0.880000	In the above I was talking about my OBGYN. I have to see him often for complications and cancer screenings. He is always straight forward with me, and has actually saved my life twice. 
0.600000	I feel they are too busy inputing data in the computer to be able to hear my issues.  My meds were inputted wrong and I am having a devil of a time to solve that issue. I tell that what I need and then it does not get done.  And I have to call and hound them for weeks to get my issues resolved. It is horrible that you can not trust the office staff to do what needs to be done.  I am able to voice my opinion but some people do not understand that they need to disagree and have a voice in their treatment plans.
0.800000	I feel doctors, in general, have the patient's care and well-being in mind when they are treating them. I feel that a patient has to have that trust in their doctor or they should probably get a new one.  A patient needs to feel that trust because their doctor is such an important part of staying well, or getting well.
0.760000	My doctor is above the average but still I've had to correct him regarding important details of my medical history as I've had to to varying extents with many doctors.  I do find that he is patient and receptive, however.  I've definitely had worse but my doctor is not ideal for me.  I'm not certain that exists.
0.720000	Because we are supposed to trust our doctors. If there was no trust we wouldn't be with them. Most doctors have a fairly good patient doctor relationship. 
0.760000	I trust my physician because they are more knowledgeable about the field of medicine than I am, so I listen to them.
0.640000	Sometimes there are certain aspects of specialized care that health coverage gets in the way of treating the person as a whole. They are more interested in whether your co-payments is paid up and your monthly premiums are up-to-date.  
0.560000	In general, doctors aren't perfect, they all make mistakes or misinterpret something on occasion.  In regards to treatments, they may have motivations other than your health, like earning more income or arrangement with a pharmaceutical company to promote a certain product.
0.640000	I feel like I trust physicians in general, however, if I was about to make a serious decision regarding my health, I would not hesitate to get a second opinion if I felt uncomfortable. 
0.800000	I've been with my doctor since I was born. I feel like she can tell what is wrong with me as soon as I walk into her office. 
0.680000	I do not have a primary doctor but when i receive treatment i do trust what the doctors and nurses tell me because they have more knowledge about what is wrong with me
0.560000	My doctor is good at his job but one day he scheduled an appointment and he chose someone else to treat me for an injury I had and the person he chose did the worst job possible.
0.600000	My dr. Is ok but I'm not getting anywhere with her I feel like shot all the time and tell her how I feel and it seems like it goes in one ear and out the other without stoping
0.680000	I am not in trust with doctors cause they're always changing doctors everyday is not getting close to any doctor if themes a new one the next time u go.
0.800000	My primary care physician takes the time not only to examine me for whatever I am there for, but also spends time asking questions of how things are going for me in general.  If she cannot answer a question I have she will refer me to the appropriate person.
0.640000	sometimes i feel like they don't want to help you, or they just don't care about the patients. sometimes as well we just don't want to trust someone we don't want to trust so i guess that is why they don't trust. when we do its because we believe that they are credible
0.760000	I trust my doctor for a few reasons. First off, they are a doctor for a reason, they want to help people improve their health. Also, there are plenty of laws and reasons for them to not slack off and do a bad job, so they are well incentivized to be accurate.
0.720000	My doctor is very thorough and is not satisfied until he reaches an answer. I definitely trust him with all my health problems.
0.440000	I do not trust my primary care physician because he acts very rushed. He only wants to deal with one issue per appointment. I am also worried that doctors are encouraged to prescribe pharmaceuticals over other treatment options.
0.600000	I do not have total trust in my doctors because in my lifetime I have been misdiagnosed.  I question my doctors and will let them know if I disagree with them.  
1.000000	My doctor is one of the first who has taken the time to really get to know me and has been the best doctor I've ever had.
0.480000	I feel like doctors are very much about profit for themselves. I don't think that they have my best interest at heart a lot of the time.
0.760000	I believe my doctor as well as the majority of doctors do keep my best interest in mind. To be in such a field shows and proves that they care about people's well being in general. I feel it is more of the patient who do not follow through with doing what is right for them
1.000000	my doctor is very knowledgeable about medical conditions and has the resources to find the treatment and solution for multiple medical conditions.  I do not have this knowledge.
0.760000	I do not distrust my primary care physician. I have no reason not to trust her by any means. I trust her completely. 
0.720000	I trust my doctors because when problems came about, they gave me my options and also gave me time to think about what I wanted to do about the whole situation I like that my doctors were real with me. And had the time that I needed 
0.920000	I trust my doctor I've had her for 5 years she's usually straight forward with me about my health and wellbeing 
0.920000	She is dependable and caring, Her husband performed my surgery and she has maintained my health since then she has been very honest about my progress,even when its not necessarily what I wanted to hear
0.800000	My doctor was really good, he seemed to care a lot for his patients. Sometimes you could tell, because he would go out of his way to do things that seemed above and beyond. He was also older so you knew he was putting forth more effort than someone who was younger.
0.600000	I think a doctor will do the best that they can do for someone or the best that a person will let the doctor do
0.760000	My doctor is caring and understands I like natural remedies and cures, but will make sure I am aware of all of my options in any condition and suggests what she feels is the best route for me. We have developed a relationship of trust and genuine care for each other. She always makes extra time for me during my appointments because she knows I like to talk and I feel that relationship helps foster trust so she doesn't rush me to a remedy to get me out of her office but cares about my well-being.
1.000000	My doctor came with high recommendations. After several visits, he is very thorough, asks questions to get a better understanding, and is open.  He makes sure to ask if I understand, if I have any other questions or concerns.  
0.600000	Sometimes your doctor may not be forthcoming with u especially if u r black u can never trust anyone
0.760000	I have never had to see my primary care doctor for anything serious, so I might feel differently if that were the case. All in all, I think my doctor can be trusted and has given me no reason to think otherwise.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because my questions are always answered. I feel like I. Always taken seriously no matter the situation.  When something is wrong he always goes above and beyond to figure out whatâs the matter. I always feel like I can open up about whatâs wrong and not feel embarrassed. 
1.000000	everytime i go there its important and i get results from them that is very acurate and correct i only go to my physician if i nneed to
0.960000	I've been in and out of doctor's office since I was a teenager to help with my depression/anxiety issues. With the exception of a few, all have been genuine people who have shown a complete and utter dedication to helping me be my best physically and mentally.
0.960000	I haven't had any problems with following instructions from any of them for the last five years,and I've had a few medical procedures done.
0.280000	The physician and doctors in general come across as rushed and that they have no desire or time to truly help.
0.840000	Doctors seeing lower income people don't get reimbursed well. Medi-Cal reimbusement rates are dismal and doctors aren't getting paid to see these patients. This means less doctors come to the area and we don't have a wide enough incentive to bring in high quality doctors or even keep them well paid or keep their buildings looking nice. Their surroundings seem lower tier and they often have too many patients since there aren't enough doctors. The doctors I've seen required travel. If a doctor gets recommended by someone else, I'm more trusting of the doctor. While there are some red flags to some people, I've never had an issue with an doctor at a clinic or a big hospital. They've always been able to guide me to a solution.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I feel comfortable. I can ask questions and have an open dialogue with him about any medical issue, concern, etc
0.400000	I think that the doctors I have used are traditional thinkers and that they refuse to think about alternatives other than traditional treatments. I do not think they take into account other options, especially holistic treatments.
0.640000	I trust doctos sometimes . sometimes I feel like they don't know what they're doing and prescribes just anything
0.920000	I totally trust my physician because he is dependable, intelligent, caring, and just a great man. He is versed in his profession and moreover very easy on the eyes.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician very much and the nurse practitioner, my therapist, and the people that I have seen for my health in general. They are all skilled and very knowledgeable, and seem like they truly care for me. If I have extra questions, which I pretty much always do, they always take extra time out to talk things over with me thoroughly. 
0.680000	I don't currently have any health issues so there would be no reason for me to not to trust my doctor.
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because she has known me since I was baby. She makes sure that I know what is going with my body at all times but she also tells it how it is.
0.640000	My doctor spends more time with me during check-ups than any doctor ever has. She continues to ask questions, give me tips and pieces of information I wouldn't normally expect, and will even bring up questions regarding other possible issues I have to ensure there is nothing being missed. She truly listens to everything I say and never seems like she's rushing to get to the next patient. I feel she really does care about my health.
0.800000	There is a high level of mutual respect and regard between my medical team and me.  We all recognize that honest, complete  commucation is essential for them to provide me with the best care.  If I question a particular treatment, they are completely willing to discuss the pros, cons, and options for the optimal outcome.
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician but doctors are humans and can make mistakes. I haven't personally had a bad experience but people shouldn't put complete faith in medical professionals.
0.560000	Reasons I trust doctors would be because they have more knowledge and experience in the medical field as well as medical problems. Reasons I distrust doctors, would be because sometimes they want to just prescribe medication instead of getting to the root cause of a medical condition.
0.720000	I trust my physician. She asks a lot of questions and always wants to know what works and what doesn't work for me. She offers medication and solutions.
0.840000	i think my doctor is competent. i've been using his service for a long time
0.600000	I don't trust anyone I don't know. Now if they were family and I knew them well then yeah. But anyone I don't know 
0.760000	I trust him because he takes time to explain things and doesn't rush me out of his office and comes across as sincere and even ends visit with a prayer for you
0.440000	I think they just come up with explations to get you out faster
0.680000	I mostly trust my doctor to give me the right advice and do what is best for me rather than just what is more convenient for him. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor, but I feel her decisions regarding my care are tied up because my insurance is Medicaid, and a lot of options are not open because they wont pay for it
0.880000	He knows a lot more than I do. With over twenty years of schooling who am I to dispute what is told, I do some reaseaech but for the most part believe in my doctor. I can always get second opinions of not totally sure. 
0.680000	I think my pcp is adequate. She is nothing stellar and does her job. She sometimes need prodding to complete tasks such as refilling scripts. I need to ask her to look into things that are causing me problems and many times, I come away without an answer or a generic diagnosis.
0.800000	They have a good reputation and I have never seen/had anything major to complain about. They have in the past referred me to a specialist whom they thought was better rather pretend to have superior expertise.
0.600000	I am kind of in the middle on this. I neither trust or distrust. I believe that my doctor might not be able to devote as much time to my health as is necessary to make the best health decisions possible. 
0.840000	I have been with the same doctor through every health issue and this doctor has always listened and understood everything along the way. I could talk to him about anything.
0.840000	Whenever I have had a question about my care, my doctor has always been forthcoming and honest about potential treatment plans and side-effects to prescribed medication.  
0.640000	I feel that they are in a hurry sometimes, and i get the feeling it is about the money, and  they are too quick to perscribe pills instead of trying other treatments first
0.360000	He tells me what I need to hear instead of what I want to hear.he is also very cautious and careful about administering medication that is not needed.
0.800000	I feel like he has been honest and forthcoming with me.  I went in with questions and I expected him to have answers, because when I chose him, we had a similar outlook about the prescription drug epidemic in America.  That being said, I asked about different vitamins and supplements, since I'd heard a lot of them are unnecessary.  Not only did he tell me which ones I need, but the amounts, which was hugely helpful
0.520000	I trust my doctor knows what she's doing and that we can have an open discussion.  But I usually go to my appointments armed with my latest research so I'm prepared for the visit 
1.000000	I have been with him for a long time. He listens to what  I have to say and works hard to make sure that he gives me good care and treatment and gets me feeling better. If there is something he feels he can not help me with he will find someone who can treat me better
0.760000	I ask a lot of questions about my health and usually am given the straight facts by my doctor. If I don't get the best answers I always ask for a second opinion. My doctor has been very upfront and completely honest with me on anything that we discuss.
0.960000	I typically trust my doctor and am not afraid to raise concerns if I do not agree with something she says or does.  She typically puts my concerns first and knows that I like to weigh all of my options when it comes to making any decisions.  I am not afraid to find another doctor if I do not agree with the way any of my medical problems are being handled and any doctor I see I make sure and let them know.
1.000000	he has always been correct with diagnosis, takes all the time I need when I see him, does testing when its needed , calls when any test results come back from the lab
0.840000	My physician takes the time to listen and does not rush me when I visit. They ask many questions and answer any I may have
0.680000	My family doctor is not always aware of the latest medications for my condition.  I must sometimes suggest to her the meds that I am aware of.
0.960000	my doctor is also my employer. she is very kind and listens to my problems. we have a great work ant patient relationship. 
0.840000	its not all bout that not at all.living life an leaenng helpin others an others helpin you don't matter no u wont find
0.800000	I've been a patient of my doctor for some time and we have developed a very good doctor patient relationship. If I do not feel comfortable with something she informs me of then I question it and vice-versa.
0.320000	Doctors in general are pretty untrustworthy I think. I think part of my reasoning for that comes from knowing that they push samples on people for their own profit and that they're really overworked and don't have time to really hear you. I saw a video recently about a bunch of people who saw multiple doctors and every doctor was brushing them aside and saying it was nothing when really it was ovarian cysts and split nerves and doctors just didn't take the time to care. So I think I've always felt this way but that recent video kinda watered the seed that was already planted in my head so to speak. 
0.320000	Doctors are always trying to get you to take medications that don't really cure the condition. Their priorities are to the pharmaceutical company and not to the patient. They are not in the business of trying to get people well, just getting patients to take medicines to mage the illness.
0.400000	Doctors are sometimes just out to make money. They know people generally trust them blindly, and they are just giving an opinion, so they can tell you whatever they want. I don't think all doctors are like this, but some are and it's hard to know which ones are trustworthy. 
0.600000	well fost off I just want to say that in no way shape or form I have a primary care physician and I also have little experience with doctors
0.720000	I feel my doctor completes the bare minimum required of her because I have state insurance so I pat nothing out of pocket for her time, which is as short as she will make it.
0.920000	if I did not trust him I would not continue to go to him.  he always explains things well and in words that I can understand
0.480000	I don't know her well yet, and I've only seen her three times. Also, I prefer natural medicine when possible, which medical doctors tend to stay away from. 
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she's honest and I feel that she care about me and my family. Ive been going to her for several years
0.760000	I trust my primary doctor because I have no choice but to, and most of the time i think doctors are usually here to help us so why would they not want to do what is right for their patients.
0.520000	I don't have a primary care physician. I sometimes go off of family/friends opinions of a doctor that I am seeing. In general I'm not sure that I trust doctors completely. I think that sometimes they aren't as thorough as they could be because they are trying to get you out of the office so that they can move on to the next patient.
0.680000	My doctor is great he listens to me and my needs.  Along with his nurses and communicated very well with my concerns.
0.520000	I think doctors are overworked and even though they might know the best thing to do, they might not have time to really consider what is best for you. They also cannot possibly keep up with all of the things they need to when it comes to research or making sure the best things for the patients arent changing.
0.560000	I think my doctor is very likely to want to prescribe a medication too early without looking deep enough into my condition. I think my doctor could gather more symptoms in order to make a more informed decision. 
0.840000	My doctor has yet to give me a reason to distrust him and until he does I will not discredit him. My doctor, I believe, cares about me and me helath
0.840000	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years now and we get along very well; both of us almost look forward to seeing one another. Also, her being a woman like myself helps with our rapport and my general comfort around her.
0.760000	I trust my physician because I grew up in their care as they always took care of me and made me better. They also know what they are talking about and how to deal with infections or how to make someone feel better. 
0.680000	i trust them because they have always been loyal and also offered me good services in the past. I have recommended them to family and friends and they also had good things to say about them
0.640000	I trust my physician in general medical information, such as if I have the flu or strep throat or something like that. But if it was a serious medical diagnosis I would probably want to get a second opinion to make sure that they were onto something.
0.600000	I dont think I've ever trusted a doctor completely. When I see them taking meetings with pharm reps and so many patients they only have about 5-10 minutes with each, I dont feel very confident about everything they say and do. They seem to go on vacation a lot too.
0.840000	I have worked with for many years and found his advice to be very good and has helped be get over various health issues in a reasonable time by following it.
0.720000	Because I feel like they should know what is best for you and if they explain all the options and consequences then they are more trustworthy.
0.880000	I feel that I can talk to my physician about anything and ask any questions relating to my health or how I feel.
0.920000	I believe my doctor take the time to give the most important information and take time to explain things to me. And will route me to additiol sources so I trust her over all.
1.000000	I havve been with my GP for 20 years. I can trust anything he says. He has been with me through the good and bad times and always tried to do whats best
0.880000	I don't distrust my primary care physician, but I'm cautious in general and if there's room for a second opinion I will always consider getting one. I'm not too trusting either but I trust that being he/she is the one with the medical degree that I'm in the best hands possible and I let them do their job.
0.800000	I actually just met my PCP, but she came in having clearly read my file. She took a lot of time with me, didn't appear rushed at all. She had a good bed side manner. She gave appropriate recommendations and explained things well.
0.440000	I was misdiagnosed with a condition for years and doctors refused to test for it. I have encountered many doctors and some understand more than others.
0.960000	I've been seeing my current primary care physician for 5 years now. I've had Type 2 Diabetes follow-ups regularly every 3 months for that period of time. The staff in his doctor's office are always very nice, kind, and polite. They're efficient, knowledgeable, and patient. My primary care physician himself is very knowledgeable on just about any condition you may bring up to him. He's always been honest about my health, suggested non-medical ways to address said problem, suggested medical ways to address said problem if non-medical wasn't enough or not appropriate for me personally, and been personable in a professional way. 
0.560000	I don't fully trust any doctor. Any person can make a mistake. Also you never know how a person really is and how much they really care.
0.800000	my doctor is there for me when I need him to be - he takes the time to listen to me and answer and questions I might have. 
0.560000	i trust my primary physician because they really help the sick and they how to help every one they see
0.760000	My doctor has never been judgemental with me when I'm in her office. She encourages frank and open conversations and she's been able to clarify several situations for me and always seems to be able to answer my questions or check on it if she doesn't know the answer. I really value that transparency. 
0.920000	He was my father doctor. He talks to me. He send me to do lab work. He explains problems. He read my sugar books.
0.880000	doctor seems competent, will answer any questions i have and usually explain things before i need them to be explained. very detailed and always up to date on task
0.560000	"I would never trust a doctor 100%.  Even if they're trying their best, they don't always know what's right.  If you have something rare wrong with you, it will usually take multiple doctors before you find one that gets it right.  Most doctors will treat you under the assumption that you have the ""most common thing"" wrong with you that has your particular set of symptoms."
0.600000	She was always distant and just focused on what she thought was the problem. She wasn't bad at all...just distant.
1.000000	I've been with the same doctor for several years and haven't had any issues. Always have my best interest in heart and we discussed everything from medications to procedures.
0.760000	They have all the training and experience to make these types of decisions. Granted there are still some things that a lot of people don't know
0.800000	I generally trust skilled professionals across the board. I assume someone who was intelligent and hardworking enough to fulfill the obligations of becoming a practicing physician would uphold the integrity of the position.
0.760000	He seems to know what it right for me. I do not have any trouble understanding what advice he gives me.
0.520000	Knowledgeable but doctors will rush to see too many patients.  Will not go in depth unless problem is already too far gone. Prevention not a thing with most and don't take their time with each patient.
0.840000	I trust my doctor he's knowledgeable he knows my kids the next best to myself. They seriously help me 
0.680000	I primarily trust my primary doctor. She is super nice and always answers all of my questions thoroughly and takes time to explain whats going on. That builds the trust every time I see her.
0.480000	I do not have a stable primary care physician at this time.  With doctors in the past it generally seems as if they are just handling another number in line and waiting to get through to the next person and the person after that.  They generally don't seem to listen very well.  
0.760000	My doctor has my best interests in mind at all times. She will take the time to explain my health to me in order for me to understand and go thru many options when treatment arises. She is always patient and listens when I have questions or am worried about my health.
0.800000	I trust my doctors because I have been going there for some time. They listen to my concerns and thoughts then add their input. If I disagree with something they say they will listen and try to find a better altertive. I do what a doctor tells me is best to do.
0.520000	I don't trust the American healthcare system in general, not necessarily the doctor. Nowadays, patients are just numbers to doctors. The medical care system is deeply flawed and needs reform. People aren't being treated properly for their illnesses because of astronomically high medical costs. Everything is about profit, so that's why I don't trust any doctors.
0.800000	Because she looks out for my well being if i have a problem she will recommend treatment or send to a specialist.
0.560000	He seems nice enough, and he tends to explain things adequately, but I never feel very comfortable with him. I've been in a few times with issues that he's diagnosed was stress or anxiety related muscle tension so I worry that he might think I'm a bit of a hypochondriac.
0.720000	I do not trust it sometimes. Because, some doctors do not look at the bright side and they are upset the people. And they do not look at the all type of test results. they see just some symptoms in report and they put the me of sickness. but they are not looking other side effect that cause the sickness.
1.000000	My primary care physician has been my primary care physician since I was a teenager and she is the provider I take my kids to. When she has been wrong she has admitted it. She fits us in at the last minute when needed, is willing to try more than one thing when I ask and always listens and take into account what I have to say. I worry about finding a new provider when she retires.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he has been in his field of work for 20+ years. He has seen many different types of patients with many different situations and has an abundance of experience in getting the right treatments done.
0.440000	I don't really trust my doctor very much because i feel that sometimes they are too caught up in all the drug company's ideas that certain medicines work for thing they don't or are trying to perscribe medicines due to kick backs from companys
0.600000	I've known him a long time and he usually answers all of my questions honestly and truthfully. He is always available when I need him.
0.640000	I have two primary care physicians that work in the same facility. Generally, I trust them with my medical needs. I don't go in too often, so usually when I do go, there is a need for treatment. They are good at assessing the symptons and prescribing treatment. Occasionally, there was a need for follow up that wasn't taken care of but overall, I trust them.
1.000000	I have been going to the same doctor for years now in a great clinic my kids and wife go to as well.  We really like it there and it eels like a whole team of care rather then one doctor.  
0.960000	I believe that doctors have my best interest in mind when treating me.
0.400000	I have seen a few different doctors over the past 10 years who have not taken me seriously and blew me off â that is when I came in with a list of things I wanted to have checked out, that had been bothering me over the several years that I had not been to a doctor, the doctor barely looked at the list and then told me I was normal and healthy without even checking the things and by the time I left the office I realized I haven't totally blown off. He didn't care.
0.800000	I have been going to my primary doctor for a lot of years and I have come to trust his judgement completely.  I feel he always has my best interests in mind and tells me what to expect.
0.760000	I trust her because I think and hope that she has my best interest at heart... There's always a 24 hour hotline just in case I need help in the middle of the night. She's always supportive
0.840000	My primary care physician does not make recommendations lightly and explains decisions carefully. He listens to my concerns.
1.000000	The primary care doctor that I have now is the doctor I went to for my second opinion. He seemed to care about what was wrong with me. Explained what he thought was wrong and proceeded to have me do tests. Which is more than the previous doctor I went to had me do.
0.640000	I trust my primary care doctor. I have been with the same person for 4years and she is very knowledgeable and always on point with treatment and what to do
0.760000	I go to a DO rather than an MD. I think she looks at my health more holistically than a regular MD who looks for what they can prescribe to fix the problem. She asks about other things that may be impacting the issue rather than just writing an Rx.
0.920000	She is thorough open and honest.  She believes in God and listens to me when I talk. She responds to my questions and never seems rushed 
0.840000	I trust doctors because ultimately, I visit them because I'm not an expert in regards to health and medicine and because they have the means to help me. They're the ones with the expert knowledge. If I do think that they're doing something questionable, I would consult yet another doctor. Furthermore, doctors tend to be high on empathy and people who study this career did it because they wanted to, no one forced them to do it. I think this makes them more trustworthy.
0.520000	I trust a doctor's medical knowledge but not a doctor's character or infallibility. A doctor can make mistakes even if they try their best, they can have beliefs that influence their medical advice, they can be influenced by prejudices or incentives. Doctors are only human. But that doesn't mean I should ignore what they say.
0.760000	My doctor seems to be generally caring and concerned for my well-being. This also seems to be true for her other patients. While I don't always feel like the priority, I do feel as though I am cared for in a proper manner.
0.400000	My doctor misdiagnosed me for two years. When I found out what was wrong with me he refused to listen. I hired an attorney and had him send a letter so I could get a referral to a neurologist. They agreed with my self diagnosis. Same thing happened with my GYN and my chronic problems. They could do a google search and help me but their fucking egos or laziness stops them.
0.960000	I have now been with my particular Doctor for over 10 years.  He is the best and most concerned Doctor that I have ever had in my life time.  He watched over my health and concerns with loving kindness.  I trust his decisions for my  health Concerns completely.  
0.680000	Sometimes when I get a second opinion or third, my primary doctor is wrong. I want to get various opinions and facts before I make my own informed decision.
0.920000	My doctor is amazing. He has several degrees and is one of a handful of Holistic doctors in Minnesota. He is beyond smart, compassionate and honest. I've seen many doctors over the years, but this doctor is my favorite and only one I will ever see again.
0.880000	My doctor is a DO, so I already feel that the philosophical underpinnings of his education are more patient focused than illness focused. He listens carefully to what I tell him, and responds point by point to my statements. He trusts in my personal medical judgement as far as my chronic conditions.
0.560000	I don't go to the primary care physician but once a year I don't trust her I go to the pain doctor I trust her and I go to another doctor and t trust her
0.720000	I don't have primary care physician. But i think doctors are okay and do a good job at being a doctor 
0.880000	When I had Kaiser, I didn't trust them at all. They prescribed Codine for every little thing that I had. Now I have a private doctor through PPO and they are spot on, I'm always feeling better, I never feel like I get the run around. This difference can make my answers fill mixed. But if you were to ask me how I felt between HMO and PPO health care, it would be a landslide of an opinion.
0.760000	"My doctor seems to provide a lot of information and entertain any questions, even if they don't see particularly well thought-out or ""smart"""
1.000000	I trust that my physician will care for my best interest and what is best for me. She is not self centered and is very good at her job.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she explains everything in detail. She always asks if I have any questions or if I understand. She also takes her time with me.
0.720000	I trust my doctor with my medical health care needs. I don't have any reason not to trust her with my questions and concerns about my medical health care. 
0.640000	I trust them because they know more than me but am still apprehensive at times. As long as they listen to me. 
0.760000	I think that my doctor is a decent person whom wants to make sure his patients lead a very healthy life. His job is more than a pay check. He's doing an excellent job by providing the necessary help to his patients.
0.800000	She listens to me, repeats back to me my concerns and has given me no reason not to trust her. She takes the time necessary to understand my needs and questions
0.880000	My doctor always tells me their opinion and their level of confidence. They give me options if they are available.
0.640000	Because they are all about getting as much money as possible. And getting as many patients in and out quick as possible.
0.720000	I've known him forever and he's pretty kind.  We have a generally good relationship we've maintained throughout the years and he helped me get back on track with managing a condition I had neglected due to a doctor that made me feel poorly about myself.
0.800000	For the most part, I put a great deal of trust in my doctors.  I listen to their diagnosis and try to ask relevant questions until I have a good understanding of the condition and subsequent treatment plan.  I do however try to verify on my own and if I do have more questions, I do not hesitate to get a second opinion from another reputable health care provider.  I have, however, not had a bad experience with the various doctors that I have sought treatment from. 
1.000000	I feel that he is well educated in his field and he very friendly.  I feel that he truly loves what he doing. I also just trust Kaiser to hire the best doctors.
0.800000	I have a great doctor who is very understanding and takes time to dig deeper. My previous primary care doctor just wrote me prescriptions and sent me on my way without listening, which is how I went undiagnosed with a thyroid problem. Having a doctor who listened and took the time to figure things out why fighting my insurance makes me trust her a great deal. 
0.720000	She's caring and always want me to come in for check ups. She's reliable but she does take a lot of vacations. All in all she's very understanding and I know I can contact her through email or phone. Also, I can do a walk in if I need her for an emergency. I have seen my doctors only her assistant
0.720000	I trust them because they have taken some health issues (depression, anxiety) more seriously than other doctors I have seen. I sometimes feel rushed though, so I am unsure if I always receive the complete truth or all my options. Overall I feel I have a good relationship with them and accept their opinions. 
0.920000	My doctor is more educated on physical well being than I am.  I trust him alot.  My doctor has helped me a lot with ailments in the past.
0.800000	My doctor has always shown me great care.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I've been going to her for quite some time and she's been pretty good at keeping me healthy. She knows my health and my needs so well, I almost feel like my chart is the only one in her file. I've asked other people in the office for their opinion on our doctor and all the responses seem to be very favorable. The office staff seems to be very knowledgeable and attentive. It really doesnât bother me to go to my primary care physician at all because I know Iâm going to feel better. 
0.880000	My doctor knows my body as much as I do, maybe more. He knows my existing condition, and past history. If we try a cure for something and it dosen t work, then after awhile, we will try something else.
0.760000	I trust my condition but some of my condition can't just be cured it will take alot of money to fix all the problems I have and the work that's cut out for me
0.720000	I just switched my primary care doc after over 20 years so I really don't know her all that well.  It isn't that I don't trust her; she's just new to me.  Being a nurse, I do have doctors that I work with that I trust and will ask their opinion on something from time to time.
0.640000	I do not put my full trust in doctors because most do not care for your health unless they are getting paid.  If you have no insurance they set you aside than rather to assist you.
0.640000	i trust my primary care physician for their knowledge of medicine.  but you have to ask question about your illness and the treatment you are being asked to undertake
1.000000	She makes sure she has all the current information before making a diagnosis. I am very happy with my doctor.
0.720000	The explaianation and reason why I trust my primary care physician is do to her character and understanding. I feel she is an honest physician who truly wants to help.
0.840000	I trust them because the stuff they usually tell me works or is true. Also ,I've been going to this doctor for a while.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I have no reason to believe that he is dishonest.   I also have not been misdiagnosed in any way.   The only negative is that he is sometimes very busy and does not spend a lot of time with the patient.  The office is also very quick to push people to specialists.
0.640000	I trust doctors because they know what they are talking about and you can rely on them to keep your best interest at heart. 
0.560000	I trust that my doctor would provide me with the best care that they thought was possible if there was a real serious concern about my health. I also feel that my doctor does not always listen to every symptom and she is only trying to get through her day. I think my doctor prescribes medication to easily and doesn't always look to see if the benefits out-weight the side effects.
0.360000	I don't trust any human to take care of me.  We all make mistakes and I refuse for their mistakes to be made on me.  The most a doctor can do is tell me what they believe is wrong but it's up to me to fix it.
0.600000	I mostly trust my physician, but I also do my own research just in case anything went amiss, after all, it's our own body, and we should do most of the jobs taking care of it
0.960000	I have a basic knowledge of the medical field, they went to school for this, therefore their knowledge trumps mine.
1.000000	Ive been seeing this doctor for a long time and she actually happens to be a relative through marriage many many years ago so i have no reason to believe she would be completely honest so i am the same with her
0.520000	Although I'm quite satisfied with my doctor and really like her as a person, she's made a few mistakes that cost me a lot of physical pain and could have been very bad for me if not fatal. 
0.800000	He has never done anything to make me not trust him. I've always received good care from him.
0.720000	For the most part, I have never had a doctor fail to explain my options or refuse to listen to my problems. Any issues have been because I didn't want to talk about an issue.
1.000000	My doctor always seems to be upfront and honest with me. He provides me with the information i need to be proactive in taking care of my health. 
0.840000	I trust the right kind of doctors because they know whats best of me healthwise and the right kind of medicine
0.600000	I have the utmost trust in the group of  nurse midwives that I see for my primary gynecological care and for the birth of my son.  I believe their values perfectly align with my own and I trust them implicitly with medical decisions.  I trust most doctors less.
0.800000	I trust my doctor. He has always been candid with me and I have always been able to rely on his medical opinion. He is intelligent and has never failed me in the past.
0.800000	I feel like she takes times with me and really tries to understand what is going on with me. She asks me a lot of questions. She never rushes me. She runs a lot of tests if necessary. If she can't find answers she refers me to someone else. 
0.960000	I trust my doctor because she explains things thoroughly to me.  We have a good relationship for 15 years.  When I have something that others feel is trivial she listens to me and we discussed.  
1.000000	She is attentive,caring and willing to take time to explain and answer any and all questions. She understands that I am wary of medications or procedures that tend to have negative effects and is willing to work with me to find alternatives.
0.800000	i trust him because he is a very smart individual.  Nearly everything he  does for me or recommends seem to work out for the better.; weather its advice or prescribing medication for me.
0.520000	Sometimes people just look out for their own well being more than others no matter what profession. Also plenty of doctors have been wrong in diagnosing issues I'm having. They mask everything with medicine instead of treating the root cause. 
0.720000	I completely trust my Primary Care physician, but also understand that she see many people, so I ultimately have to do some of my own research and decide what is truly right for me as far as treatments are concerned.
0.800000	was very close to my last primary care physician who has unfortunately retired but he set me up with his primary care physician who is great and I go to a great hospital with an excellent reputation. I feel like I can articulate any issues and questions necessary
0.440000	I distrust my doctor because he is always in a hurry when I see him. I feel like nothing but a number to him during most visits. 
0.760000	I feel I can trust my doctor because he is very professiol. He seems to care about his patients. He also explains things well.
0.760000	I trust my primary care doctor.  She has never given me something I don't understand and has always explained things carefully and thoroughly.  I understand enough about my diet and lifestyle to know if she gives me a medication that I probably need it.
0.800000	My doctor regularly calls my home and checks on me. Also to remind me of any appointments I may have upcoming.
0.760000	They have not misdiagnosed me or ignored my fears or reservations about a particular treatment. My PCP does not treat me as another number.
0.600000	Sometimes I feel that doctors have too close of a relationship with drug manufacturers and this causes them to push certain medications on you when you could possible solve a health problem by changing certain habits.
0.840000	i have been with the same doctor for years and he listen to me and always give me the right medicines an test that im required to do
0.720000	I trust my PCP because she is fairly thorough.  When I explain to her that I have a specific medical concern, she does what she can to address it.  If I ask for a test or procedure, she does whatever she can to make it happen, which helps to allay my fears.  She makes appointments for me in a timely fashion, and she seems to actually care about my issues.  That's not to say she isn't usually in a hurry, but I think most doctors are because of a large patient load.
0.600000	I generally trust doctors. They're educated, but I also know they're human and can have biases that may sway the education or logic.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he does not hesitate to tell me when I am doing something wrong and the risk of doing that and he will also tell me what I am doing right and praise me.
0.600000	"I haven't seen a doctor in over a year; I had to have stitches in my arm due to an accident. I'll use that experience to explain here. The doctor I saw was very trustworthy, in my view. The first thing he did when he saw me - before he even said a word to me - was put on gloves and poke/prod a lipoma near my eye. I had seen my doctor about it years previous so I knew it wasn't anything to be concerned with, but having a doctor who goes ""hey, this guy is here for stitches.. but I'm going to take a brief moment and check out this other thing that I'm not even going to put on the record"" really made me feel as if he was looking out for me. I really appreciated that. When we got to looking at my arm, he explained how I was lucky because if the cut had been just a small amount deeper I'd need surgery (of course today I couldn't use the terminology that he did, but at the time I fully understood everything he was saying -- if you're a redditor, it was very ELI5). However, when speaking with my normal doctors.. sometimes it seemed as if they weren't really paying attention to what I was saying. For example, when I was in the military I told my primary care physician that it didn't matter what time I would lay down, I could not go to sleep. His response to me was ""go to bed earlier"". He eventually sent me to see the base psych and I was given medications that helped."
0.760000	I asked my physician about certain medications and she said that she doesn't like to prescribe those drugs. I respect her respect her reasoning, as I feel the same way about certain medications
0.800000	I have been through a surgery with him and have had good results. He openly shares the good and the bad and the tough things.
0.960000	I trust him because he always been right in diagnosis my problems if any & able to provide the correct medicine & counseling.
0.680000	In general, I would say I trust doctors since they are the professionals and they know what they are doing. Being able to become a doctor would imply that you are well educated in that area and have an adequate understanding.
0.320000	Every single PCP I have had the displeasure of dealing with has been arrogant and rude to me. They don't seem to take anything I say seriously, and seem to just want to get the visitation over with. It's a one-size-fits-all approach for these guys.
0.760000	My physicans has always been very open and up front with me. I have always trusted my physician. He makes me feel confident with his diagnosis. 
0.640000	As a human being I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, unless they prove otherwise. As far as regarding my relationship with my primary physician, I would say it is mostly trustworthy. But I do not put pass anybody moving in a way of their own benefit. I am in my sound mind when it comes down to my health, you can not pay enough for it, and it is very precious. So with that being said I trust me only. My health is very important for me. I try to be well versed in it myself, so I can know what is going on with me. My body is my temple.
0.560000	feel rushed at the doctors office so i tend to gloss over a lot of problems and hope they just go away
0.760000	My primary PCP is awesome. She answers all my questions, takes time with me and knows me and my family. I trust them. 
1.000000	I trust my primary doctor because he is very thorough with his examinations.i trust.my doctor. I will continue to see him as my doctor. 
0.880000	I feel like I have to trust him.  I am allowing him to look after my health.  If I didn't trust that his decisions or education was good enough I would happily find a new doctor.
0.280000	i DONT THINK SHE HAS TIME TO LISTEN TO MY PROBLEMS. SHE ONLY WANTS TO TREAT ONE LITTLE THING WHEN i THINK THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED. SHE GIVES MEDS TO QUICKLY
0.800000	I really like my doctor. I can always depend on her. She goes out of her way to help me and her other patients. She calls me herself without having a nurse do it. She explains things to me and also gives me educational materials.
0.800000	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. She hasn't let me down and I don't feel like I'm not getting the care I go in for.
0.720000	INDEED I TRUST MY PHYSICIAN IT PROVIDES ME A GREAT ADVISE IN MY LIFE AND I HAVE MORE 5 YEARS EXPERIENCE WITH HIM WITH NO PROBLEMS NOT RESOLVED
0.840000	I trust my physician because she gives me all my options and tells me the pros and cons before we do anything.  She is available when I need her for anything and always makes room for me.
0.520000	I do not trust one of my physicians because even though I feel pain I always get the feeling that because they know nothing is broken I shouldn't be in pain or as much pain as I say I am. Also they give presriptions that either don't last long or just not work at all. I Do trust them because I am referred to them by my parent and some of my other physician are much more different. 
0.720000	I think they have your best interests in mind. I do not expect them to do any harm. Also they are well educated and worked hard to get to where they are 
0.720000	Yes I trust my physician. I generally trust most people unless they give me a reason not to.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because he always gives me all my options in detail and never tries to mislead me. Sometimes though he does seem to push options that are more convenient for him and the practice. 
0.720000	I would not patronize a doctor in whom I didn't have trust.  That's counterintuitive.  Why would I go to a professional, then discount his advice/opinion.
0.960000	My primary care doctor is always ready to be there when I need to talk to him and if he can't be there a nurse is always available to get back with me. He is available by phone 24/7 and that is a comfort to me. I have been going to him for several years now and also my brother has been going to him too. Makes sure appointments are set up so that I don't miss any. Explains things in a layman's language so that you can understand what is going on with you physically and what you need to do to take care of any health problems that could arise and to keep me healthy. Makes sure that all vaccines are up to date and that I get my flu shot every year. Very happy with him. Also my dermatologist I am very happy with..He is very up-to-date.
0.520000	I like my physician for yearly check ups...but have not had a thorough examination from her after 2 years.  I have very few reasons to see her outside that, but I did disagree with her on one Rx and told her I would not take it. She was fair and said it was my decision, but I am free to question if I don't agree with her. 
0.680000	I do some things, my doctor tell me to do, like lose weight, but i don't put 100% trust in my doctor, I don't think any one should either.
0.800000	my doctor takes a lot of time with me we talk he lets me tell him what i think and if i say i don't like something or i am feeling bad about something we talk until we can come together on a fix and he tells just what's up not what i might want to hear
1.000000	He has my interest and always keeps me aware of my health and what I should be aware of as I grow older. The things we must do to keep me healthy
0.720000	For the most part, I think doctors are trustworthy. However, they are very busy and see a lot of patients, so they could make mistakes, just like everyone else.
