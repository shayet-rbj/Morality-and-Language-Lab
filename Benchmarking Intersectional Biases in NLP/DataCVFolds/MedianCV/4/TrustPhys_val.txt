-1	I typically trust doctors who have a lot of experience. I trust my doctor to know the best treatments for me, but I don't always expect my doctor to know everything about me. Sometimes, doctors don't believe what I have to say if it is strange or abnormal. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is clearly very knowledgeable, and also comes across as confident and direct, which I find reassuring. She is very no-nonsense, which I really appreciate. She is thorough when it comes to tests and exams and I have no reason to believe she has ever misled me with regards to treatment options or anything else.
-1	its happen couple times when i went to my primary care physician she was wrong about my illness then i had to ask her about it and then she used to prescribe other medicine. i dont trust now days to doctors. most of them look in google for clues.   
1	My PCP doctor has been treating me for more than 20 years now.  He also is part of a very small practice that is in the country side.  Even though I live farther away from his practice now, I still commute to see him because I trust him based on our long history and the experiences I have had with him in the past.  He tends to be very honest with me with regards to everything that we talk about. 
1	i trust my doctor very much because why wouldnt i trust my doctor i would trust my doctor all the time because they are there foor me all the time. 
-1	I don't distrust the doctor. I merely feel like so many tests and procedures are unnecessary and sometimes harmful. I don't go to the doctor unless I feel like something is wrong.
-1	I'm not sure they always have my best interest at heart. On the other hand they are willing to give their medical opion.
-1	I am still new to going to the doctor and entrusting them with my illnesses and overall care. I am attempting to get the doctor to understand.
-1	It just seems doctors are to eager to get to the next patient. They never spend enough time with you.
-1	I do in some ways trust my doctor or sometimes if they have a lot of patients then I am not as trusting
-1	I distrust my primary physician because all you here these days are how people are being prescribed things that they don't need 
-1	"I believe that doctors in general are not always up front with patients concerning medical conditions. Too often doctors try to "" sugar coat"" the facts, when in reality, most would rather NOT be given false information and false hope"
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for about 10 years now, I have full and complete trust in him.  He is very proactive with my health and he does not always recommend using medicine.  
1	My doctor explains everything to me and then presents options for me to choose from. This creates a relationship where I trust her. She is providing me with the opportunity to be involved in my healthcare decisions instead of being extremely paterlistic and telling me what I should and should not be doing.
1	I generally trust doctors because it is in their interest to make people feel better, and they have the training to do that. I think it takes a lot of caring for others to be a doctor and most physicians have the patient's best interests at heart. Most of them are proud of what they do and want to do well. 
1	She always knows when something is wrong and she knows how to help me with any problem. I can tell her anything and she will listen with out judging me.
-1	It seems that it depends on what mood she is in..maybe in a hurry at times and doesn't appear to be thorough
1	He has always been honest with me and tried to help me or sent me to someone who could help. He asks if I have questions and answers them. 
1	My doctor always seems to explain and talk about everything that i have any questions over and it's always quick and to the point but they are also somewhat hurried.
-1	been my family doctor for a long time not just me but friends and family and has alway do their job well
-1	I have had a long relationship with  of my doctors. I can depend on them to answer all my questions and give me their honest opinion 
1	She has been my primary care physician for a good many years and she has shared with me a great deal of her own personal information insofar as it is relatable to things that I have shared with her
-1	Well most of the doctors I've gone to in the last 20 years work at production mills. Get the patients in, give them some drugs, get them out. Treat as many people as possible in the given time.
-1	Most doctors get paid commission on certain products. This is conflict of interest. I don't trust that
-1	she is more than willing to answer any questions, and seems like she knows her stuff, thought I feel like she could care more for me, spending more time when I visit.
-1	My primary care physician is a nice woman who listens to me. She will direct me to many specialists.  She, however, does not treat very often.  She goes over the records of other doctors, etc.  
1	I think that when it comes to healthcare you should trust but verify. I think that there is a common way to deal with problems, but it is not always what is best for your undiviual needs. I like to learn what my doctor recommends but also look for other options and tural treatments as well. I think my doctor is awesome, but she is just human, and therefore it is important to have other ways of obtaining other opionons. 
1	He takes time with me, listens to me and is very responsive and honest.  He is caring and personable, easy to talk to.  
1	i trust my doctor he is insiteful and forthcoming, he brings up tips and information that is  having a healthy life
-1	I trust my doctor. He has never done anything to make me think he should not be trusted or that he is not honest. He has always been candid about my health concerns, and explains everything. He happily answers questions I might have and has even given me his email to contact him if I have any further questions.
-1	I'm so frustrated now.     I'm seeing 4 specialists and could give a damn about coordinating care with each other.   God forbid they go an extra inch , must less mile. 
-1	I don't trust my doctor because I think they are just trying to feed me medicine they always are rude and insensitive 
1	I trust most doctors because they are highly educated and have much more knowledge and experience than I do on the subject.  I do not trust some of those I go to because I am in the military and some are just HMs who have not necessarily been to college let alone medical school and could be lacking in the right information.
1	I trust my doctor because he cares about what's good for me. He would not knowingly do something that would violate my trust in him.
-1	I trust my doctor because she seems to care about me - and listen to me when I talk. I have never had a problem talking to my doctor.
-1	Sometimes I trust her judgment other times,I do not. When it come to basic healthcare needs and minor ailments, I trust her. But major issues ,I do not. She is too quick to offer medicines, when I don't think it's a good idea. For example, she encouraged me to take pain medicine after a minor surgery and I refused.
-1	I feel like my primary care physician and most in general just want to constantly put people on medication to fix everything. I don't want to be on a bunch of medication with negative side effects and that's all they try to push in order to fix problems. The lack of options causes my distrust in my doctor.
-1	nothing like that i can feel the importance and trust mmyself very easy so am saying that very confidiently that i can do all by myself
1	I trust my primary care physician because they always treat me with respect and care. When I get that type of respect from someone they earn my trust with their professional opinions.
-1	I trust him because he's been our family's primary care physician for a long time now. He is very helpful and courteous
-1	My primary care physicians does her best, but is still just one woman. She does tend to rush, and if what she recommended could drastically alter something going on in my life, I would prefer a second opinion. OR at least a long talk about why she believes this instance/course of action to be the case. People make mistakes, I wouldn't want to be hurt by such an accident.
-1	I feel like the doctor doesn't know exactly what she's talking about sometimes. I feel like she just gives me medication instead of really getting into what is really going on. Some of the things she says is wrong. 
1	My doctor says a good businessman can never be a good doctor and a good doctor cannot be a good businessman. My doctor has a simple practice in which he spends considerable time with each patient.
1	They usually Iistens attentively,  always asks if you have any input or suggestions. Does tests, x-rays and send to others doctors for things outside of their scope of expertise. 
1	I trust my primary physician because I have seen her for a long time now and she has never let me down. She's always helpful, always within reach, and she has never given me bad advice. I trust her because I consider her a friend and she feels the same way.
1	I always make sure to choose a physician I am comfortable with. This means that I feel they have my best interest in mind and are not just out to milk my insurance or have little interest in their patients.
-1	Although my GP is most likely intends to do her correctly, with the high number of patients under her care I can't trust that she able to fulfill her responsibilities. With the private health care system dominating in a society where so many people are below the poverty line, it becomes impossible to see a GP more than once a year. If you develop any medical issue between the appointments the only option for so many Americans is to go to the emergency room.   
-1	I feel that sometimes my Dr. cares more about what's convenient for them instead of me. I also feel like they rush me sometimes or think just because they know me, I don't have any new issues. My Dr. is good b/c anytime I need to see him or her, I can always get a same day or next day appt. They also listen to what I have to say, whether or not I'm right or wrong
1	I trust my doctor because he was there when I was born and is very trusted by my parents. He has taken good care of my siblings and is very kind. 
1	I don't have a PCP but I consider my OBGyn my most regular doctor. She is very smart, compassiote, and takes time to explain things to me clearly and give me advice and recommendations. I like her and trust her a lot. 
-1	I am currently between doctors, but in general, I haven't experienced any issues where a doctor seemed to dismiss my concerns or rush me.
-1	I trust my primary care physician as she is very thorough and wants to help get down to why something is bothering you.  I don't always trust that she is 100% present as she is very busy, only works two days a week, and has a packed schedule. I frequently have to wait a very long time while at the appointment before I see her, and I wonder how focused she is.  I feel like I'm inconvniencing her with my issues.
-1	I need to know all the side effects of each treatment and take a proactive stance when it comes to my medical treatment.
1	I trust my primary care physician, because I have make seen remarkable results in their work. I have have been a patient with this physician for more than 5 years'.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician that I see regularly so it is hard to say. I based my answers on the times that I have seen doctors in the past. In general I think that doctors are trustworthy and do have the best interests of their patients at heart.
-1	I think that they want to do what is best but I also feel with the insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies around that it is hard for them to always do what might be best for the patient. They try to use universal fixes for everyone and instead of fixing the underlying issue they just prescribe medicine which causes more issues.  
1	My doctor is a really nice guy, very competent, and is open and honest with me about my treatment and diagnoses
-1	She is thorough and informative, and won't give you unnecessary drugs. She actually tries to get to the root cause of ailments instead of treating the symptoms 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because they tend to know better than I do what is better for me when it comes to my health
-1	I believe that my doctor has my back because that is his job.  He is competent and pragmatical, and he would undoubtedly explore treatment options with me.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician at the moment, but if/when I get one, I'll judge him based on his expertise, reputation, my own knowledge and judgment and first impressions.
-1	I think my doctor is honest with me about my condition. But as medication is concern is not giving me the medication treatment that I think is best for me. I think because of other health problem that I have he is cautious.
-1	I do trust our physician, but feel that we are often hurried in and out of his office. It would be nice if they got to know us a little more and asked more questions. 
-1	I feel like some doctors love money more than helping their patients. They will make you take test that you don't really just to bill your insurance and make money 
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part. I feel that he will do right by me but sometimes I feel I am being rushed. I can not think of anything else to say.
1	I trust doctors because i believe that they have my best interests at heart
1	My doctor always seem to have time for me in general and she is very open to what I have to say. And she always listen.
1	I have known him a long time, He also helped look after my parents and he was always honest with me. Most of the time I think to honest, But that was ok I needed something to be put bluntly  for me to digest everything that was happenings. My Dr understood that, he took the time to understand that being blunt was what I needed.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician and I do not trust doctors as I've had the pleasure of witnessing first hand their dishonesty. Doctors are a business and their primary concern is their bottom line rather than the Hippocratic oath. 
1	I have been going to the same doctor for about ten years. He is very thorough and knows my medical needs. He hasn't failed me yet and has helped me tremendously in all aspects of my health.
-1	well fost off I just want to say that in no way shape or form I have a primary care physician and I also have little experience with doctors
-1	I do have trust in my PCP - as he is intelligent and qualified, but he runs a busy office and I often times feel as though he rushed through the process or appointment. 
1	She is thorough, thoughtful and knowledgeable. My health is good. I have no data that argues for mis-trusting her
1	 All my doctors have always given me competent information and competent care. I trust them very much.
1	i trust my primary care doctor because that's the doctor i've had since i was born. She has all of my medical records. So, its just easier to stay with her and trust her knowledge of me.
-1	my primary physician is new to me, so I dont have a built in relationship with her yet.  She's new to medicine, and that makes me think she is up on the newest medical trends but may also lack experience of knowledge.
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part and he does spend time with me when I have questions.  If he does not have answers to my questions about a specific problem, he would send me to a specialist.
1	I have had the same primary care dr for 30 years. His background is much like mine and he is excellent.i trust him implicitly.
-1	I trust a physician to have the knowledge and experiences to at least to best explain and point me in the right direction of addressing  health issues.
1	I'm trust in my doctor because I know him since I'm a child and every time that he told me something is right he is someone with sense of kind and he is helpful and he care about his patience, He can make mistake like everyone because is human but I trust completely in him.
1	As I mentioned earlier, my father was admitted a week ago to my hometown hospital with kidney failure and pneumonia so I'm drawing on my past week. I haven't been to a doctor in a long time or had any medical issues. My interactions with his primary care physician, cardiologist, renal specialist and all his supporting staff have been professional, transparent, caring and seem to be of the highest quality. He's in rehab today after flat-lining and a close brush with death and I have nothing but respect for every medical professional  I've dealt with.
1	All of my physicians are thorough, personable, and genuine. They never make me feel rushed or like they only do things that are convenient for them. They always provide me with extensive information while weighing in on the pros and cons of each possible outcome. 
-1	Doctors are stuck within a system over which they have limited control. They have to consider the patient, the budget, and themselves.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very smart, well qualified, and she knows what shes doing. The office that I go to is also very well known, and its been around for years so I trust them. They are all very professional, clean, and enthusiastic in their practice their.
1	My doctor is thorough and honest with me, and discuuses every current issue if any, and reviews all issues in the past...so very happy with my care from my primary physician...
1	i trust my physician because that is their job to tell the truth and help you as needed. a doctor should always provide the help you need and should have a solution to your problem.
-1	I personally have had bad experiences with doctors, NPs not listening to what I am telling them. Doctors are constrained by a broken healthcare system, insurance system, so they cannot spend the time with patients, even if they have good intentions. the federal gov. is meddling in the doctor/patient relationship. 
1	I hVe had medical issues in the past and he was completely open and honest about all he options available to me whether good or bad
1	I have known him for quite awhile.  he is well respected and has an excellent reputation.  He always takes time to talk with me and address any concerns that i might have. 
-1	I've been seeing him for several years now, and have always followed his recommendations, which have been very useful. I expect this relationship to continue going forward. 
-1	I just don't feel there is enough time. My MD books a lot of patients and is cognizant of the time and need to be quick. I don't often get a chance to sak all my questions.
1	I have a long relationship with my dr. She has earned my trust over the years and is normally very accurate in her diagnosis. Her explations and communication is top notch.
1	I trust him because he's never given me a reason not to. Every time I've gone to him he gives me the correct medication or suggestions to alleviate what's going on and they've worked every time
-1	Because they are in the business of making money and the more sick I am and dependent upon the medication they are giving me, the better for them. I do not believe they truly want me to get well.
1	My doctor is willing to listen and doesn't ignore my concerns. She brings up different options and will let me choose which of them I think would work best for my situation. Overall, I'm very happy with my PCP.
-1	I think that the medical profession has a rrow view of the patient and does not look long term.  It is ultimately up to me to decide on the course of action in my healthcare, after taking the advice of the doctor with a grain of salt.  I do not wholly believe that the doctor knows what is best for me after a brief office visit, only I can know and make this decision.
-1	I trust them because they always give me the right medicines and treatments for any problems I have and go through. They are always there when I need her
1	I feel that I can completely trust my doctor.  SHe listens to me when I talk and she helps me to feel at ease.  I believe that she has my best interest in mind.  SHe genuinely cares about me.
-1	He seems to care about me and my needs. They know more Tha. I do and can come up with reasonable solutions.
-1	I trust my doctor because he is willing to answer my questions even as far fetched as they might be, he takes the time to listen to what I have to say
1	I have developed a strong relationship with my primary care doctor. I have seen him for many years now and he has been successful at helping me through various illnesses with success. 
-1	I trust her because she is a licensed doctor and looking out for what is best for me. If my physician wasn't trustworthy, i'm sure they would've stripped her of license to practice medicine.
1	I completely trust my doctor. he is thorough and honest. he is caring and understanding. he has kept me healthy and happy for many years. I cannot imagine seeking health advice from anyone else.
-1	She does just an ok job. I would change doctors if I gound a better one in my insurance scope. I am looking.
1	I trust my primary care physician because they are experienced and very caring. MY physician takes the time to explain all the possible procedures and how they will effect my outcome. My physician from day one has spent ample time with we talking and understanding my needs and concerns
1	My doctor and I have a very strong friendship as well as doctor/patient relationship. She listens to my opinions and thoughts and we make my health decisions together.
1	I assume that our doctors are trustworthy. They undergo a minimum of seven years of postgraduate schooling, pass rigorous tests and are responsible for our health and the health of our families. But in recent times there are few cases in which doctors are not considering as trustworthy. So I think it is better to check few things before preferring doctor.There are several doctor-rating websites where patients share their reviews and experiences with physicians.
1	My doctor is a very good doctor, who i trust completely. I have been seeing her for the past 4 year. I feel that she always tells me the truth and looks out for my bet interest. Anytime that i feel something is wrong she always listens to me and doesnt blow me off. There has been times when she has made appointments for me for follow ups, within like a week. I have not had others doctors do that
-1	I feel like I am being rushed through appointments and that she is only half listening to what is going on with me.
-1	My doctor is highly trained and highly regarded in the community.  I am comfortable with him and my treatment plans and therefore trust him.  He is highly rated.
1	My primary care doctor is thorough and caring.  He never rushes my visit and always asks a number of questions about my various health issues.
1	There are instances or maybe rare instances that I did not trust my doctor one time because all he/she ever gave me was simple remedy that I could have just researched in the internet.
1	My primary care physicians takes the time to talk to me, even discussing things that are going on with my family and work that might be affecting my health. She seems truly concerned about my well-being.
1	Back home my family doctor took care of my parent and me very well. And he was very reliable and openly honest. If he was not sure he would get a second opinion.
-1	I only trust my physician, if he gives me honest answers about my health.  I have had physicians I did not trust in the past.
1	I do not have a primary care physician though I do trust doctors, but rarely I receive that doctor that just cares about getting you in and out. Sometimes I find out about other treatments options myself but I can tell my doctor about it to receive more information and how the treatment works exactly, so I can figure out which fits best for me.
1	I feel that you can trust a doctor fairly well because the last thing they want is to cause you harm. For one they most likely would feel bad and morally wrong for hurting a patient. Also they do not want any law suits on their record or in their life at all.
-1	I have not really found a good primary care physician yet. I had a good one, but he retired. The new one I have found so far has not impressed me. He is ok, but I don't feel as comfortable talking to him and sometimes feel like he jumps to conclusions about me or my condition without fully evaluating the information I have provided.
-1	I trust all the doctors because they graduated because of something, although there are some that do not give me good impression
1	I don't have a pcp at this time.  However, while I have some good doctors and some not so good doctors, most of the time I have had exceptional care from my pcps in the past.
-1	I mostly trust my PCP. Of all the doctors I've seen in my life, he's better than most when it comes to listening to my problems and trusting that medical issues I bring up need to be addressed; a lot of doctors I've seen will try to explain away symptoms or avoid doing more tests. But even he's not perfect, although maybe his medical judgment and my instincts may sometimes be in conflict.
-1	I trust my primary care physician to try to do what is best for me. However I realize he may be constrained by insurance restrictions or influence by drug manufactures.
-1	if you dont have insurance you get very lil consideration because the doctors think that you are not important enough for them to bother with you 
1	I trust my doctor because is a doctor that really cares about is patients. He takes the time to really talk and explain everything to me.
-1	I recently changed primary care doctors. I had my first appointment with her and so far I feel she is doing a good and thorough job.
-1	Doctors want money and they often push information they are being paid for, like from pharmaceutical companies and whatnot. I really don't know if my doctor knows what is best for me because of all the alternative medications and practices I can read about online. I don't put too much into what my doctor says as they have limited information from their medical school studies.
-1	Doctors are only interested in what your insurance can cover-period! It's very difficult to find a decent doctor who will consider what is best for the patient and sometimes their treatment is worst than the decease itself!
1	My doctor actually seems to care what happens to me and how my treatments are going and affecting me
1	I trust my doctor she has been a friend and Dr I can Tell her anything she is straight forward with me
-1	I have military healthcare through my husband. Both my primary care doctor and my neurologist were recently rotated out to new duty stations. Both of them were really good, and saw me through my initial GBS-CIDP diagnosis and the first cycle of recovery and recurrence. I'm now on cycle #2 and both my current doctors are new to this duty station. They may prove to be just as good as my last doctors...but I just haven't seen them often enough to make that determination yet.
-1	first of all my primary care physician doesn't show up to work on a the regular basis and also he always smells like alcohol and do not have that much knowledge in medicine.
1	I have been going to my doctor's office for a long time and do trust that the care is great.We have a good relationship and communication between us
1	I have known him for a long time now. He has often been honest to me about my weight and that I should try harder to manage it.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor cause she/he been there for me since the age of 7 so my bond with the doctor is more then strong
-1	He or she doesnt listen to me. They tell me what they believe to be wrong or right with me. I believe they just want peopls money and that they arent looking out for our best interest. I do trust some doctors but most of them I dont.
1	When I was 41 yr. old I had a severe asthma episode.  I had never had asthma before and I almost died.  The Dr. the ER called in saved my life then and I had him as my doctor for many years and had me on meds that controlled the asthma.  More recently I have had other doctors and have been treated well; have had questions answered; been given meds that did what they were supposed to do.
1	I've been with my doctor since I was born. I feel like she can tell what is wrong with me as soon as I walk into her office. 
1	She's kind but straight forward and tells me how it is. She listens to my thoughts and concerns. She's never given me a reason to not trust her.
-1	Some primary care providers are somewhat of a trust because of male practice or other issue at a specific location
1	She is intelligent and asks thorough questions.  She is good at following up.
-1	I would have to say more than anything I feel a doctor is there to rush me in and out. I don't go very often but I never feel like I'm truly heard. I wait for 30-45 minutes for 5 minutes with them saying exactly what I have already told them and them prescribing something. I feel like I should be able to see a doctor nearly instantly for a cold, flu, or something common so I can be in and out and not waste my time.
1	I have found my primary care physician to be a very good listener who asks pointed and relevant follow up questions. He also takes into account my experiences with various medicines and treatments when prescribing tests and/or new medications. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has known me since I was baby. She makes sure that I know what is going with my body at all times but she also tells it how it is.
-1	I trust my primary care physician and I do have a primary care physician who has always been trustworthy. They are known to have a good reputation within the community.
-1	I trust my doctor because its his job to know how to treat his patients but i think he could be more thorough and listen more.
1	I trust my primary physician because he is very thorough in what he does and has been my doctor for many years.  Any time I have needed him he has been there and properly diagnosed me.  He is not afraid to involve other doctors when he is unsure or would like a second opinion.  
1	Mainly because I do not really need my doctor to explain to me what is going on. I can see that he gives instructions and recommendation based on current research and best practices by verifying it for myself. Unless you do this you allow yourself to be treated like an object instead of a sentient being. It is vital that a person educate him/herself outside of the doctor's office.
-1	I believe that most doctors want what is best for their patients. But due to fast pace and so many patients they see I don't think that doctors can always fully give everyone the time needed. I also think that there is so much medical information that it can be difficult to get consensus among doctors and you are often give mistaken information. 
1	My children and I have been seeing our doctor for the last 10 years.  He always remembers everything about my kids as if they are his own.  It's as if he is part of the family.  I can reach out to him at any time of the day and I know that he will be there for us
1	My Physician is very open and forth coming.  He tells you everything and explains things to me. I have never had any reason not to trust him
1	I trust the care of my primary care physician because I have been a patient with him for years and also because I am a LPN, he trusts my knowledge as well and we can always come to a decision together regarding my care.
1	I like to give physicians the benefit of the doubt.  I have never been steered wrong yet.  I bet there are a few crooked ones out there but I have not encountered them.  I like to think people are more good than bad.
-1	Generally all doctor do not take enoug time to talk to their patience. Sometime the doctors just want to see as many as patience as they can 
-1	My physician doesn't make a habit out of asking for unnecessary tests or making me pay more than I should for a service or diagnosis. I trust that the doctor is looking out for my best interests.
-1	"I receive medical treatment through a public health service. These people are over worked, under paid, and emotiolly drained. They have no incentive nor energy to deal with people who are uncooperative, and thus will try to give few options that leave people with ""obvious"" choices. "
-1	I think they have your best interests in mind. I do not expect them to do any harm. Also they are well educated and worked hard to get to where they are 
-1	It seems that physicians want to treat symptoms rather than dig to find causes and solve complex medical issues now.The latter takes more time and effort and expense and the medical industry does not favor the old diagnostic approach to medicine.Physicians are too ready to write prescriptions than to treat patients with drugs.
1	I trust her because she seems so genuine and caring. She is very thorough when giving me information and very knowledgeable. We have a lot in common and I can really relate to her. 
1	I been with the same doctor for ten years at least. She and I are not just patient and doctor but true friends. I know she has my best interest.
-1	I think a lot of doctors these days, especially young ones, are not that concerned with taking the time need to solve a medical problem. They want to take the easy course, get paid and move on to the next patient.
-1	I worked at a hospital for along while doctors worry more about getting as many patients seen and worry less a out providing good healthcare this has gotten worse. Since Obama care started
1	I trust my doctors because I have been going there for some time. They listen to my concerns and thoughts then add their input. If I disagree with something they say they will listen and try to find a better altertive. I do what a doctor tells me is best to do.
1	I have been with this doctor for over 10 years and no matter what he always treats me with respect and kindness. I have a lot of faults such as my struggle with my weight and depression and bipolar. He gives me options, but does not shame me. 
1	I trust her because she actually takes the time out to listen to me when I speak to her about what is going on with me.
1	A source neutrition and health care body taking care of your body health diets stay health and stuff
1	I trust my physician because he has always been good to me and given me accuracy and professiolism.
1	She always listens to my questions and concerns without making me sound totally ignorant or a bother to her
-1	I trust my doctors because they take the time to make sure I get a reminder call for appointments, they are friendly and don't mind taking a little extra time to explain something to me if needed, I even have a doctor who constantly tells me not to worry about his fee. 
-1	He or she listens and has a nurse listen and gives opinions and what type of meds are best and makes suggestions that are wise and schedules new appointments and calls in prescriptions and is concerned and gives advice and pamphlets and samples that help and is helpful
-1	i trust my doctor because she is very edicated and have a big experience and all time when she gave me some medication this is work very well
-1	I guess it is I trust my doctor to make decisions and help find answers. It is the unexplained sickness or pain that seems like all doctors avoid. You always have to see several doctors instead of just a few and that's when it seems like your being pushed through the system. If someone finds something, or another test is run.. I want to know why.. and what the findings are. Some don't let you know anything after tests are done.
1	Cause the physician knows what he/she is talking about and is dedicated to. The physician has no axes to grind and has no other agenda than to render the best care.
-1	I trust my doctor and his decisions about what is right for me, but overall I am know what is best for me and I do not trust many medications.
-1	I think it would be foolish to completely trust a primary care physician. They are humans and make mistakes like the rest of us. If it's something important I will want a second opinion.
-1	She is competent and very thorough, but I feel she relies on prescription drugs too heavily as a course of treatment. I would like to know about altertive treatments and therapies.
-1	He's just a regular doctor, maybe he's trying to sell me something for all I know. That's what some doctors do a lot.
-1	They are sometimes in a hurry. They don't always have all the answers. I value  second opinions or even thirds.
-1	"I trust my PCP to a certain extent, not because I feel that she has negative motives, but more because I know she is human and prone to make mistakes just like everyone else. I know she may have a bad day and may not be at her best. So while I trust her medical knowledge, I don""t put 100% faith in everything she says or does."
1	My doctor always does every test to make sure I am doing the things I need to do to keep myself in good health and if I am not doing them she makes sure she explains to me all the consequences I will face. She always tells me she wants the best for me 
-1	been with him for a long time and feel confident he is trying to do what's right and look out for my best interest as a doctor.
-1	I have moved to colo. So I have not found a primary doctor yet. The doctor I had in Michigan I completely trusted. They helped me control my asthma. 
-1	I trust them because I have to, they are the medical professionals and as long as I give them all the information they need they should be able to tell me what's wrong. I distrust because they are in business to make money as well. Medical world is big business and driven by insurance company's and their reimbursements 
1	I've been with my Doctor now for almost a decade and I've had little or no reason not to trust he has my best interests at heart. He only prescribes drugs when I really need them and gives me more than one option for treatment with full information.
-1	I would suspect that a doctor that is engaging in activities that would lead to people questioning their legitimacy in their decisions wouldn't still be able to be a physician. All my physicians that I've ever had seemed to genuinely care about wanting to treat patients to the best of their abilities.
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I feel there are things besides good medical practice which afffect the decision making of my doctor. When it comes to treatments, I feel my doctor is influenced by the pharmaceutical industry either directly (through an active relationship) or indirectly (through the funding that is given by those companies to research which then dictates what treatments are available or not).
1	I have had the same dr for years and she has never steered me wrong. Always disagnosed properly for whatever i came to them for, or gave the correct medicine that healed me for any sickness. My privacy has never been invaded. I trust my doctor
1	While I do trust my doctor sometimes I worry that she focuses on one aspect of my health while I'm trying to get help for something new that just came up. 
1	My doctor has always been upfront with me regarding my health care and options. Very through with my testing and responsible with overseeing my wellbeing.
-1	they seem kind of crooked
-1	I currently don't have a primary doctor at the moment which is why I documented all neutral. I'm new to the state and have yet to find a doctor I'm comfortable with yet. The last doctor I had in my hometown was my childhood doctor. 
1	My primary care physician was my pediatrician. I reconnected with him after 20 years. He is a good listener, and not fond of medications. Likes me to work out problems every other way before trying meds.
1	My family doctor has always treated us great including my two year old child with a serious heart disease and if it weren't for them we may have found out about her disease in the worst way possible which would be finding her dead. My doctor gives it to me straight and certainly does not sugarcoat anything which is good considering I am obese.
-1	I like her a lot and she hasn't steered me wrong so far.  I feel like she's honest with me about her opinions and my options.
1	Well, These doctors have been to school for this. I like to walk into a clinic thinking that I will be in good hands and that the doctors know what they are doing.
1	I have been going to my doctor since I was little and he knows me and my family well. I trust in what he says and does to treat my ailments.
1	My primary care physician is excellent! I love her and her team! They offer suggestions. They explain everything to me in a way that I can understand it.
-1	I don't trust the newbies sometime because there new but I feel like why would a doctor deliberately
1	I trust my doctor because he has never made a bad medical decision, and he listens to my problems ad concerns
-1	"I trust most doctors in general as long as they can explain why they recommend the things they do. I need more than a ""you need to do this"" explanation."
1	I have been seeing my GP for nearly twenty years, and I feel like we have a good rapport with each other. I can ask questions and offer theories and she gives them serious consideration because she knows that I am self-aware, and that I'm not not dramatic or prone to exaggeration.
-1	I generally trust them but at the end of the day they are they to make money and not just to help me or  to make me feel better so I have to take everything they say or recommend or do with a grain of salt and seek other opinions
-1	I trust my doctor because they know better than me, also i would know or feel if the doctor is not being honest with me. I have my wife to help me too or guide me. My primary care physician has been my doctor for years and he has helped me a lot on different things so I have built a trust for him.
1	Because I have been with him awhile and I would say health wise he knows everything about my health to make a good decisions about  my over all health
1	He's very sympathetic and a good listener.  I have been going to him over 20 years.  He's never steered me wrong
-1	I saw the results of his work and I know I can trust him in terms of whats best for my health. Not sure about what he is charging me for it...
-1	I've been with my doctor for many years now and have had no issues with her. She is very nice and I do trust her very much. That said on a big medical decision I may get a second opinion.
-1	Doctors in general. Are great for the world.  89 percent of dr.s are good at wat they. Afew dr.s make mistakes as any other human.  Dr.s should continue to evalate their patients and keep saving lives. And also 
1	She listens to me, repeats back to me my concerns and has given me no reason not to trust her. She takes the time necessary to understand my needs and questions
-1	I trust her because I think and hope that she has my best interest at heart... There's always a 24 hour hotline just in case I need help in the middle of the night. She's always supportive
-1	I trust my dr. But I just feel that sometimes you need a second opinion which i find nothing wrong with that.
1	I trust my primary care physician as they have done a really good job of diagnosing me and getting me the care I need so far. They have helped direct me to people that were able to help me with things that they were not trained to do (specialists) and in a very short amount of time. They have been able to help me with my scoliosis and have always been very positive. 
1	She made me take my shoes and socks off. No other doctor has. She also gave me the straight answer on if I were diabetic.  I need medication. 
-1	I trust my doctor. I have been going to him for years! He has givinen me the best advice and he also help birth all three of my children.
1	because everytime i have went in to see him for anything he has always been concerned and always explains everything i ask him
-1	I trust doctors to a point. However I feel that they do not always listen and just generalize your condition. They lump you in with other patients they have experience with
-1	Hes there to make money.  He has his own agenda, and sometimes I feel like he ends up only doing the least amount to help me so I will  have to come in again so he can make more money off of me.
-1	I trust my doctor before I do it is good to trust your doctor because they are your doctor and t is good
1	My doctor is always very open with their thoughts on any condition I come to them about.  They always give me a chance to ask questions and always make sure that I have a chance to say everything I feel is important.
-1	I trust that my primary care physician will tell me the truth about my health and well being and making sure that I'm dieting and exercising daily 
-1	I trust my doctor because he understands my needs and listens to what I am telling him.
1	I trust my doctor because he has never  done anything that has made me question his ability of motives. Everything that is done or tested for me has a specific reason that he explains to me. 
1	I went through several doctors before I found my doctor.  He is always ready to listen, doesn't prejudge and is willing to go the extra mile to make sure that I understand what he tells me
1	I trust my doctor since i have enough time dealing with him and also i entrust is to my family and my friens and colleagues
-1	I trust my doctor to an extend, but I think it's always important to do research on conditions for yourself and God third party medical opinions as well.
-1	I have been going to my doctor for over 20 years, I trust her. I feel as if she treats me based on my needs not as a guideline of treatment, but for individual needs. She talks to me like a person and shows respect and compassion.
-1	I think my doctor schedules more patients than she should which causes appointment times with the doctor to be rushed and short and not enough information is given to me or options discussed
1	"I don't ""completely"" trust anyone, but do I believe my doc is being honest and upfront with me?   Yes.    Not that I wouldn't get a second opinion if I had a serious illness, that's a common sense thing.  "
-1	I don't think I have seen my primary care physician enough to establish more trust.  I have only seen her once, so most of my answers are based off experiences that I have had with doctors in general, mostly OBs.
-1	Overall, I trust my doctor to give me honest answers to my questions. I can't prove they are 100% accurate, however, I have never had an issue with her diagnosis. 
1	He has been there every step of the way. He make me feel comfortable about dealing with my illness. 
1	several years experience with her - openness to questions, takes time to explain things, honors my decisions
-1	There is no doctor that tells the complete truth to heir client. Their pockets are lined and their methods are biased.
-1	I trust my PCP because a previous Dr had misdiagnosed me, so I went to my current Dr. for a second opinion.  He immediately sent me to the ER and it ultimately saved my life.
-1	I've met many rude doctors in my short life. It seems like there are may people that become doctors for the wrong reasons. When I find a competent and compassionate doctor it almost seems like finding a rare gem. I think most of them are competent of course, but few have what it takes to interact with patients appropriately.
-1	I trust doctors because they have medical experience and know more than I do That is why I go to them when I am sick or have a medical problem
1	I have never had any problems with her since I have been seeing her. She always answers any questions I have and always makes sure I don't have any unanswered questions before leaving the office. She always checks everything to make sure she has diagnoised me correctly. 
-1	i trust them, the reasons why are because of there positions 
1	I have been going to my Primary Care doctor for a few years.  Any concerns I have brought up she has addressed honestly, but in a caring and comforting way.  I am not talked down to and I am often presented with information and options. 
1	I think they tell me my options. I rely on their experience. I have rare skin disease so most doctor's don't know much about it. I can tell by their responses if I  trust them. Example - some admit they don't  know about my condition, while some try to suggest something I know doesnât work.
-1	My primary care doctor usually takes all the time I need to understand what is going on with me and to answer any questions I have.
-1	I have found in the past with primary care physicians I've had that they are interested in providing me with prescriptions I don't need and calling it preventative. 
1	He explains things well. I never feel rushed during a visit. He takes time to answer all my questions.
-1	i do not know her very well yet
-1	I trust my primary doctor because  the love and care and concern he has for my health. the doctors makes sure that he explains and let me know everything about my health plan
-1	I believe sometimes a doctor will persuade you into what they think should happen or their beliefs. They don't always look at it as your way of thinking just what they've been taught and learned. They also aren't alway as compassionate about and undertanding about the way you feel they do things every day and some doctors loose their passion for their work and it becomes just a pay check.
-1	I have been having some health issues and they are not really sure what is wrong with me.  We are testing multiple theories but it is frustrating 
-1	My insurance isn't great and I have to go to a very low cost doctor whom I don't have a lot of trust in, to be frank. She has often told me things that I outright knew were wrong (e.g.: continuing to tell me to take St. John's Wort after being prescribed Prozac, rinsing out a dog bite with hydrogen peroxide). It makes me wonder if the things she tells me that I DON'T know are wrong are correct.
1	"I trust my medical professional because from the moment I met her, she engaged me and made me feel comfortable and relaxed.  Throughout my visits with her, I've seen her competency shine through and appreciate her honesty and her ""house tricks"" to treat more common/household illnesses.  While she may prescribe a medication, she'll also talk through other alternatives and recommendations."
-1	I always have to call and remind my Dr. of things we already discussed.  In someways they are good, but still needs some work.  I don't like it when they screw up the Rx's or don't place the orders.
-1	"I think the vast majority of doctors become insensitive to their patients and their problems.  In fact, I think they lose the ability to even recognize that their patients are people.  They seem to push whatever ""treatments"" benefit themselves the most financially, without any regard to how that's going to affect their patients financially or otherwise.  "
-1	I need the medical advice that the Dr gives.I have no medical experience. I can always get a second opinion.
-1	this is true most of the time that doctors care more about what is convenient to them so we should not completely trust them but not all doctors are same so my view is neutral.
1	my doctor takes the time to explain test results and procedures, also the reason why certain medications have been prescribed
-1	I tell my doctor problems and he brushes it off. He does not respect my needs.  He is too cold. I told him about a knot on my foot 6 months ago. He ignored it. Now it is painful and bigger
1	I trust my doctor thouroughly. She let's me know what works and doesn't work. She is truly intetested in me as a patient and her nurses have called after a sick visit to see how I'm doing. She's awesome. 
1	I have been seeing same doctor for many years so I trust her with all my medical issues. She has never let me down
-1	I trust her because she listens to me and genuinely wants to know how i a doing. She suggests things for me to try that fit with my lifestyle instead of pushing pills on me. I appreciate that she isn't rushing to go out the door and listens to what I have to say. She is thorough and has a lot of knowledge in the things i need answers about. Plus one of my illnesses she also has so I get that extra insight.
1	The Physician's Assistant that I see (I normally do not see the actual doctor) is very pleasant and seems caring. She does not seem rushed or like she is trying to hurry through the appointment. She also gives me the opportunity to ask questions about any diagnosis or treatment.
-1	I trust my caregivers because they would not decieve me. They are supposed to do no harm and care about their patients
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has known me for over twenty years.  He is aware of all my medical issues and takes care to make sure i am getting the best care possible.
-1	Like I stated in the earlier essay question, in my experience with health care professionals (doctor's moreso than nurses), they tend to either ignore or downplay my questions and concerns. This angers me because I'm intelligent and I am great at researching, so I believe that my questions and concerns are well-founded and based on facts.
-1	I havw a new pcp because my old pcp misdiagnosed me. She did this with a couple different things. One being hep b and hep a. I do not have and she said i did. New pcp is more of a doctor feel good, meaning he prescribes anything you ask for. I feel like he just goes through ths motions. I dont trust him completely.
1	I have complete trust in my physician,been going to for 15 years.never had a problem.knows what doing.office staff friendly,clean,and askes how your doing.
-1	My PCP does his best, I think. But he is often rushed and is getting older. I trust him less than I used to. That said, I have absolute trust in the NP in his office.
1	I trust my primary care physician. I do not have a primary care physician, I trust doctors in general.
-1	I trust him because he takes time to explain things and doesn't rush me out of his office and comes across as sincere and even ends visit with a prayer for you
-1	Some of the things my doctor tells me aren't true. First of all, everyone knows that medicine is not good for you and second of all, she should be more observing. ð
1	My primary dr has been my dr for 25 years,  I trust her, I think she is great.  he never hesitates to help me
1	I have generally had positive experiences and never had a bad experience with a doctor. I have always received proper care.
-1	I generally trust my physicians, but I'm not afraid to ask questions or challenge their proposed approach if I'm aware of something they may not have considered. If my treatment isn't working, I'll do some research on my own and come back with questions the next time.
-1	The Primary Care Physician I have right now I trust very much, but she is leaving her practice and has not informed any patience as of yet. I am afraid of finding a new one Because my previous physican gave me a hard time helping me manage a medical condition
-1	I have a new doctor that I do not know very well. She is very friendly and seems competent. However, I would still ask questions to be sure that the right decisions were bring made about my health. I would never just blindly trust my doctor without understanding the information.
-1	I'm not crazy about him, but I'm on Medicaid and few good doctors. take it.
1	My doctor is known for having excellent bedside manner. She explains medications thoroughly and answers every question fully.
-1	My doctor is always looking at a computer and asking my thoughts on in. he has brought up his personal problems and comparing his problems to mine 
-1	I usually trust what my PCP tells me and recommends. I have only had a couple of bad experiences with doctors, throughout my lifetime.
-1	Because i believe and put my trust in god the physicians and doctors can only do so much be its gods power that can perform miracles
-1	I generally think they are looking out for me and have my best interests at heart. 
1	we have a young, enthusiastic doctor who comes from a family of doctors; he listens to me. Since I do a lot of research on medical issues, I feel he is giving me correct information.
1	My doctor is very verbal about what he thinks is happening. He explains the symptoms and what step should be taken to help cure the problem.
-1	The doctor that I have now pushes the medication option.  My previous doctor did the same.  I know they are doing the basics for me.  But I'm not that good a patient and I don't always follow their orders.
1	Because my doctor is a very professional and well prepared person who knows the area in which I am currently treated.
-1	 I feel I can trust them based on the general information , and listen to solutions where I know they are not just trying to take my money. Many times the use of fancy language and misdiagnosis lead me , and many other patience astray which is why I am neutral in that I trust most of their practice , but know they can have bad intentions and give wrong information.
1	my primary care physician seems like a believable type of person that could provide me with the accurate info that I need to know about my health
-1	I lost trust in past doctor's because it became completely obvious that they had taken on too many patients and their time and attention lacked because of it. They started to care more about the money than anything else. I left that doctor and moved on to the one I am with now. I feel like she cares more about what I have to say, but she also kind of rushes through things. She just opened her practice so i'm afraid with time, she will get worse and not care as much anymore. Sometimes it seems like it really is all about the money with doctors. They are a few that really do care though. My kids' pediatrician is a great doctor and I wouldn't want them going anywhere else. I've met more doctors that didn't seem to care than doctors that really do seem to care. 
-1	I basically trust doctors to do the right thing...but I make sure to research or learn more about a treatment or medicine if it is prescribed for me before I do anything blindly
-1	I had a LEEP procedure twice last year. I trust my doctor because She is professional and I am not. However, after having first procedure, She recommended me to have another procedure even though my after procedure result was negative. According to her, Just make sure all bad tissue is taken away by taking bigger portion . So, I followed her recommendation because she is very careful person, but on the other hand, I feel having second procedure is really needed or not.
1	My primary care doctor I trust because he test everything or look into everything have questions about 
-1	At the moment, I am in between a primary care physician.  I have been with an internal medicine doctor as my primary care doctor for almost 30 years and for the last two years (I go in once a year for a physical checkup), I feel I wasted my time.  He read my blood work and didn't even ask if I had any questions or problems to address.  I now have an appoint next month to see a new internal medicine doctor.
1	I love my dr. because she is open to hearing what I have to say and is not interested in bossing me or just telling me something to get me out of her hair.
1	i believe that health care is mainly a way of making money. Maybe there are some providers that are honest and caring but the majority are in it for the money
1	I have seen the same doctor for years who I have an extremely close relationship with.  He has been honest with me whether it has been a negative or positive thing that we are speaking about.  After him giving me extra time and going out of his way for me on separate occasions, he has more than proved himself as genuine.
-1	PCP is as good as you tell them your issues. In todays medical world they are more of a gate keeper referring patient to specialist as needed.
-1	I've been going to her for many years.  She is as good of a doctor as anyone.  However, sometimes I feel my opinion and desires are ignored.
-1	I don't feel they go the extra mile to check for any ailments I feel they are in a rush and don't check for everything they could sometimes we have to offer suggestions which is not cool 
-1	being 71 i always look forward to seeing the doctor asking questions and making sure i understand the answers
1	I trust my doctor i know that wind i go see them she take her time in doing what she do make shore all my test are up to date
-1	I trust my physician due to the fact of being a paitent of his nurse for a number of years in the past
-1	While I do trust my doctor in general, I think it's always a good idea to do your own research and educate yourself as well before coming to any fil decisions about anything. 
-1	I trust doctors they have the knowledge to help me I don't have myself they went to school to learn about medical procedures I didnt
-1	Well he knows what is best. I'm sure he doesn't want to get sued for doing something wrong. He wants to do the best he can do. 
1	THEY DO SEEM TO CARE FOR YOU BUT SOMETIMES IT BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU NEED A QUICK APPOINTMENT BUT THEY ARE TOO BUSY TO SEE YOU IMMEDIATELY BUT MUST WAIT FOR A LATTER APPOINTMENT 
1	I have a doctor that actually cares about people. The entire practice cares about doing what's best for the patient and not what's going to be the most profitable or the easiest option.
-1	I tend to trust those that have done no wrong to me and act in my best interest which is why I trust my physician.
-1	I don't always feel they are devoting enough time and attention to my problems. Initial courses of treatment don't always work, then they ask more questions. They jump to easy conclusions.
-1	I trust doctos sometimes . sometimes I feel like they don't know what they're doing and prescribes just anything
-1	Well it depends. Some doctors only group their patients in a certain category. They do not praise when the patient does well and cannot recognize the patients who are compliant 
-1	I feel like I have a bond with my doctor and i feel as if he has my best interest at heart. I trust his decisions when it comes to my health.
-1	She is a good doc but doesnt always like to do what i feel is right treatment for me. Example. I would like the shot for shingles but she says i am not old enough. I also want the pheunemenacocal shot she wont give it. I am almost 51 and want prtected before i get sick
1	i just trust my doctor ho when to school and I know she care about her patients. She work for her patients and not just for the paid.
-1	I trust my doctor, because she takes time with me, making sure everything g is OK..I trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable
1	I always trust my doctor unless I have a gut feeling that's something is really wrong with me then I will go get a second doctor to look at me
1	I have been going to the same physician for many years, and have built a great deal of trust with her.  She understands me and my health history and needs.  
-1	i do not feel a sense of closeness to my doctor that i would like to feel.  Sometimes he does not seem like he really listens and understands me
1	My primary doctor has been my doctor for almost 10 years. She is the most caring, loving and thoughtful doctor I have encountered. 
-1	I recently switched from my pediatrician to a regular doctor and the general exam was less thorough. I felt that I could say anything and he didn't seem to care.
1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR HE HAS BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR US FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS ALWAYS LED US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH THOROUGH AND EXCELLENT MEDICAL CARE
1	I trust him hes a good man. Very funny. Spends a good amount of time with me. And my health benefits.
1	My primary care person is a local Nurse Practitioner.  She is busy but never seems rushed while visiting with me about my concerns.  She listens and then asks questions to be sure she understands.  She explains the reason she will chose a certain treatment or why she's choosing to wait and see rather than treat right away.  I like that she doesn't talk down to me and treats me as though I am intelligent enough to understand.
-1	they don't really know much more than i do and they treat us all like commodities if they see one condition in one person and the same condition in another person they treat it like the same thing but it is not they are just humans.
1	I have had the same doctor for 9 years and he has been nothing but a profession al and friend. He always diagnoses my correctly and prescribes the correct medicine. 
1	The doctors I've gone to are usually right. They've never given any reason for me to not trust them, and they've always been honest with me, even if I didn't want to hear it.
-1	My primary care doctor always tells me the truth. They also always tell me how to help fix things and if I am on track and doing well. I always listen to their advice. 
1	I fully trust my PCP because I feel that she is open and allows me to play a large role in my own healthcare. When I discuss my health with her, it is very natural and not uncomfortable. She allows me to make decisions together with her and she always listens to my concerns and opinions.
-1	I have been going to the same office for my whole life, so I feel that the team of physicians there is invested in my family and I. I am comfortable with them and their decisions as a result.
1	Because he is experienced at his profession and also he knows what he is doing and also he knows how to treat his patients 
-1	I somewhat trust my primary care physician because I do not believe he shares with me all the possible solutions to my ailments. Many of the times he prescribes drugs for something that can be healed with more natural substances. I would like to know the full range of my options, from natural to prescribed medications when making a medical decision.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because we went to the same school and he seems like an honest and reasonable guy that I feel that i can relate to. He understands that i have a good knowledge of my health
1	My doctor truly have my best interest at heart. She takes her time to explain everything. She goes over & beyond.
-1	My doctor usually rushes through, spends bare minimal time with me.  He makes me feel like I don't know my own body. He usually tries to push his opinions on me. 
-1	I used to trust my doctor until last summer.  I took my son to see the Dr. and he said he just has an infection take these pills and get some rest.  I trusted my gut and took my son to the ER and found out that he was a type 1 diabetic and he almost died because the doctor did not diagnose him properly, he spent a week in the hospital recovering.
-1	I have nothing to say. I like my doctor. They help me more than not. I really don't have much more to say about it.
1	I simply trust my doctor, because every time I needed to go to him, he was very clear and helpful about what ever the situation is. My doctor has been in his practice for over 20 years and he is very knowledgeable about his practice. 
1	She has been my physician for many years and has always looked out for my best interests. I have full confidence.
-1	i trust them. But no one is perfect so its best to do your own research as well as get a doctors opinion.
-1	well, I need trust of doctor due to better criteria about some item or procedures about healt. then I feel good with this
-1	I do not trust doctors because I have no reason to trust them. They are doctors because they went to school and got a degree. I trust myself much more.
-1	I dont feel like my doctor wants to talk for too long. Just that they think everything is ok or not. They do provide options for allergies though.
-1	I trust my pcp because she always take time to make sure I understand and really explains all my options and possible outcomes. 
1	I have a relatively young doctor, who is usually very thorough, and very plain-spoken. I respect and appreciate these qualities, and he's never given me reason to doubt him.
-1	I trust him because I have been with him for so long. I know he is looking for my best interest.
-1	i don't trust a doctor that won't directly answer my questions.  i don't trust a doctor that wants my money more than he wants to help me.
-1	You just go to have Faith in the medical profession. What would be the point in going to see a Doctor if you don't take their advice.
-1	I trust my doctor i have been with her over 20 years and i feel they want you to feel better, if you talk to them and tell then what is wrong they will help you 
-1	I feel that my doctor looks out for my best interests. She gives me advice when I ask . Tells me what I need to do to feel better .
1	I trust my primary care physician because he listens to me and asks questions. He looks at my chart and asks me follow up questions regarding ongoing medical issues. My previous physicians were already writing prescriptions before I finished talking to them and did not bother to look at my file before meeting with me.
1	My physician does a great job of explaining things carefully and thoughtfully. He also believes in getting a second opinion when needed.
1	She has entered in to a relationship with me with goal setting and holding me accountable, she's not just passive.
-1	Doctors are human, they are arrogant and used to getting their own way, they are inclined to listen to the powers that be instead of to their patients, and they are often lapdogs for the pharmaceutical industry.
-1	It is not that I mistrust my doctor but I do need let him make all my decisions for me.   If they prescribe me a medication I research it thoroughly before I decide to take it or not.    I am more in favor of hollistic medicine so I always look for a natural way to help my problem.   Medical doctors only want to give you more pills and I am afraid of the side effects so sometimes I do not take them and seek   a natural way of treating my problem
-1	Somties we must make hard decisions and know what is best for our health and i dont think a physician has all the awnsers
-1	I like my doctor to take their time and sometimes that doesn't happen.  But, she does what she can.  She answers questions and perscribes what is needed.  
-1	I don't really feel either, i don't know them enough but they do help if i need it.  they can guide me but don't just give me all the answers, and they have ok ratings.
-1	i trust my primary care because she always is there for me and helps me and has given me no reason not to trust her 
-1	I don't know how you feel better soon to be the best for you and your mom is the best ot your life for the rest is just the way I can see the point in time for me today 
1	I have had doctors I did not trust, and quickly sought a new doctor. To me, it is one of the most important decisions a person can make. I need to feel they are thorough, caring, and aren't just passing over any concerns I have. If I am unhappy with a doctor, I have no problem asking to see a different one. The one I have now is very caring, compassiote, and listens, even if the appointment takes  a little longer than expected.
-1	I distrust my doctor because I feel that I'm just a check to them. I sometimes leave feeling that nothing had been accomplished by my visit and that my suggested treatment was the most convenient for them. I've also been misdiagnosed at least once to my knowledge.
1	My doctor has my best interest at heart and through what i have encountered this past year my doctor has showed consistently over and over that there is care and concern 
-1	I trust my primary care doctor. I have had good experiences with her so far. On the other hand I have only seen her a couple of times.
1	I do trust my primary care physician. Mainly because she takes the time to listen to what I have to say. And responds to me as if I'm a friend and not a medical record number.
1	we just meet two months ago and he has gotten upon all my medical needs.He knows all my medicatios and what test are need in such a short time.
1	I trust my doctor b/c when I first started seeing her I was a mess and she ran labs on me and found a ton of my problems and worked hard to fix all the problems and every 6 months she runs labs on me to make sure all are in the level they need to be.
1	in the end she usually is right. if I did not trust her I would get a new doctor. so far I have no reason not to trust her.
-1	I trust them because they help me wnrx never gave me a reason not to trust them on anything and yes I just trust them and their kindness and there will to help me in my problems
-1	My doctor seems to take a genuine interest in me and my concerns.  She spends time with me and answers all of my questions in a way that I can understand.  
1	I trust my doctor because he always asks me if i understand or if i have any questions he is always following up with me and he is really nice
1	My primary care physician has been very effective in treating my present health issues to such an extent that my condition has greatly improved in a remarkably short period of time. Of course, I played a role in following the instructions; it is, after all, a cooperative effort. Her guidance and approach has been first rate.
-1	My doctor seems knowledgeable and has gained my trust over the years. My doctor is personable and likeable. I've also verified a lot of his/her comments using the internet, books and other personal research.
-1	I trust my physician to be analyzing any potential issues and recommending appropriate and safe treatments for me in order to recover.
1	I've been going to the same doctor about 15 years now - if I don't trust her I wouldn't Be going to her.  She's  very understandable when it comes to my needs and knows what best for me.
-1	The do not listen. My issues are important and they do not take them serious. It is annoying.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician anymore. I don't really get sick. I just kinda play things by ear and go from there.
-1	all things in the end are based on the insurance you have or do not have and where you can go to get the care you need
-1	I trust my primary physician because he listens to me when I tell him something and he gives me different options to choose from for my treatment. If I have a problem with the treatment I can always notify him and he will recommend something other treatment.
-1	Northface Raincoat and I appreciate every th8 mg tablets 5th 5th the actual number is not opening the door or answering my 6th and get blocked in the actual world of outlaws and get blocked in the actual world of outlaws 
-1	You never really know when to trust doctors... There's the whole profit motive thing these days. A lot of them are basically drug pushers for big pharma.
-1	I love my physician. He makes sure I understand everything that is going on with my health. He ask me if I have any questions, and I say no
-1	She's always been helpful and willing to explain things to me. I haven't run into any issues as of yet
-1	I do trust my PCP.
-1	I believe that the process for becoming a doctor is a long and arduous one.  This makes it a profession in which a larger percentage of the individuals in it are truly committed to their practice.  Being a doctor is an extremely important job and I think the majority of doctors in it truly want what is best for the patient.
1	I have been seeing him for many years he treats my children and spouse as well so we have discuses many things over the years and I am comfortable with him.
1	My doctor is completely honest with me whenever I had an appointment. He tells me exactly what is wrong and the possibles outcomes of it, as well as the aproaches I can take.
-1	I believe his heart is in the right place, but he makes sp judgements regarding care. Sometimes he says one thing then does something else, or doesn't do what he said he would do. Medical science is often wrong regarding treatments and doctors in general are too busy to keep up with the latest changes.
-1	I find that often doctors just do whatever is needed for them to get from patient to patient (take as little time as needed) and sometimes just don't listen to what their patient is saying to them.  I can understand their busy schedule but sometimes the care doesn't seem persol, just rushed.
-1	Doctors in general seem to be more jaded with their profession. They seem more concerned with simply medicating and moving patients along rather than spending time to determine what the best course of action is. I have seen it with a lot of doctors as well as vets for animals. It could be because there is an increased number of cases that they process, I'm not sure. But it's alarming.
1	I have had the same Dr. for a lot of years .He is alwys nice ,explains everything in detail for me .He is very kind and thoughtful.
1	I trust my primary care physician primarily because he has always taken the time to listen to me when I have had health concerns and discussed treatment options and recommendations with me. He discovered that I had a heart condition when I was 40 that I had all my life, and he sent me to a cardiologist,who was impressed that the doctor say it on my EKG. He has been careful about prescribing drugs unnecessarily, but prescribes medicine as he feels necessary. He even takes time to answer health questions I have when I am with another family member for an appointment. 
-1	"I have served in a medical sales capacity for more than 10 years and have seen doctors who recommend and even require certain patient services that will benefit them financially although they may not be the most medically necessary or advantageous service.  Medicine has become a ""business"" more than it used to be and managed care does not always allow the doctor to provide the best care, rather what is allowed."
-1	I have been seeing my dr for a long time and she knows me pretty well.
-1	I don't completely trust my primary care physician because I think he is mostly in it for the money.  He knows that I am very limited financially, yet he insists that I make an appointment to see him for any prescription refills, even if I just saw him two days before.  He routinely prescribes the most expensive drugs, knowing that I can't afford them.  On top of that, his office routinely charges me double what my co-pay is supposed to be.  
1	My primary care physician has been my doctor since I was born. He always was my mom, and cousin's doctor.
1	I don't have. A primary care physician. But previous ones have been very trustworthy and have my best interest in mind
-1	I trust my doctors for the most part. I don't however completely trust medical science or drug manufacturers. Medical science just doesn't seem to have all the answers where many diseases are concerned and drug manufacturers seem to be more interested in profits than life.
1	Because I've been seeing him for years now and he's a very honest doctor who treats you more like a friend he truly cares about rather than just another patient. He sincerely cares about me, my health and my needs and does all he can to help make me feel calm and safe and also optimistic about whatever health issue I'm facing. I've had zero issues with him over the years and despite being terrified of going to the doctor and hopsitals, I still have trust in him because he's never done me wrong. He looks out for my best interests and is one of the best, in my opinion. 
1	I have seen my primary physician for many years and i have established a long enough relationship with them to trust their input
1	My doctor takes time to listen to me and takes time to explain things to me. He us very caring and very through 
-1	In general, doctors aren't perfect, they all make mistakes or misinterpret something on occasion.  In regards to treatments, they may have motivations other than your health, like earning more income or arrangement with a pharmaceutical company to promote a certain product.
1	I trust my doctorsâ because they know how to take care of me, take care of my needs and give me the right medicines and care.
-1	I feel like sometimes my doctor does things that i don't like and I wish they would come to me and go over it with me more.
-1	I just had my first appointment with my new provider so I don't know him well, but he was very thorough and organized, however when I told him my L4 dermatome below my knee was numb he googled it with me and as he was doing so said he didn't think that was the L4 dermatome. It was. Then he googled a few conditions in front of me and suggested I might have diabetes. I live a pretty healthy active lifestyle and have no other symptoms, and diabetes numbness usually starts in hands and feet and is tingly or painful. I am on a soccer team of physical therapists and they all checked me out and said it was likely a contusion or compression. My sister checked me out and said the same thing. I asked about diabetes and they all thought that was ridiculous. Why was he googling so many things in our appointment? Just say you're not sure, I don't expect you to know everything, but making things up, reaching, or googling diagnoses (which I already did more effectively, not webmd nonsense) doesn't instill confidence. But he seemed like he genuinely wanted me to leave feeling taken care of, and that's more than a lot of doctors.
1	I trust my doctor a lot. She spends a lot of time with me at my appointments and is never rushed. She listens and offers good advice when I bring up issues such as my living situation which might be affecting my health, like living with second hand smoke.
1	i trust my doctor totally.......when he prescribes a new med or feels i need test done.......i discuss with good friends and they all agree with his treatment.
-1	Its not so much a matter of Trust or Mistrust.  It's not black and white like that.  Its about enhancing and verifying information.  Just because I verify a doctors findings through my own research doesn't mean I do not trust them.  I'm um....Intuitive.
1	I trust my doctor because she explains things thoroughly to me.  We have a good relationship for 15 years.  When I have something that others feel is trivial she listens to me and we discussed.  
-1	he knows what is best for me  they care about what happens to people because of their health. Doctors care I believe
1	Trusting one's doctor is based on years of  patronising the Hospital, and sometimes Customer trust the physician just because they are certified doctor.
1	My doctor is extremely familiar with my worries, feelings of helplessness at times and he provides enough time to listen to my concerns. He is very empathetic. 
-1	I trust my doctor knows what she's doing and that we can have an open discussion.  But I usually go to my appointments armed with my latest research so I'm prepared for the visit 
1	I've known my doctor for 25 years and I see us more as friends than a doctor-patient relationship.
-1	I have switched doctors until I have found one I trust.  Prior to that I truly felt as though the Drs wanted to make money on procedures and medications.  I felt as though they pushed the same things and it was for a monetary reason.  Currently my Drs really listen and I am involved with my health care choices.
-1	I think that doctors have lots of time constraints so they tend to limit the appropriate amount of time necessary for their patients 
-1	that what they are there for give us the best advice regarding our health and mental wealth that's what they studied for
1	I trust my primary care physician as they have been the primary for my entire life, he's a great doctor who is very understanding and always willing to listen and pitch multiple ways of dealing with whatever is ailing me. 
-1	Although doctors have to function in quick way due to overwhelming amounts of daily patients, it is unlikely that they have any bad intentions in mind. In my persol experience my doctor has always been honest and upfront with treatments and diagnosis.
-1	I've started to distrust her as of late. She seems more interested in just refilling my prescriptions and getting me out the door than actually helping me solve my problems. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician for a few reasons. For one he is an excellent listener. I often over think or over worry and he puts up with it. He offers a variety of medical options when issues arise and he is always knowledgeable on these options. This makes me trust the he is making informed choices for my health.
-1	i respect them because they help me alot concerning my health.they  do tell me reality whenever i visit them and they give me advices about coping with life experiences. through them,i have a sense of belonging even when i tend to feel that my life is meaningless
1	I have been going to the same Doctor for 20+ years I have total trust in him he has always helped me whenever needed
-1	i have been misdiagonsied in the past and have changed dr because of this i also have had bad experiences when i knew i was sick and they refuse to treat me untill i have almost be hospitalized. I really feel that they don't know there pt and really just treat u like a number and a bill
-1	He seems to know what he is talking about when it comes to my health. He does take the time to ask questions and does a thorough checkup. What I find that frustrates me is he never calls back and it is hard to get an appointment.
-1	I trust them because i know them and they know me well. I dont really have any distrust for him and overall i dont see why i would with anyone else.
1	I like my PCP a lot. He is patient, thoughtful, and always listens. He is also very willing to utilize care that is more holistic. If I tell him that I'm confused or uncomfortable with a potential medication or treatment, he listens and is willing to explore and consider altertives.
-1	When a doctor shows interest in what I have to say and gives advices relevant to my needs, it helps build trust.
1	I trust my primary physician because I take the time to ask them questions and gauge their answer.  If they do not seem to speak as if they have my needs in their consideration, I switch physicians.
1	he-she has my general helth and well benning in mind so I have to trust that what do for me will be the right thing for me 
-1	I trust that my doctor is doing the best he can. I think he is rushed and overworked though and perhaps could just miss things in haste. 
1	I just my doctor due to the fact that any concerns I have had she would always look into it with all her testing to get to the source of the problems even if it took a second opinion from a specialist she would take it a step up. Also because once my doctor has results the treatment that would be given would actually help with whatever was my concern so that's why I trust because I see good outcomes. 
1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR VERY MUCH - I KNOW THAT THE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE PRESCRIBED FOR ME HELP ME.  I KNOW THAT MY DOCTOR TAKES THE TIME TO GO OVER MY HEALTH ISSUES AND PROBLEMS.
-1	Cause they take good care of me and I trust my primary doctor  because she great and honestly I just love my doctor she great 
-1	I distrust physicians because the way the medical system is set up isn't about quality of care. The way the medical system is set up is to push as many patients through as quickly as possible. Once we start incentivizing quality care; then my trust in physicians will rise.
1	I have total trust in my primary care physician because he did extensive test during my first visit and was able to make diagnosis that other Doctors had not been able to make. They did not do any of the test that the Doctor I have now performed. That is why I have full confidence in the Doctor that I have now. 
1	I guess if I had to think about it, I would have a hard time coming up with a reason not to trust my primary care physician. I have been seeing him since I stopped seeing my pediatric doctor when I was a teen. He has never led me wrong or given me trouble about my prescriptions when I needed to get them filled. I also see a psychiatrist for anxiety and he provides me with the medicine needed to treat my panic disorder. I have been seeing him for over a decade and by now I only need to see him for a quick appointment once every three months because he knows me so well.
-1	I feel as if my concerns are not addressed by my doctor.  I feel he is too busy with too many patients and will tell me one thing in one phone call and a week later will forget his direction to me or forget what we discussed or what my initial concern was about in the first place.  He isn't a problem solver for me but rather he dismisses my concerns and makes me feel unimportant.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been our family doctor for years, and considering my other family members are still alive he must be doing something right.
1	i trust him because he is a very smart individual.  Nearly everything he  does for me or recommends seem to work out for the better.; weather its advice or prescribing medication for me.
1	I trust my doctor because who else can I trust.  It leaves me no choice but to trust my doctor.  I can always decide later whether I believe it's a good advice or not.  
1	My family has used our primary care doctor for many years and he has always done a great job in treating us.  He has never given us any reason to feel like he doesn't have our best care as a priority and for that we have complete faith and trust in him.  He's never done us wrong.
-1	I feel that doctors are generally trustworthy. As human beings, they do have biases, and they do make mistakes, so it's important for patients to educate themselves, ask questions, and so on, but on average I feel people in the medical profession can be trusted to know how to do their jobs.
1	I have been with my doctor for many years; we trust each other and work well together, also have mutual respect
1	I've been going to the same doctor my entire life and he's always been a great help in helping diagnose and eliminate the various viruses, infections, and flues that I caught throughout in my life. I've had no reason to not trust him for the entirety of my life. So, ever since I was a child, I've learned to trust my doctor.
-1	She listens to me and she is always available to answer question or to find the answers for me that she may not know.  
1	I have been going to my primary doctor for over 27 years and my mother went before me.  He works with a team of doctors from UPMC so that all of my doctors are aware of what is going on with me and develop a plan to figure out what is best for me.  
1	I trust my doctor because she is open honest by telling me both the good and the bad in all thongs we discuss about my health. 
1	"Because my primary doctor sent me to a specialist, I have a second opinion that concurs with her conclusions and course of treatment so I trust my doctor.  When she isn't sure, she sends me to a specialist--she doesn't guess or ""wing it"".  She has lab tests performed routinely and bases decisions upon data."
1	I trust her implicitly. She is thorough, asks questions, actually listens to my answers and answers my questions. She is friendly,  seems really interested in me.
-1	I know that doctors are busy and cannot know the details of every case. So asking questions to get more information can help. I don't think it is intentional, just impossible to have another person who rarely sees me to know what will be best for my life in some situations. 
-1	I  LIKED THE PRIMARY ATTENTION OF MY DOCTOR BECAUSE IS GOD, THE INFORMATION THE HE LET ME KNOW IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND
-1	My primary health care told me not to read the inserts that come in your medicine telling you about side effects, they were for lawyers only
-1	I trust them because they work relly hard to help us. Troughout time, we pay many pateientsd to help us really much. I love it. Going tot he stoer
-1	I trust my physician to a degree.  However, she tends to send me out to specialists a lot...which makes me wonder how much she is really able to treat.  If I have a cough, sniffle or fever, she's fine.  If it goes beyond that....hmmmmm.
-1	I think doctors miss a lot of things because they are trained to treat the symptoms and not the causes. They don't often trust that people know their own bodies.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he listens to what I have to say and thoroughly explains whatever I do not understand. I trust his opinion and I feel like he cares about me as a patient.
-1	Reasons I trust doctors would be because they have more knowledge and experience in the medical field as well as medical problems. Reasons I distrust doctors, would be because sometimes they want to just prescribe medication instead of getting to the root cause of a medical condition.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he explains to me exactly what is going on and gives me his best medical advice 
-1	I have developed a great deal of trust in him over the many years I have been seeing him. My father recommended my doctor and because my father is a physician , that made me trust him right away. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because they always tell me the right things and steer me in the right  direction, they never tell me anything wrong.
-1	Cause sometime they can be wrong about  some stuff about you if yoy go to anthor place it different resulr
1	m\My primary care doctor has been seeing my family for many years. he always makes time to call and check in if one of us is very ill and makes us feel like he is doing his best to put our health first 
1	My doctor always takes the time to talk with me through things versus telling me what they want me to do.  Their suggestions are always things that would be considered safer than just prescribing something that would make them have more money.
-1	Pt was also educated about the importance of compliance with psychiatric treatment and need for regular follow ups to check on response to meds and seems to understand the same. She was also educated about the importance of abstinence from illegal and intoxicating drugs, like alcohol. Consider addition of Lamictal vs abilify in the future. F/up in 2 week, get records, safety plan discussed.
1	I believe they are legally required to tell the truth, based on the information they are given. If I truly didn't trust the doctor on something I would go to another doctor and see if they have the same conclusion.
-1	Established patient for many years.  Doctor also has a good reputation in the community.  Primary care physician for all of my immediate family members as well as my siblings and their families.
-1	My doctor is rather trustworthy. He makes sure everything I came in about is checked and will answer questions and run relevant tests if he sees necessary
1	relevancy to good things. I can belive in only good things happening to me and nothing bad. if I follow the door's instructions mostly good things can happen.
-1	for the most part I trust some of my doctors.  I don't have a primary care physician but I have other doctors I see regularly.
-1	My primary care doctor gives me options to different medical situations; if she feels I need to see a particular type of specialist for my condition, then she refers me to one.
1	My doctor ask a lot of question and does a good job in knowing what is wrong with me or if something is going on.  Never in a hurry.  Goes over info with me.
1	I feel that my primary care physician always listens to me so this has helped build up my trust over the years.  I have always felt she has taken the best path for my medical needs.
-1	My physician sometimes waffles or backtracks, which causes me to suspect her judgment on occasion. She has more than once recommended a certain treatment and then at a follow-up exam, has made statements about the treatment which caused me to wonder whether she actually believed in it or not. I do realize that doctors are just people, and sometimes not even terribly intelligent or competent, so I've trained myself to expect not quite so much from them as others may. 
1	I trust my physician because they were the one able to get certain medical conditions under control while previous doctors have not. I have gotten better while under their care.
-1	I think my doctor is very good but sometimes doesn't have complete understanding of my medical conditions.
1	She makes me feel completely comfortable and she listens. She explains everything to me and answers any and all questions I may have.
1	My primary care physician has been giving me care for many years. He is a family friend and has always been competent and attentive to my needs as a patient. 
-1	I canât say that I have complete trust in my doctor. I know my doctor cares to talk me through my concerns and issues but there have been times that I have felt that my doctor was not as talkative or seemed to be in a hurry more than other times. My doctor has at times discussed different things to try for me and told me the good and bad about the treatments and Iâve never felt that she tried to push anything on me just explaining the benefits and so forth and let me take it from there.
1	I trust my doctor as I have been seeing her for many years now.
1	I have had my primary care dr for many years. I know he is a very good man who does his best to help me. He knows a lot about different things. He knows my history. He spends the time to listen to me. I still make my own decisions about things, but I really do trust him a lot. 
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for 15 years.  Over this time I have built trust in his diagnosis and treatment options.
1	My doctor is pretty good at giving me all of the options and making sure that I am doing what I want, for the most part. There are rare times when they are busy and ther just isn't time and they tell me to just do something and I trust they are doing what is best and know better than myself. 
-1	My personal physician doesn't spend enough time durong y visit understanding my concerns. She abrupt and unprofessional
-1	The only reason I go to my doctor for a yearly wellness check up is because I have to in order to have my prescription birth control refilled. I don't particularly like my doctor and sometimes I feel like she doesn't know what she's talking about.
-1	My Dr. doesn't isten . He just gets in and out as fast as he can. I don't think he even really cares I am just more money to him. Ireally get upset. I wish he would take more time to pinpoint what is going on.
-1	My primary care physician has changed often lately, so this is more about physicians in general.  For the most part, I trust their decisions:  they are trained professionals with a lot of experience in their jobs, and many are also active research scientists.  However, they do have some pressure put on them by drug sales representatives to recommend one product over another, and I think that there is a possibility of their judgment being distorted by drug and other medical product marketing techniques.
-1	Doctors are people too, typically I believe they are trustworthy and what they say is knowledgeable but they can still have areas where they do not know much about, like nutrition. Also, doctors are heavily lobbied by pharmacy reps to peddle their product.
-1	She put me on a medication and took me off another cold turkey and I developed serotonin syndrome which has completely turned my life upside down.
1	I trust my doctor due to honesty, making decision about the best treatment for me, and extremely thorough as well as being careful.
-1	I mostly trust my PCP. The only bad thing is I feel rushed. Which also makes me feel like she doesn't care. But she does try to find me help through other doctors or whatever is wrong with me. She does ask me questions that I don't even think to ask her. She seems to want to cure me quickly .
-1	I trust my primary physician because I think he gives me the best advice for my condition. Sometimes he gives me general information that I don't think is best applied to me. I usually would tell him and he would suggest something different.
-1	hes old school and knowledgeable.  tells it straight and doesn't lecture. been helpful and clear in explanations.
-1	i trust my doctor because he always correctly diagnoses me. He expresses to me the benefits and risks when starting new medications.
-1	I trust my doctor because they are suppose to have my best interest at hand. They are all that I have to trust when it comes to my health.
-1	i have been with my family doctor  for years he knows our family history and has been in practice for twenty years  
-1	I trust that my primary care physician makes good choices and care about me. He is very knowledgeable about his expertise and always very patient to answer my questions. He will analysis different options to me and don't pressure me to make a choice he preferred.
-1	Im not soley untrustworthy of doctors however mesicine in my opinion has stiffled the body from self healing medicinal alternatives also doctors are worry about money more than patient and thats a concern of mines
1	I rarely go to the doctor because I am in excellent health. when I do have to go, I feel that the doctors that have been assigned to me always take good care of me and don't let me leave not knowing what is going on with my health or if there are any health concerns. this in turn gives me the optimistic and trustworthiness of my doctors that I can go into a health care facility and not have any regrets. I don't feel that the doctors at any time are looking more for convenience for them, than my actual health.
1	I trust my doctor to give me the medical knowledge I need to mage my life the correct way.  I've never had a doctor who is so willing and able to take the time to listen.  They block out time for each patient.
1	I trust my doctor because i've built a relationship with them over a number of years. We have open communication regarding any health issues i may have. We talk about those issues openly and at length. I never feel like i'm being rushed out the door. I never wait for a long period of time in the waiting room. I'm given ample resources in order to understand and educate myself. 
-1	I do not trust my primary care physician for many different reasons. First off, I believe he prescribes medication for even the smallest symptoms. This is usually not necessary, and most of the time just gives a financial burden. I also believe that they don't fully check your symptoms to check if it is something more severe, and rather just plays it off like its the flu and that it'll go away after a while. 
1	My physician likes to push different new medications on me instead of worrying about the side effects that I would have in taking these medications. I do get a great deal from my physician in the way of ordering test and sharing about my disease. I wish that my physician cared about my daily issues and not so much about the different medications they want me to try. My doctor comes off as a drug pusher at times. I also feel as if my doctor is always in a rush and that makes me lose my concentration.
1	I trust him because he listens to what is going on and if he can't figure something out, he will direct me to someone who will and will provide a referral with no problem.
-1	I trust the doctors because they know more about the health systems than I do this is why I trust my primary care person 
-1	I generally trust them, and believe they would consciously act in my best interest but at the same I acknowledge they may be overworked, see many cases a day, and may overlook details. 
-1	I trust my Doctor because they've had many years of experience. I trust them because I know nothing in comparison to them. They took an oath to be a Doctor and I have to rely on that for their honesty.
1	I trust my doctor because I do believe he wants to do what's best for me and really help me. I think that they always wanna do the best thing they can for their patients. They are their to help, and that's what they really try to do, in my opinion. 
1	I think doctors tend to want what is best for their patients. If I ask enough questions and understand things correctly then I can get a sense of the diagnosis. 
-1	Doctor has seen me and my family through loss, illness and family ifficulties. He has always weighed the options to get us any help or medications we have needed
-1	All in all, I feel doctors have good intentions and generally want to help you. I don't have a primary care physician, so I can't tell you anything about that sort of relationship.
1	I've known this doctor for a long time. He's very trustworthy and kind. I believe in him.
1	my doctor has always shown compassion and caring for me. im never rushed 
-1	Doctors do practice nothing is a hundred percent so they can say something that is wrong and we have to pay for it
1	primary care physician is one of the best things that we can do to ensure better care for ourself. This is because we are likely to become more trusting of our doctor as we see one another over the years, so this can lead to better communication, consistent treatment compliance, and regular appointments. For these reasons, it is important to take the time to find a clinic and primary care physician that we trust.
-1	I believe that the doctor is looking out for my best interest.  However, I also feel as though he is trying to make money with as little work as possible.
-1	I trust my doctor because I do not really have a better option. If I am sick I have to go and visit him hoping that he can figure it out how to get better. But on the other hand health care system is lead by money so it all comes to the end where it is about our pocket. If everyone would be healthy then hospitals, health care providers, doctors etc. would be in a big trouble. No customer means no paycheck. So till a certain extent they must have patients. Health care system does not create cure. It creates consumers.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he is patient with me, listens to all I have to say and consults with me regarding his decisions.  He has very well trained office staff that provide excellent services.
-1	I feel as though doctors sometimes see too many people to really be able to focus on one person care. Also they can't know everything about each individual.
1	i trust my doctor  they know what they  are doing most doctor u can trust and u can relie  on them for medicial needs
-1	"My primary care doctor is fairly new. She has a new practice and I just signed up for treatment. However, she has not given me any reason to distrust her. For the most part, my trust is rated at ""neutral"" because I just don't have enough experience with her."
1	Whenever I have had a question about my care, my doctor has always been forthcoming and honest about potential treatment plans and side-effects to prescribed medication.  
1	She makes sure she has all the current information before making a diagnosis. I am very happy with my doctor.
-1	I have been misled at times and questioned my primary care physician's thoroughness and motivation. I still trust them, but would be cautious in not seeking out a second opinion in certain situations.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have only had good experiences with them and they always seem to have my best interest in mind. The times that I have had to be given medicine they seem to do a great job of telling me all of the options possible to me and talk with me about the pros and cons of each one. They also seem to be aware of small details that show they have an interest in me. 
1	I trust my doctors because I feel their goal is to keep me as healthy as possible. Their advice that they give me is the best that is for me in that particular situation, not the best for them.
-1	People can have favorites, flavors, ideas and treatments. So someone can easily get into the routine of recommending a favorite treatments. Also, people can be out of date in their ideas. 
-1	In general i trust my physician. It's not because I don't trust her that I don't tell her everything, it's because I worry about her thinking I'm being silly and a waste of time.
-1	always spend as much time with me that I need and answers all of my questions as far as my medical conditions
-1	I mostly trust my doctor but I also know that sometimes doctors have other interests in mind. Example, if a new drug has come out and insurance will give the doctor a bonus for each patient who prescribes to said medicine for a certain medical condition, the doctor may persuade you try it if it pertains to your treatment even if it's not the best course of action for you 
1	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind at all times. I don't feel that I have ever experienced health care that had other intentions at heart. 
1	"I am a ""Type 2 Diabetic"". I know that my doctor must get frustrated when my A1C count is high. He does not give up on me for not trying my best to control it. He still gives me advice on how to eat, exercise, and not give up. "
-1	"I believe that many doctors rush through exams in order to get to their next patient and end their day and go home. this is not true of ALL doctors of course, but a great many I am sure it's true. I trust my doctor to see the glaring issues that are wrong and to suggest treatment for those, however, I would greatly push for more testing or ask more questions if I feel they don't ""get"" what I'm there for or if they seem to brush it off. Bottom line is that you need to be an advocate for yourself because these doctors see so many patients, they do not care on a personal level. You have to force them to see you as human and not a number in an office."
-1	I do trust my primary care physician basically because she has never given me a reason not to trust her.  I think she is kind and caring, and she has never misled me in the past.  She has been helpful any time I have gone to see her. 
1	Now he take care of me talk too me and tell me what I need too know About my health it is a good thing my doctor is great give me the things I need too know.
-1	In general, doctors do not spend enough time with patients to get the WHOLE story, and sometimes a little tidbit of information that the patient might not seem to think is pertinent can make a diagnosis or a more appropriate treatment.
-1	I have been seeing my doctor for several years and have established a trust and confidence in his ability and diagnosis
1	He is always very frank about any health issue he has to address with me. He is kind,considerate and professional.
-1	In general, I trust doctors as they have a tremendous amount of experience, but they are also sometimes rrow in their views of what types of remedies work. So, I trust but reserve my right to question things.
1	my Dr. is like my best friend offers time and thorouhgness.i can ask or tell my Dr. anything. she has much patience and dose not rush me.
-1	My doctor takes time to talk with me and answer all my questions. There is also time to discuss all options thoroughly to gain the clearest picture.
1	My Doctor has not given me a reason not to trust them. When I go into the office I feel like I am always well cared for and that my doctor genuinely cares about my health. 
-1	yes i love my primary care physician and my insurance through my company it helps keep my health together
-1	Most doctors care more about cost than patient care.
-1	I don't have complete trust in my doctor - but I would say I trust most of what they say. I am not too big on vaccines anymore, although my daughter does get them as a safety precaution. I don't always trust the meds I am given because sometimes if I suggest something the doctor has said no out of spite. And then a few months later we try the medication I originally suggested and it works great (I am mostly talking about psychiatry there - psychiatry/psychology is a hobby of mine, luckily I have a great psych doctor now!)
-1	I trust my doctor they went to school to learn this stuff so I would hope they know exactly what they are telling me and what medicine they are giving me
1	She is honest and is down to earth. She has my well being has her first priority and she is very thorough
-1	I mentioned my extreme anxiety and how i just couldn't relax no matter what I tried. She told me that I just needed to walk out in the sun everyday and completely cut out caffeine and I'll be cured. She did blood work for my hypothyroidism and did a cholesterol test with it. The test came back I had high cholesterol and she put me on a medication they just called into the pharmacy and she didn't talk to me about anything. Just told me to take the pill.
1	i trust my doctor to give me good advice on all of medical needs and provide good advice on my meds and good advice on my other medical needs
-1	Although I'm sure he gives great information, I have a feeling that most doctors as well as my own throw out information in order to benefit themselves. Better feedback means more clients, etc. I feel like most solutions to my problems are a bit forced and not genuine.
-1	I mostly trust my primary provider. I feel that she has my best interests in mind and provides good care. However, I wouldn't fully trust any single human with serious health decisions. I have a need to research things myself, and even though I know my doctor is a good one, she's human, and we all make mistakes. 
-1	well i should trust the person that went to study to become a doctor and they should know what they are doing honestly or they are in the wrong field
1	My doctor has known me since I was young and knows my entire medical history. He always takes the time to go over my symptoms and questions with me.
-1	For the most part, I trust my doctor and her looking out for my best interests. I tend to not fully trust anyone and always think there's a possibility for alterior motives, but for the most part, I trust my doctor's advice.
1	My primary care physician is thorough and never overlooks so she has ample time to spend with her patients. 
-1	One, as a physician I have seen many physicians make mistakes.  I have trained myself to be objective and results oriented (preferring clinical studies to opinion)..  I have also been privy to compassionate and caring physicians and those who are less so.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She is trustworthy and knows what she is doing most of the time of my visits
-1	My doctor has achieved a medical doctrine, that took years to get. I have to trust him to a certain point. Honesty if I have doubts then that's when I patronize a different medical establishment. 
-1	He works WITH me and asks me questions and gives me a voice in my care. He used to ask if I was ready to discontinue a certain medication, but when I finally explained why I wanted to continue it, he understood and stopped asking. 
-1	I always find that my primary care physician is too busy to give me the time I need. I have gone to appointments countless times and left feeling like I really didn't solve my issues. Sometimes, I even feel that they get annoyed if i ask too many questions and keep them in the room for too long.
1	I feel as though i trust my primary physician because she ecplains things to me so i can understand and she always allows me to ask as many questions as i would like. And if i ask her to test me gor something she does it.
-1	I trust to a point. Aslso as stated he may opt for expedience and convenience whcih may compromise the outcome and care.   its a mix
-1	I have had issues with doctors prescribing medication that has harmed me while pregnant.  I have a son who has hearing loss due to a medication provided to me while I was pregnant.  I later found out it was not approved for pregnant women.  I also suffered a miscarriage after taking some medication prescribed for a virus from a doctor.  I can't say that it was caused by the medication or the virus, but looking back, I still don't trust that the medication was safe.
1	I trust my primary care physician due to actually taking the time to listen to what I am saying and talking with me about what the right path is for me.
-1	"She answers all of my questions and gives reasons why she is advocating something that I may ""waffle' with.  She listens carefully appearing to see that I as a patient do know myself quite well."
1	I trust my primary care doctor completely. He save my life many years ago and I have never gone to anyone else.
-1	I have just had bad experiences with doctors in the past. I don't want to go into my persol history but sometimes they don't care about patients. 
-1	My last primary care physician wasn't necessarily a bad doctor, but she was pretty busy and quick to get my appointments over with. She even ended up missing key signs of a very serious problem I was having by diagnosing the symptoms as common ailments that had nothing to do with each other though she's not to blame for that (it was a very bizarre chain of events that led to the discovery of my problems). I know she did what she could with what she knew but I think if she spent more time with me in my appointments, maybe she would have seen something different.
-1	For the last several years I have primarily seen a pain management specialist.  I feel like it has been write a prescription rather than deal with the problems. Then when the attitudes began to change about medicating chronic pain patients it became trying to stop giving me medication. At no time have I felt my best interests were served.  I would prefer a more middle of the road approach. 
1	I have a regular physician at the university hospital. I have been seeing him for past few years. So far, I do not have any issues with. During my visit, he is always very professional. He seems to care a lot about patients. He is always polite, kind and caring. He seems very focused during the diagnosis. After careful examination, he has been able to explain my problems in simple words and recommend the proper treatment. He always warns about possible side effects of any prescription.  So, far I have not had any issues with treatment and medicines. That is why I trust my physician very much. 
-1	I trust them because they know a lot about what they are doing and they care about the patients. They have the awareness to know how to take action
-1	My Primary care physician is actually pretty decent. She knows what she is talking about most of the time and is honest when she doesn't. That being said, she has been wrong about a few things, and is not as turally or holistically minded as I would like
-1	I hate doctors.  I feel bad saying that but I find them to be judgy and hypocritical.  Doctors seem to think they know more than they actually do and that can be very problematic...
-1	My doctor is thorough, but he can't know everything. I can't totally trust him or any doctor, knowing that they may not be able to find the answer. 
1	"She has always been correct with her diagnosis.  Most people would rate her low, due to the fact that she takes a lot of time with each patient, so her wait times are in the hours, at times.  However, she is spending quality time, with each patient.  Making sure she doesn't just, ""put a Band-Aid"" as a solution but she tries to find out what is causing the issue.  For example, my husband went in with a bloody nose, she didn't just give him medicine, she spent time with him and did tests to figure out why his nose kept bleeding."
-1	I sometimes trust doctors. There are good and Bad people in everything. Not all people are bad. I feel like they do the best they can to help people 
-1	I do not trust all doctor's . My perception is based on a negative response I had with a doctor some years ago. . I did not like her results and when I went with another opinion with another doctor it turned out that  I did the right thing by doing so, Because my primary doctor was way off on her prognosis.
-1	I mostly trust my primary care physician. She is patient, answers any questions that I have, & seems to suggest the right course of action for me.
-1	I trust my primary care physician although it sometimes hard to understand her. She is not from America. She is Indian.
-1	I mostly trust my PCP, but I do feel like she's a little old.  I think it's worth getting a second opinion when anything serious comes up. However, for general run of the mill problems, I think she's fine. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has been our family doctor for more than 15 years and all his diagnostics and treatments have been accurate. He always gives us advises and we feel that he cares about our well being.
-1	"For the most part I do trust my Dr, but at times I feel like she is rushed. Last time I was there I had told her that I had hurt my back and my chiropractor did a MRI and I found out I had degenerative disc disease. I asked her if she had someone she would refer me to if I needed injections. She acted like it wasn't a big deal and said ""ya, we dot that all the time."" I guess I would have felt better if she had asked to obtain a copy of the MRI (or look to see if she had it, as I gave her name when it was done) and look at the extent of damage and give me some names. I also feel like she doesn't look at previous issues and see if I have had any symptoms relating to those. "
-1	I do trust my primary care physician but I also don't feel like I get very personalized service. I feel as though I get a generalized service saying that I have basically the same issue as other people. 
1	I trust my doctor because thus far i have not been given a reason not to trust her and her expertise. 
-1	I trust my doctor in regards to being thorough with my medical needs but he has hundreds of patients so sometimes it feels like I'm not getting his total attention.
1	My PCP has stood by me through 2 years of complicated medical issues collaborating with a team of doctors to ensure continued progress and diagnosis. He discusses all factors pros and cons with me and takes the time to ensure all factors are discussed. Time is one of the keys.
-1	I wont go back cant go back to the way things use to be today is the day I have to go home and cook dinner for my family and if I don't they will be really mad at me and will not talk to me at all for a week and I will be very sad
1	I trust my doctor because they tell me what I need to hear not what I want to hear.
1	I am able to reach my  physician by e mail or phone and get a reply back in a timely manner if it is needed. They are helpful in keeping any RX's refilled and providing me with the results of my tests along with any recommendations. 
-1	I don't trust ANYONE with my health besides myself.  If there is something I need to know, then I reach out for answers, then go back to caring for myself the way it should be.
1	I have been going to my primary care physician for almost 10 years and have built trust with them. They always offer me advice on the best treatment for my conditions and help me monitor any possible conditions that may arise.
-1	I mostly trust my doctors because they know way more about the medical field than me.  However, doctors can definitely be wrong, which is why I didn't rate the statements above as 5.  Also, there can be some doctors that don't always want what is best for their patient, especially if it would cause too much of an inconvenience to themselves.
1	I have had the same primary care physician for seven years.  We have mutual respect and trust in each other.  My primary care physician is very credible, highly credentialed, and always professional.
1	I think the doctor I have has made several diagnosis that have been correct about me over the years, so because of that I trust him quite a bit. Doctors do seem to minimize the time they see me in the office but I can forgive that since they are very busy.
1	I've never been given a reason to distrust him and I haven't been steered wrong yet so until that happens hes good in my book
-1	I don't have a doctor, or see one regularly, I only go when I have a problem. So I'm just not going to trust some random doctor I've never met before, especially when my money is on the line.
1	I trust both of my doctors, MD and psych. They have a great track record with me and my treatments. I don't know what else to say.
-1	I feel my doctor is easy to talk too understands my health providing the best medications for my health issues
-1	They work very hard throughout their lives to become doctors. I have much faith and trust in them to stick to their oath. 
-1	I do not have a primary care physician. In general, I always like to question my doctor though. Itâs part of my nature.
-1	It's great to have a personal doctor and it was could be the way u can save your life.An they care about u more
-1	This one is hard to answer because my old doctor retired and I now have a new doctor that I've only seen once.  She seems ok, but very different than my previous doctor who was really personable.  She is more professional and not really into have a relationship with her patients.
-1	The doctors I have visited seem like they judge me and I feel as they know something is wrong with me but won't tell me and they always have the same pity look they give me. I don't trust any doctors because I know they just want to get rid of me and they think of me as another patient (another number) in the system.
1	I do not go to the doctor often, and when I do, it's usually a different doctor, so I don't really build trust. That being said, I've had largely very positive experiences with my doctors-- especially psychiatrists. They seem to have my best interests at heart.
-1	I think she is very intelligent and is definitely capable of taking care of my needs. She also makes a point to pay attention to my input about things. 
1	I trust my primary physician, I've had the same doctor since I was a child and they're always very thorough. We often spend quite a bit of time when an issue arises to ensure we're taking the proper steps to rectify the situation.  
-1	I had a procedure done approximately 1 year ago. It could have been done in office with just a numbing shot. Oh no, the doctor wanted me in the OR with a local . I finally talked her into a spinal  just to shut her up. I am still angry and upset over the bill and the doctor not listening to me
1	I trust my doctor to give me the most up to date information concerning my health and well being.She emails me when I need to keep up with my chronic condition appointments concerning my diabetes.I get frequent emails with my lab results and information that my doctor wishes to relay to me.
-1	She doesn't act like she is too concerned about my problems. She speaks over top of me. She doesn't do proper testing or know about the specific diagnosis, so smuts hard for her to recommend me to the proper specialist.
-1	I've been seeing a D O instead of an MD for over 8 years. He use to just come in and make a few notes, get up, leave and then come back with prescriptions. Unless, I had a cold or rash or the kidney stone that one time. He believed in pushing pills. I have degenerative disk disease and have had several fusions. Since the government crackdown, he got himself (IMO) some trouble. I went to him last time and he could not believe that nobody had done an image on my lower back (no surgeries there). My point is, he's the doctor. Why should I be the one to order an image? Now, with the government crackdown, he's actually got to do his job!! I'm highly considering changing because I don't believe he is that good. 
-1	In my experience they just want you in and out so they can make their quick money. I had gall bladder pains for a year, and they kept telling me I was just constipated. I filly got someone that did an ultrasound and I had to have immediate surgery, and I was jaundiced. A YEAR of incompetence! 
1	My physician is a great doctor. He has done everything in his power to help me where others have failed or didn't want to.
-1	Conveyor belt care, prescribes drugs my insurance won't cover, just does the very least.
-1	"Other than those who wish others did not think I do not know what trust is.  I have severe problems with medical professionals as with all fields and would never trust anyone in any ""position"".  The idea itself upsets me."
1	All of the doctors that I have interacted with over the past few years have been understanding and compassionate about my current situations. Sometimes I feel like they haven't been completely helpful in finding solutions to some of our health problems, but I've never felt like they haven't been doing their best job to communicate and give me options. 
1	I would only choose a doctor if I believed in them and what they stood for and whether they were competent enough to take care of me the way I should be taken care of. If I get a hint of a wrong feeling about a physician I will definitely not use them
-1	I trust them because my family uses them and have used them before I was here. I feel like that is the biggest thing that makes me feel like I am taken care of.
-1	i feel that i just depends on how you feel in the moment with the doctor. 
-1	I feel they are too busy inputing data in the computer to be able to hear my issues.  My meds were inputted wrong and I am having a devil of a time to solve that issue. I tell that what I need and then it does not get done.  And I have to call and hound them for weeks to get my issues resolved. It is horrible that you can not trust the office staff to do what needs to be done.  I am able to voice my opinion but some people do not understand that they need to disagree and have a voice in their treatment plans.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is very polite, respectful, and reputable. He is more than willing to assist me in my health needs as well as my decisions regarding choices that are more optional than necessary such as vitamin capsule intake. Overall, he's very helpful and a great source of health knowledge. 
1	If my primary care physician see that his way is not working he will send me to another doctor , he will explain every thing to me , sometimes draws pictures and shows me how something will work , he takes his time with me and make sure I know what is going to happen 
-1	Because we are supposed to trust our doctors. If there was no trust we wouldn't be with them. Most doctors have a fairly good patient doctor relationship. 
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for many years, and the care I get from her is always excellent. I am able to ask questions and get answers when I need to and she is never rushed or indifferent to my needs.
-1	I trust my primary doctor in all the basics.  But, I have not had to question about something serious, at this point.  Sometimes my doctor seems too busy, but she has never ignored a question or concern
-1	I don't think I currently have a primary care physician, but I don't always necessarily trust doctors in general. My sister has had really bad luck with certain situations so that doesn't help. She's type 1 diabetic and was underweight for a while and the doctors were trying to claim my parents malnourished her when in reality she was just thin and sick from the diabetes. She has some other symptoms going on that they've been trying to find the cause of for years and still haven't. I do believe they're trying their best in this situation but they're definitely not perfect.
-1	I feel that my doctor is generally knowledgeable and competent; I just think that sometimes my sessions are rushed through, as if I'm just another customer to pay for their services. I don't distrust my doctor, but I do often believe that my doctor should spend more time with me.
1	I have been going to my doctor for over twenty years. He's the best doctor I have ever had. He will always tell me the truth about my health conditions and what kind of treatment is needed for them. He will then let me decide which one I want. He never suggests a treatment that I do not need. The two times I have gone through cancer, he was extremely helpful and caring. At appointments, he always takes his time with me and other patients. In other words, he does not rush through them as some doctors do.
1	My doctor cares about my condition and makes sure I understand what she's saying, about the different meds that I take on a daily basis. If I don't understand something, she'll explain until I completely understand it. 
-1	Doctors' relationship with big pharma inhibits some from providing the right treatment when providing the most beneficial (for them) treatment is a better career and fnancial move. 
1	Because she is up front and honest and she is not going to beat around the bush about my health she tells it like it is rather i won't to hear it or not 
-1	In American society, doctors are too easily swayed but money. I don't trust them to provide me with the care I need if I don't have insurance or the amount of money that want. It seems so odd that we have to buy our health, like the common man is owned but the powers that be. 
-1	Doctors in far to big of a hurry. If you get ten minutes with the doctor I think you did very well. I feel they just push through to get to the next person so they can make that money.
-1	I don't trust to many doctors because of the reputation they've been given and how they work with the insurance companies.  I believe money and insurance companies have an influence on the treatment a fixture prescribes.
-1	The doctors who I know personally genuinely do care.So while sometimes it is a situation of covering their butts, most the time it is done for my welfare. 
1	My doctor takes the time to listen and help me she doesn't try to rush you out the door. When she isn't familiar with an issue she will find out about it and then help you 
-1	Pharmaceutical companies have alot of doctors and hospitals by the boot straps so if its not something that is paying their bills they are least likely to admit it. Example going hollistically versus a medication to help a small yet consistent pain is not going to come out their mouth much less approve you doing so already yourself
-1	I have issues with doctors telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. They think that they are more than God. 
1	I trust doctors in general because I grew up around them, and saw that almost all of them were there to help people. I don't believe any of them would suggest a treatment for any other reason than it being the best thing for the patient at that time.
1	Because for the most part the have a pleasurable bedside manner. And I am well versed in whatever to malady may be.
1	I trust my particular primary care physician because she is a friend of mine.  Most importantly, I trust her character.  I know that she cares deeply for people and takes her job very seriously.  I know that she has done a great deal of personal research on many health topics, especially those pertaining to women and children.  She also takes a holistic approach to medicine which I appreciate.  
-1	Most of the time, I feel my doctor is under qualified or is just there to make a buck.  Sometimes I have ongoing medical issues that I mention to my doctor,  and the issues get overlooked or played down as if nothing is wrong. 
1	I really like my doctor. She is very thorough and friendly. Always has done the right thing. Very patient and listens to me. Never have doubted her.
1	I trust my doctor but I still get a second opinion to be sure. Sometimes that second opinion is a good thing to do. 
1	One of the major reason why I trust my primary care physician is because she has being our family doctor for years and treats us so well with kindness and strong hand atimes when necessary
-1	"I ""trust"" doctors in general, as in, I believe they are highly educated and that this education is important for being able to evaluate complex information and make health-related decisions. I also think most doctors are conscientious about their work with their patients and sincerely care about their well-being, even if they are subject to regular human biases. Personally, though, I hate going to doctors and actively avoid them, because I am an extremely private person and don't want to share personal and sensitive information about myself, or to be physically examined. For this reason, and because I am generally well-educated myself, I strongly prefer to avoid doctors and make personal health decisions on my own whenever possible."
-1	I trust my doctor. He has been caring for me and my family for years and we have been in good health. he has always provided the correct recommendations and we have trust in him
1	i talk to him ask questions have specific discussions about my concerns i trust him based on researched information and talking with him
-1	Overall, I may put trust into doctors generally since they are professionals within the field, but I suppose I have a bit of skepticism toward some doctors and their thoroughness. Also, it seems that some treatments in the past haven't been the most adequate in treating various concerns, which influences my perception.
1	we have had a long relationship and I have never had any issues with and concerns that have come up with my health that was not resolved.
-1	They came highly recommended and has great reviews. They are local and they take good care of me. I do appreciate how they handle my plan of care. 
-1	Doctors in general prescribe generalized medications with no intention of correcting an issue but merely masking the effects
-1	I have a chronic illness. Most doctors are quick to say nothing is wrong or that its all in your head when they can't find anything upfront. Most doctors have told me this, and then my last doctor diagnosed me with Epstein Barr. I have recently started seeing a new doctor and I don't know how I feel about her yet.
-1	in general, I prefer to do my own research. Doctors are only humans and can make mistakes and be miseducated just as anybody else could. I wouldn't feel comfortable relying on anybody for anything frankly.
-1	My primary case physician spends a lot of time with me and any issues I have are probably due to my inability to communicate my issues to him effectively.
-1	It seems like doctors only want to pass out pills. That is a bandage and dose not resolve your problem and has side effects
1	I trust what my Doctor tells me as I have been a patient of hers for a number of years. 
1	I moved from Ohio to Florida 4 years ago  and health care in Florida is far inferior. I have never been seen by the doctor where I go because I see the PA because the only reason I go is to get my meds managed.  I like and trust the PA but it will never be completely.  I am still feeling the sting about a situation that occurred a year ago that was extremely critical and the doctor overseeing the PA who is ultimately in charge totally let me down.   It was cold and impersonal and there was no commitment to me as a patient what so ever. Horrible and extremely stressful experience
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a long time and he is very in tuned to my needs and is constantly learned more about medical needs.
1	When i go to the doctor they listen to everything I have to say.  They answer all my questions.  They will also ask any follow up questions that they need answers too.  They don't rush through the appointment.  they take all the time that is needed by me and by them to come up with a solution to whatever the problem is.
-1	I feel like some doctors are only concerned about getting paid. They don't always look out for their patients' well being. Some doctors also get perks from prescribing certain medicines to their patients. 
1	"In regard to my doctor in he eral regardi g my primary care physician , I completely trust their decisions when it comes to my health and diagnoses of ""it"""
-1	I feel that my doctor, who is nearing the end of her career (upper 60's) and thinking about retirement in the next year or two is no longer placing my needs first.  I think she's having some sort of compassion fatigue and it doing a lot of things that are easier for her rather than giving me the proper care I am paying for and deserve.  I've gone to this doctor for over 20 years and it's difficult to see this happen however, I think the end of this doctor patient relationship is near either due to her impending retirement or me finding a replacement prior.
1	I taught in medical schools and know about their selection and training.  It is a time-tested process.  The quality of practicing physicians is assured by this process.
-1	I have an equal amount of trust as I do distrust with my doctor, given that I know him and my mother talk, and that I distrust her entirely with my health causes an issue. I believe that what I say to him can impact my home life, because it gets back to my mother. In general, i suppose I trust doctors, as long as they're not corrupt or anything. When I will be tasked with finding my own doctor, I will look long and hard for someone I believe to be trustworthy
-1	My doctor has been a doc for over 25 years and has always given the best options available for what my ailment has been. I trust her whole heartedly 
-1	Because they provide me with the best decisions for my health and body. Both physically and mentally 
1	I trust doctors until I find out they are wrong. So far all my doctors have treated me well and never been wrong.
-1	I am not sure if I completely trust my primary care physician because he seems more concerned about liability or convenience at times rather than in the welfare of the patient. He is not as open to answering questions about medical care. He also is not as uptodate on treatments and may recommend something that he is familiar with but may not be as effective as more new or modern treatments.
-1	"She is very busy and quick and gives recommendations rather than talking to me and asking if I want a certain test or procedure. In general I prefer a less ""medical"" approach to health care than she does."
1	My doctor came with high recommendations. After several visits, he is very thorough, asks questions to get a better understanding, and is open.  He makes sure to ask if I understand, if I have any other questions or concerns.  
-1	I think people should have trust in doctors because they went to school for their practices. O have full trust in my primary care physicians 
1	My doctor is honest and gives me options. She listens and is patient. My doctor informs me of everything.
-1	I trust that they will tell me what they think. However, I'm not always convinced that they're up to date on the very latest options. I also think they sometimes omit borderline information (i.e., risks or treatments that are on the extreme ends of the normal bell curve) just out of the sake of time. I generally trust them, as far as it goes, though.
-1	I trust my doctor implicitly but he has alot of patients and his time is severely limited with each patient. It's the one thing that annoys me. But he is excellent at his practice even if his time magement is lacking. He still mages to be caring and attentive but the rushing in and out does sometimes give me pause.
-1	My doctor is pretty clear about his observations and at the same time considerate about my thoughts 
-1	I trust my doctors for the most part; however, they are not God.  They make mistakes, get tired, and have lives like the rest of us.  I believe in second opinions and self educating.  
-1	I have been having a growing feeling that my doctor is not doing all he can to help me lower my blood pressure. The medication I am using now, the fourth, is not working very well at all.
-1	I just established a primary care physician not to long ago so I am still gaining that trust. So far it seems like she is trustworthy and really wants the best for me. I have heard good things about her which is why I decided to establish her as my pcp 
-1	All doctors follow rules and procedures that are generalized for everyone and not for me. They may or may not take me 100% at my word when I describe symptoms and feelings and will not provide all options if they don't approve of one. I've only been able to get full information when I pressed and asked, although I have encountered some doctors that did let me make the fil decision without judgement. I feel I know my body best, and often they don't take that same attitude.
1	My doctor has been in business for over 40 so years. And he is due for retirement soon. He is extremely empathetic to my concerns and very friendly when I first met  him. I think his attitude and experience have given me a great gift.
-1	In my many years of dealing with people I have never found one I really trust to any great extent, certainly not with my life.
-1	I trust the PA more then my primary doctor, she is more willing to find out what is wrong with me. Some primary doctors are only in it for the money and are not willing to diagnose and find out what is wrong with their patients. If a test doesn't show what is wrong then it ends there
-1	My doctor seems interested in moving people from the in door to the out door in record time.  He rarely gives more than ten minutes of time to his patients.  
1	I trust them to do the right things for me and have my best interests in general. They be open and straightforward about it.
-1	SHE IS FORGETFULLSHE FORGOT TO ORDER ALL MY MEDS THAT SHE WANTED ME TO HAVE...SHE DOES NOT EXPLAIN ALL TEST I HAVE TAKEN,,
-1	for the most part I trust my various drs, and follow their recommendations. however when it comes to taking prescription medications, I am reluctant to add any to the ones I already take, and feel that sometimes drs are too ready to pull out the rx pad.
-1	I trust my doc because he really listen to what i am saying and looks out for my well being. When I am sick he gets me into his office in a timely manner.
1	I have known my primary care physician for almost 10 years. He is a very honest person who believes in treating others with compassion. He would not knowingly harm or mislead his patients.
1	I had cancer and a knee replacement.. and Id say shes always  given me the best advice.. and always been very caring..and if i have any questions shes always been caring and thoughtful
1	Being a nurse has helped me see doctors in a different way. There are some doctors that have proved to me that I can trust them and there have also been some doctors that have been deceitful to their patients. If a doctor is honest with me and spends time talking to me then I can trust them. If I have a doctor that comes in the room and doesn't engage with me or sends his/her nurse in to talk to me, then I have less trust. 
-1	My family doctor is not always aware of the latest medications for my condition.  I must sometimes suggest to her the meds that I am aware of.
1	He has been practicing for many years with a very solid reputation. He takes the time to listen. He seems to genuinely care about the well-being of his patients 
1	I think that doctors in general have your best interests in common and that you should trust them generally speaking to help you whenever you need it.  You should follow any and all instructions that they give you under most circumstances unless you feel you might need a second opinion from another doctor.
-1	I do not have complete trust in my doctor as they need to make money first, and care about people less than they should. They want to help others but also can't do the cheapest options.
1	I trust my doctor I have been going to him for about 10 years if he has any doubt about what is wrong he refers me to a specialist. 
-1	"I never have total trust in anyone. I do ""mostly"" trust my primary care physician. He's a good man. I like him and he hasn't failed me. But that doesn't mean I don't look online to learn more about the things he tells me to do. I think that's a good thing to do and I don't consider it to be distrusting."
1	My doctor takes his time and does not rush. He gives me many options for treatment and often asks for my preferences and input.
1	In the time I've been seeing him he has told me things that I NEEDED to hear rather than what I wanted to hear. He always spends as much time as is necessary with me to make sure I understand my options and instructions. 
-1	Sometimes, doctors are pressured into prescribing their patients with medication they really don't need. So, some doctors are honest and are straight-forward with their patients and some aren't. 
1	i have already explained this. my doctor and i have a good relationship. we talk, we discuss. she is open with me about where i am at in my care and listens well.
-1	I do not have a primary doctor but when i receive treatment i do trust what the doctors and nurses tell me because they have more knowledge about what is wrong with me
1	Sometimes they can be telling you the truth. But sometimes they can be telling you lie. So you have to reach it frist.
-1	I think my doctor has my interest in hand. I trust that my needs are important .
1	Overall, I trust my physician.  That isn't to say that I won't seek out more information on a subject after getting my physician's opinion.  I will take what she tells me as a stepping point to learning more for myself.  My physician has shown to be open to Western Culture health care in addition to Eastern Culture health care, and that matters to me.  She is always warm and kind, and strikes me as genuine.
-1	this doctor is new to me, he seems like he is in a hurry all the time. so, its too soon to tell at this point.
-1	My primary care doctor seems to take care in doing all the necessary testing for illness and other conditions which might be present is a person of my age, gender and lifestyle.
1	Usually my primary care physician had more experience and knowledge than me, and they know better what they give to everyone
-1	Sometimes my doctor recommends treatment that she is familiar with. I prefer to take a holistic approach to my health. I prefer to try more natural alternatives and see most prescription medications as a last resort.
-1	It can be hard to trust physician due to financial incentives they may or may not have. I often wonder if physicians have to do so many procedures, write so many prescriptions, etc. just to stay a float. 
-1	She spends more than 5 minutes during appts and seems to listen when I have problems or issues that need addresses
-1	well I think the doctor does his job as he was trained to do but he isn't god and doesn't always know what illness is present  right away
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is kind and caring.  He gives me options about my treatment, tells be about research that has been done, and lets me choose what I think is the best option.
-1	I do trust that doctors are not in it to just make the money, but to provide good health care. They will be honest it what they think is the best treatment for you. However, I know doctor's cannot go into detail about the possible long term effects of a treatment so I always like to do my own research. Particularly reading forums and such.
-1	i think that doctors do whats best in part for the money. An are more interested in bringing in more patients, as it is why they try to keep people on medicine.
-1	I think that their reputation are on the line so they are generally honest.  There are people who expect miracles from doctors so sometimes the doctor has to answer the best he can but needs to move on to the next patient so he may be a bit short with answers. 
-1	I do care about my primary care physician because i have a close relationship with him and he knows me for years
-1	I trust my physician in part but there are things that I think he could miss. Also I like my doctor but he is only human.
1	I have always had a good experience with her and she seems willing to answer questions and explain things. For the most part I trust her. She seems very intelligent and like she thinks before she speaks.
-1	"Some physicians are very ""textbook"" and don't really apply what I think to what their diagnosis ultimately is "
1	My physicians seems to want me to stay healthy. They give good and reasoble advice.
-1	Sometimes for the same symptoms different specialist give way different, sometimes opposite prognosis, so there are many things they disagree with one another in, that makes me nervous.
1	My good health is a reflection upon my provider, if I'm doing well, then so are they. They have never given me a reason to doubt that they have my best interest at heart.
1	I believe that doctors in general have their patients needs first in mind, but I also feel like they are over worked and over stressed. They also don't necessarily have all the answers, and have to solve some problems through trail and error.
1	Our primary care physician goes out of her way to make our visit worthwhile and listens, answers questions throughly and honestly.
-1	My doctor often says things like I think you have ......  Without any tests or proof I know I should find another doctor
-1	I do not have a primary care provider. i normally go to urgent care if I am sick or if I have an issue that needs to be addressed.
1	I feel like my doctor provides me with all the options available for me and helps me decide on the best course of action for myself. she takes the time to explain all options I may have access to
-1	I trust my doctors because they answer my questions when I ask them, they don't treat me like a child or an idiot, and they actually pay attention to what I am saying. My doctors are engaged with me as a person and while our goal is to make me feel better, it never feels like the docs are focused on the endgoal - diagonsis - and are instead focused on me and what I need and what I'm feeling. 
-1	I think my pcp is adequate. She is nothing stellar and does her job. She sometimes need prodding to complete tasks such as refilling scripts. I need to ask her to look into things that are causing me problems and many times, I come away without an answer or a generic diagnosis.
-1	I want to trust doctors as their job is so important and I would like to believe that they know that and always want to do the best thing but not all people do the right things and people get into some industries for all the wrong reasons. 
-1	I trust doctors as they know what physical conditions I may have and have often been truthful to me.
-1	I mostly trust my doctor. However, I've only been seeing this particular doctor for 5 months. I think doctors, for the most part, intend and try to do the best for their patients. I also think that sometimes, other things, like scheduling, unforeseen emergencies and whatever get in the way. When these things happen, doctors just do what they can and maybe don't spend as much time with their patients as they should. 
-1	I don't like how Dr.s get kick backs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe meds. This makes me not trust them because they put themselves first.
1	I trust my primary care physician very much. He is thorough in my yearly check-ups. I have been seeing the same doctor for 17 years. He is very knowledgeable about my medical history so I am confident in asking questions if I have any. 
-1	Sometimes I feel I want to trust what she says but other times I feel like she's not even aware of my problems. She tends to focus on things that don't need to be done versus helping me with my true problems. I feel she is overwhelmed with other things and patients and I am just a number on a chart and not a real person.  
1	 I've been going to my doctor for about 10 years and I feel she knows me well. She has been very caring when I had upsetting personal experiences in my life. I definitely feel she listens to what I have to say.
1	My doctors is very qualified and professiol.  I am highly aware that my doctor knows far more than I do.  My doctor has educatiol experience in many areas that I do not. I trust my doctor's knowledge, experience and expertise in all medical situations concerning my health.
-1	I am a very careful person and consider myself to be well read. I ask questions and do research on my conditions and medications. 
-1	because they have more knowledge, education, and training than I do and though I may think I know, they likely know better. They have seen more people with similar issues than I possibly could so I trust them mostly. I also think that they are influenced by things such as insurance and pharma companies and such. That is why I think sometimes they rely on what is convenient and makes them the most money.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for a while.  She is very thorough.  If there is a question about treatment or diagnosis, she will refer you elsewhere.
-1	I have a rare disease called Achalasia. I was so sick I lost over 170 lbs in less than a year, doctors kept telling me there was nothing wrong with me for a year. Doctors kept insisting I had bulimia and it was all in my head, this was not the case at all. If that was the case I would have been binge eating then forcing myself to vomit, instead I would take a few bites of something and regurgitate it afterwards. After seeing over 4 specialists I finally found a doctor who listened to me and understood what was going on and it wasn't in my head. The majority of doctors I saw didn't care about my symptoms and just wanted me out of their offices. This experience made it difficult for me to trust doctors in general. 
-1	I have seen my doctor for a long time. We have a good rapport, they're honest and clear me. In aldi very much trust my son's pediatrician, he's good at what he does. Quick to the point. 
-1	I trust my physician due to feedback from others I know who also use him. I never see a doctor I have not researched about because there are many out there that should not be practicing medicine. 
-1	I do not always completely trust doctors. On simple diagnoses yes, I do trust them but as far as more complex health issues I would rather get a second opinion as well just to be certain that the diagnosis is correct. 
1	I trust my doctor because of his track record over the years with patients who aren't me and the fact that doctors can easily get in trouble for not doing the right thing.  
-1	I have to trust them right now because they tell me whats wrong with my body and I feel like if I dont listen to them something bad will happen to me.
-1	As with most things/people, a medical professiol can have an agenda they are pushing and most of the time it's for monetary reasons. I don't believe in taking unneccessary medicine and sometimes I don't trust the dr when they tell me I need to take a medicine when I think there is a better treatment option available.
-1	Its been quite a while since I seen my Dr. We moved and I havent found a personal dr. If we are in need of medical care we go to  instacare, I have found them to be knowledgeable and helpful, as if our family dr. Really good to explain.  I trust them both.
-1	It's obvious that my primary care physician, and all the other doctors in that office in general, is ridiculous overworked and overwhelmed.  When I do go see her, I can expect to regularly wait 2 hours past my scheduled appointment time to even see the doctor, only to have her rush through our meeting in 5 minutes and rush me out.  The waiting room for my primary care physician's office is always filled to the brim with waiting people, many of which sick and coughing.  My doctor means well but she is clearly overworked and unable to give me her best.
-1	I went to them and told them I believe I had something, they brushed me off and said I was fine. Four visits and hundreds of dollars later I was diagnosed with that very thing and then was given a treatment that did not work.
-1	I feel like I listen to what they say but then wait to form my own opinion on it. I haven't always had doctors give me accurate diagnoses. Sometimes I have to do my own research and tell them what I have before they can tell me themselves.
1	I trust my doctor. He is kind and caring. He takes plenty of time to listen to my concerns and responds appropriately.
1	I trust in doctors because they generally have my best interests in mind and consider all the options available.
-1	I've been put on meds that ended me up having renal failure and hospitalized. I had another doctor prescribe something that didn't work well with another medication. I'm overly cautious.
-1	I do trust him, but he is a GP and usually sends me to other people to really do a good physical.  Many things he has me do have all come out clear, yet I have spent a great deal of money doing all of his tests.
1	She is honest with me, consistent, a very good listener and does not rush through my appointments. She takes into account my feelings and my wishes in regards to my overall health care. She does research when necessary and always provides me with informed options which we discuss together. 
-1	I believe doctors are generally there to help you, not hurt or deceive you. They are looking to make you feel better as that is my most people go into the medical field.
-1	Pharmaceutical companies, among others, have changed how doctors conduct their business and it has not changed to benefit the patient.
1	It is his job to give his patients the best care and treatment. If not, he could be sued, and could potentially lose his license 
1	I have to see doctors relatively often, and although most visits are quite short, my doctor (or the nurse) is always willing to explain something I don't understand. I believe my doctor is concerned about my health problems and prescribes the medications he feels will work the best (I often have to change medications because one isn't working or a new one causes problems with an older one).
-1	I feel like doctors are usually in a rush to see as many patients as possible and just throw out the most broad diagnosis and treatment that they can hoping it will solve the problem. I feel like if something is more complicated to diagnose, it will take a long process of narrowing down if they ever even get it right
1	I trust that my physician wants what is best for me, but I think they are also bound to what their organization they work for want and what insurance companies will allow. The organizations and insurance companies are only interested in making money and do not have my best interests in mind and put pressure on Drs to avoid expensive procedures - that can delay needed treatment.
-1	I have been going to my primary care dotor now for 17 years.  I feel that he has my best interest at heart.
1	I do my research before choosing a doctor. I also go off of word of mouth and trust my doctor completely because of the people who recommended hi and my faith. 
1	been seeing my dr since 2015 after my own regular dr of 10 yrs messed up my ekg and heart condition.. my new dr found out i had high cholesterol and my old dr prescribed me pills for high blood presssure when i didnt have high bp . now i trust my new dr she never steered me wrong 
1	My doctor has been very good so far in terms of honesty/transparency, letting me know my options and giving me quality care.
1	I've had my primary care physician for a very long time and they always give me good recommendations based off of the life that they know I want to live. For example, I'm not really into taking medications if I can help it so if something can be aided naturally by eating healthier or exercising more, they nudge me in that path. Obviously if I have a severe cold or infection, I take their prescription that they recommend but they are aware that if I have to work a little harder to set a goal to get back on track, I'll take that path. And I really appreciate that from them!
-1	My doctor is my friend as well as my doctor. I feel I can trust what advice she gives me most times, or at least I hope so. I am very comfortable with my doctor
-1	I trust my primary care physcian because we have a strong relationship when it comes down to my health.
-1	My primary care doctor is mostly considerate and kind but often gives me the impression that he is overworked. He has had the tendency to forget certain things about me to the point where I have needed to remind him of things in visits (ie: medication allergy). He has never directly put me in danger with any of his decisions but I would trust him more if he was less rushed and willing to spend more time getting familiar with me and my health.
-1	i have been seeing my doctor of over thirty years and he has never led me to anything that would hurt or harm me
1	She has known owe a long time. She knows what is best for me. She is very knowledgable about my health.
-1	My GP is fairly new at this practice. She is a NP and I think she gets a little hesitant about making decisions on what medication to give you. This in turn makes me nervous. Overall, I trust doctors but I also arm myself with knowledge. I will not take a new medication without researching it. Doctors do not have the time to know everything there is about a medicine they're prescribing. So, a pharmacist and research can be your best friend when it comes to your health.
-1	My current Primary Care Physician is not even a physician.  She is only a nurse practitioner.  Every time Iâve gone to see her she has literally said âI just donât know what to tell you.â  âIâm not really sure what is going onâ.  After she did some research online, she came to the same conclusion that I already had by searching online.
-1	Doctors are human. Most of them are careful and want to help their patients. Some are better at keeping up-to-date with the newest best practices than others. So, depending on how many doctors are in your area and how good your insurance is, most people who can afford medical care can find a decent doctor who keeps their best interests in mind.
-1	They seem to care about the patient's well being rather than their financial benefit. Often times, some are willing to discuss concerns outside business hours.
-1	My doctor has never given me advice or medical care or information that turned out to be wrong or incorrect
1	I had a primary care physician that I liked and trusted very much. She had me do a number of tests when I first saw her so she could see what was going on. She is always listened and answered all questions I had, she had a caring personality, non-judgy. Sadly she moved and I am currently looking for a new primary care physician. 
-1	My doctor is very thorough and is not satisfied until he reaches an answer. I definitely trust him with all my health problems.
-1	I generally try to trust doctors, unless I feel like I am being rushed through or not listened to.  I feel most doctors have keeping me healthy as their top priority.
1	My primary care physician has never given me a reason to distrust him. He is always willing to listen to what is bothering me, give his professional opinion of the cause, and let me choose from the treatment options available. Over time, he has earned my complete trust.
-1	I visit military clinics to see my primary care managers.  This means that they have no reason to mislead me.  However, they can sometimes be in a hurry to try and get to all their scheduled appointments on time.
-1	At the end of the day it is their job and duty to ensure that i get the help i pay for so i am generally rather trusting of them and their judgement
1	She is thorough open and honest.  She believes in God and listens to me when I talk. She responds to my questions and never seems rushed 
-1	My physician has forgotten medical information about me, and had to be retold. Also, my physician has said offensive things that seem to step across the line of patient and doctor relationship. I haven't switched because I'm only living here for one year and hopefully don't get sick until I move. Finding a new physician would take too long to get in. So I don't really trust my physician.
1	My doctor has never failed me or my family.  Anytime we have ever gone to her she takes her time to get to the bottoms of what is wrong.  I trust her not only with myself but also my child.
1	I've been going to my primary physician for years, he's always tried to help me to the best of his ability.
1	In my case, my primary care physician is also a good personal friend that I've known since before he was my doctor.  We built a relationship of trust before we had a business relationship and that has carried over into seeing him as a doctor.  Any time I have had an issue I have honestly expressed it to him and he has given me straight answers on what my options are and what the possible outcomes were.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician. I haven't even been to the doctor since I was a kid. But I don't see any reason not to trust your doctor. What advantage could he gain by lying?
-1	I rarely go to the doctor, so it is hard to answer this question. I mean what else am I suppose to say in this 
-1	I don't see a primary care doctor because I have had trouble finding one that really listens to me and works with me to solve my medical problems. It seems to me that they are too busy most of the time and want to solve the immediate need that I have come in for, rather than working towards long term health. 
1	Because one Doctor put me on medicine that would kill me, didn't believe my medical records.  And couldn't be bothered to ask.  Reduced my faith in everyone in the medical profession
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing her for a long time and am comfortable with her. I can be completely honest with her and 
-1	most doctors like to load their patients up on lots of medications. for example, when i was 17 i went to my doctor with stomach pain. it turns out i have acid reflux, my doctor gave me medication for it instead of giving me a list of foods to avoid.
-1	The explaianation and reason why I trust my primary care physician is do to her character and understanding. I feel she is an honest physician who truly wants to help.
-1	The reason I cant trust my primary physician on a regular day to day daily basis is because to me it seems a lot of them are simply in it for the check. I also feel like my primary physician looks at everything from a book perspective, and the truth is no matter what schooling no book can tell you everything about real life, especially when dealing with a real life person. I feel a lot of providers just see us as a number or a insurance claim, they aren't understanding enough to realize that some things are just life not everything can be explained via a book. 
-1	I trust that he means well, but I don't trust his ability to see things clearly.  And in general, I think most doctors have too many patients and not enough time to focus on them long enough to really see what might be apparent early, until it's so obvious and too late.
1	Well, this doesn't seem like a very good question to me. But I think that one has to trust their doctor or find another one to deal with. So what can I say. that is about it, about that........
-1	I have no issues with my current primary care physician. However, in the past, I had a PCP that was not very attentive during my yearly physical examinations. This resulted in my performance anxiety condition to go undiagnosed throughout my childhood until finding a new PCP later in life. 
-1	I like his speech with me . It is full of love and cer toward me . He is very special in his way of speaking and learning
-1	I trust my doctor because he's never given me a reason to distrust him.  I don't believe he values me above all else, and certainly he cuts corners/time/doesn't explain EVERY possible option every time, but he always tells me the relevant information I need.
-1	I have no reason to mot trust him. He has been p[en gentle kind and sesitive to my conditions. I have no doubts about my trust in him
1	My doctor is very paiteint with me and other paitients. She takes the time to explain things and answers all questions I have. I never feel that I am inconveniencing her when I visit with a problem.
-1	Unfortunately, I live in a town where the doctors don't care about anything but money. I have been misdiagnosed (about having a heart attack)  that could have killed me. I have a hard time trusting doctors after that.
1	I have to trust the person I am trusting my life and future with. I cannot doubt their abilities. If for some reason I find I don't trust my doctor I find a new doctor. I have done it. I don't want to have to be concerned that my doctor does not have my best interest in mind.
1	I trust my doctor because i have been seeing her for  a while now and i haven't had any issues and she helps me out every time..
1	he is very dedicated and thoroughly professional hhe is also kbowledgeable and cring and always follows up on things i trust him completely
-1	CONSECUENT PORTFOLIO SOLUTION OF ESTIMATING SIMPLE CONTRARY OF THE INSPIRED PROSPECT SECURITY INPUT ACCOUNT RIGHT
-1	I have only had one bad experience with a doctor and that was more about billing and paperwork than the actual care. When a doctor gives me an opinion I generally accept it and follow their advice. So far in life that has not let me down.
-1	I do not trust m primary care physician, nor do I trust doctors in general. I feel like no doctors really care about their patients, instead they only care about making money in this terrible for profit health care system we have here in the United States. 
-1	I trust my doctors because they went to medical school and I did not. So I believe them over myself.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I truly believe she has my best interests at heart. We spent a long time my last visit just taking through all my options and making sure I truly understood what was going on. 
-1	I trust my doctor because of our history together. She is honest and always give me a list of options while explaining what each option means to me. 
-1	Because whenever I have had a health problem I have been treated well and achieved good results by staying healthy and stable, without having to buy or consume unnecessary medicines
-1	Who Sunil Endo shul think to do you  think homophobic to do check bunko stay stuff tho do dunno dunno syrup yup dunno affecting full full full full
-1	I completely trust my Primary Care physician, but also understand that she see many people, so I ultimately have to do some of my own research and decide what is truly right for me as far as treatments are concerned.
1	I feel like they have my best interest at heart. I can trust that they know what they are talking about and are educated in their field so I don't have to worry about my health.
-1	I trust my doctor to do her job. To diagnose and treat. Doctors have gone to countless lectures and read numerous medical books and journals. They know much more about the human body and how it works than I do. With that being said, Doctors are still people and they do make mistakes but I trust them a lot more than Iâd trust a medically uneducated person to treat me.
1	I have been seeing this doctor for over 12 years and he has always been honest with me. I know my welfare is his top concern and he has always taken very good care of me and health issues that may arise.
-1	I trust that they have more knowledge about medical issues than I have. That being said, I don't very often put 100% faith in anybody's opinion. I'll do my own research even if it's minimal, and if I'm really uncertain a second opinion is always nice.
-1	Because they know what's best for you . They know the right spot or place for you. They provide the best for you . They care for you .

Beginning in 1993, Dallin A.

1	I trust my doctor because she has been my PCP/GYN for a long time and haZs NEVER steered me wrong with any diagnosis or medications.
1	I trust him because he always been right in diagnosis my problems if any & able to provide the correct medicine & counseling.
-1	I distrust my doctor because he may only be doing it for money or trying to finish up his work so he can move on to the next patient.
-1	I don't feel that my doctor has the time to spend with me on a one on one basis because of too many patients.  I also feel that when I ask the doctor to give me a certain test because other family members have a certain condition there should be no reason why I shouldn't be tested to catch an early diagnosis. 
1	she seems to remember all the tiny details of my case. she seems genuinely interested in helping me to feel my best.
-1	I trust my doctor because they do not make me feel dumb about the questions I ask and are always willing to answer more questions I have.
1	My doctor and I have a similar temperament and she is knowledge, down to earth.  I trust my physician to prescribe medication, inform me of treatment options and perform any type of medical procedures.
1	I trust my doctor, although we have disagreed on the best treatment options in the past. I do not always think that a pill is the cure, while he tends to prescribe medications for everything. I do think he looks out for me though and has my interests in mind.
-1	"Trust is a two way street.  The doctors do not trust you when you are in pain.  Because they do not trust you when you are in pain, the doctors decide that it is a good thing to poke and prod you until you actually scream.  After they hear you scream, they then decide that ""oh, maybe you are in pain"". That is when you will be given a hand full of papers otherwise known as referrals, to go to a place where they do x-rays.  After signing in with them, you have to fill out all of the paperwork once again.  It is a tedious job to continue to fill out the same forms over and over again.  The referral doctor takes the x-rays, and tells you to make an appointment with your original (primary) doctor.  The doctor that tells you to make the appointment with the primary doctor will then read your x-rays and send the results to your primary doctor. It seems to me that the primary (original) doctor is just sending you back and forth to different doctors to get additional payments from the insurance company.  I just do not trust any doctor.......they are all out for themselves."
1	I have been with my doctor for a long time. If he doesn't know the answer to my question he will find out for me. He is very caring and attentive towards me about my problems.
1	I fully trust my PCP. He is always verbose in his explations and open to any and all questions. He has fostered a great trusting relationship.
1	he is a good man. he is always there for me when i need him even when he is occupied by patients. n/a
-1	I trust my personal primary care physician because they seem competent and know what they are talking about. I am iffy with doctors because some of them may seem like they are out of touch with society. 
1	Listen to my questions by verbal or notes and they give me eye contact not ignore me and also give me advice of things to try out before the next step and have me at times look up information on line if I don't understand what they are talking about
1	I trust my doctor because he has always done right by me. He answers all my questions and listens to my concerns.
-1	Because I think doctors only care about the bottom line, Money.  Rarely have I ever met a doctor I thought he knew what he was doing ! 
-1	Many doctors are too busy to listen to their patients. Some have a horrible bedside manner and it makes the patients feel uncomfortable to ask important questions. If a doctor is to be trusted, they need to listen to the patient. They need to show compassion and understanding, while maintaining a professional demeanor.
1	I have a good relationship with my doctor. She has always been very helpful. She is always willing to listen to my thoughts and concerns and is never forceful in her suggestions.
-1	I had a doctor to whom I gave 100% trust because he earned it. Now that I have that person as a comparison, my current doctor falls well short in knowledge and patient advocacy.
-1	In general I have a great deal of faith in doctors, but I know they are very busy and there is an intense amount of knowledge they would need to synthesize in order to truly be able to find the best course of action for everyone. I believe they try very hard, but from personal experience I know that often several courses of treatment need to be tried before the right one is found. I don't think badly of doctors for this, nor do I think it is from neglect or mal-intent. I think it is just a result of the complicated workings of the body and the fast amoutn of medical knowledge that exists.
-1	 trust my doctor because he is very knowledgable about most if not all medical information that is relevent to my medical and emotional wellbeing. if i have any questions, he explains what i need to know to make an informed decision.
-1	I have had things happen in the past-(wrong doses prescribed, not listening to serious concerns and misdiagnosis that cost me a lot of heartaches and physical consequences- as a result I am very apprehensive in trusting fully what any doctor tells me. I question everything a doctor tells me and I research my issues. 
1	She takes the time to listen to my concerns and ideas and plan for my health, as well as providing valuable information to assist me in doing so.
1	My doctor always explains the results of my visits thoroughly. I never have additional questions that go unanswered. My doctor consistently looks out for my best interest.
-1	My physician is extremely busy and usually seems preoccupied by something. I live in a rural area and patients are often seen by assistants and students rather than the physician. I am concerned that local practitioners are not up-to-date with current findings. Medicine here seems to consist of ibuprofen, Gatorade and Jesus.
1	My doctor is very trustable because he takes his time with me and cares about me getting better when im ill. I have no reason to distrust him with all he does for me. Hes the best at what he does.
1	Personable and sharing, shows interest in and concern for all of his patients. That he listens to my questions and opinions is obvious to me from his answers and reactions.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician so I am unable to fully complete this section.  I do trust doctors in general and rely on them if I should ever need to use a medical service.
1	I trust my primary care physician because i have known them my entire life. I can understand some people not trusting doctors in general because it seems a lot more of them these days are just trying to make every dollar they can off of their patients. 
1	my doctor is very knowledgeable about medical conditions and has the resources to find the treatment and solution for multiple medical conditions.  I do not have this knowledge.
1	I trust my doctor because I have had him for along time.There is nothing that don't trust from my doctor.
1	Recently finished medical training.  Listens.
1	I tend to trust the professionals who show a passion for the work that they do. If the connection and relationship between the patient and doctor is not present then I find a new primary care physician. There is no room for mistrust in medicine.
