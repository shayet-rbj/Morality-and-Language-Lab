-1	I generally trust doctors, but also have some degree of skepticism and will ask questions of medical providers until satisfied with the answers I have received.
-1	She is there for me when I need her. She does not rush through appointments with me. She explains everything and makes sure that I understand. She is knowledgeable about current trends in health care.
1	He is very open to answering my questions and spending time explaining things. 
1	i trust my doctor very much because why wouldnt i trust my doctor i would trust my doctor all the time because they are there foor me all the time. 
-1	Sometimes I feel that my physician has a lot going on and not a lot of attention going toward me. I understand that they are overworked but I do feel that I will need to take charge of my own health if I feel that they do not completely understand me. I will take what they say strongly into consideration but if it does not seem to fit me, I believe that I know myself better than they do.
-1	Like all professions not all doctors are perfect.
1	Because my family knows them and their family well. That is what keeps me feeling secure with going there and feeling like i am getting the best honest care.
1	he always takes his time with me, gives me advice and then leaves it up to me.  Great be side matter.
1	I have had nothing but good experiences with my doctor. I always got the feeling that they really care about my health and what is best for me.
-1	I've been going to the same doctor my whole life, and when I was younger it seemed like he knew what he was doing. Now that he's older, it seems like he just wants to get patients out of his office as quickly and as possible. Prescribe some medicine and you're good to go. I like not spending a lot of time in the doctor's office, but it does make me wonder if he actually knows what he's doing.
-1	Well I trust them because I expect them to be professionals and know what they're talking about. But at the same time I have gotten second opinions and wouldn't hesitate to do so again in the future because it's always better to be safe than sorry in my opinion.
-1	I distrust him because he just wants to hand out pills instead of getting to the root cause of the problem. He has been treating me for migraines for years and years and it turns out it wasn't even migraines. It was tension headaches. So he just wanted to switch me to a different medication instead of offering massage with the physical therapist (which is covered by the insurance).  I had to make a huge scene to get him to let me go to physical therapy over just trying to medicate the pain away. He's so focused on getting through his appointments in his allotted 15 minute slots that it keeps him from giving an honest look into the best solution for each patient individually. Some patients may be perfectly content with popping pills, but I'm not. He should have said here are the options available, which do you prefer?  But that doesn't happen with this doctor at all. 
1	I have two physicians who I see.  Because I'm in good health (no major health issues) I feel quite comfortable with discussions I have regarding my maintaining my health and with regard to any issues that might effect my health.  I try to keep active and maintain a healthy lifestyle so there isn't much I would not trust them about.
-1	I don't like or trust her, she comes in looks at my chart prescribes another pill and walks out without hardly talking to me.
1	The methods implemented by my doctor to help me have always worked in the past. I have asked my doctor questions about why they wanted to be a doctor and what kind of education they have. Therefore, I know my doctor is passionate about their profession and wanting to help people. My doctor communicates with me promptly when I have a question or concern about my health. My doctor also has a good bedside manner, is always respectful, and does not make inappropriate comments. I know my doctor will be up front with me when I ask them difficult questions.
-1	My doctor is very caring, and makes me feel confident about treatments he suggests.  When you go in you feel more like a family member than a patient.  He doesn't rush he is thorough and he can't get answers he'll refer you somewhere that can
-1	He's very down to earth and tells me what is protocol but also what is necessary. He's a big proponent of preventative care and has always backed up his suggestions with research.
1	I have known my primary care physician for years. Every time I go there, I walk away positive and confident about my sickness and know that she will do what she can to help me get better. She is very thorough and has a lot of information to give and is patient with me. 
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because he is extremely thorough. During appointments with him, he often exceeds the general '15-30min' exam time, but just because he's so informative. For example, the at my last appointment with him when we were discussing medication options, he was actually showing me published articles from the New England Jourl of Medicine so I can see the data for myself and be more informed in my decision. Obviously he's far more well versed in these things than I am, but he doesn't just assume that these things are 'beyond my comprehension'. He can explain things in a thorough yet not unnecessarily complicated way so I don't feel forced to just take whatever advice he gives me.
-1	She has delivered all 5 of my babies and she didn't miss a single one she takes the time to listen to me and even called my insurance company to help me out
-1	I trust my physicians because he is generally very thorough in our exchanges. He takes the  time to listen to my concerns and will provide me valid answers and options for my treatments.
-1	Medical care has declined as insurance provision has decreased.  Fewer people are seeking the education to become a doctor because they don't make enough money - this due to the low quality of insurance and the amount paid by insurance companies; therefore the quality of doctors has gone down and most doctors are foreign and don't speak good English.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have informed myself of options and treatment prior to my doctors appointments.  that way I can listen to his proposals of treatment and decide in a positive way if I think he is on top of my situation and treatments.
-1	It take a mouth for to see Dr then u wait 2 hours and he see u for 5 mins.in the 5 mins he just tell u time for check up .
-1	The doctor does his best but must be a good listener and read between the words to understand me and be a good judge of what will work a long time.
1	My doctor actually seems to care what happens to me and how my treatments are going and affecting me
1	I have seen the same doctor for years who I have an extremely close relationship with.  He has been honest with me whether it has been a negative or positive thing that we are speaking about.  After him giving me extra time and going out of his way for me on separate occasions, he has more than proved himself as genuine.
1	I trust my doctor because he has yet to steer me wrong. Whenever I am having a problem or I need a question answered he is there to listen and give me a thorough diagnosis. He also looks out for me by recommending me the best products with the lowest price. If my problem can be fixed easily with a drugstore product then my doctor has no problem bringing up that product first. Even if I feel as though my problem was major and my doctor diagnoses it as something simple like a stomach ache, he will still treat the situation as important and reassures me in showing that it wasn't a waste of time to come.
-1	well I think the doctor does his job as he was trained to do but he isn't god and doesn't always know what illness is present  right away
-1	I trust them because they work relly hard to help us. Troughout time, we pay many pateientsd to help us really much. I love it. Going tot he stoer
1	She is confident, intelligent and excellent diagnostician. .I do have complete trust  in her capabilities.
-1	I think there are high quality people in the healthcare professional and some that are not of average or less as providers. I judge by my interactions with each individual.
1	Because he has always told the truth and he always gives me a solution to my discomforts or diseases
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she seems to care about my health she also seem to care about what I think and how I feel
1	My doctor is a really nice guy, very competent, and is open and honest with me about my treatment and diagnoses
-1	I would not patronize a doctor in whom I didn't have trust.  That's counterintuitive.  Why would I go to a professional, then discount his advice/opinion.
-1	Sometimes i know my body more and know how to react to things. I dont necessarily believe fully in pharmaceuticals. 
1	I am not currently in the care of a particular doctor, but all of my experiences, save one horrid anesthesiologist, have been excellent, which certainly says something because, as I said I have had a good handful of this and that over the years.  
-1	My doctor is very sweet and kind to me, I don't see why she would purposefully be dishonest with me about anything. Sometime's I'm confused by what she tells me, but that isn't her fault.
1	My doctor is patient and takes his time when I have an appointment. He makes me feel valued and never makes me feel embarassed regardless if my concern is minor. 
-1	I do trust my doctor almost completely, you have to if you are not going to go crazy. But I know in the back of my mind no one has my best interest at heart but me. 
-1	I dont have a primary care dr because of insurance reason but i do tryst drs however i feel they dont help everyone 
-1	I primarily trust my primary doctor. She is super nice and always answers all of my questions thoroughly and takes time to explain whats going on. That builds the trust every time I see her.
-1	sometimes i feel like they don't want to help you, or they just don't care about the patients. sometimes as well we just don't want to trust someone we don't want to trust so i guess that is why they don't trust. when we do its because we believe that they are credible
1	I trust my primary care technician because we have a long standing relationship. Over the years, she has never gave me bad advice and has been completely upfront and honest about my health.
-1	I trust my doctor because he is a human being and doesn't want to see me suffer; he wants to help.  I do believe that he will give me different options that will make the most money for him though.  As long as it helps me, I don't really care.  There may be some options he won't mention due to the fact that it requires me to go to someone else, thereby not giving him the money.  I do believe medicine is based on money, sad but true.
-1	They are always looking out for my health and making sure everything is good and I don't have any problems at all
-1	"My GP has been great over the years. Rarely has he said ""trust me I'm a doctor"" He has a fantastic group of referral physicians and surgeons and has never steered me wrong with any medical treatment or diagnosis, unless there is little known about it then we both work on it"
-1	I dont completely trust my medical physician because often I feel like instead of doing what's the right thing for me they are likely doing what can get them paid the most. 
-1	I distrust my physician because she doesn't put her patients first . She is never on time and does not care about how her patients feel . She goes about her business in a disorderly matter .
1	My trust in my doctor depends on which doctor I go to. For instance, I trust my general physician and gynocologist but not my dermotologist because he doesn't give me a lot of attention and seems to be in it only for the money.
-1	I have advanced lung disease and I often feel that the doctor has not taken the time to really look over my files and/or learn about my condition.   For example, he recommended the Shingles vaccine for me and I had to inform him that because I am on steroids I cannot have the vaccine.
1	My family has been going to the same physician for over 50 years, starting with my grandfather. Our doctor has been reliable and up front for all that time. I have no reason not to trust his judgement.
1	I have had a long-term relationship and we communicate well. I have never had any issues with this doctor.
-1	I trust or distrust my primary care physician because he trusts me as well and cares for me like no other doctor does 
1	she's caring and thoughtful. she always has my best interest in mind. she truly cares about my health.
1	I am comfortable with her. She answers my questions in a language I understand. I don't like to take medication, so we discuss how to do things in a natural way.
-1	because she tells me nothing. she invites other doctors in that also say things like it doesn't look good but when you ask them what it is they say i can't tell you here is a referral to another doctor who then says the same things and prescribes drugs without an explanation at all of what it is and what its for
-1	Been with my doctor for years. she is very thorough does not rush me off. i found out more about my well being by her patients & understanding. 
1	She's honest, trustworthy, and blunt. I feel she has no real reason to lie to me. There may be times where she doesn't want to deal with all of my illnesses at one time, but she has told me this point blank if and when it happens.
1	I have had the same primary care physician for quite some time. He is thorough, makes me feel comfortable, and is overall a great person. There's not a time when I'm at his office where I do not feel safe and at ease. He has never steered me in the wrong direction either. 
-1	Trust by verify. I am smart enough to know not to trust my internet/google searches when it comes to my health, but I'm also smart enough to know that 99 times out of 100 my minor ailments and annual checkups are best handled by my PCP and I can rely on his expertise
1	My doctor ask a lot of question and does a good job in knowing what is wrong with me or if something is going on.  Never in a hurry.  Goes over info with me.
-1	I trust my doctor because despite his hurried overall attitude he has done nothing but provide me with proper medical care and make the best choices for my health.
1	I've been with my primary care doctor for a number of years, and feel he does have my best interests at heart... he takes enough time with me at every visit, and will answer any question I have. 
-1	Most doctors are greedy. The money is more important than our health. They perform unnecessary treatments to earn more money
1	I trust my primary care physician. She is empathetic, thorough, and a great communicator. She always takes the time to thoroughly explain things. I never feel like she is in a rush.
-1	I do not have complete trust in my doctor as they need to make money first, and care about people less than they should. They want to help others but also can't do the cheapest options.
1	He listenes and talks with you about things, always explains well.
-1	I am forced to go to a clinic by my house that rarely lets me see an actual doctor. Many times when I go for specific reasons or health issues they ignore those and don't do anything for it. I am always forced to see a nurse practitioner who always has to look up stuff in books to treat me.
-1	I generally trust most doctors, while I don't have a primary care physician if I ever need professional medical help or advice I usually just go to the urgent care center and they have always been able to help me with my problems. So my trust level for them is average I would say, I don't necessarily believe everything a doctor says, but I also don't think everything is a lie they are telling me either. 
-1	The reason I do not have trust in my doctor is because they rush through the appointment becaus ehe more peopla see means more money they make. The quality is poor.
1	I trust my doctor because he genuinely shows concern for my health. He explains all of my options along with short and long term effects. He is attentive to my concerns and offer effective plans  and he is there when i need him
-1	I always find that my primary care physician is too busy to give me the time I need. I have gone to appointments countless times and left feeling like I really didn't solve my issues. Sometimes, I even feel that they get annoyed if i ask too many questions and keep them in the room for too long.
1	I trust my doctor because he is compassiote about helping others and takes the time to answer any question I might have. I've always received prompt service and have never had to wait too long to be seen on in an office visit. He also has been willing to work with me if my insurance has not covered the full price of a medicine I needed.
1	my doctor's been working with me for almost 10 years I'm configurable with him because i feel he knows me well add far add my medical history very well and i haven't suffer anything other than a common cold so i believe he's awesome
-1	INDEED I TRUST MY PHYSICIAN IT PROVIDES ME A GREAT ADVISE IN MY LIFE AND I HAVE MORE 5 YEARS EXPERIENCE WITH HIM WITH NO PROBLEMS NOT RESOLVED
-1	I utilize different professional medical settings (i.e. urgent care, hospital, offices) and have had multiple bad experiences, both personal and of my friends. It seems as though many doctors rush through without properly analyzing the situation, or push for the more costly of treatments. Medicine has taken quite a plunge in recent years, and the Hippocratic Oath does not mean what it once meant. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never steered me in the wrong direction.  I have had this same doctor for several years.
-1	He is usually in a hurry when I go to see him. I imagine that is because he sees so many patients. Since I see him rarely, I imagine there isn't enough of a connection for him to really care outside a professiol capacity.
1	My primary care physician has been my doctor since I was born. He always was my mom, and cousin's doctor.
-1	I trust and distrust my primary care physician. They are not God and do not have all the answers. They can only give advice and provide solutions that they've studied. Most of the time I can google on the Internet and find my own solutions to problems.
-1	I trust my doctor's abilities and believe him to be honest. That being said, he has hundreds of patients and I'm not his friend or family member. I'm sure he does a great job, but why should I have complete trust in another person, just because they are my doctor. I don't have complete trust in my friends or family members, why should my doctor be any different? 
-1	i trust him too much because of the years, what he has advice me had never proving to be false. he is so caring and approachable. he tell me what is needed and not what i wants to hear. he is such a wonderful man. also he put patience first before money.
1	I've been going to see him a long time and he tells me the truth...even when it's hard to hear.  He never spares my feelings and always shoots straight with me.  I really appreciate it and trust everything he says.
-1	my primary care physician helped save my life, he was able to find, diagnose and treat an illness that could have killed me
-1	I have a new primary care doctor, but she is kind and well-respected. I trust her based on others' experiences and honest reviews, in addition to persol experience. 
1	My primary physician hasn't failed me yet. The other week I went in because I had an horrible cough and headache. He took a look into my ears and prescribed antibiotics, one week later I am feeling better.
-1	I feel i can trust my PCP. She is being very honest with me about options and potential results. I feel i already established a personal connection with her
1	I was referred to my current doctor after complaining about my old doctor.  It seems that my old doctor did not have my wellbeing at heart
-1	i feel that i just depends on how you feel in the moment with the doctor. 
1	Cause the physician knows what he/she is talking about and is dedicated to. The physician has no axes to grind and has no other agenda than to render the best care.
1	my pcp seems to be very knowledge and takes her time whenever I visit with her. she does not push unnecessary tests and always takes the time to explain answers to any questions I may have. she gives me all the options for certain treatments and gives me her opinion on which is best but always leaves the final option up to be. I feel I can trust her and I have not been disappointed in the past
1	I have been with my doctor for a long time. If he doesn't know the answer to my question he will find out for me. He is very caring and attentive towards me about my problems.
1	I have no reason to not trust her. She seems to truly care about my health and seems to make good decisions for my health.
-1	i like my doctor but sometimes i just do not know what to think about things they have help out a lot over the years
1	I trust my primary care physician because he really cares about my concerns and needs. Also, is really honest about whatever questions I have.
-1	i trust my doctor because she knows more than i do about human bodies. i can look things up and give her my symptoms, but at the end of the day she knows a lot more than i do about how things work. I trust her.
-1	I trust my doctor for a few reasons. First off, they are a doctor for a reason, they want to help people improve their health. Also, there are plenty of laws and reasons for them to not slack off and do a bad job, so they are well incentivized to be accurate.
1	I trust my doctor in any arising health issue concerning my health. My doctors always gives me all of my treatment options that's available to treat my condition. 
-1	I don't have a current PCP but I do believe all my former PCPs have truly cared about my health and looked out for my best interest 
-1	I think the vast majority of doctors have the patient's best interests at heart, but occasionally they may push for a certain treatment or medication for political reasons.
-1	I currently don't have a primary physician. But the one I had was pretty good, caring and efficient. 
1	Beachsideu doctor ss to care about my needs and have helped me change habits when I didn't want to. Cared about helping me when o was at my lowest and getting me the best help. 
1	I'm very knowledgeable about health, but I also don't have md behind my me.  I find that being able to colloborate with a doctor works better for me and my health goals.  I have more faith and trust in a doctor who I mesh very well with and can have dialogue with.
-1	My Doctor is very caring despite the short time I have with her during check-ups and I trust her judgement. She always answers my questions and does her best to give suggestions. I trust her judgement but I also do my own research on what is best for my condition so I can be sure that it is the right decision. 
-1	I'm very middle of the road on this because of my own personal experiences. Ive never been mislead by a doctor but I do know people who believe they have, including close family members. So as with anything involving humans I don't completely put my faith in it.
-1	all doctors are just after the money, and they are all in bed with the pharmaceutical companies vying for free trips an such. write prescriptions like its going out of style
1	I trust my physician because he is generally caring and I see him over do himself daily for his patients. He gives patients his work and personal phone number so he can be reached at anytime day or night. He's also really good about what tests he orders or doesnt order to find out the cause of whatever is going on. He also listens to each and every patient for as long as is needed. He doesn't stick to the every fifteen minute schedule he's set to.
1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR HE HAS BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR US FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS ALWAYS LED US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH THOROUGH AND EXCELLENT MEDICAL CARE
-1	I don't  have a primary  care or physician I use walk in clinics  some I can't give you that much information  so you see whom available 
-1	I need to know all the side effects of each treatment and take a proactive stance when it comes to my medical treatment.
-1	My Primary Care Physician is an exception to the rule. Nearly all other physicians I've encountered would have received the exact opposite scores. My physician runs a small-town cash-only clinic, removing insurance from the process altogether and creating a much better Doctor-Patient relationship in the process.
-1	I'm currently pregnant and every time I try to make an appointment to be seen because of pain, they refuse to see me so therefore I do not trust them because they think they know what they talking about but honestly they dont
-1	I don't distrust my doctor, but he's human and no one knows everything. When it comes to my health, if its a serious issue not just a cold, I always want to get another opinion. 
1	I go to him because I do not understand enough about what is wrong to make a decision. If I didn't trust my doctor, I wouldn't have gone
-1	Doctor are human. As human beings, they have their own personalities and agendas that are not entirely conducive to another persons needs or health. Therefore, their actions and advice require some consideration in the larger picture. One must take responsibility for one's health regardless of another person's opinion of your health. I guess we should all be doctors for our own sake...whether we like it or not.
1	My PCP has stood by me through 2 years of complicated medical issues collaborating with a team of doctors to ensure continued progress and diagnosis. He discusses all factors pros and cons with me and takes the time to ensure all factors are discussed. Time is one of the keys.
-1	I don't feel that my doctor has the time to spend with me on a one on one basis because of too many patients.  I also feel that when I ask the doctor to give me a certain test because other family members have a certain condition there should be no reason why I shouldn't be tested to catch an early diagnosis. 
-1	My primary care doctor is good and does seek out the tests and medicines he thinks I need; but his idea of health and life is different than mine.  I don't think he is into natural and spiritual healing.
1	I have known my doctor since my first daughter was born over 13 years ago.  She has treated all of my children.  I started seeing her myself 4 years ago and she has always given me insightful options and thorough testing.
1	I have had the same primary physician for almost thirty years.  he has earned my trust. he has always given me good advice and care.
-1	My doctor frequently overbooks his appointments so I don't always feel that I have his full attention.
-1	I don't think doctors are not taught enough about health.  I prefer to trust myself when it comes to my health.  Doctors only like perscriptions for health. 
-1	I think doctors are always pushing big pharma agendas of the latest most expensive drugs in return for kickbacks.
-1	I think they follow a book of rules and aren't open to new ideas and some only care about the money so they just want to give you more drugs to more side affects
-1	My primary care doctor is part of a large company. That company has huge turnaround, a huge patient base and relies heavily on billing. My primary care doctor probably wouldn't recognize me on the street.
1	I have had the same physician since birth he has always been honest and open with myself and my parents. When we need referrals to other Dr.'s he gives us the best one he knows and follows up with that Dr. to make sure they are all on the same page with my treatments if any are needed.
-1	I trust my doctor. I have been going to him for years! He has givinen me the best advice and he also help birth all three of my children.
1	Most doctors are businessmen first and doctors second, meaning that medical practice has transitioned from a profession to a crass, me-first money making operation. Most of the docs I know care about caring, and serving the best interests of their patients; but I have to acknowledge that for more than a few docs, money matters a lot.
1	I have been with my PCP for several years and I have grown to have more and more trust for him. Since Doctors are people too they can make mistakes or have errors in judgement. The one that graduates at the bottom of their class still gets the same credentials as one who graduates at the top.
-1	I think my doctor is well educated and has patients best interests at heart however I also think at time her own prejudices get in the way of effective treatment.
1	I trust my doctor because that is what she went to school for. She has been trained in a way that people that are not doctor arent. 
-1	Overall, I trust my doctor to give me honest answers to my questions. I can't prove they are 100% accurate, however, I have never had an issue with her diagnosis. 
-1	he knows my health condition adn also take care of all my allergies very well. he knows my food habits and also suggest nutritions. he speaks really well
1	I trust my primary physician because I feel she has my best interest at heart. She listens to my complaints and ask questions concerning them. If she can't figure something out, she will refer me to another physician.
-1	All doctors treat you for symptoms you dont need medical attention for. They get a kick from certain medications, so they convince you to take it. We have proven it. A doctor told (Ã) to take (said medication), and (+) didnt take it, and after 6 months, there was no difference.     I only take mine when I need to.
1	I trust my doctor by telling them if something is wrong or if a medication isn't working. They are very helpful if i have a question for them
1	I just changed my pcp and have only seen him once. My rheumatologist, however, I've seen many times. I trust her because I know she will fight for me to get the medications I need. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never done anything which has lost my trust. There have been several instances where he knew is capabilities and referred me to a different doctor who have the knowledge and skill necessary to help me in my time of need. When I visit with him his head isn't in a pad or notebook so I do not feel like I am just another checklist in his big book of clients. He is very personal and takes the time to actually talk to me and get to know my family which is nice. I have also been going to him for some time so I have built a good report with him.
1	They have proven to be thorough and caring in the way they handle me and my health problems, they have never given me any cause for doubt and have a good open bedside manner.
-1	My doctor has always taken the necessary time to go over any questions or concerns I may have, even if that meant she was going into her next scheduled appointment late
1	I think that my doctor takes the time to listen to me . She does a good job going over each problem and giving me options . She will explain each one and recommend what she thinks I should do . She is good with following up . If I feel like there is a problem she doesn't just write me off . She takes the time to explore it and make me feel like it has been addressed . She always gives me as much information as possible . If I am not comfortable with something  she is willing to try another avenue . I feel like all in all she puts me first in my health care . 
-1	He has always given me different options and explain them clearly to me. He always stays on me about my health and wants me to be healthy without the help of any medication if possible. 
1	Doctors and nurses ppl must have full trust in and clinic and hospitals along with billing and paper work 
-1	I've started to distrust her as of late. She seems more interested in just refilling my prescriptions and getting me out the door than actually helping me solve my problems. 
1	She takes the time to listen to me and is very thorough in her explanations. Asks about my feelings etc.
-1	feel rushed at the doctors office so i tend to gloss over a lot of problems and hope they just go away
-1	I trust him because he's a good guy and he's kind and smart. I really like him a lot and he's good. Nothing else
-1	I tend to trust my physician inasmuch as he knows me for nearly 30 years and I know him well enough to know when I'm getting short shrift.
-1	I trust my doctor she listens to my feelings & also listens to me regarding my concerns about certain medications 
-1	My doctor seems in a hurry. I think my doctor does not care for me because I refuse treatments for things like the Flu shot. He seems in a rush to get to the next patient. He says things that are contradictory and confusing to me without leaving time for me to follow up on what he said.
-1	I trust in my primary care physician because he is the first to help me in any situation.. this survery is good
-1	It is really hard for me to trust anybody. Also, a lot of doctors are only out for themselves. However, I have had about 8 surgeries and all of my surgeons were awesome and I trust the surgeons! 
1	I like my doctor and trust him, he is caring and thoughtful of me and my needs I would not change doctors, I will continue seeing him
1	my  primary care physician always show interest in my concerns and totally honest in telling me about all of the different treatment options available for my condition. All in all, i completely trust my doctor's decisions on which medical treatments are best for me.
-1	I trust my personal primary care physician because they seem competent and know what they are talking about. I am iffy with doctors because some of them may seem like they are out of touch with society. 
-1	One, as a physician I have seen many physicians make mistakes.  I have trained myself to be objective and results oriented (preferring clinical studies to opinion)..  I have also been privy to compassionate and caring physicians and those who are less so.
1	we just meet two months ago and he has gotten upon all my medical needs.He knows all my medicatios and what test are need in such a short time.
-1	I trust them because they know more than me but am still apprehensive at times. As long as they listen to me. 
1	i trust that my doctor knows what she's doing and if a problem arises, i know that she will diagnose and help me find the best possible treatment/medication for my needs
-1	My doctor is real friendly & will answer all of my questions. She seems to really care about her patients. 
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for many years, so I feel that he knows my background and my problems very well. I always feel I can ask questions if I don't understand something. I also find he is very willing to listen to my feelings about taking a medication and he seems to give them some weight in his decisions.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to explain all my options to me. My primary care physician always takes the time to make sure that I have all my questions answered.
-1	I do not have a primary doctor and do not trust western medicine.  Drugs that are legal are also harmful to people.
-1	In my experience they just want you in and out so they can make their quick money. I had gall bladder pains for a year, and they kept telling me I was just constipated. I filly got someone that did an ultrasound and I had to have immediate surgery, and I was jaundiced. A YEAR of incompetence! 
-1	I don't trust most doctors. They just see you for like maybe 5 minutes and then get rid of you with meds.
1	I trust my primary care condition because it feels like she really cares about my health. She asks a lot of questions about any problems I have and doesn't rush to meet her next patient. She's very thorough.
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part, but at times I feel he rushes to get to the next patient. When I feel he is rushing, I usually wonder how thorough he has been in my case.
-1	Sometimes I feel the Doctor has too many patients to concentrate fully on my medical results. I think they are preoccupied or overwhelmed with all they have going on in their own lives
1	My previous Doctor took time to explain everything to me. I never felt rushed. He knew my medical condition and always provided me with the latest and best treatment for me. 
-1	M doctor is big on test results but not as good as chatting about life. He is getting better. I talk with him more each time, and tell him what I need.
1	I've had my doctor for 10 years now.  He was my fathers doctor for over 20 years and he also treats my sister.  He's kind, very smart and has a lot of experience.  He's always willing work me into his schedule even if it means skipping his lunch or staying late.  So yeah, I trust him completely.
1	I trust my doctor because I had her for years. And she tries to make sure that everthing is done for me.
-1	Somties we must make hard decisions and know what is best for our health and i dont think a physician has all the awnsers
1	I have always trusted my primary care doctor as she listens to me when I talk and always asks me if I understand the treatment/ etc.  She makes sure that I know about all my health issues.
1	I have a background in the medical field and am able to effectively build a rapport with my physician to ensure a trustworthy relationship 
-1	I trust my Doctor because I believe he has been completely honest . He is willing to admit when he doesn't have the answer to all of my health concerns and doesn't hesitate to direct me to other Dr. that can treat my health problems.
-1	They are always rushing and not receptive to questions.  They seem to be overbooking for the money.  I think ultimately it's my responsibility to take care of myself so I don't blame them in my mind.
-1	I'm not very trusting of him, because he shows no concern or care for the problem he is treating. His main focus is money, and when he recommends a treatment or medication, I need to go and research it myself to make sure it is even a viable option. He has suggested some options that are laughable at best.
1	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE HE TAKES THE TIME TO CARE, ASK QUESTIONS, SHARE STORIES AND OTHER EXPERIENCES, EXPLAIN EVERY TEST, EXPLAIN MEDICATIONS. HE IS PROMPT AND COMPASSIONATE AND A CHRISTIAN.
-1	Because with them I feel very safe
1	They always take their time, aren't rushed and explain to me any test results.  They have a conversation with me rather than just reporting things.  They have a genial and relaxed manner.
1	other than she's my best friend and the smartest person i know. there aren't any more reasons needed
-1	I have not been with my primary care physician very long. I was with my last doctor for 22 years and trusted her extremely. She was very thorough and took great care of me. My current doctor is not as thorough and does not prescribe medications, just ginger tea for everything and his blend of vitamins. So I'm not sure how I feel about him just yet.
1	I know him personally as a friend and have worked with him in the past, before he was a doctor. So I also know him professionally.
-1	When I don't feel the doctor listens or is willing to explain I get another doctor.  My current doctor listens, answers questions and looks into my concerns.  We communicate by email and he is always certain to get back to me quickly.
-1	My dr. won't let me ask a lot of questions. Like my diabetes medicine. I tried asking about getting something else but he told me no. I wish there was a way that I could learn more
-1	Doctors that I have dealt with have been upfront with me and told me what is wrong and what I should do about it. Beating around the bush is very uncommon.
-1	that what they are there for give us the best advice regarding our health and mental wealth that's what they studied for
1	They could be lying at any point making up fake illnesses that I could possibly have.  This would be so they make more money off me
-1	I just feel like when I visit my doctor or doctors, that I am just another person for them to get  through. I feel that they are always in a rush to get in and out. Its not always because they have other people to see, sometimes it just feels like they are ready to take a break and they rush just to get out. 
-1	I believe he's a good guy I generally trust him. Gut reaction
-1	I would generally assume that they are giving honest answers, and given their training and experience it would seem sensible to trust them. They would have little reason to deceive me, although some of it involves guessing.
-1	The last time I want to my doctor he seemed rushed and had other things to do do. He said he was going to do a tetnas shot that day. He never marked it in his notes so the nurse never gave it. 
1	I trust my doctor because of the way he presents the situation or the treatment he speaks with confidence and knows what she's talking about so I will take her opinion
1	She has been very thorough and asks questions about me personally we have a good relationship she checks me out 
1	I have a great trust in my doctor.  He lets me know how things are and if any changes need to be made he explains how and why.
1	I have a very good Doctor. I have no reason not to trust him. 
1	I feel my doctor has my best interest in mind and treats me with dignity and respect at all times. I have no complaints about my treatment.
-1	He's been honest but one doctor is not an end-all game when it comes to my health, I should consult multiple doctors if a problem arises. Therefore, I don't have full unwavering trust in one doctor.
-1	I have been with my doctor fer a lot of years as well as he was my fathers doctor. He is more then competent as well as being a trusted source of medical needs and advice.
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for 15 years.  Over this time I have built trust in his diagnosis and treatment options.
1	I do my research before choosing a doctor. I also go off of word of mouth and trust my doctor completely because of the people who recommended hi and my faith. 
-1	I don't know them well; we're on insurance and don't get top notch treatment, and I don't know the doctors well enough to know how objective they are.
1	My doctor is very thorough and he goes over my chart with me.He also ask about how things are going with other Dr he have recommended me to see
-1	Cause they take good care of me and I trust my primary doctor  because she great and honestly I just love my doctor she great 
1	She has been my primary care physician for a good many years and she has shared with me a great deal of her own personal information insofar as it is relatable to things that I have shared with her
-1	i dont have other choice, im not a doctor
1	I trust my doctor because she knows that sometimes treatment options work differently for different people and she lets me know that I might not get the results I want but she has always been willing to work with me when I need to change a treatment option without hesitation. 
1	He does thorough blood tests and other tests to make sure he covers all areas of what may be going on.
-1	My main issue is how doctors are educated and their over reliance on pharmaceutical drugs. In my experience it is the rare doctor who takes the time to actually diagnose a problem rather than putting a 'band aid' on itin the form of some prescribed drugs.
-1	I believe that my primary physician is completely capable and competent to execute his duties well. I do not doubt my doctor's conclusions.
-1	I have an equal amount of trust as I do distrust with my doctor, given that I know him and my mother talk, and that I distrust her entirely with my health causes an issue. I believe that what I say to him can impact my home life, because it gets back to my mother. In general, i suppose I trust doctors, as long as they're not corrupt or anything. When I will be tasked with finding my own doctor, I will look long and hard for someone I believe to be trustworthy
-1	He is willing to listen to me about my illness and help the problem by giving necessary medicine. When ask questions by writing it down he make sure he looks at it. And I ask him what vaccines do I need base on my age. And he make sure it get done the same day.
-1	I think that doctors are humans...they make mistakes. While my dr may have the best intentions, he can make mistakes too. I therefore, trust myself and how I am currently feeling and what I think is best for my body over his opinion of everyday issues that may come up. 
-1	I just do because they talk and ask me questions so they are really educated on that kind of stuff that makes me feel reassured
1	I have trust in my doctor because  he is reliable, kind, helpful and efficient.If I  need information  on my medical  condition he will thoroughly  explain every thing and make a suggestion  about  which decision  would be best but I  would always be the one to decide.
-1	"I don't have a current one, but my last one accused me of drinking a ""starbucks milkshake"" before my blood test when I repeatedly answered that I had not consumed anything that morning for the blood test. He also fought with me about my premie status as a baby and whether or not the scar sites were for a heart surgery I had to fix a murmur. I've seen my own bill for my birth, I had the surgery. He then tried to forcefully sign me up for Jenny Craig before I left, which would not be covered by my insurance, and insisted on offering me the flu shot after I declined several times because I already had the shot. "
-1	because i think sometimes they are un honest and dont know what they are doing or what they are talking about
-1	My doctor himself is trustworthy, however, as he works for a for-profit hospital I know sometimes his decisions are based on money and he has to follow certain rules based on how his bosses see to make money. In order to have complete trust in him he would need to work for a non-profit
1	my doctor always takes the time to explain all  my options to me all what happens with each option  he is very patient with me and my questions
1	I have complete trust in my physician,been going to for 15 years.never had a problem.knows what doing.office staff friendly,clean,and askes how your doing.
-1	I trust my doctor because, when she explain whats going on i will ways get an reason why shes doing what she doing. And the other reason is because im not dead yet. ð
-1	been my family doctor for a long time not just me but friends and family and has alway do their job well
1	I trust my primary care physician because I've been going to her for quite some time and she's been pretty good at keeping me healthy. She knows my health and my needs so well, I almost feel like my chart is the only one in her file. I've asked other people in the office for their opinion on our doctor and all the responses seem to be very favorable. The office staff seems to be very knowledgeable and attentive. It really doesnât bother me to go to my primary care physician at all because I know Iâm going to feel better. 
1	My doctor has always been honest with me and he is very humble. If he doesn't know what's wrong, he will say so and have another doctor come in for a second opinion. 
1	I trust my doctor because shes open and  honest and  takes time to answer  and explain  all the question I ask her
1	I assume that our doctors are trustworthy. They undergo a minimum of seven years of postgraduate schooling, pass rigorous tests and are responsible for our health and the health of our families. But in recent times there are few cases in which doctors are not considering as trustworthy. So I think it is better to check few things before preferring doctor.There are several doctor-rating websites where patients share their reviews and experiences with physicians.
-1	I have just had bad experiences with doctors in the past. I don't want to go into my persol history but sometimes they don't care about patients. 
-1	I usually trust doctors to provide the best care possible for me or my family.  As long as frequent checkups and follow-ups occur, doctors can closely monitor a patient's health and provide the appropriate treatments for any conditions they may have.  As long as a doctor keeps a good relationship with me and makes me feel comfortable I trust in them to have good intentions for my health.

1	I trust my primary care physician because I have gone to their practice since I was a newborn and have had no problems, and have handled all of my vaccines and health issues appropriately with them. I figure that my doctor knows a lot more about health than I do and that alone is a reason to invest a lot of trust in them.
-1	He has always done what is best for me, and I trust his decisions and opinions.  I've had health issues, and he has helped me.
1	My doctor seems to be honest and trustworthy. She has given me good medical advice in the past and I can't see a situation, unless something changes drastically, where I wouldn't trust her. 
-1	I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have been dealing with it for years, but I don't believe my primary care physician has helped me control it. They don't always listen to my concerns with taking certain medications.
-1	I'm not sure they always have my best interest at heart. On the other hand they are willing to give their medical opion.
-1	I have had experiences with Workers Comps doctors who only care about workers comp and not my well being.
-1	Because some people lie too you and  that's not professional it's not cool it's disrespectful and you can be in lots of trouble for doing a customer like that 
-1	to explain the reasons is moot inane and asinine.  questions like this destroy the survey experience
-1	It's great to have a personal doctor and it was could be the way u can save your life.An they care about u more
-1	I think many doctors are merely motivated by the prospect of making money rather than helping others. 
1	My primary care doctor has been helpful to me throughout my life and has always made a point to make sure that I am getting better. 
-1	My doctor's previous decision about my health were trustworthy. He explains my options for treatment & let me make the final decision.
-1	I feel my doctor doesn't really listen to me or take my concerns into consideration. He glosses over everything and will focus on something that isn't a true problem. I also feel he likes to give me every test in the world even if it doesn't pertain to any of my complaints. 
-1	I trust my doctor at some point and sometimes doctor don't know everything they only goes with what the person tell them
1	My doctor seems very competent and knowledgeable. She makes sure to listen to my concerns before discussing treatments. If I have questions about the situation, she answers them thoroughly. She has many years of experience and seems to know what she is talking about.
-1	I have trust in my primary physician to a degree because no doctor deserves total trust. You know your body and sometimes you have to go with your own gut feeling.
-1	Doctors in general I feel can be trusted. If anything, their reputation is on the line, and in any field, reputation is key.
-1	"Along with the strong development trend of the market economy, many social values have been changed: social relations, morals and morality are also reversed. For the medical industry, besides a number of achievements are very proud, a small part of the doctor insensitive to the pain of the patient, against the moral, contrary to conscience, doctrine, do ""stained ""The image of the noble profession of medicine has traditioned for many generations. So what is morality? What is yoga? What is the content of ethics? What are the causes of medical ethics? How to improve ethical issues in the health sector? These are urgent issues of the society today."
-1	I have been several times to my doctor and have mentioned certain pains or issues and if it is not the focus of the visit they are kinda brushed off.  This has happened several times so I don't completely trust my physician.
-1	I trust my doctor a greater deal. She has always provided with a ton information for all treatments. When I call with questions she is always very happy to help or research information for me.
-1	I trust my primary care phycician. Since coming into her care she has always been helpful as kind. I believe she helps me to the extent of her abilities. 
-1	He takes the time to listen and then to explain. He asks me questions to understand me and is most often correct.
1	I have been seeing my PCP for many years. Since I am in good health, we rarely have issues requiring lots of medical direction or intervention. However, in the conversations we have had, I trust his judgment and expertise. He has always been straightforward with me about illnesses and treatment.
1	I trust my OBGYN, I just think he is a little c-section happy.  Two high risk pregnancies and two c-sections for someone who wanted a natural birth is a little disappointing, but everyone is healthy and alive so can't complain with the results.
-1	My doctor always makes sure to look over everything and run multiple tests if needed. He's very concerned about how you're feeling and finding an answer. On the other hand, one of the nurse practitioners likes things that are convenient for her and usually comes up with a diagnosis without further investigation. Overall I trust my doctor but not the other staff.
-1	I trust my doctor because my doctor hasn't given me reason not to. She answers any and all questions that I have.
-1	"I think most physicians do care about there patients. I have worked with some who think it is a paycheck and like the ""doctor"" title and pay not the work and it shows."
1	I have two Primary care physician's so I have the luxury of second opinions. I trust both of them as they have been my doctors for a long time and we have a good relationship that is open in every way. They always include my thoughts in discussing medicines and procedures and are quick to chastise me for my lack of discipline on my diet and exercise when needed.
1	I trust my doctor b/c when I first started seeing her I was a mess and she ran labs on me and found a ton of my problems and worked hard to fix all the problems and every 6 months she runs labs on me to make sure all are in the level they need to be.
1	Dr. answers my questions whether time  is factor or not.  Does not just give an answer to shut me up, is truthful.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing them since I was young. My whole family goes to the same practice and we have had a lot of positive experiences and received good health care.
-1	My doctor does not always take time when I see him.  He hardly spends time with me. That is all I have to say.
1	I trust my physician because he is very nice and kind. and I feel that he wants the best for me. He gives me no reasons to not trust him.
-1	the reason why I trust my doctor is because he is always explaining  my health and wellbeing very clearly to me.
-1	I trust in my primary care physician to a certain extent . Sometimes, I do not always agree with everything that she says. But, I feel she thinks she is right and that is fine but I can agree to disagree with her. I do not always agree but I try her way first .  If it gets so I do not fully trust her opinion then I will find another primary care physician. 
1	He has been practicing for many years with a very solid reputation. He takes the time to listen. He seems to genuinely care about the well-being of his patients 
-1	I lost trust in past doctor's because it became completely obvious that they had taken on too many patients and their time and attention lacked because of it. They started to care more about the money than anything else. I left that doctor and moved on to the one I am with now. I feel like she cares more about what I have to say, but she also kind of rushes through things. She just opened her practice so i'm afraid with time, she will get worse and not care as much anymore. Sometimes it seems like it really is all about the money with doctors. They are a few that really do care though. My kids' pediatrician is a great doctor and I wouldn't want them going anywhere else. I've met more doctors that didn't seem to care than doctors that really do seem to care. 
1	Sometimes doctors are full of shit but you can trust them. Most of them take their job seriously and can gonany length to care for their patients. Some doctors on the other hand do not give a rat Ass. 
-1	I had one that I know that I couldn't trust but all the rest are good people and they make sure that I have all of the information that I need
-1	Doctors spend minimal time with their patients and don't devote honest care to them. They always seem really busy. 
1	My current physician seems trustworthy and has given me good recommendations to improve my everyday health which have been working. 
-1	They don't always take my concerns into account. They are in a hurry to get me out of the office a lot of the time 
-1	I truly trust my doctor. She seems concerned is always pleasant, answers my questions and gives me lots of options.

1	Because for the most part the have a pleasurable bedside manner. And I am well versed in whatever to malady may be.
1	My family has used our primary care doctor for many years and he has always done a great job in treating us.  He has never given us any reason to feel like he doesn't have our best care as a priority and for that we have complete faith and trust in him.  He's never done us wrong.
-1	I think that my doctor is a good and genuinely knowledgeable person, but sometimes thinks he needs to dumb down explanations or ease my worries instead of giving me all the facts.
-1	"I distrust any doctor because I have had bad experiences with them in the past.  Ultimately I believe they are interesting in making money and nothing else.  Most of the time they seem bothered by your problems and do not listen to what I have to say.  I've been told before to take antidepressants for a pain in my stomach, which turned out to be a cyst on my ovary.  It took FIVE doctors to get a diagnosis that wasn't ""you're crazy."""
-1	I trust my physician because I know he graduated from a really good medical school. He also is very kind and takes him time to explain everything so you can understand it.

-1	I just got a new Doctor and he is very good and explains everything to me very well which makes me feel like he is concerned and wants to make sure I understand.
1	My doctor is a great doctor.  He tells you straight about medical information.  I have researched him and he does not participate in pharmaceutical company kickbacks.
-1	"I mostly trust my doctor but sometimes I believe that doctors are only taught one way of thinking and therefore do not consider alternative treatments in all cases but rather use only drugs to ""fix"" issues."
-1	I do not trust my primary care physician because he acts very rushed. He only wants to deal with one issue per appointment. I am also worried that doctors are encouraged to prescribe pharmaceuticals over other treatment options.
-1	"He is often in a hurry to get to the next patient and does a poor job of explaining my condition/medication and shows no sympathy.  Just because someone is a ""doctor"" does not mean they are any good.  "
1	My primary care physician does not make recommendations lightly and explains decisions carefully. He listens to my concerns.
1	I am able to ask any questions and have those questions thoroughly answered.  Explanations are given as the examination is being conducted.
-1	I really love this idea, and I think it's really good, and interesting, this also shows a great variety of many things, and I personally think this is super interesting, and really shows a lot of information, and things.
1	Past experiences in hospital and evaluations,Help given to family and friends,hospital meeting to discuss treatment and future options
1	I believe my doctor is competent and knowledgable.  She has specialized training, so I often defer to her.  She is always professiol, and I trust the hospital she works for.  She is a good person who genuinely seems interested in promoting my health and well being.
-1	my doctor sees so many patients they usually diagnos you with what everyone else has. they only spend like 5 minutes with you.
-1	I know enough medical information to trust that my doctor is doing what is best for me and I can do my own research for any treatment plans suggested by him or her
1	I think my doctor is a good doctor and a good person who cares about his patients and works very hard. I rarely completely trust anybody because I overly cautious. 
-1	Doctors in general tend to over prescribe medications and are not explaining any of the side effects that they might cause.
-1	i do not feel a sense of closeness to my doctor that i would like to feel.  Sometimes he does not seem like he really listens and understands me
-1	My doctor always listens to my concerns and addresses them in a timely manner. I don't feel neglected or rushed when I am at my  appointment. 
-1	I think some doctors are gifted in what thry do. And really perform and do an excellent job rather than other doesn't know the situation to what is been explained to them.
1	I trust my primary care physician, because I have been her patient for a while. She makes sure she asks me about my current condition. She listened to my concerns, and doesn't only give me one option when it comes to treatments. She also asks about my family and career. 
-1	he knows what is best for me  they care about what happens to people because of their health. Doctors care I believe
1	Doctors take an oath of not doing harm and with the risk of malpractice they would not do what is convenient but what is right.
1	From my overall history with doctors, I trust my current doctor almost completely. She is young and I haven't had her for long (about 2 years), which is why she doen't have my complete trust yet. She does care about me and my health and is very thorough in her assessments. I am very pleased to have her.
-1	I feel doctors do not generally look at all options and want to do what is best for their schedule, not what is best for the patients needs
1	I trust the  doctor to do the  right thing concerning my medical needs.  often discuss my concerns and issues with my doctor, and then take it from that point.
-1	I believe I bring with me an army of negative people.  It has been this way for over ten years.  Without me these people get nothing.  It is difficult for me to focus on my life when so much of it revolves around other people.  Of course the only evidence to me is going from a grade a student to homeless and unemployed.  Like I set that goal for myself.  I find life gives me the opposite of what I ask for.  However due to current small successes I am beginning to change my opinion and that I believe will also change my homelessness.  That being said people who set out to help me find they now become part of this negative crowd's aggressiveness.  Who to blame but me.  There is no evidence.  It's about a person's attitude and their true intentions.  I trust my helpers to make informed decisions according to their god given abilities and people given authorities.  The second amendment.  The fifth amendment.  To defend the first.
-1	In the past I have been misdiagnosed three times finally I found a nice doctor who tested me for Lyme disease and it came back positive being misdiagnosed made it worse and very hard to eliminate.
-1	I had a doctor that did all of the things above and I trusted him completely but he left medical practice and went into administration.  I now have a new doctor and have only seen her a couple of times so there hasn't been time to develop the trust you need with a doctor.  So far this doctor seems only interested in making money off of the insurance companies.
-1	She takes the time to explain things and answer any questions I might have.
1	My doctor has always been upfront with me regarding my health care and options. Very through with my testing and responsible with overseeing my wellbeing.
1	My PCP has been very open about her reasoning and thought processes and gone out of her way to set me up with the next steps for me to pursue. She listens to my concerns and thoughts as well.
1	I have known my doctor for quite a few years and completely trust her with all my medical needs. She knows what is best for me and what I need to do to feel good 
1	For one, doctors go through many years of education; they strive and work hard to gain the knowledge needed solely to help others. This career is a selfless one. Also, any health and medical situation I've been in, the advice and/or medicine prescribed has worked efficiently to fix the issues. I've no reason to not trust doctors. 
-1	They have put in a lot of work to get where they are in their field. They are going to make sure they are doing their job right.
-1	I am pretty neutral with doctors - it is their job to tell me what is wrong, but most of the time, I already know what is wrong with myself. Ideally, I'd like to just get a solution to the problem from what I tell the doctors, instead of having to go through the process of them telling me what I already know. 
1	I trust my physician because he seems very thorough with his exams and questions for me.  He listens to me and seems to have my best interests.
1	They make me feel cared for and I know that they know what they are talking about. They also make it a point to explain things to me so I completely understand.
-1	I don't completely trust anyone, the doctor is there to make money and they can be easily brought my the pharmacal company
-1	He may not have the best bedside manner but he's always utd on all new and current medical information and I feel I get great care just too faced paced if that makes sense
-1	I don't have a PCP. I  have no insurance so I have to visit clinics and see different nurses, almost never a doctor. I can't think of a time I've seen a doctor. I generally trust the nurses because the conditions I've had are fairly simple to treat. I went in knowing I needed some kind of antibiotic so it was easy to trust the diagnosis. 
-1	Most doctors care about their patients. Unfortunately, the system is set up so they probably cannot spend as much time with each patient as they would like. I think they do the best they can given the circumstances but I also believe in taking responsibility for my own health. I take everything with a grain of salt and often wonder if health professionals are not telling me everything for their own financial gain (i.e. pharma companies supplying incentives for pushing certain medications/treatments).
1	Ive been going to my doctor for over 2 years and feel very confident when i see her. She makes me feel welcome and cared about
-1	I trust my primary care physician based on 4 years experience with her. I receive my care through VA and I know she's always busy, but, hey, she even laughs at my jokes.
1	The main reason I trust my doctor is that I have been going to him for many years for yearly check ups and other medical attention and over time I have discovered that his diagnosis is generally correct and that he has my best interests at heart. 
-1	One of the reasons is because the physician seeks to find ways or things that are beneficial. Sometimes certain information is held back for the sake of not telling everything in order to gain more power that gives the physician the upper hand. That is my speculation based on a lot of things that are taking place today. 
-1	I typically trust doctors who have a lot of experience. I trust my doctor to know the best treatments for me, but I don't always expect my doctor to know everything about me. Sometimes, doctors don't believe what I have to say if it is strange or abnormal. 
-1	My primary is kind and caring.  She is also educated and thorough in her practices.  She makes me and my opinions matter.
1	My PCP is a doctor for the right reasons. He cares. He has never tried to rush me out or not believe me in describing issues I had.
-1	Have only seen him 2x but he seems nice and  seemed to know what he he doing, more than willing to,set up appointments for me with other hwpealthcare specialists
1	I have had the same primary care doctor for quite a number of years and she has always taken the time with me to figure out any problems and treatments available. She helps me come to a decision with treatment plans, taking my day to day life into account. If she doesn't know an answer, she will tell me, and refer me to a specialist she trusts to help me.
-1	I feel that I can trust my doctor. If I couldn't trust my doctor I would choose another that I would be comfortable with. 
1	He took an oath to make sure his patients are cared for to the best of his ability. He went to school for years to get to where he is, and that means it's persol for him.
-1	i'd like to think most doctors are good. some out there are terrible and just want to make more money. but there are plenty good ones out there to trust
1	"My new doctor is quite friendly in every interaction I've had with them be it in person, over the phone, or through online messaging. He makes eye contact and generally has a smile on his face. You can just ""feel"" that he genuinely cares about his job and helping his patients. He actively listens to everything I have to say, and I get the impression he hears my hesitation or what I don't say just as much as my words. I don't just feel like a patient with him, but a member of a team. We work together to come up with the best plan of action in treating my health needs."
-1	Sometimes doctors does not explore all the options available and they sometimes treat people differently because of race or status
1	I had the chance to review other physicians before choosing the actual one. I have also learned from a close family ember about my doctor's qualities. He indeed proved to be very professional and also close to his patients.
1	I trust my PCP because she always tells me the truth, even if it is not what i want to hear. She has never lead me wrong. She takes the time to listen and do a full assessment. 
-1	"I trust my primary care physician because I believe that (while it is a generalization), doctors are overall very dependable. However, I also feel as though many physicians will tell patients they ""need"" certain testing, only for their own financial gain."
-1	I have had things happen in the past-(wrong doses prescribed, not listening to serious concerns and misdiagnosis that cost me a lot of heartaches and physical consequences- as a result I am very apprehensive in trusting fully what any doctor tells me. I question everything a doctor tells me and I research my issues. 
1	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a long time and he has always looked out for my well being. I never had any issues with him and I trust his medical advice based on prior experience.
1	I trust my doctor because she always explain every thing in detail about what's going on with any issue that arises and always ask me if I have any questions before I leave.
1	my doctor is honest with me. She gives me the advise I need. If I have a problem, I can rely on my doctor to give me the answers I need and require, I have a lot of failh in my doctor.
1	I trust my primary doctor because she takes the time to talk to me and to listen to me. She asks me questions pertaining to the situation and is thorough in explaining what her opinion is. 
-1	Doctors and arrogant and a high percentage of them are sociopaths. They represent the pharmaceutical industry and they will deny their rx drug prescriptions caused anyone any harm. Doctors are unethical and dangerous as they put their ego and money ahead of the public's best interest. I stay away from them and hate most I have ever had the misfortune to come in contact with.  The only times I have gotten better from anything is when i have avoided or stopped going to allopathic doctors. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because they are in the profession for a time being and they would know best.  They would provide the best services possible to meet my needs and based on the their experience the can provide the appropriate type of medication etc.
1	My doctor has never lead me wrong. My doctor has always given great advice.
-1	Doctors are human and make mistakes. Doctors don't know it all. I rely on my common sense also. Two opinions is better than one.
1	We went to the same high school. She was always a smart and sweet person. By knowing her background I trust her completely. She has always been good when I visit her at the doctor. 
-1	He spends a long time with me and makes sure I have a lot of reading material to take home. He makes sure in depth that everything is okay and makes sure to run regular tests.
-1	I think my doctor is very good but sometimes doesn't have complete understanding of my medical conditions.
1	I have been going to the same doctor for about ten years. He is very thorough and knows my medical needs. He hasn't failed me yet and has helped me tremendously in all aspects of my health.
-1	I trust my doctor because as of right now they have not steered me wrong. I have taken the prescriptions prescribed to me and it has fixed my issues and I haven't had any bad experiences yet.
-1	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN MY DOCTOR FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND HE KNOWS MY CHART. 
-1	I don't have a regular primary care physician but in general towards doctors I do not have complete faith in them. The few times that I have had to take either myself or my child to an emergency room, the doctor completely missed something that was extremely important. Most think that you are drug seeking and ignore what could be going on. There are times I trust their judgement but I will speak up if I believe that they are wrong or not being as thorough as I think they should be. 
1	I have know my doctor for 14 years and trust him totally.  His office is very close and feel confident in discussing any topic.
-1	I trust them for the most part. It's an extreme amount of school and experience required to be one so they aren't messing around. Though, sometimes, they are in a rush and your problem may be really low acuity in their eyes so they may hastily treat you.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is very friendly, trustworthy and always make sure I'm comfortable.
-1	Not all doctors let patients know all of their options as far as treatments are concerned. I try to trust my doctors because I have to. They are the ones with the MDs in ultimately should know best. I do use my own judgment at the end of the day but put trust in my doctors and what they tell me.
-1	A couple of times she had misdiagnose my illness. I went to a specialist after talking to my Primary care practician
1	I have been with my doctor for 15 years.  She is awesome and has made me feel completely comfortable with all of my health care questions and needs.  I travel almost an hour to see her as her practice moved.  I have no qualms about driving that distance because I know I am getting superior health care.
1	Very knowledgeable. Works for an excellent health system. Great bedside manner and caring. Takes the time to hear and address my concerns.  I don't feel rushed during my appointment.
-1	My doctor has always lead me in the right direction when examining and prescribing me medicine and i trust there training.
-1	I believe he is looking out on my behalf.  He is very down to earth and honest.  He gives me the facts and I do my best to understand anything he tells me.  I do believe him, I do not think he tries to give me any false information.
1	I think that my doctor just wants whats best for me so I need to listen to her always and make sure that I live a healthy life
-1	My health is more important to me than it is to him.  I have read the results of the 8 year study by Arizo University on chelation.  My physician who offers chelation has not read the results of the study.  Absolute trust would mean that a second opinion is never justified.  My wife just had a bacteria eat away some of her bone below her lower jaw tooth.  Many periodontists would still treat this using bone grafts, while a better treatment using a laser is available.  We selected a periodontist that uses the laser approach.
1	I trust him. He always runs extra tests and checks on me clearly.
1	I completely trust my doctor as I have known her for a long time, and she is also a friend of the family. She is highly regarded by her peers and the medical community in general. She is very professional, honest, and kind.
-1	"I don't think any doctor or physician is out to like to me or be dishonest. They wouldn't have chosen the profession if they didn't want to genuinely help people. The money is good, but the time investment is huge. Sure they may prescribe me a particular medicine to get ""kickbacks"" or something, but I feel they are fairly trustworthy."
1	I trust my primary care physician because she listens to my concerns and provides clear explanations and suggestions on how to overcome them.
1	I trust my physician because they were the one able to get certain medical conditions under control while previous doctors have not. I have gotten better while under their care.
-1	They know a lot more about the medical field than me. They wen to medical school, studied and learned more things than I know. Its usually better to trust an experts opinion on things like this. 
1	I have no reason to distrust. He has answered every question I have had about myself and family members without sugar coating anything. He is very upfront and honest.
-1	I have been seeing my current primary care physician for nearly 4 years. She is very competent, compassionate, and will send me to specialists if I have medical problems that she cannot treat. 
1	I think my trust comes mainly from the time my dr. is willing to spend with me. She takes the time to talk and get to know me and what my life looks like. She integrates any options into what works in my situation. 
1	I trust them because we have built up a relationship in the past. It has taken time but we have a good feel for each other
-1	It's not more of a trust or distrust, it is more of a time thing. I feel like doctors, including my own, need to be able to spend more than 3-5 minutes with a patient. Yes, I know I have a cough and sneezing, so my asthma is acting up. Don't just throw a new inhaler on me. Give me some options and other things I can do at home. I want to know the options I have for medications too. So I feel that adds a little mistrust, but I still feel like he is a good physician. I hope that makes sense. 
-1	I don't really trust them and find myself changing and getting second and third opinions all the time. I feel like the doctors don't really pay attention to what I am saying or use their head to think of outside the box ideas. Basically I tell them how I feel and they agree, they don't ask or think of ways or things my pain could be from. I could say that I feel like a horse and they would give me horse pulls.
-1	I trust my doctor because she seems to care about me - and listen to me when I talk. I have never had a problem talking to my doctor.
-1	Recently discovered an enlarged thyroid.  My PCP ordered thyroid ultrasound but, did not order TSH level.  I had to call office and suggest this be ordered.  
-1	I trust my doctor. But I believe that test need to be ran and blood work. My doctor can't always go with the simple answer. Sometimes a little more research needs to be done. Need to make sure I am healthily instead of always worrying about if my insurance will pay.
-1	My doctor has always been honest with me and had my best interest at heart.  Se has never recommended anything or any tests that were not necessary
1	I have been going to the same doctors my whole life. They have all my info and they have had it since I was a little kid. I can trust them because they know all there is to know about me. I almost lost trust in them when they did not send one of my important documents over to my school, but then we kept calling the office until they sent this. I really do not know if you are reading this but if you are then know in a game of 1 on 1 basketball you cannot gaurd me.
-1	Sometimes she will give quick fixes to a problem instead of finding a long-term answer or resolution.
-1	My primary care physician is quick to prescribe medication and has often overlooked diagnoses when reviewing my records. She schedules appointments 15 minutes apart and then rushes you during your visit. 
-1	I trust them to do the right thing because they studied a long time, took an oath to help patients, and should care about people.  I have to trust them.
1	my primary doctor has all my my health in good hands and she works to keep me on the right track. she is truly successfully keeping her pentions in good health 
-1	I have great trust in my current position because I have seen my physician long enough that I trust what she will say and I trust that she understands what treatment is necessary. At this point I have established A rapport to give her complete trust. 
-1	It's difficult for my PCP to find the time to see me, and when she does, I almost always feel rushed and unable to get through my appointment in a timely manner.
1	Having had the same doctor, nursing and staff for over ten years, has built trust in his decesions. Even after several years have poor health the overall satisfaction with medical care still exists, even with costs and scripts rising, staff have tried to provide all avenues od discounts that may help me
-1	"I generally trust my doctor to prescribe what's best for me, but not to the fullest. I have sometimes felt like I was being rushed out the door instead of them hearing me out all the way. I have an anxiety issue that comes with very frightening chest pains occasionally. I was seen for this problem and had all my labs done and my heart checked out which ruled out anything ""serious."" I was put on medication for anxiety and not really followed up with. I stopped and just did the research for myself on what's wrong with me since my doctor couldn't seem to figure out what it was beyond anxiety."
1	I trust my primary care physician because she took the time to get to know me and listen to my concerns. She regularly asks questions about things we've discussed previously.
-1	For the most part I trust my primary care physician. When other doctors had turned down sending me to a specialist for a condition that I had for several years that still had not been addressed, my primary care doctor sent me to a specialist to get it checked out. Furthermore, some small issues that I had been having over the years she took the time to look into to give me a full and proper diagnosis. 
-1	They have more medical training than me. I do not know anything regarding the field of medicine and that is their job. I have to depend on what they know, similar to how people depend on me for IT advise.
1	I have been in the hospital more than I can ever think of, and every time I go to the hospital, my doctor is the best that I have ever found
1	In the time I've been seeing him he has told me things that I NEEDED to hear rather than what I wanted to hear. He always spends as much time as is necessary with me to make sure I understand my options and instructions. 
-1	I have a good endocrinologist that I trust with medical issues; however, when it comes to diet recommendations he does not have accurate info.  I listen to my body and know that I must eat a ketogenic diet which my doctor does not agree with.
-1	I respect and trust in the ability, expertise and intentions of my physician. However, he is still just a person, and no one is infallible.
-1	I feel like I trust physicians in general, however, if I was about to make a serious decision regarding my health, I would not hesitate to get a second opinion if I felt uncomfortable. 
-1	they do not make money of of me not coming back. they need to know i will come back. they took an oath to help people and do what is right
1	Thus, far I have had mostly positive experiences with my primary care doctor. Everything I have been prescribed has usually worked well enough.
-1	Sometimes I feel doctors in general cannot recommend the best course of treatment for a patient if he or she doesn't have health insurance.
-1	Some doctors are good and some are not so good. They are just in it for the money. I really wish there were better doctors. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because everything he has told me has improved my quality of life. I have yet to experience anything bad and his knowledge is evident at first glance.
-1	My doctor is a good doctor, but her staff is not very responsive to patients needs. She doesn't understand my personal problems as well as she should.
1	primary care physicians are there to help us, people may have different outlooks on treatment but none of them have a medical degree to back up there beliefs. We have doctors for a reason, they are trying to help us get well. Even a physical can make an error in treatment, I recently has a visit do the dermatologist and he prescribed me medication that did not help.There was no reason of me to be concerned, I called him back and got a different drug that helped. The amount of knowledge and understanding of science that the MD have is incredible. I'm very grateful for there service. Trusting your physician is important part of anybodies life, they will not harm you or judge you , they are there to help.
1	I haven't had any problems with following instructions from any of them for the last five years,and I've had a few medical procedures done.
1	She always has sound advice about my health whether I like it or not. I am able to use the same doctor for all my needs. 
1	I trust my doctor because she explains things thoroughly to me.  We have a good relationship for 15 years.  When I have something that others feel is trivial she listens to me and we discussed.  
1	I trust my neurologist because she is very knowledgeable and informed regarding all of my medical conditions. I have complete trust in her
-1	She just appears very genuine. I don't get the slightest hint of anything off about her. I've been seeing her for a few years now, and on more than one occasion, even when she's clearly running behind schedule, she shows no rush to be through with me. She feels like an ally.
-1	Sometimes I feel that my primary care physician is stretched too thin and sees too many patients. I realize he cannot remember everything, but he does have my electronic medical record readily available to him. I feel that often I have to repeat issues I have, and I don't think he is just testing my understanding. I think he has forgotten and not bothered to remind himself by reviewing my record. I also have to call the office because I will sometimes get test results before they call me about them. I don't think that my physician would intentionally harm me or lie to me, I just think that he is seeing too many patients - putting quantity over quality to make a profit.
-1	I do not have insurance and cannot afford a Primary care physician. I do not trust physcians because they have too many patients to provide me special attention
-1	I have never really had a regular doctor, so I've never really gotten to know one very well. The doctor I have currently I like a great deal. I trust her decisions and she is very kind and explains things very well. I have only seen her a handful of times though.
1	I trust that they will make the right decision and give me options and reasons as to why. if you can't trust them to do so who can you trust
1	She always goes above and beyond. She never stops trying until she finds whats wrong. 
-1	Had a doctor that I was going to  for years.  Had  complete trust in the doctor. She knew my history.  She listened to me, was concerned about my health she helped me on a lot of my health decisions.
1	I trust my PCP completely as he is the one who has the credentials, knowledege and experience to give advice and treat patients, including myself.I believe my doctor is honest and  I trust his decisions completely based on his thoroughness and willingness to answer and address any questions I have.
1	I've been going to the same doctor since I was an infant.  He's well known in town and well liked.  He spends as much time as you need NEVER giving you the feeling that he's rushed.  Never.  He sits and listens quietly and intently to what you have to say.  Which also makes the patients outside waiting impatient and complain until they get in the room and he shows them the same patient listening to their symptoms, issues.  That's why I wait patiently when I'm waiting because I know what he's doing.  
-1	I have a good doctor.  In most things I trust what she says.  However I am responsible for my own care and if something seems risky it is best to get more information on it first.  I try to avoid taking a lot of medications that has bad side effects.  
1	I trust my doc because he is trustworthy. He has been faithful in trying certain things to get my health in better standing. He knows what I am willing and unwilling to try. He is very attentive when I explain what my symptoms are. Also, he is very knowledgeable about the disease I have been diagnosed with. He is smart, observant, full of knowledge and skill. 
-1	I trust doctors because that's the only gap between dying from a cold and living with cancer. I believe doctors are really important and valuable to the world for the sense of security and safety. They are the closest things to magicians due to the miracle they are able to perform.
-1	I just started with a new primary care physician so I answered based on my experiences with my past doctor.  She always took the time to answer questions and provide information and made sure that everything was understood.  She also was very interested in my thoughts regarding my medical situation and/or treatment.
1	my doctor is paient, lookinks me in the eye sk me question as well i feel like i can ask my doctor question she tell me what shots , treats, examesi need  friendly, honest, and i feel she has my best interest at heart.
-1	I completely trust this doctor because two years ago I had a knot in my neck, and right away I went to see my Primary Care Doctor. After examining the knot, and telling him my other symptoms, he did not beat around the bush, he sent me directly to a specialist who then biopsied the knot, and it turned out to be cancer. This doctor does not waste my time or his, and cares deeply about his patients.
-1	I have been seeing my primary doctor for several years, and she is well known and thought of in our small community. I know her outside of the office as well. I fully trust her to help me solve any medical issues, or to at least help direct to any specialist I may need.
-1	I have only had my doctor for a year and have not had any new treatments or diagnosis since being her patient
-1	My doctor seems to be generally caring and concerned for my well-being. This also seems to be true for her other patients. While I don't always feel like the priority, I do feel as though I am cared for in a proper manner.
-1	My doctor is very open when discussing medical issues and concerns with me.  There is no issue discussing alternatives, side effects, etc.  The doctor never makes me feel uncomfortable and has always provided me with accurate information.
1	"Because my primary doctor sent me to a specialist, I have a second opinion that concurs with her conclusions and course of treatment so I trust my doctor.  When she isn't sure, she sends me to a specialist--she doesn't guess or ""wing it"".  She has lab tests performed routinely and bases decisions upon data."
-1	I trust my health care provider to keep me looking and feeling healthy and give me great advice on my body and what I can do to improve 
1	He has never let me down after many years and has always gone to extreme length s to assure my treatment
-1	I don't really trust doctors because in the United States, where I live, healthcare is a for-profit industry. Doctors are basically no different than salesman, and, selling products myself, I know what goes into trying to get people to buy a product. It's not honest; it's not about care; it's about money. I also think many doctors are not realistic about the way people live their lives.
1	My doctor takes extra time to look for different altertives for me. She also always finds different ways to explain things to make sure I fully understand.
-1	As a human being I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, unless they prove otherwise. As far as regarding my relationship with my primary physician, I would say it is mostly trustworthy. But I do not put pass anybody moving in a way of their own benefit. I am in my sound mind when it comes down to my health, you can not pay enough for it, and it is very precious. So with that being said I trust me only. My health is very important for me. I try to be well versed in it myself, so I can know what is going on with me. My body is my temple.
-1	I often trust what doctors are telling me because most of the time, they are right. I believe that most doctors in America are well trained in medicine, so I would expect them to be very helpful and/or professional.
-1	You  can't  put  trust  in  anybody  to  a certain  point  ,  you  can  weigh  the  many  options  out,  but  you have  to make the  best  choice   for  you
-1	I've been seeing a D O instead of an MD for over 8 years. He use to just come in and make a few notes, get up, leave and then come back with prescriptions. Unless, I had a cold or rash or the kidney stone that one time. He believed in pushing pills. I have degenerative disk disease and have had several fusions. Since the government crackdown, he got himself (IMO) some trouble. I went to him last time and he could not believe that nobody had done an image on my lower back (no surgeries there). My point is, he's the doctor. Why should I be the one to order an image? Now, with the government crackdown, he's actually got to do his job!! I'm highly considering changing because I don't believe he is that good. 
-1	Sometimes to dis day then back from twenty years they hardly do a phiscal check. No a days there always just listen what you say and on a computer..
1	She has been my physician for many years and has always looked out for my best interests. I have full confidence.
-1	"She answers all of my questions and gives reasons why she is advocating something that I may ""waffle' with.  She listens carefully appearing to see that I as a patient do know myself quite well."
-1	i trust my primary physician because i have not encountered a reason not to trust her. Until you break my trust, I trust you
1	 I've been going to my doctor for about 10 years and I feel she knows me well. She has been very caring when I had upsetting personal experiences in my life. I definitely feel she listens to what I have to say.
1	I trust my doctor because he has never  done anything that has made me question his ability of motives. Everything that is done or tested for me has a specific reason that he explains to me. 
-1	I trust my doctor with most things some things I research on my own especially if it is about taking a new medicine
-1	I mostly trust my physician, but I also do my own research just in case anything went amiss, after all, it's our own body, and we should do most of the jobs taking care of it
-1	I lived next to my primary physician for a few years and we always got along very well, having that personal relationship was one of the reasons we chose him, and him being a younger person knowing he would be around for awhile also helped.
-1	I spend more time in the waiting room than I spend witj my doctor about my condition. She is her short when it comes to going over health options
-1	My doctor is a confident and intelligent person whom I respect. He is willing to here my thought s and opinions on my own health and but as I have cultivated a reputation of years with the man, I know that I can trust in his expertise. 
-1	The do not listen. My issues are important and they do not take them serious. It is annoying.
1	I have seen my primary care physician for a few years now, and have only seen my health improve during this time. I have had no reason to distrust her or feel that her opinions of me are biased in any way. She has always been open to any questions I have, and has been willing to look at a variety of options for medical issues that I have had, and adjust things based on how I feel. She'll check in to make sure that I've followed up with other appointments as necessary, and I just generally tend to feel that she really cares about her patients. I don't feel like I'm in a rush, and she always treats me like a person, not just part of her job, which I appreciate. I've also looked online and she's had good ratings from other people, as well as working with a highly rated medical group that other members of my family have gone to as well. I feel like she has the resources available to help with any treatment I may need, and has utilized them in the past when she thought some other specialist may be of more help than she is. Prior to this, I didn't have good experiences with doctors. They tended not to listen to my problems, and were quick to make assumptions. In one case, a doctor refused to listen to the fact that I believed I was allergic to a medication I was taking, and I actually ended up in the ER. This current doctor is the first one that I feel listens and is actually willing to help with any issues that I have come up.
1	I trust doctor she's very trusting and she's knows what my condition going to be and what medication to take and keep up to date with it
-1	I feel that my doctor knows  enough to trsut him but sometimes its okay to get a second opionon to be srure
1	He is very thorough and he always give you options.  He calls to make sure you are okay after hours. He is always giving suggestions on cutting the cost of your prescriptions. 
1	I trust her because she genuinely seems likes she wants to help and she has the knowledge to do so.  She is very kind but stern, and does talk about a lot of options I may have.  She also is quick to refer me if she knows I would be better suited with a specialist.  My only distrust would be that she is fairly young, so she does not have the experience of the more established physicians.
-1	I feel like doctors today are too busy.  They aren't thorough on examinations and do not make sure you understand what they are telling you.  Their practice earns money in volume so they move people in and out as fast as possible.
-1	I feel like doctors don't treat you as a person, they treat you by how they judge you when you first come in. They already have you figured out and they won't listen to you no matter what they say. 
-1	I believe most doctors do settle for medications when there are other alternatives available. Medications are very expensive, some doctors get kickbacks from sales. I believe most harsh medications actually cause worse physical reactions.
1	"I'm sure there are ""bad"" doctors but I have only had positive experiences. They have been attentive and seemed to genuinely care. I also trust their expertise."
1	I've been with my doctor for a long and he understand my illnesses and treats with the utmost care. He always makes my health and wellbeing first priority. 
-1	Doctors do what the hiarchy tells them what to do. In this day and age, our health condition is a push-pull battle between our insurance plans, and how much influence the drug companies have over the doctor's profit potentual for prescribing what is best in their best income, not what is best for the patient. For that reason, I really don't trust anyone unless I can verify their recommendations without a shadow of a doubt that they are not selling me out.
-1	I feel like my primary care physician and most in general just want to constantly put people on medication to fix everything. I don't want to be on a bunch of medication with negative side effects and that's all they try to push in order to fix problems. The lack of options causes my distrust in my doctor.
-1	I believe that they can be trusted for the most part. I do believe they may prescribe certain medicines to get a kickback but I dont believe they would completely lie about a condition.

-1	I trust my primary physician because I think he gives me the best advice for my condition. Sometimes he gives me general information that I don't think is best applied to me. I usually would tell him and he would suggest something different.
1	They treat me as a friend. Being a medical professional they done use word to dum down what is being discussed. I much rather they tell me using the medical term vs trying to avoid miscommuication
1	Doctor  John Smith in Springfield is my doctor. He is the kindest and considerate person I have ever had as a doctor. The one I had before was Jane Doe, she was mean rude and could care less about me. She should never have become a doctor. She hates people, I was not the only person that she mistreated.
1	I appreciate her as a person. She knows everything about my health and things that impact my health.
1	I trust my doctor because for the most part he has been on the mark with health problems that I have had. Once he had an intern from a local school take a look at me. She had difficulty diagnosing me so she went to get him. As soon as he walked in to the room, he saw me from a distance and called out what I had - again from a distance. He was dead right. My doctor knows his stuff and also has a sense of humor.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I can talk to them and they will be honest. However, they are still busy and will push me off if I let her.

-1	Typically my doctor seems to always want to do things that cost but i have no money. I feel was though she always wants me to visit but never helps me with my problem
1	I have used my doctor for almost 30 years as I had my son when I was 18. He was just started out in his practice. I have used him since then for my other two deliveries and as my primary physician for my yearly checkups. He goes above and beyond with his bedside manner and thoroughness. He took care of me throughout major complications with all of my pregnancies and I have three healthy children.
1	There should be a general patient to doctor relationshipâ, to where I can trust them and to where they can trust me. If I can not trust this doctor I have to find one I can trust. Mistrust can result in my life ending so I prefer to go to a doctor I can trust with my life.
1	My doctor is confident and knowledgeable. He listens intently and compassionately. Doesn't prescribe a lot of unnecessary testing. Has been right on the mark with his diagnoses so far. 
-1	I believe that most doctors want what is best for their patients. But due to fast pace and so many patients they see I don't think that doctors can always fully give everyone the time needed. I also think that there is so much medical information that it can be difficult to get consensus among doctors and you are often give mistaken information.

-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have family members the use the same one and have had good experiences. He follows up on my health with phone calls and long conversations.
1	She is very thorough in her exams and tests for everything. I would rather someone be too thorough and have nothing come up than slack off and miss something. She is very knowledgeable and has not given me a reason to distrust her. She reviews side effects of medications thoroughly and even goes over medications that have been prescribed to me by other doctors. 
-1	I definitely depend on my primary care doctor but I do know enough when to seek out a specialist.  I'm very fond of my doctor but I always question medical decisions.

-1	Because I feel like they should know what is best for you and if they explain all the options and consequences then they are more trustworthy.

1	I trust my physician because she is very caring, knowledgeable, and understanding. She works with what my medical plan covers and anything I pay out of pocket which takes a lot of stress off my mind. I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off and I'm getting the services required.

-1	I have a medical problem right now that my doctor doesn't seem interested in figuring out. I think they dont really care

1	I feel I get many explations throughout any of my appointments that educate me on what is happening and why at all times.  It is very helpful to be able to feel educated. 
-1	I do not have medical insurance nor a PCP.  Thus, any statements relating to primary care physicians is moot.
-1	i have only met my primary care physician once. i do not tend to trust most people so doctors are no exception to that rule.
-1	"I would never trust a doctor 100%.  Even if they're trying their best, they don't always know what's right.  If you have something rare wrong with you, it will usually take multiple doctors before you find one that gets it right.  Most doctors will treat you under the assumption that you have the ""most common thing"" wrong with you that has your particular set of symptoms."
1	I have a very good doctor, and I trust her implicitly. The rest of her team is also trustworthy, and I have no qualms about visiting any of them.

-1	I believe that the doctor is looking out for my best interest.  However, I also feel as though he is trying to make money with as little work as possible.
-1	My feelings are at a neutral state with my doctor. I feel this way because I believe that  physicians give you some truth but they can also throw in some lies as well. They are money-oriented so therefore they will do whatever they can to get you to spend more money.
1	I formerly disliked, feared, and distrusted doctors. I have recently found a new primary care physician in whom I have complete trust and great respect for. Doctor Hekman at Cleveland Clinic has completely changed my feelings about doctors. He is knowledgeable and compassionate especially regarding my being a transgender woman.
1	For the most part I trust my primary care doctor. Sometimes I feel like she is guessing and not really making an effort to help my situation. It seems like a lot of trial and error. I trust that she is getting the most current information to pass along to me. She is usually quick to respond to message also.
-1	My doctor has always been honest with me, even if it means telling me something I don't want to hear. She gives me a variety of treatment options when they are available, and that helps build trust. 
-1	I ask about medicines I see advertised on TV if they would help. And he will sometimes say lest try it. Are if another doctor orders medicine for me he acts like it was his idea. I haven't found a doctor I truly trust.

-1	I trust my primary care physician as she is very thorough and wants to help get down to why something is bothering you.  I don't always trust that she is 100% present as she is very busy, only works two days a week, and has a packed schedule. I frequently have to wait a very long time while at the appointment before I see her, and I wonder how focused she is.  I feel like I'm inconvniencing her with my issues.
-1	I think doctors sometimes rush when they have alot of patients or they have somewhere else to be other than that I do trust them and I think they like to charge your insurance for unnecessary things  
-1	I think that my doctor has my best interests in mind. There are times where I may not agree with what she says but overall she is a good doctor
-1	I should be able to trust my Dr. I have no reason not to trust them. I have had no problems with any of the Dr.'s I have seen.
1	I trust him because I can tell he cares and is thorough and not dismissive of me. I have previously seen doctors who I do not trust, and who dismiss my symptoms or concerns, so I know what the other end of the spectrum feels like. 
-1	I do not have a primacy care physician, but I do feel that not all humans are perfect. As such, not all doctors are going to be perfect either and can either make mistakes, or purposefully mislead a patient for personal reasons.
-1	I feel like doctors often dismiss what a patient is saying- and roll with their accumulated knowledge of what is actually happening with a patient's medical issue. You can almost see them smirk at times when you describe something.
1	My primary doctor always have been sincere with me, I have full confidence on him, is great in all senses actually 
1	THEY DO SEEM TO CARE FOR YOU BUT SOMETIMES IT BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU NEED A QUICK APPOINTMENT BUT THEY ARE TOO BUSY TO SEE YOU IMMEDIATELY BUT MUST WAIT FOR A LATTER APPOINTMENT 
-1	In trust my physician for the most part, and I say that because although he is a doctor or what not, he does not have all of the answers I may be seeking about a certain condition of how I am feeling.
-1	The majority of doctors I've seen dismiss what I say and treat me like a number. They're always in a rush and want to just get in and out, instead of taking the time to listen to what my concerns are. They just want to shove pills at you and get you out the door, instead of exploring underlying issues.
1	always trust my doctor all the time and he totally helps me take care of myself and my family all the time
-1	I believe that doctors and general can easily get caught up in the formulaic behavior of routinely prescribing prescription for patients A, B, and C, so when the next patient comes along with a similar issue it is just a wag of their pen to get them out of their office and another person into the exam room and go on with their day. 
1	I have the best doctor. Recently had the flu, saw the doc and got medication. After four days my doctor called me at eight at night to see how I was doing. He treats me like family and I admire him so much.
-1	I have seen a few different doctors over the past 10 years who have not taken me seriously and blew me off â that is when I came in with a list of things I wanted to have checked out, that had been bothering me over the several years that I had not been to a doctor, the doctor barely looked at the list and then told me I was normal and healthy without even checking the things and by the time I left the office I realized I haven't totally blown off. He didn't care.
-1	I am still new to going to the doctor and entrusting them with my illnesses and overall care. I am attempting to get the doctor to understand.
-1	My husband is in the Air Force so I have to see the military doctor on base.  Sometimes I feel rushed when I come in for an appointment and don't really get my needs met.  Sometimes I have a couple of problems but them only want to talk about one and that can be frustrating because I can't keep taking time off work to come in for everything.  There have been a few times where I've come in for a problem, one time in particular for an ear ache, and the treatment my doctor prescribed didn't work at all.  Instead of just referring me to a specialist they made me come in for another visit.  In the end, I'm still dealing with this ear problem that comes and goes.
-1	I trust my doctor because this is his job and his expertise. He has a background and knowledge of the subject, so I am really in no place to second guess him. I can ask questions for further explaination or instruction
-1	There is no doctor that tells the complete truth to heir client. Their pockets are lined and their methods are biased.
-1	Doctors are sometimes just out to make money. They know people generally trust them blindly, and they are just giving an opinion, so they can tell you whatever they want. I don't think all doctors are like this, but some are and it's hard to know which ones are trustworthy. 
1	My primary care physician takes the time to fully explain things to me, because she knows I want to know what I am taking. She never rushes me. She never tries to give me medicine that she knows won't work just because she is getting a kickback from the company. She doesn't over-medicate patients, only prescribing medicine if she really believes I need it. The only times I distrust her is when we disagree on a course of action. But the fact that she allows me to disagree, and talk it over with her makes me trust her more. 
-1	I feel the 'industry' of medicine out weighs the care of patients. Profit is more important than caring for and treating the person. 
-1	my primary physician is new to me, so I dont have a built in relationship with her yet.  She's new to medicine, and that makes me think she is up on the newest medical trends but may also lack experience of knowledge.
-1	I trust my doctor mostly but sometimes she can seem a little cocky. That concerns me because she doesn't think she is capable of mistakes.
-1	I do trust my doctor to a large degree. While I am aware they are going to suggest drugs based on their own connections with certain companies.
1	I will always trust my doctor because he is the best at what he does plus he very honest and open minded I can ask him anything  and hes always honest
1	He will actually open up studies and show me where the information is coming from. He does not beat around the bushes. He gives me pros and cons for everything when it comes to symptoms or medications
-1	Sometimes there are certain aspects of specialized care that health coverage gets in the way of treating the person as a whole. They are more interested in whether your co-payments is paid up and your monthly premiums are up-to-date.  
-1	I mostly trust my physician because they are a close family friend. They are usually pretty straightforward and honest with me.
-1	While my doctor can sometimes seem a bit rushed and hurried to get out of the room I do trust him.  Even though he goes through the options a bit fast he does let me know all the options I have.  I know he has my best interest in mind. 
1	They are the experts in knowing your conditions and how to treat the conditions. Knowledgeable doctors are the best in knowing what is wrong with you they have to keep up to date with all the medical conditions that are coming up in the world today.
1	I am a very health individual, so I do not go to the doctor's very often; but when I do her recommendations seem appropriate and well-thought out.
-1	My dr has helped me with several things over the last couple if years. She has even let me try a couple of meds that i had wanted to. I seem to do well under her care.
1	My doctor is kind and very well informed.  He always takes the time to explain things to me carefully and has literature to support his positions.  He takes my opinions into account and doesn't ever denigrate my own research.  It's a great partnering relationship.
1	I feel that my doctor and I have a good relationship and that we can trust each other to work through any problems that might arise. I feel that my doctor knows that I want to know how my health is going and what I need to change in my life.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has an excellent track record. She has consistently provided excellent care and treatment for myself and my family. She has proven her abilities over the long-term.
-1	I have never had a reason not to trust anything my doctor has told me.She's always very thorough and honest
1	I Have A Caring Primary Physician Who I Have Known Intimately For Several Decades And To Whom I Can Communicate Very Easily.
-1	I trust my primary care provider, I just wish I could see the same doctor every time I go.  Due to the fact that where I go is a medical practice, I rarely get to see the same doctor. 
1	I have a long relationship with my dr. She has earned my trust over the years and is normally very accurate in her diagnosis. Her explations and communication is top notch.
1	My doctor is very caring and open about my health. If I have questions I can expect truthful answers and not judgement.
1	He is good and addresses any issue or concern that I have. 
-1	I do trust my primary care physician because he is really care about his patients with heart, perhaps he has aged with a happy family. I never seen any patients is not satisfied with his services. He also has a lot of nice staffs at his clinic office. He always clearly explains and give the hard copy of your heath notes if you have any concerns.  
-1	I don't really have a relationship with my Primary Care Physician. I probably would mostly trust. I respect their knowledge.
-1	I feel that my primary care physician is concerned with my best interest.  However, it is difficult to totally trust them knowing the lobbying they receive from pharma companies.  I often wonder if I really need the medicine they prescribe or if they are receiving a kickback for it.  On the other hand, my PCP spends a lot of time answering my questions and explaining treatment options.  I do not feel pushed to take medicine I am uncomfortable with.  All in all, I trust my doctor and am not considering switching. I just wish the healthcare system overall was more transparent!
-1	he listens and explains things very well.my family has been a patient of his for over twelve years and everyone understands his explainations and plans for treatment.
-1	When boredom strikes in the restrooms and customer service to you with the wedding is coming tomorrow night at family dollar store for a few years and I have to be a little more time to tell you that I get home I'll be there in a bit more of an effort in a bit more than the wedding is coming tomorrow night at the time but if the girl is still interested in a bit more than I was going to go to tell bay area of an effort in a bit more than I can count on the wedding and I get home I'll be back to the house 4th to tell bay friends and 
1	I have gone to him a few times in the past couple years.  He has always been diligent and has diagnosed my conditions correctly each time.  He had to do a couple small procedures which went great.  I have gotten better each time and have had no complications when recovering.  He has done a fantastic job.  Takes the time to make sure he knows what is wrong and goes over everything I need to know and answers my questions.
-1	I have always had good experiences with doctors. They have all been professiol and seemed to be competent.
-1	Because if they are so rushed to see you and need to make appointments that they can't even keep most of the time, then something is wrong with their time management. I feel like I've told the doctor things before and they just brush it off like it's no big deal or that it's normal when I know that it's not. They just don't want to have to sit there any longer. 
1	My doctor has been in business for over 40 so years. And he is due for retirement soon. He is extremely empathetic to my concerns and very friendly when I first met  him. I think his attitude and experience have given me a great gift.
-1	Don't have a primary physician at the time. Don't take the time to really know me and what have led to any problems I am now experiencing.
-1	I dont have one. Cause I dont want one. I take care of me. No medicnes here EVER.I know what it is the best for me. A doctor dont.
1	My doctor has been my primary care physician for over 20 years. Sometimes, she does seem to rush, but not often. She's been there for me through illnesses and injuries and always taken care of me.
-1	 I feel I can trust them based on the general information , and listen to solutions where I know they are not just trying to take my money. Many times the use of fancy language and misdiagnosis lead me , and many other patience astray which is why I am neutral in that I trust most of their practice , but know they can have bad intentions and give wrong information.
1	She is straight forward with me and lets me know about the options that I have. She doesn't sugar coat things and doesn't pressure me in to decisions that are unnecessary. I feel that she actually cares about my health. 
-1	They are my doctor for a reason, they know what they are doing and I understand everything, and they know what to do when I am sick and need help.
1	I have a great doctor who is very understanding and takes time to dig deeper. My previous primary care doctor just wrote me prescriptions and sent me on my way without listening, which is how I went undiagnosed with a thyroid problem. Having a doctor who listened and took the time to figure things out why fighting my insurance makes me trust her a great deal. 
-1	I do not trust my primary care doctor because he tells me that I can only present one problem I am having during a visit. I have chronic issues, and I only go into see the doctor once a year, because he doesn't order tests, or seem to take me seriously when I present a problem. So, in turn, I don't trust that my primary care doctor really cares about me, or my chronic problems, and I don't bother going in to take care of anything because he won't do anything to help me feel better. Wish I had better insurance, so I could find a doctor that was interested in helping me feel better.
-1	I trust him, he is very nice and kind and seems to care about his patients and wants what is best for them
1	I had trouble for a long time finding a good doctor. I had stomach issues and other weird problems for a decade. Then I switched to my current doctor, she tested my thyroid and Iâve felt so much better since. Sheâs been pretty spot on since Iâve started seeing her. My whole family see her we trust her so much. 
-1	"I feel that they always say ""no, that symptom is not because of _____"" or just send me away with some blow-off treatment for my symptom. I am very aware of changes in my body and sensitive to them. He might know medicine way better than I do, but I know my body way better than he does. "
-1	I feel like the doctor doesn't know exactly what she's talking about sometimes. I feel like she just gives me medication instead of really getting into what is really going on. Some of the things she says is wrong. 
-1	My doctor is caring and compassionate to say the least. They have my back at all times and i appreciate it very much
-1	I trust my doctor because he is truthful, he is always right in the diagnosis because he does all the necessary checks and he is also the family doctor
1	I have been going to my doctor for years & he is honest & straight forward about telling me what is wrong.
-1	i think i trust them because they know alot about me and they are they to keep me safe.Without we wouldnt know what is wrong with us and how to keep up with our body
-1	My doctor is pretty old, and set in his ways. I haven't been to him that many times since I moved here, but the times that I have been to him he was not that great. He seemed to rush through appointments, not spending much time with me. The information he gave me about an issue I had seemed pretty outdated, so I didn't take his advice on that. I have been meaning to find another primary caregiver, but I have not found the time to do it yet.
-1	My doctor has become my friend over the years, not a close friend but a friend of a sort. I can trust him to be concerned when I'm not doing well and to think carefully about what the best course of action would be for me. I feel confident about his decision making.
-1	My doctor is set in her old ways. She insists putting me on blood pressure medicine with a diuretic is excellent, but in reality it made me sick,lethargic,dehydrated, and I fainted constantly. In fact, it made my blood pressure too low. Now once again my doctor wants to put me back on the diuretic. She doesn't care what it did to me the last time. I tried to explain to her how it made me feel the last time but she doesn't seem to listen. Also, I have hypothyroidism. It took them 4 years before they took me off synthetic thyroid and put me on NDT thyroid. I had to put my foot down to filly get her to switch me. I'm doing a lot better now I'm on NDT thyroid.
-1	He seems to know what he is doing and I rarely see him for anything outside of being sick which I rarely am
-1	I trust my doc becasue he talks to me like a person, not just throw meds at me and call next patient.
1	She spends lots of time answering my questions and discussing all facets of every situation.  She answers questions thoroughly and never seems like she's in a rush.  
-1	Recently I was diagnosed with Lung Cancer. I've been telling my Dr. I had problems but he kept saying it was bronchitis. He got it wrong.
1	I trust my doctor because I think he has my best interest at stake. He takes time to listen to my concerns and actually tries to help me. 
-1	My physician is very thorough and takes considerable time with me when I see him for an appointment.  He takes extra time to research the proper course of action.
1	I trust him because he always been right in diagnosis my problems if any & able to provide the correct medicine & counseling.
-1	I have been having some health issues and they are not really sure what is wrong with me.  We are testing multiple theories but it is frustrating 
-1	before this survey I had never gave it a seconf thought  I automatically think that the doctor know what he is talking about
1	everytime i go there its important and i get results from them that is very acurate and correct i only go to my physician if i nneed to
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part but they aren't the most open minded when it comes to alternative therapies.
-1	I don't trust or not trust my doctor, I just feel like they always point my symptoms at something that it's not. And I also worked in a doctor's office, so it made me not trust doctors as much as I would like to.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician, but have no problem with trusting a doctor with my care, as I have in the past.
1	I fully trust my doctor because I know her personally outside of the doctor's office. She also delivered our child and I have seen her in action. I trust her.
1	I do not go to the doctor often, and when I do, it's usually a different doctor, so I don't really build trust. That being said, I've had largely very positive experiences with my doctors-- especially psychiatrists. They seem to have my best interests at heart.
1	The only real reason that I would not trust my PCP is that she is not an expert in a specific medical field. However, I trust her recommendations for specialists implicitly.
1	I trust my doctors because they help me get what I need for my kids and make sure they are healthy.
1	Mostly thinking of my pediatrician, but she has proven herself as knowledgable and deeply caring about our situation even though she is overwhelmed by other patients at the time.
1	I have been going to my doctor for about 30 years.  He is also a personal friend of my husbands.  At the same time, he is a very conscientious and caring doctor so I trust that he has my best interest at heart.  He is also passionate about his profession and has been in practice for a long time so I am sure he is very knowledgeable.
1	he has always let me to kake right choices I have never had a reason to not trust him I have had him for a doctor for over thirty years still in about as good a shape as any year old man
1	My doctor is one of the first who has taken the time to really get to know me and has been the best doctor I've ever had.
1	"He goes through each option, detail by detail, explains the pros and cons, prices and impact on my health. He often says ""Full disclosure, I benefit from people being RX'd this drug."" If I have suggestions from research, he takes those into consideration and allows me to participate in my care."
1	I have been seeing my GP for nearly twenty years, and I feel like we have a good rapport with each other. I can ask questions and offer theories and she gives them serious consideration because she knows that I am self-aware, and that I'm not not dramatic or prone to exaggeration.
1	Well, I've only gone to my new PCP once but she really took her time to get to know me and my history.
1	I completely trust my doctor. She lets me know what I can do to improve my health. If there is a problem they will give me a phone call to come right in. 
1	I don't see my primary care doctor very often, but I do see my gastroenterologist on a regular basis. I trust him because I've been seeing for three years. In that time, I've been hospitalized when I was very ill and he made the right medical decisions for me. He's always informative when I see him and explains things well. I have never had any problems during any interaction with him.
1	I trust my doctor because he's been with me for quite a while and he's never brushed off any of my concerns.  While he talks to me like I'm a friend, when he needs to be, he's serious and blunt and makes sure that I understand what's going to happen.  The one time I needed surgery, his recommendation was wonderful.  He regularly checked up on me and made sure I was recovering nicely which definitely made me feel more like a friend rather than just a patient.  Considering that and the way he thoroughly explains things to me, I have complete trust in him.
1	I think they know best that is why I trust them. For them it's not only about a job but also saving lives
1	I am familiar with him because I have been going to him for a long time. I trust what he says about my health and my medical care.
-1	My urologist is a little young, so it was kind of scary trusting him with my goods. But he showed confidence in himself and it made me feel confident in him. 
-1	I have had alot of experience in dealing with doctors because I took care of my ageing parents. I do know that sometimes doctors do whats easy for them and they look at the ageing elderly as if their life is almost over anyway. For that reason and others I dont truely trust every word my doctor tells me. I get second opinions first.
-1	I dont feel like my doctor wants to talk for too long. Just that they think everything is ok or not. They do provide options for allergies though.
-1	When I delivered my baby it was near dinner time at the close of the business day and the doctor wanted to be done. He was frustrated that I had a birth plan that I asked him to follow when there was no medical indication not to and he injured me by speeding up the delivery in yanking out my baby. Following that there have been instances where I have sought help for a condition I have and the doctor has only told me he doesn't want me to continue the treatment I have been using without an explation as to why and he was pushing me to use a contraceptive rather than the altertive treatment that has been effectively working. 
1	They have been with me since I was young and have built a reputation 
-1	Doctors only care about paying off their student loans and when that is done getting as much money as they can to justify suffering through all that crap in their twenties. Nowadays all of the caring, bedside manner, and respect I have gotten comes from nurses. You barely see your doctor when you are hospitalized and when my mom was dying, it was the nurses who called to tell me, who sat with me after she died and helped me. The only thing the doctor on call did was pronounce her dead and run out of the door.
1	my doctor always seems to know how to treat me well I wouldn't go to anyone else unless referred to by my regular doctor
1	I have been going to the same physician for many years, and have built a great deal of trust with her.  She understands me and my health history and needs.  
1	I have to trust my doctor because who else would I turn to when I have a medical  problem. If I don't trust my doctor, I would never check if I have a terrible disease and I could possibly die because of that. Basically, I trust my doctor because of necessity. 
-1	I trust my doctor implicitly. He is more internal medicine, so I have been able to see the same doctor since I was a child. My parents saw him, I even have a couple friends who were delivered by him. He has been practicing medicine in the community for decades longer than I've been alive, and he's always had excellent bedside manner. Everyone loves him. 
-1	My primary care physician tends to present options to me and suggest one of the options based on what he knows about me, such as waiting to have surgery performed for something that is not life threatening but may cause more issues in the future than what it does now. He also listens to my concerns and addresses them in an understanding way.
1	my doctor would ask questions to find out what was bothering me.  She made good judgement calls on the best treatment for me.
1	My primary care physician belongs to a practice which both myself, my wife and several of our friends have been patients in for many years. They have great reputations in the community. Additionally, my physician has excellent bedside manners, is very easy to talk to and always asks if there is anything that they can do better during the course of my visits. My primary care physician makes me feel comfortable and secure in knowing that they are giving the best attention possible.
-1	I do trust our physician, but feel that we are often hurried in and out of his office. It would be nice if they got to know us a little more and asked more questions. 
1	I have had no problems in the past with my doctor. He has always been straight forward with me and laid out the different options I have for dealing with medical issues.
-1	I wonder if there might be something she's not telling me to keep me from becoming upset--not diagnosis-wise, but possible non-serious effects of medicine or activity
1	I have been using him for years and trust his opinion. He is a very smart doctor and gives personal care.
-1	I feel like a couple of health issues that I have had to deal with have been belittled or downplayed when talking to my doctor
1	Over the years, my doctor has proven that he knows my issues, listens to me carefully and always makes the right choices for me about my care and well being. I completely trust him because he has fixed many conditions and proactively treated me to prevent complications and other issues.
1	I have been with my doctor for 28 years he has never steered mee wrong  I haav aalwa trusted him to do what is right for me and he has never let me down.  Always  on my side not his.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. I have been for years with this physician. Through his appointments, there is no real reason for anyone to have to distrust my primary care physician at any point in time.
-1	At this current time I do not have a primary doctor. The reason being is that there is nothing going on with me. As me trusting or distrusting a doctor that's neither here or there because I trust in a higher power 
-1	Because they are in the business of making money and the more sick I am and dependent upon the medication they are giving me, the better for them. I do not believe they truly want me to get well.
1	They have been my doctos for awhile I believe it was when they tell me things. They haven't steered me wrong thus far.
-1	I get a long well with all of my Dr's, If I do not trust them I will get another Dr.I also listen to other peoples opinions on what they think of the Dr's
1	I trust them because they have a trusted thing about them they make me feel comfortable and like I don't have to worry about stressful stuff they give me good advice
1	I trust my primary care physician because they are a professional and it is their job. In my experiences, they seem to know what they are doing, provide good advice, and respond to any questions and concerns I have. The person looks and acts professionally and I have no reason to distrust them or doubt their competence. They are more knowledgeable than me so I trust their advice and directions on health matters.
-1	doctors are paid by number of tests and other billable transactions they can perform on patient.  so they are only interested in increasing the number of tests and unnesessary operations for no health benefit.  need single payer health care
-1	My doctor is very well intentioned, but he will opt for conventiol medicine without turning to lifestyle choices first. For example, he would immediately prescribe a statin rather than addressing food choices first. He would prescribe a thyroid drug without first asking if one is eating a lot of sea vegetables or other high-iodine foods. He recommends mammograms despite the evidence that they really don't save lives (in the aggregate), they simply make more people patients.
-1	He is trusted doctor knowing to family members. I feel happy to know someone known within he family.
1	I've been going to the same doctor my entire life and he's always been a great help in helping diagnose and eliminate the various viruses, infections, and flues that I caught throughout in my life. I've had no reason to not trust him for the entirety of my life. So, ever since I was a child, I've learned to trust my doctor.
1	I trust my doctor because he has never given me a reason not to. He's always very thorough and he gives me options when appropriate. 
-1	I would prefer that all the information relative to my body be listed and discussed and added to the procedure of what we're going to do with my body.
1	He's been my doctor for years I know him outside of his work. I trust what he says but sometimes I don't want to follow his advice.
1	MY DOCTOR IS HIGHLY EDUCATED WITH MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE D AND HIS ADVICE HAS ALWAYS PROVEN TO BE RIGHT
-1	I don't have a primary physician however I don't really trust doctors. They are more concerned about making money.
1	My primary care doctor is always willing to take as much time as we need at each appointment to cover all of my medical concerns. She is also always willing to listen to any concerns I have and doesn't brush me off.
1	I trust my doctor because they never give me a reason not to. They show me everything I need to know. They have a website where I can see all my medical records, what test they ran and how they I did on it. My doctor is the best!
-1	My doctor seems to want to help treat patients but applies his personal beliefs too often and wants me to mentally overcome certain aliments or rely on God.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a very long time with no issues ever my routine checkups go well with everything explained to me 
1	I feel doctors, in general, have the patient's care and well-being in mind when they are treating them. I feel that a patient has to have that trust in their doctor or they should probably get a new one.  A patient needs to feel that trust because their doctor is such an important part of staying well, or getting well.
-1	she's been the only doctor that has found an antidepressant that didn't give me side effects
-1	I trust my doctor based on passed experience. He will always take time to answer any questions I have.
1	I tend to trust the professionals who show a passion for the work that they do. If the connection and relationship between the patient and doctor is not present then I find a new primary care physician. There is no room for mistrust in medicine. 
-1	They always mix things up in the go so doctor report and most of the time they are wrong and if I go somewhere else they tell me something different
1	I'm active duty military and see my doctor at the base hospital. I feel as though they honestly care about me and my fellow military members and do what is best for our health and long term care. I have no reasons to doubt this or experienced anything to discredit this opinion and view.
-1	I don't fully trust any doctor. Any person can make a mistake. Also you never know how a person really is and how much they really care.
1	if I did not trust him I would not continue to go to him.  he always explains things well and in words that I can understand
-1	I have been repeatedly misdiagnosed and handed pharmaceuticals that only mask the symptoms, not treat the problem. The doctors often seem so preoccupied with getting to their next patient that they don't care to take the time to properly resolve my ailment(s).
1	I do not trust all doctors completely. They are human and can make mistakes, and may not always have all of the answers, and may not know the entire situation. 
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I feel like she dismisses a lot of what I say except for what she wants to hear and treat. For example, I suffer from depression and anxiety and all she does is prescribe medication that doesn't work. Sometimes my anxiety is out of control and I get very little sleep. I have a medication that is not working for me and she just keeps adjusting the dosage and it still doesn't help. This has been going on for over a year. She takes my high blood pressure and cholesterol very serious but doesn't give me much help other than a diet and exercise and medicine. The practice has also become much more busy than it used to be and I feel like sometimes her mind is someplace else because of that.
-1	My primary care physician does not know me well as a person or patient. I believe I am more of a number than a patient. My doctor is quick to prescribe medication.
1	I know him as a doctor for many years and how he feels about my condition. Usually he is correct with a diansis and treatment.
-1	I because whatever is wrong I'll take it but if something is not wrong I won't take it. It's all depends on meds
-1	I know that he is very busy with a lot of patients, so maybe he just jumps to a treatment that  he thinks might work. For instance, I used to have a lot of digestive issues and such, and I don't think he asked once what my diet was like. Instead, he put me on pills for depression. Don't get me wrong, I needed those as well, but looking back, I think diet had a lot to do with it as well.
-1	My dr. explains my options and asks me which I want to do. She will offer her opinion on what she thinks is the best option for me but ultimately it is my decision. However, she and I disagree on the usefulness of supplements. I think it's helpful to take the ones that I do and she disagrees. I don't completely trust her because of this.
-1	I trust my doctor, because she takes time with me, making sure everything g is OK..I trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable
-1	She takes time to really listen to me. If I am doubting something, or questioning why about things she will explain it. I don't feel like I cannot bring things up to her. For example when I mentioned my anxiety she really took time to get me on meds that made me feel better. It made all the difference in the world to me. 
-1	I feel that I trust my doctor when they do checkups on me and then review my test results and such, i trust their judgement
1	I feel as though i trust my primary physician because she ecplains things to me so i can understand and she always allows me to ask as many questions as i would like. And if i ask her to test me gor something she does it.
-1	i  not very sure  so middle ground is the best way of answering   ............................................................................................................................................................... nothing else I have too say about this  but  they wanted a longer answer  
-1	Most time my health got recover after seem them.  Their got high degree and was well  train. 
1	I guess I have only had one issue that involved a pap smear test going to the wrong lab and me being charged way too much (like $10 vs $500). Considering that was just human error, I have no real reason to distrust my doctor. But mistakes can happen, so I don't fully trust anything. 
-1	Doctors in the past seemed to care more, and spent more time with you, now everything has a prescription, and they don't tell you about something that will work without prescription.  And it seems as if they're not really listening anymore.
1	I do trust doctors for the most part, they have the education and experiences above my own. I think that the trust I put in my doctors, as well as the research I can do on my own, makes a good team in my healthcare.
1	The doctors I have had throughout my life have always been good to me.  I have never had any problems with them.  I am very confident in them no matter what the situation is.
1	My current primary care physician is incredibly thorough in her evaluation of my health issues and in her explanation of the options available. Whenever she makes a recommendation she goes into a lot of detail about her logic behind the recommendation and explains why others might have a different opinion. I usually do some research after my appointments with all physicians in order to make sure that I understand all aspects of my illness or treatment and have never found the information my current doctor gives me to be lacking in any way.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a medical doctor. He once brought a medical condition to me that I had ignored for a long time and he persistently asked me if I had certain issues that I was in denial of. He recommended getting some blood work done and I am so glad I did because it turned out I was actually pretty sick on the inside. Once I started a treatment for this medical condition I improved so much. I trust him for reasons like this. 
-1	I have great faith in our medical staff, resources and facilities here in the swell state of Washington.
1	"Hard to comment on doctors in general, since I believe a lot of them don't do a lot of research on drugs and were not trained in preventative care outside of ""take this pill."" I try to seek out physicians who are also trained in natural care and prevention. My primary care doctor is Chinese with both a Chinese and US medical degree, but very unconventional. I trust what he says because my overall heath and well being has actually improved. I am 71 with very little degenerative arthritis, normal blood sugar/cholesterol and plaque-free carotid arteries. So I do trust him and the other health specialists that I see"
-1	Anytime I went to get a check up and explained a problem i had, he'd tell me it was stress but i didn't get any help. Then i was prescribed anti-depressants and they didn't work.
1	Because I have never been steered wrong by my physician. She has always listened to me when I explain something. also she believes me when I am talking to her 
1	I have been told by another doctor that my doctor is one of the best in his field, which is a great complement. When one course of action comes to a halt, he always has another course of action to take.
-1	I trust that he is able to go over all options of treatment for me.  He is also available to go over details in the event i need him off hours
-1	I generally trust doctors as I only see doctors who I have done a lot of research about - to see that they are generally revered in the medical world. I believe if they are that successful and well known, I can trust them. However if it was an ER doctor, I'd be cynical. 
-1	Most doctors are either trying to make money or don't take the time to fix the problem. They rely on medications to make the patient feel comfortable while making him or her more sick. 
-1	I feel like I am being rushed through appointments and that she is only half listening to what is going on with me.
-1	Sometimes I feel like doctors thinks they know more about what I'm feeling than I do. It sometimes makes it difficult for them to take me seriously and leads to them downplaying my symptoms or ignoring some of them and telling me it's nothing or I'm worrying too much.
1	She made me take my shoes and socks off. No other doctor has. She also gave me the straight answer on if I were diabetic.  I need medication. 
-1	My doctor is relatively new, and I had not been in a few years. I was very nervous, because I have never liked going to the doctor, hospital, etc. She was so easy mannered, understanding and really listened to my concerns. I liked that, and have been going back ever since for regular check-ups/ins.
-1	I have been given no reason to distrust my current physician. She is thorough even though it is difficult to get in to see her.
-1	I don't trust or distrust them. I think they give the best advice they can, but ultimately it's up to me to decide what to do.
-1	I think sometimes they care more about money than actually helping people.
1	"She is ""new"" since my doctor left  and I had to find another.  She is earnest, thorough and explains what is need to know,"
1	My experience with my primary care doctor has been positive. She has not tried to push unwanted medications on me and she tells me exactly what she is thinking.
1	I trust my doctor because she's a woman, close to age as myself, and we've had similar experiences (pregnancy at around the same ages).  She knows my history and she's listened to my concerns and we seems to work together vs her just telling me things.
-1	The primary care physicians I have dealt with are overworked and unable to completely focus on one case at a time. That is the nature of health care today for all but the very rich. This is just the way it is. I feel responsible for knowing and researching as much as I can for my own good. 
1	I have had the same physician since I moved to IL which is almost 9 years and I trust her judgement implicitly.  She has proven to me that she has my best interest at heart.
-1	If I didn't trust the doctor and did not believe in his or her abilities and commitment to patients, I wouldn't be seeing this doctor. The standard of care for pretty much any injury or illness is established by governing medical bodies based on scientific evidence. With some small variation pretty much every doctor will prescribe the same treatment under the same medical circumstances. If I trust modern medicine there is no grounds for distrusting the care my doctor suggests. Which doctor I go to is mainly a matter of my convenience and my persol perceptions.
1	I have to look into what doctors say because even though they mesn well they can be qrong sometimes too
-1	I rarely go to the doctor, so it is hard to answer this question. I mean what else am I suppose to say in this 
-1	well, I need trust of doctor due to better criteria about some item or procedures about healt. then I feel good with this
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough when I see her for visits. She allows me to ask as many questions as I like, and she really listens.
1	I really like my PCP. She's super nice and understanding. She explains everything really well and makes sure to focus on me while I'm there. She always asks how I'm doing and about non medical aspects of my life. I feel like she cares.
-1	I trust my doctor based on her reputation and referrals.  but have not been with them long enough to build that trust on a long term basis.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I my family and I have been going to the same one for many years.  She has helped me manage many things including my blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Also she is very up to date on my medications in which I need to order.
-1	Doctors are out for money and income.. They don't care about your welfare. They are not honest and care about your health.
1	She spends time with me and tells me what she feels is the best treatments for me.She is caring and listens to me.
1	My doctor always takes an extended amount of time to discuss all of my issues with me and make sure that I understand them. He is willing to do whatever I would like to make me feel comfortable and taken care of. He is bluntly honest and makes sure I know all of the side effects of my medications and whether or not I should be concerned about them. He has been right in every diagnosis he has given me so far. 
-1	My doctor has been with me for many years and knows me   personally for many years. I fully trust her for my physical well being. 
1	I have been with this group for some time now and I feel like they have alway took good care of me so I think I can trust what they are saying and doing for me and I have no reserves
1	I have to see doctors relatively often, and although most visits are quite short, my doctor (or the nurse) is always willing to explain something I don't understand. I believe my doctor is concerned about my health problems and prescribes the medications he feels will work the best (I often have to change medications because one isn't working or a new one causes problems with an older one).
1	My primary care physician is a young man who takes his time talking with me and actually listens to what I have to say. He then asks relevant questions and discusses which course of action would be best for me and which he feels would best address my concerns. He is always available through his patient portal and responds in a timely manner. His staff is also very kind and caring and I get a sense that they actually quite enjoy working for him, which to me is very telling.
1	I've been a patient of my doctor for some time and we have developed a very good doctor patient relationship. If I do not feel comfortable with something she informs me of then I question it and vice-versa.
-1	Depending on what type of insurance you have, some doctors may give you the cheapest treatment instead of what's best.
-1	I sometimes feel my visits with doctors are rushed because a lot of them see so many patients throughout the day. I feel like when I try to explain things to some of them, they tend to think I don't know what I am talking about.
-1	I have had bad experiences with medical doctors in the past.  I never assume a doctor knows what they are doing or has my best interest at heart.
-1	I'm usually a pretty healthy individual, so I only ever go see him for my regular annual physicals. I really have no reason to doubt what he tells me, since I'm a very low-maintenance person health wise.
1	I do not go to my PCP often because they are far away but when I do go I do trust their option because they have not seared me wrong yet. It is important to be able to trust your doctor. 
-1	I have been seeing my doctor for several years and have established a trust and confidence in his ability and diagnosis
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she as highly rated in my state, she has cared for 5 other of my family members, knows my entire medical family history better than I do, and she is very comforting and kind. She always explains everything I need to know, is very thorough and makes me feel comfortable with asking any questions.
-1	sometimes I think my doctor tries to make money off of the medicine he prescribes for me. I've been recommended some medication that could help but wasn't quite necessary. Persol fincial gain is a problem I find with some doctors.
-1	I think my pcp is adequate. She is nothing stellar and does her job. She sometimes need prodding to complete tasks such as refilling scripts. I need to ask her to look into things that are causing me problems and many times, I come away without an answer or a generic diagnosis.
-1	I trust because he has been very effective in his diagnosis. His advises has always been for my better health. He is seriously concerned about my well being.If I have a medical problem, he always clearly makes me understand the situation in very simple layman language. 
-1	Because as much as they are trained to remove personal opinions it is near impossible for slight bias' not to be within a doctors recommendation. Also what they are more familiar with they will feel more comfortable recommending. For example a surgeon will always be more comfortable with a surgical approach, while an internist with a medicinal approach. All advice in life should always be taken with a grain of salt. 
-1	In the past my pharmaceutical care has been top-notch in most of the issues that I've had I've been able to receive helpful and cheap help that while inexpensive was still effective to the point where I could get what I needed without having to lose half of my bank account. As well as the fact that when I'm in the care of my dr. I feel as if I can address issues that I have and concerns that I have while still being able to see honest feedback with proper support and help
-1	I feel like there are too many profit based motivating factors with doctors in America that directly work against my best interest. I hear all the time about doctors strongly recommending expensive tests that prove to be unneeded in the eyes of a second opinion. 
-1	I mostly trust my doctor, except when he seems to have more patients on his plate than what he can handle with the utmost care at the moment. Sometimes my appointments feel rather rushed and I know he has not had adequate time to alyze every possible solution to whatever problem I may be dealing with, and that he is simply giving the fastest and easiest solution rather than the best one. I know that he is competent and knowledgeable and has always taken care of me, but I wonder sometimes if better care and more close attention is available elsewhere. 
-1	i trust most of them in general because they have enough schooling to know what to do and what not to do in most situations
1	I've been going to the same doctor my whole adult life. I'd rather not go into specifics but I trust the medical advice I'm given as well as any recommendations. I also know I am free to ask questions and they'll be answered.
-1	I trust my doctor to do his job and explain my medical options. It's not his job to decide for me, so I wouldn't take his recommendations automatically.
1	My primary care doctor goes over all of my options and I have asked about options that she has not presented and she will explain why she thinks that option would not fit my lifestyle.  She also genuinely listens to my concerns and answers my questions.  
1	My doctor's mother had the same resease I have and he has and still is doing extensive research about it. He also has personal knowledge about it.
1	I moved to this city 13 years ago and have been seeing this doctor for all my health care needs, apart from my dentist and eye doctor. She answers all my questions patiently and never hurries through the appointment.
-1	Sometime doctors just lok out for their own benefit rathan Try to take good care of their patience. Try to see as many patiences as possible
1	He's always been there for us and has had good results in treatment. He hears me and has addressed my needs. So far he has been good at curing us.
-1	I do trust what the doctor has to say almost all the time. If it is something pricey and serious, I will get a second opinion.
-1	"I had an experience with a doctor where he over prescribed pain medication.  I wrote an essay as a witness statement which was used in the case against the doctor by the India Attorney General.  When I was 16, I was hurting so bad and didn't know what to do so my parents took me to a pain magement clinic which would be described as a ""pill mill"".  I don't blame my parents at all.  The first thing I signed was a waiver for them to prescribe me opiates.  The first time he prescribed tramadol, ambien, vicodine, and a muscle relaxant.  He told me it would only be one month and then he would get me off all medication.  Months went by being told the same thing.  It took me 3 years to get off the medication.  I was a zombie.  Now all I need is medicil canbis, and no pills.  I feel better than ever.  This is why I don't trust any doctor and I don't  think I ever will."
-1	I believe that the doctor does know better than me about medical treatment. However, I also know that there are incentives in providing certain options over others, and cultural biases that pervade the doctors perceptions (as well as my own).
1	i trust mine because she knows her stuff and she has progressed my health much more than before. she has the knowledge to tell me truthfully whats right  from whats wrong
1	My primary care physician has become a friend and is concerned about my health beyond medical appointments.  She acknowledges when she doesn't know a detail, researches and follows up with an answer.  She's active in her professional community, speaking and writing.  
-1	my promary doctor is very thoghell when notices the blood test he sends me to a specialist for further testing
-1	Doctors in general have to work to gain my trust-I have had very bad experiences in the past with doctors, so I would say that I am wary anytime I see a doctor.
-1	I feel like most doctors will try their best, but I have experience with some who have clearly not known what they are doing. So while I generally trust them, I am always skeptical.
-1	Doctors come in an listen to you for barely 5 minutes, then do some perfunctory examinations like check blood pressure and come to a decision on your situation.  Its obvious often doctors have no clue on how to diagnose a non-visible symptom like stomach pain or neurological issues.  They just tend to prescribe yah a prescription and rush you out the door.  The prescription might do more harm than good too.  Its clear that some of the doctors I have fit this profile and aren't very circumspect or patient oriented.
1	From the past experiences I have had with my doctor, the care/medicines he has prescribed me has always helped. Also my doctor makes sure & give me the option to choose the medication instead of forcing it on me.
-1	they seem to know what they are doing and i haven't been diagnosed inaccurately yet. they also were educated at good schools.
-1	Well when I first met my doctor 2 years ago he is adding me head to toe tell me you don't things I need to do things I shouldn't do for the first month and now it's just pills pills pills pills to cure one paying the Cure that pain is almost like a pill Pusher and I don't like medicine all the time there's a lot of Earthly things that you can do besides taking medicine all the time so my concern with the doctor is maybe I should change doctors I don't know then I spend maybe a few minutes with you but I understand they have a lot of patience but it just in and out of the door when you want to ask a question it's like okay what else do you need not very concern so maybe I should change doctors that's
-1	Sometimes I fear that the pharmaceutical industry makes the decision what pills I get, rather than my persol doctor. I trust my doctor in terms of surgeries and maybe pain magement but outside of that, I wouldn't take any pills they recommend. 
-1	I do not think that he like women or respects them as much as men. I feel like he talks to my husband with respect and caring but dismisses me when I try to tell him my mental health issues.
-1	At times I feel the Dr. is rushed and needs to get on with other patients, at times I feel like I should be given the time to write down directions I may forget
-1	I am a very careful person and consider myself to be well read. I ask questions and do research on my conditions and medications. 
-1	I don't have a primary care right now but my specialist that treats me has always been trustworthy and is a very pleasant doctor to deal with.
-1	I trust my medical physician in suggesting good medical treatments for me and I believe that my medical physician is capable of successfully treating any illnesses I may encounter. 
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, but in general, doctors are open about a patient's health. Even when they are stern, it is because they want the patient to have the best outcome. There are few doctors who would deliberately mislead a patient. 
-1	"I feel that a lot of Doctors "" Herd Sheep"" because we don't have enough Doctors out there."
1	He's a great guy that truly wants me to be as healthy as I can. I swear he wants me to live to 150, happily, healthy, and active.
-1	I have been seeing my doctor for several years and she knows me.  She knows how my body reacts to certain drugs and other stimuli.  She believes what I tell her.  
-1	he is a doctor and he know what to do and how to treat so i trust him/her but i also do my research on it and seek out the treatment  
1	My doctor is an excellent communicator, a good listener and expresses his opinions with confidence.  He is well-trained, experienced and view him as a trusted friend. I trust him and confide in him.
-1	I had a doctor for years who was incredibly thorough and I did completely trust always. Unfortunately that doctor is no longer in practice. I have had experiences with other doctors that have led me to question whether they truly are thorough at all, and I don't have the level of trust with any of my current providers that I had with my former PCP. 
1	I believe that my Doctor care about my well being, if not I would be able to trust my physicians. I love honesty and not drugs.
1	I trust my doctor because he was there when I was born and is very trusted by my parents. He has taken good care of my siblings and is very kind. 
-1	Sometimes your doctor may not be forthcoming with u especially if u r black u can never trust anyone
-1	I am on the fence with doctors because I think to many of them have a god complex and have very little information on how diet can actually affect your health.
1	I have a good relationship with my doctor. I knew him for along time and he will always tell me the truth but, will let me decide what I want to do. He is willing to answer any questions I might have and give me the honest answer.
-1	At the moment I don't have a primary care physician so I am answering based on my previous doctors and the many doctors I have taken my parents to.  I believe all these doctors are trying to be responsible and do their best.  But primary care physicians are much too quick to prescribe a pill or CHANGE medication based on one reading in their office (especially for blood pressure). I honestly don't believe some doctors understand that 'more' or a drug is not necessarily better. I don't think doctors have much time (or take much time) to problem solve these days.  I think they often make sp judgements based on how much your symptom looks or sounds like somebody else's rather than assuming your symptom might be unique.
-1	I trust my doctor, he is very thorough and asks tons of questions.  He is concerned with my wellbeing and orders tests for me 
-1	I've been seeing her for over 15 yrs and she's always took me serious. She always considered the best treatment for me and not what was best for the med companys
1	I have known him a long time, He also helped look after my parents and he was always honest with me. Most of the time I think to honest, But that was ok I needed something to be put bluntly  for me to digest everything that was happenings. My Dr understood that, he took the time to understand that being blunt was what I needed.
1	I have been going to my primary doctor for over 27 years and my mother went before me.  He works with a team of doctors from UPMC so that all of my doctors are aware of what is going on with me and develop a plan to figure out what is best for me.  
-1	I feel my doctor is easy to talk too understands my health providing the best medications for my health issues
-1	Well i think i have to trust him because he knows what he is doing. I think I'm kind of safe trusting him and his methods. 
-1	All he want is the money the meds he give me all of 5hem has side affect some times it might work and sometime they do Not work it just about money. Its sad
-1	I don't distrust my primary care physician, but I have had a couple of bad experiences with doctors in the past.  Doctors are humans and humans make mistakes.  My last primary care physician didn't listen to my daughters symptoms and the next day, she was hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis.  I never went back to him .  (She won't either. )
1	I moved from Ohio to Florida 4 years ago  and health care in Florida is far inferior. I have never been seen by the doctor where I go because I see the PA because the only reason I go is to get my meds managed.  I like and trust the PA but it will never be completely.  I am still feeling the sting about a situation that occurred a year ago that was extremely critical and the doctor overseeing the PA who is ultimately in charge totally let me down.   It was cold and impersonal and there was no commitment to me as a patient what so ever. Horrible and extremely stressful experience
-1	I think they are prone to subscribing meds for everything versus trying something else. They don't take into consideration long term effects.
-1	i trust my doctor,it is the insurance cos. that i don't.They are in charge and make the rules they want.That is the framework drs. function within.A tratment must be insurance approved or you won't get it.
-1	First of all I don't trust to many people. I have been to a doctor in about 20 years so trust has not been built at all. From what I have seen from other people their physician is only interested prescribing drug, somehow I think that get a cut somewhere down the line. I also believe the are concern but making that money is their main focus.
1	I trust that my physician will care for my best interest and what is best for me. She is not self centered and is very good at her job.
-1	I trust my physician to have knowledge but i distrust because in my experience in life, 3 physcians will have different opinions on treatment.
-1	I trust my doctor because I've had the same doctor since I've been born. I have the same doctor that helped my mom give birth to me 
-1	My doctor is very thorough and is not satisfied until he reaches an answer. I definitely trust him with all my health problems.
-1	I don't trust doctors because I think they put a band-aid on the problem instead of solution trying to fix the problem. For example, doctors over-prescribing opioids to relieve pain.  
-1	My GP is relatively new to the practice, so I have not had to see her very often, thus cannot rate her as totally trustworthy.  My encounters have been productive and useful.
-1	My doctor spends very little time with me. I always have to go through the nurse who doesn't really know me or remember me as a patient and gives me blanket responses insted
1	My primary care physician has been my primary care physician since I was a teenager and she is the provider I take my kids to. When she has been wrong she has admitted it. She fits us in at the last minute when needed, is willing to try more than one thing when I ask and always listens and take into account what I have to say. I worry about finding a new provider when she retires.
1	I trust my doctor but I still get a second opinion to be sure. Sometimes that second opinion is a good thing to do. 
1	She always knows when something is wrong and she knows how to help me with any problem. I can tell her anything and she will listen with out judging me.
1	We have an understanding and friendship and know that we can trust each other.
-1	He is more interested in turnover than quality care. He wants to get you in and out. He presumed you're an idiot.
1	My primary care physician is thorough and never overlooks so she has ample time to spend with her patients. 
-1	I've been seeing my current PCP for 9 years but he often forgets (even with my records in front of him) the nature of my chronic conditions. He is disorganized, abrupt, and has a tendency to dismiss my concerns
1	I have been to the doctor many times in the past and there has never really ben any issues.  I have been provided good information and treated the way I would want to be treated.  There has been no reason to not trust him in the past so I will continue to trust until proven otherwise.
1	She's always explained to me whatever she's doing in my treatment, and she's never given me any reason not to trust her
1	I trust my doctor completely to give me the best available options.  Having this doctor for many years has built a relationship of trust in him.  I would follow any of his orders without question.
1	because they can help me find the solution to the problems at hand and it will help me to become a better person
-1	Some primary care providers are somewhat of a trust because of male practice or other issue at a specific location
1	I trust my PCP because she has far more education than I do. She would never intentionally do anything that would cause me harm. I know that if something is wrong with me, she will figure out the best way to treat it.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he knows how to care for his patients. He also knows how to work with you to understand his patient's needs.
1	I trust my doctor, but I trust me more, because I have to live with the consequences of his actions. I still like to do my own research to make the most accurate decision.
-1	Overall I trust my doctor.  Sometimes when she is busy with many patients, I feel as though she rushes my checkup.
1	I trust my PCP because of his past experience and the care that he has provided for my family throughout the years.
-1	i trust my primary physician because they really help the sick and they how to help every one they see
-1	I feel my doctor is getting ready to retire and doesn't really care about anything anymore. He just hands out pills to everyone and doesn't reall explain what they are for or what they can do to you. Time to find a new doctor that cares.
-1	my dr is easy going but very honest. he tell you what you need to do to get better . he doesn't seem snobby like some drs.
-1	My physician doesn't make a habit out of asking for unnecessary tests or making me pay more than I should for a service or diagnosis. I trust that the doctor is looking out for my best interests.
-1	I do not either trust or distrust my doctor. I feel they are they to evaluate my physical condition and to make recommendations to maintain or improve my health. They are a valuable resource which I can then use to make a decision of how to proceed given the options which have been discussed.
1	I trust my doctor due to honesty, making decision about the best treatment for me, and extremely thorough as well as being careful.
-1	I have been going to him for years. He has always given me good advice. I trust him completely to make good recommendations.
1	My primary care physician has been a faithful friend and advocate for me. She spends time finding out about my illness and she spends lots of time with me.
1	I like my COP because he seems to care. He doesn't rush me. If he's unable to give me an answer, he has no issue Googling it to figure out a good solution instead of insisting it's not true or he knows better. His humour doesn't hurt either. 
-1	Doctor has given bad advice a couple of times, such as don't read about side effects. I don't have anything else to say.
-1	Even though i trust my doctor somewhat; i feel that he doesn't tell me everything. I think there are other treatments out there that he hasn't referred me to.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has a good bedside manner. He is effective in keeping up with medical tests that I need to take. He takes care of my whole family.
-1	I believe that my primary care physician has outdated information on certain things. It's not like they go back to school every couple of months to get updated information on certain conditions. I also believe that they kept bonuses for pushing pills on to people.
1	No exact reason why. Doctors have saved me multiple times before in the past and also will be in the future.
1	My doctor is around the same age as me. She is very aware that weight loss is important but it's not as simple as just losing some pounds. She has never pushed any shots or drugs on me if I'm not interested.
1	was very close to my last primary care physician who has unfortunately retired but he set me up with his primary care physician who is great and I go to a great hospital with an excellent reputation. I feel like I can articulate any issues and questions necessary
1	Doctor hasn't done anything or given me a reason not to trust him. He is genuinely concerned about my health. He makes sure I know every aspect of what is going on and how to make things better if need be. 
-1	Well doctors are humans as well, and they make mistakes, which is why I have a general neutral stance when it comes to doctors. I believe they do what's right for the most part, but it's possible they're forgetful as well.
-1	She does just an ok job. I would change doctors if I gound a better one in my insurance scope. I am looking.
1	I answered in regard to my doctor of 30+ years who recently retired. I absolutely trusted him with my children, whom he delivered, and myself. He always turned out to be right, always listened and explained things, gave me options. I have not seen a different doctor yet because I lost my job and do not have any health insurance.
1	he is very knowledgeable and always provides different options and talks about possible side effects and is a great listener,not in a rush to get to the next patient.
1	my doctor takes the time to explain test results and procedures, also the reason why certain medications have been prescribed
-1	I have beem referred to my doctor and have been under his care for years. His experience and staff make me feel very comfortable.
1	Doctors care about people, thats why they do what they do. They are properly trained and can generally be trusted.
1	I trust my primary physician based upon the relationship that we have developed since I began seeing him.I can trust him.
-1	Trust my doctor because she takes out time with me. She don't rush me at all. She explains things to me. She takes care of any problems that you may have.
-1	A few years ago, my mother's former cardiologist recommended that she have open heart surgery based on faulty results of an echo cardiogram. He was also not truthful about the surgical options available either. We confirmed this first through internet research, then with a leading heart surgeon at a highly-rated cardiac hospital. The end result was that my mother did not need heart surgery at all and after twice-yearly echo cardiograms with a different cardiologist, still does not require it. I have less drastic but similar experiences in the past with doctors. Unfortunately this has given me a healthy amount of distrust for what I'm initially told. I will always research topics myself, ask many questions and seek 2nd opinions.
-1	Some doctors seem more interested in selling extra products that I really don't need..Seems they just want the extra income.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has never steered me wrong. He's been great in answering my questions and is quite knowledgeable. He's very intelligent.
1	My doctor always takes the time to talk with me through things versus telling me what they want me to do.  Their suggestions are always things that would be considered safer than just prescribing something that would make them have more money.
-1	I regularly trust doctors but i recognize that they sometimes might be biased towards recommending certain medicaments. I don't really pay attention to that though.
-1	I think they are very busy and default to common diagnosis.  Seems like it takes a few follow ups before they go into any depth.
-1	i've been seeing him for a very long time and he has never let me down or given me bad medical advice. i trust him one hundred percent.
-1	I don't have a regular doctor anymore due to no insurance and the clinic we were seeing closed. Most doctors I've experienced blame any and all of my health issues on my being overweight. Unfortunately, this has left many conditions undiagnosed for years, some of which actually contributed to my overweightness.
-1	The last time I went to the doctor they ran a lot of tests on me that resulted in a $700 bill, later when I saw my gyno he said that the tests were unnecessary. I don't have a need to go to the doctor right now but I would look for another place to go. 
1	I trust my doctor because he has been in my life since I was a baby. He's been a family doctor to my family for years and we all love him as if he is apart of our family. 
-1	I think that the doctor has my best health and happiness in mind when making decisions. I ultimately think that the doctor makes a lot of money, but that this also motivates him to give me the best available care.
1	I have seen my same doctor for a long time. He always has my best interest in mind. I have always been able to rely on his judgement. 
-1	I do not have a primary doctor but when i receive treatment i do trust what the doctors and nurses tell me because they have more knowledge about what is wrong with me
1	I trust my doctor, she asks good questions and always seems to take the time necessary to understand my needs. She doesn't seem in a hurry like other doctors I've seen in the past. 
1	Being a nurse has helped me see doctors in a different way. There are some doctors that have proved to me that I can trust them and there have also been some doctors that have been deceitful to their patients. If a doctor is honest with me and spends time talking to me then I can trust them. If I have a doctor that comes in the room and doesn't engage with me or sends his/her nurse in to talk to me, then I have less trust. 
1	he takes good care of me and if any thing is wrong with me he will sit and explain my options to me and we can decide what form of actions to take
-1	I don't 100% trust my doctor when it comes to giving me advice on medications to take for my condition. I have asked him a few times about certain medications I should be treated with and he had to look them up because he had never heard of them.
-1	well Trust is, of course, essential to both physician and patient. Without trust, how could a physician expect patients to reveal the full extent of their medically relevant history, expose themselves to the physical exam, or act on recommendations for tests or treatments? Trust promotes efficient use of both the patient's and the physician's time. Without trust, the process of informed consent for the most minor of interventions, even a prescribed antibiotic, would become as time consuming as that needed for major surgery.rust may even have therapeutic value, enhancing the efficacy of prescribed treatment.22 Most importantly, trust in the doctor caring for them is of great importance to patients. Patients who trust their doctors rate their care more favorably, as demonstrated by Keating et al.23 in this issue, as well as by others.20,24 Numerous open-ended studies of patients' views about their care, in a variety of contexts, most of which did not include specific hypotheses about trust, have found that patients spontaneously discuss trust and its importance, adding
-1	I have had the same PCP for over 20 years and he has been straight and honest with me over the years..
-1	He seems capable, but not particularly out of the box or persol.  He seems a little confused and passive when I talk to him, but mostly that's because he's giving me basic info and agreeing with me.  There's also nothing particularly wrong with me, I just go for checkups, so it's not like I've really strained his abilities.
-1	Because they get payed by the amount of prescriptions they give. They are sponsored by companies and hospitals 
-1	I trust doctors they have the knowledge to help me I don't have myself they went to school to learn about medical procedures I didnt
-1	I trust my primary care, however sometimes I feel like she doesn't have all the information and that she's just trying her best. Sometimes I leave feeling confused. I feel like she is honest about all the different treatment options available, I just feel like she doesn't give the correct info because she doesn't know. 
-1	I only will trust a doctor who believes in God, I find this to be very important in how they handle situations
-1	he is totally trained and professional, educated about what he does and he does it well. Seems to care about my problems and researches everything  quite well and very thouroughly. Cares about me as a patient.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor - overwise I would have change my doctor immediately. No reason to visit doctor I cannot trust.
1	She listens to my concerns and offers options. I have learned that I need to write down my symptoms over time and let her know what I've been feeling and for how long. She is then quite willing to listen and explore options
-1	I don't always trust doctors I don't have a physician but if I did I would always make sure what he or she is telling me is true by getting a second opinion.
1	I trust my primary doctor depending on what it is. I value his honesty and I think he is a great doctor and knows what he is doing and cares for his patience.
-1	When talking to others about their experiences with their primary care physician, I know mine is better. My doctor takes what I say seriously and examines them. She makes sure that I take all the necessary tests and she scolds me when she feels that I am not taking my health seriously. I told her that I was having chest pains but that it is probably anxiety or heartburn. She made me that an EKG and based on those results, an ultrasound.
1	Because she looks out for my well being if i have a problem she will recommend treatment or send to a specialist.
1	II generally have faith in my General practioner because of  her education, background, and her level of competence.  She always displays empathy and care with her patients.
-1	my primary caretaker is very awesome! She is always down to earth and gives it to me straight. The only negative thing I have against her is she is not for using medicine as much. If it can be done, she would rather the body heal itself naturally. This is ok sometimes but when I have a dance concert coming up there is just not enough time so I don't want to have to argue about giving me medicine. 
-1	My doctor is caring and understands I like natural remedies and cures, but will make sure I am aware of all of my options in any condition and suggests what she feels is the best route for me. We have developed a relationship of trust and genuine care for each other. She always makes extra time for me during my appointments because she knows I like to talk and I feel that relationship helps foster trust so she doesn't rush me to a remedy to get me out of her office but cares about my well-being.
-1	most doctors have so many patients to see that they take too little time thoroughly listening to your problems
-1	My Dr is an intelligent female. She listens to me & takes my opinions into consideration. I trust her judgement. 
1	i trust my doctor because she has always listened and been very helpful when i needed to discuss something. i needed to get my first mammogram last year and had been putting it off. when i saw my doctor she really encouraged me to go and get it done. she wasn't mean or stern. she was very concerned for my well being and wanted me to get the mammogram done to benefit my health. 
1	He listens to me and never rushes my appointment. He returns my phone calls which is rare for doctors these days
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has known me since I was baby. She makes sure that I know what is going with my body at all times but she also tells it how it is.
-1	Generally, i do trust my physician, but I also feel that they see me so rarely, and see so many other patients, that they are not able to provide the best recommendation.
-1	"The dummy put me on birth control for headaches and then when I spiraled into panic attacks and depression, then came the zoloft and birth control. I knew there ""had"" to be some other answer because this all just came on so suddenly. They want to give you the typical ""disease"" bullshit and that you'll be on meds the rest of your life to mage. F no. I spent days and asked the universe several times to lead me to the answer, and it did. My diet was high protein, high fat, high processed vegan junk food, and ever since switching to a high fruit, mostly raw vegan lifestyle, I becoming a new person, and don't need their bullshit meds. They get handouts for prescribing meds to people and they don't fully understand the lymphatic system, in fact they completely ignore it. Unless Dr. Morse on youtube who was the ONLY one, that actually completely explained the lymphatic system, how all diseases are connected and the underlying problem of too much acid chemistry in our bodies."
-1	I do not trust my physician because they have yet to tell me whats going on and ways to help my situation 
1	I do not have a primary care physician, but I have been to the doctor a few times in the past couple of years. Every time I have gone, I have been treated with respect, and the doctor has been honest with me every single time. I have no reason to distrust doctors in general, based on past experiences I have had with doctors. I have always gotten better when following a doctor's advice.
-1	I wouldn't say that I have complete trust. They do what they can do. For anything that is beyond their scope of expertise, they send you to a specialist.
-1	It is very important to be able to trust your doctor or physician. Your health is in the hands of your or physician.
-1	I find that while my primary care physician offers thorough screenings, some of the information given at my appointments seems to be standard for everyone, rather than taken my personal medical history into account. I feel like the treatment is not always individualized.
-1	I don't trust or distrust doctors.  It depends on the situation if I feel like I can believe what they are telling me. 
-1	I just can't trust doctors any more.  I think they are like mechanics and just trying to upsell me on every little thing that they do.  Every stupid appointment is two hundred bucks.  just stupid
-1	based on my experience with the doctor over time and in various circumstances relating to my health and my own knowledge and research
-1	My doctor has found and been able to diagnoses what other doctors just left untreated..I completely trust my Doctor and his team of staff.I would recommend anybody and everybody to my doctor.
-1	I don't trust anybody & thats basically it. I have had enough terrible experiences in the past with people on a whole. Everybody is all for themselves nowadays & they will only treat you nice because it is their job & they are getting paid for it. Majority of the time i think thats what it is. I do believe there are a few that actually care though but they are scarce.
-1	i have not visited a doctor myself in a very long time but my experience has not always been on good terms
-1	I find that often doctors just do whatever is needed for them to get from patient to patient (take as little time as needed) and sometimes just don't listen to what their patient is saying to them.  I can understand their busy schedule but sometimes the care doesn't seem persol, just rushed.
-1	He's a good doctor he has helped me with my lower back to see the pain management doctor but the people that work for him doesn't do there job with referrals for me for mental health
1	My doctor knows my body as much as I do, maybe more. He knows my existing condition, and past history. If we try a cure for something and it dosen t work, then after awhile, we will try something else.
-1	I generally think that doctors are good people who go into medicine to try to help people. I also believe that like any profession, there are nuances that average people do not understand or care to, and I can not completely trust an individual who has personal incentive to provide you care that is not necessarily ideal for you. As long as pharmaceuticals are as big of an industry as they are I cannot completely trust doctors. 
-1	I have been going to my doctor for over 20 years, I trust her. I feel as if she treats me based on my needs not as a guideline of treatment, but for individual needs. She talks to me like a person and shows respect and compassion.
-1	I don't specifically have a primary care doctor. I trust that there are some doctors that can be completely trusted to help you make the right choices. Seeing malpractices and other missed illnesses in my family, I can see how it's easy to distrust some doctors.
-1	My physician is reserved.  I do not feel totally comfortable with him.  He is nice but not very talkative.  He is a general doctor, so I am not sure that he is up on everything that is specialized.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to him for a long time. He always explains things to me in detail. He doesn't rush, or ignore my questions.
-1	I feel that my doctor does all that he can with my health care, I just don't completely trust any of them.
1	I trust my doctor because she is our family doctor and she always explain my condition to me and refer me to a specialty when I need one,she take good care of me and my whole family.  
-1	Alot of my anxiety of fully trusting doctors boils down to when my grandfather was sick.  The doctors were not able to identify the source of his fever until I mentioned that after googling his symptoms that lymphoma has all the same symptoms.  Only then, they finally tested and were able to diagnose him 24 hours before he passed away.
1	I've always been taught to never completely trust anyone who makes a living off of you, because at the end of the day, the want to make the most money possible.
1	I've known for this doctor for years, and for the most part he has been quite helpful. Thereby, when he outlines a plan for me to follow, I generally follow it. There have mostly positive results. Thereby, increasing my trust in him. 
-1	 I trust all of my professionals and doctors with all my medications and my life .positions and doctors are the same thing one just tell you more than elder..
1	I work with my doctor and I really like him. He is very good at listening and let me be apart of my treatment plan. 
1	My primary care doctor is a family friend. He has also been my doctor for over 20 years and that I am aware of he has never lead me in the wrong direction. He might tell me something and then I will look it up and it will be what he says so therefore I tend to believe him. If I do the things he tells me to do I usually feel better.
-1	"Some physicians are very ""textbook"" and don't really apply what I think to what their diagnosis ultimately is "
1	In all of my recent doctor visits, the doctors have suggested minor preventative things I could perform to better my health, that were completely unrelated to the original visit's intention. It wasn't necessary, but they care in general to see less patients.
-1	He's been my doctor for over 20 years. He's not the most organized and he makes mistakes but he has a good bedside manner and he cares about my health. 
-1	The doctor has a quota of patients that he has to see to make a profit for the day. this leads to the doctor spending less time than is possibly needed to fully aid a patient
1	My Primary care doctor spends time with me and answers all my questions, tells me if I need to be concerned about something and doesn't waste my time if I don't. I have asked for him on the phone and he answers my calls and emails promptly if I have concerns.
1	He seems to know his stuff and has never disappointed me in the past. His attitude shows that he cares and really takes care of me.
1	My dr.is very thorough  in his work researches the issue or problem and gives u the option on your best possible care
-1	They don't listen to the patient.  They give you therapy before they even xray anything.  Everything is either your dehydrated, to walk, go check your eyes and other hairbrained answers.  I wish old school doctors still existed.  These young ones are terrible.
1	I am able to easily talk to my doctor about issues I may have. She is very thorough and takes the time to answers my questions in a way I understand. I appreciate this.
-1	He did not provided all the answers I needed. It took him less than 5 minutes to see me and guess what's wrong with me. I felt like I visited a quack. I spent 100 dollars in which I can diagnose myself online for free.
-1	Doctor has seen me and my family through loss, illness and family ifficulties. He has always weighed the options to get us any help or medications we have needed
1	I've been with my doctor for so long I just trust her word and care and believe she would give me the best options
-1	I don't have a primary car physician.  I haven't had one in over a decade.  My doctor left the practice and I was switched to someone else without my knowledge or opinion and then they moved to a different location and 'lost' me as a patient and wasn't accepting new patients.  I've always left appointments feeling like I'd been let down in my interactions with doctors.  
-1	I generally trust my physicians, but I'm not afraid to ask questions or challenge their proposed approach if I'm aware of something they may not have considered. If my treatment isn't working, I'll do some research on my own and come back with questions the next time.
1	My doctor takes time to talk to me about things going on in life (even politics) and not just my physical condition. Also she follows up with emails about how I'm doing and once when I was sure I had a bladder infection, all I did was email her and she prescribed what I needed. She explains treatments well and asks questions to make sure I understand. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he cares about my health and needs hes very patient and understanding he keeps me informed
-1	I distrust physicians because the way the medical system is set up isn't about quality of care. The way the medical system is set up is to push as many patients through as quickly as possible. Once we start incentivizing quality care; then my trust in physicians will rise.
1	I trust my doctor because she is smart, caring, takes time to hear and listen to my issues. She genuinely cares for me.
1	Well, I trust the doctors for their knowledge and their experience and that is the most important thing for me
-1	My doctor asks questions to be sure he is treating me effectively.  He listens without judgment (as I have encountered with another doctor) and he doesn't make me feel belittled.  
1	She listens to me and we have an excellent report. I think she is  caring and remembers me from previous appointments.
1	I trust doctors because they are helpful and reliable in helping patient treat thaie ailment and diseases.
1	Always honest with me, asks me questions to really know what's going on and to also ensure I understand
1	She shows me that she cares. She refers me to specialists when she's unsure, she follows up with me quickly, and she seems very knowledgeable.
1	I trust my doctor but I realize that sometimes a problem needs a different viewpoint. I think that my doctor does the best she can but sometimes a problem needs an expert in a different field. I trust my doctor to admit this and move me on to see that person. I think that my doctor has my best interest in mind when she makes decisions related to my health. 
1	I trust that he has my best interests in mind, he usually presents me with options for any concerns/issues I have and encourages me to do my own research into those options to ensure I can make a fully informed decision. He takes his time during our visits to explain to me what I need to know, and almost always request that I follow up with him in a timely manner to ensure I am on a recommended path towards meeting any goals/treatments that have been selected.
1	My doctor is very open and honest. She just not speak down to me or just give me orders. She communicates with me in a dialogue, listening to my concerns and opinions. She shows real interest, offers advice, and listens. She does not lecture but works with me as a teammate to take care of my health.
-1	I think my doctor is very likely to want to prescribe a medication too early without looking deep enough into my condition. I think my doctor could gather more symptoms in order to make a more informed decision. 
-1	Because he through in everything he does for the patient, he tells you what is right and what is wrong for your physical being.
-1	I do not really fully trust any doctor that much since sometimes whatever is affecting me cannot be solved by my doctors. 
-1	I trust my primary care doctor cause she/he been there for me since the age of 7 so my bond with the doctor is more then strong
-1	I feel like sometimes my doctor does things that i don't like and I wish they would come to me and go over it with me more.
-1	"If the doctor is bad, it's likely that it would have been revealed by now to someone else. It's extremely unlikely that a doctor would be ""out to get me"" specifically. Furthermore, since I lack the necessary scientific knowledge to verify everything the doctor says, I have no real way to check what they say. Since it's unlikely that they're misleading me and attempting to verify them is impractical, there's little point in worrying about it. Of course, if someone does mislead me, I wouldn't hesitate to distrust them in particular."
-1	I mostly trust my current health care provider, a nurse practitioner. She listens and took some of my recent experiences and behavior seriously. For example, I recently took someone else's pain pills because I was in serious pain. She saw that as a need for my pain to be addressed, not me overreacting.
-1	Personally, I distrust my primary care doctor because she is always in a hurry and rarely takes the time out of to fully listen to me. She is always leaving the room and doing multiple things at once not being fully immersed in my care. 
1	He reviews all my conditions with me, asks questions, and then follows up with personalized suggestions or comments.  
1	because me and my mom have been going to him over 15 years and he has never been wrong for both of us and seems honest and caring and always meets our needs
-1	She seems like a good doctor. I don't have any complaints. If she thought something was wrong I'm sure she'd tell me.
1	I trust my doctors because my doctor helped me get well again an does his best to put me on the right medication an make sure I'm in good health 
-1	I don't know where the doctor is coming from or what motivates the doctor. I am young so the doctor would probably overlook serious issues and may misdiagnose me
-1	I do trust doctors. The only thing I disagree with is if you call with a question they say go to the ER or doctor immediately. that is not always the case.
-1	My doctor seems to care about me when I visit. She does not contact me often, but when I need help she is helpful.
-1	I generally trust doctors in general. However, they get caught in a huge bureaucracy and regulations and fear of law suits when it comes to healthcare in general, it limits their options.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been seeing him for over 15 years and every time I go there it is consistent.  I have no reason not to trust him.  I cannot speak for everybody else though, because I believe some doctors could be corrupt. 
-1	I trust my doctor because she wants to help me and she cares about me.  She also takes the time to listen to me and does not rush my visit.
1	I trust my doctor thouroughly. She let's me know what works and doesn't work. She is truly intetested in me as a patient and her nurses have called after a sick visit to see how I'm doing. She's awesome. 
-1	depends on your condition and symptoms you might have to make several visits to figure out what the problems are
1	It depends on the profressionalism of the doctor.A doctor that speaks for you and your charts. One that research different treatments but has seen it through their other patients and is ready to venture with you and that is open minded everyone is new.
1	Just general anxiety from test results. The people I deal with are all very good and do all they can to make me more relaxed. 
1	My doctor has been with me through all of my children, he has helped deliver them and he knows what i am interested in and what I am not interested in. He finds ways to bring other options on the table when I do not agree with what he or another doctor has said.
-1	I feel that, similar to lawyers, medical professionals will sometimes look to profit instead of wanting the best service for their customer. For example, a few years ago my dentist suggested braces, which would've been an extra 4,000 dollars. I refused, and my teeth are still perfectly healthy.
-1	i trust them because they have always been loyal and also offered me good services in the past. I have recommended them to family and friends and they also had good things to say about them
1	I havery had my primary care physician for a very long time , and each time I consuled him I always feel great.  Also, his reputation and experience so far speaks well for him.
1	I've had the same doctor for 16 years, and so far he hasn't given me any reason not to trust him. I have been extremely healthy for all of those years too though so he hasn't had much of a chance to be wrong. Overall I'm comfortable with him, and feel like he does a good job.
-1	You can trust your doctor to tell you about your condition and what the doctor tell you about your illness
1	I trust my primary care physician because he really cares about my health and well being. He is very patient, and informative. 
-1	I have been going to the same office for my whole life, so I feel that the team of physicians there is invested in my family and I. I am comfortable with them and their decisions as a result.
-1	They sometimes give you the wrong information or what they think is wrong with you. Then when everything turns out bad they seem not to care about it.
-1	I trust my doctor because of the signs and the symptoms I be having but distrust when it comes to some medications I'm supposed to be taking with harmful side effects
-1	I do not have a primary care physician so I am unable to fully complete this section.  I do trust doctors in general and rely on them if I should ever need to use a medical service.
-1	I believe sometimes a doctor will persuade you into what they think should happen or their beliefs. They don't always look at it as your way of thinking just what they've been taught and learned. They also aren't alway as compassionate about and undertanding about the way you feel they do things every day and some doctors loose their passion for their work and it becomes just a pay check.
1	I think they tell me my options. I rely on their experience. I have rare skin disease so most doctor's don't know much about it. I can tell by their responses if I  trust them. Example - some admit they don't  know about my condition, while some try to suggest something I know doesnât work.
-1	I have trust in my physician because he has always been correct regarding any health issue I have had in the past. I have no reason to distrust him as I have never left an appointment feeling anything has been overlooked when it comes to my health
-1	I've had the same doctor for approximately 10 years, he's always helpful and knowledgeable. Provides me with answers and comforts my concerns but every visit feels more and more rushed like they are squeezing in more patients than time. It's like you are leading the visit by talking non-stop so he doesn't run away to the next.
1	They have gone above and beyond to check in with me after appointments and procedures. They seem genuinely concerned about any issues I am having. I feel like the believe me when I have pain and are not dismissive of any condition. 
-1	My doctor doesnt seem to be quick to prescribe medication, answers all my questions, is calm, doesnt seem to be in a hurry to move on to the next patient. Makes me feel confident in his ability.  
-1	My primary care physician is not very thorough. He also doesn't take my concerns that serious. It also seems as though he is always rushed when I go in for an appointment. 
-1	I have a new doctor. So I have to see how I can work well with them. I need to communicate with her carefully to get the information and help that I am in need of.
1	I've known this doctor for a long time. He's very trustworthy and kind. I believe in him.
-1	I trust my doctor because I really feel like she really cares about helping me. She takes her time to listen and explain things to me. 
1	My primary care doctor is always ready to be there when I need to talk to him and if he can't be there a nurse is always available to get back with me. He is available by phone 24/7 and that is a comfort to me. I have been going to him for several years now and also my brother has been going to him too. Makes sure appointments are set up so that I don't miss any. Explains things in a layman's language so that you can understand what is going on with you physically and what you need to do to take care of any health problems that could arise and to keep me healthy. Makes sure that all vaccines are up to date and that I get my flu shot every year. Very happy with him. Also my dermatologist I am very happy with..He is very up-to-date.
1	They define the position for the organization, for potential applicants, and legally. If there's any question about whether a staff member is actually doing her job, or being asked to perform duties that have nothing to do with her position, the job description should clarify the situation. It should also make it clear who's ultimately responsible for specific tasks or areas.
-1	I trust them because they know a lot about what they are doing and they care about the patients. They have the awareness to know how to take action
-1	The practice I go to has SO MANY PATIENTS. The care is generally good, but I often feeling like I'm on an assembly line and their time with me is on the clock, so they might be more expedient than thorough.  
1	I HAVE BEEN WITH MY PCP FOR 25 + YEARS. SHE HAS ALL WAYS BEEN UP FRONT ABOUT MY CARE. NEVER HAD A REASON TO MISTRUST HER.
1	I completely trust my doctor. She takes a lot of time to listen to my concerns and answer any questions I may have. She never makes me feel rushed like a lot of other doctors. She works on a gameplan to treat something with what I am most comfortable with. Most importantly, she was able to quickly diagnose a foot pain I had been experiencing for months which gave me a lot of confidence in her abilities.
-1	My primary care physician does a good job of looking at all the possible treatment options, and talking with me in detail about which option would work best for me.  I think it would be great if they incorporated a more holistic approach to my care and not just looking at the medication treatments.  
-1	"First, I want to say that it's very hard to rate the sentence ""all in all you have complete trust in your doctor"" on a sliding scale. The sentence contains an absolute, so it's not clear. Next, to sum up how much I trust my doctor, I'd say I generally trust her, and I think that she's a competent person with good intentions, but that she also has a reasonable amount of self-interest and might not be above soft-selling me something I don't really need, like botox. I don't think that she would lie to me about it, though. She has a fairly conservative point of view about prescribing medications and I appreciate that."
-1	 Trust my primary care physician because not only did he go to school to be in his profession but he also has taken the time to get to know me.
-1	I trust doctors mainly because I don't really have a reason not to. I have never been mislead by a doctor or have received any bad medical advice in the past. 
-1	I trust my doctor with my health or else I wouldn't go to my physician. I am a person who once I find a trustworthy doctor, I will stay with them until I need to change physician or I am not able to.
-1	they're medically trained and have good bedside manners. Shows genuine concern for my health and wealth being.
1	I have not trusted all physicians completely, but my current one has been a gem. He's been completely kind, compassiote, gives multiple options and educates me on what he's telling me (whether I ask for further explation or not) and spends time with me instead of rushing. When I had blood work done, he called me persolly to discuss my results even though they weren't all that remarkable and gave me further thoughts on how best to approach my health.
1	i have been using the same doctor for 18 years she delivered my son. also was a mentor to my daughter. she also treats her medically
-1	My dr and i believe that most dr's are too by the book.  They see a person as a payment or a number rather than an individual. This causing them to just use us as test subjects to kind of see what works rather than really getting to know us and our bodies. 
1	I have had my primary care dr for many years. I know he is a very good man who does his best to help me. He knows a lot about different things. He knows my history. He spends the time to listen to me. I still make my own decisions about things, but I really do trust him a lot. 
-1	for the most part I trust some of my doctors.  I don't have a primary care physician but I have other doctors I see regularly.
-1	 understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions
-1	I have great trust in doctors because it takes a lot to become one. Lots of school lots of practice and lots of experience make for great helpers.
-1	My husband and I moved to a new state and we didn't know anything about a Primary Care Physician, so we looked up who seemed to be best in this town.  The doctor was not taking on new patients, but there was another doctor in his practice.  This doctor who I just mentioned is awful!  He barely seems to care when I have an issue and need his help.  We are currently looking for a new PCP and are getting ideas from others who we trust.  Also, our previous PCP where we used to live was AMAZING!  She took her time, asked questions and made sure that I was cared for!  That just makes this new PCP so much worse!
-1	She listens to me. Also I have other family members that go to her and they have gotten wonderful care from her also
-1	I trust doctors in general, but they are human and can make mistakes. And then there are some who are not very good at what they do. My trust is conditiol.
-1	I do not have complete trust in any doctor. You have to be your own advocate. Doctors struggle with the amount of time spent with patients versus the number of people that need to be seen each day. Any time I am given a medication or advice from a doctor, I do my own research before trusting it completely.
1	I have had my doctors for several years now. We've built a relationship and I do trust them to share information with me freely and that we will choose the best course of action together. 
-1	Doctors tell you what is good for them financially. They may have stock in a certain type of medicine so they prescribe that medicine more often. It's always best to get a second or third opinion.
1	Doctors are very well trained at what they do and how much they know. They have to keep doing continuing education to keep their skills up to par.
1	My doctor I found to be honest with me, taking precautions so that if something is wrong we can correct it in the easiest way rather then going to the extreme (operation) to correct it. He seems to cares and calls me as soon as the results for a test are available.
-1	He know what wrong I dont so he nice and kind answer all of my question I! Very happy with my doctor I trust him
1	He seems to have a good understanding of what goes on. He lets me know whatis likely and will order a test if I'm worried even if it's unlikely. Seems nice and caring
1	I trust my doctor because he knows all the right meds I should be on and what I should do and not do . He always answers all my questions I have and makes sure I am always okay .
-1	I trust the doctors because they know more about the health systems than I do this is why I trust my primary care person 
1	    I trust my family doctor completely because he is thorough and complete in ALL of his medical dealings with me. He answers my questions and asks me questions too. If I need a specialist, he knows which ones are better than average and will tell me who to see.
-1	I believe in no man 100%. They make mistakes just as I do and I can't see looking to someone else to validate me.
1	I trust the care of my primary care physician because I have been a patient with him for years and also because I am a LPN, he trusts my knowledge as well and we can always come to a decision together regarding my care.
-1	He seems to know what he talking about when it comes to my health plus he explains it in layman terms
-1	I think they probably had altruistic motives in becoming a doctor.  I think their professiolism dictates that they act properly.  I think they're probably well-educated and intelligent. 
-1	I believe that most doctors have the patients best interest at heart and they want to help them get better and give them good medical advice
-1	I always trust my physician I trust hospital committee they know what fits my needs and take care of me with good customer service 
-1	Well my doctor seems like she knows what she doing, plus she did do surgery on me so that mean I do trust her 
-1	I am not completely happy with my current physician. He tends to rush patients in and out of the office, spending very little time. I always feel rushed and try to obtain the most important information first. I feel like my physician always looks for the quick and easy answer instead of spending time looking into something more seriously.
-1	I haven't been seeing my PCP for that long.  For a long time I didn't have one, and this Dr. was one that was accepting new patients.  I find her manner rather brusque and hurried, I actually need to make her stop and answer questions.  I get a lot of my information from the nurses, but i want to hear it from the Dr.  She seems to always be thinking about her next patient instead of me.  I feel like I don't hold her attention for even the five minutes she spends with me.  For that reason, I will be looking for another PCP, it's just hard to find one that will accept new patients.
1	He has been my doctor through cancer and other maladies for 20 years. He is very modest and gentle. He has found problems with my health that I was not aware of, such as pneumonia.
-1	I trust him, but he is a family practitioner so sometimes I don't think he always knows what is best when it comes to my mental health.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been going to her for almost ten years. She usually takes the time to explain things to me and make sure I am comfortable with the decisions that we make.
-1	Because they provide me with the best decisions for my health and body. Both physically and mentally 
-1	As I only see a doctor once every few years, I would say I have had no reason to mistrust any of them.  In general, I feel I have been given adequate information and care.
1	I trust my doctor completely. He has never wronged me and he is always willing to listen to my most intimate problems and give objective advice on what to do to treat any ailments I have.
1	i have had the same doctor for 10 years and know him and his decision making abilities and he has a good persoble quality and is fairly accurate
-1	 I feel like it they can learn more about their  position  but like some just give you a quick answer  I feel like some doesn't listen to what you going  going through
-1	tnhey have the knowledge and training and should know what is for the best for thier patients whether they do or not
-1	I feel my doctor is rather caring about my medical needs. He tries his best to cover all bases when an issue comes about to elimite any possibilities of what the issue can be causing any underlying illness.
1	I trust my physician because they always ask whether I am doing okay or whether a certain medication is working for me. They want to make sure that I am in good health every time that I go to the doctors office for a visit. 
1	I do trust my primary care physician. Mainly because she takes the time to listen to what I have to say. And responds to me as if I'm a friend and not a medical record number.
1	While I do trust my doctor sometimes I worry that she focuses on one aspect of my health while I'm trying to get help for something new that just came up. 
1	I do not have a primary care physician though I do trust doctors, but rarely I receive that doctor that just cares about getting you in and out. Sometimes I find out about other treatments options myself but I can tell my doctor about it to receive more information and how the treatment works exactly, so I can figure out which fits best for me.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician because I believe that they are generally caring about me and their other patients. Times where I have had issues with my health my primary care physician has been able to effectively diagnose and treat my illnesses and return me to the state that I should be in. I don't necessarily find any reason to distrust my doctor as she has given me no reason to. 
-1	I don't trust to many doctors because of the reputation they've been given and how they work with the insurance companies.  I believe money and insurance companies have an influence on the treatment a fixture prescribes.
-1	I trust my PCP because they are good at explaining situations with my health and laying out options. I am skeptical whether ALL possibilities are considered, but I am confident that the most likely scenarios are addressed first. 
-1	I had a hard time answering because I have not been to a PCP for 8 years or so because I have not been at all sick.
-1	Because whenever I have had a health problem I have been treated well and achieved good results by staying healthy and stable, without having to buy or consume unnecessary medicines
1	My oncology team is also my nephews, they have been treating me for six years and him for almost one and they have managed to keep me up and moving despite how difficult it is for me to tell them everything. Plus our main dr is known around the world and is always traveling so thats nice to know.
-1	Sometimes i feel doctors are so jaded by patients that they dont really take the time to listen and respond.
1	I have been with my current primary care physician for over 10 years.  She knows me as well as my family.  She explains things if I don't understand.  She listens when I have concerns.  I trust my physician to provide care that is best for me.
-1	I have been with them through multiple appointments and issues. He looks out for what is the best for me, and I trust him and his diagnosis. He has soothed my worries and worked to make sure I am helahty. I have complete trust
1	I trust my doctor because I have no reason not to and she is competent. Again, I have had only routine visits, nothing serious, so I don't have a lot to base it on.
-1	In all honesty, I do not trust my doctor at all. It seems as if most doctors in general mostly just care about their own convenience and making money. Even though the job itself is to help people, to them it's still just a job to them at the end of the day. 
-1	I trust doctors to an extent. Not too much though. They are in business to make a profit at any cost!
-1	I do trust my doctor but not doctors in general. Many are only looking after themselves and do not have the patient's best interest at heart. I will not stay with a doctor I think is doing that.
-1	My doctor is above the average but still I've had to correct him regarding important details of my medical history as I've had to to varying extents with many doctors.  I do find that he is patient and receptive, however.  I've definitely had worse but my doctor is not ideal for me.  I'm not certain that exists.
-1	He usually explains the situation to me, asks my opinion when choosing a treatment. This way, he earned my trust
-1	They have good intentions and want to help. They also have rules and regulations they have to comply with and don't have the time to get into the details about individual patient care. I trust that they are giving good advice, but it's only part of the picture. As an adult I need to research any conditions I have and find the best overall plan to treat it, including their treatment recommendations or medicines. 
-1	They use my past drug usage to assume they know what I need instead of asking what they think I recommend and going from there with options
1	I trust my doctor because she is open and always take the time to listen to me. Also explains all procedures small or big in details so that I feel comfortable.
-1	When i trust my doctor, it helps to create a better relationship between the two of us. Those who distrust the doctor may end up being combative, and that is not conducive to good health. Of course, trusting your doctor starts when you have a good doctor that is professional
-1	I don't have a primary care doctor but I believe most doctors are not trust worthy as they tend to focus on the money rather than the patients. Most doctors prescribe medicines big pharmaceutical companies want them to.
1	I have had the same doctor for the past 20 years. He has never steered me wrong all of this time so I value and trust his opinion. 
-1	I think they just come up with explations to get you out faster
1	I feel most doctors are not hands on enough and can began to make stupid mistakes from it further training. 
-1	They are there to do a job and I think doctors want to help so they always try to do their best and sometimes they are wrong you have to look to yourself to help too
-1	I find in hard to trust doctors because a lot of people become doctors for the wrong reason instead of becoming one to help people they become doctors because it's a high paying job.
-1	I don't have a primary doctor because the ones I went to weren't that great and I feel that they didn't understand me or didn't believe me and my condition and made me feel like I was lying
-1	I think that the amount of patients doctors are forced to see to be paid reasonably means they spend small periods of time with large numbers of patients. I am sure that given more time with each patient, along with adequate time to review medical tests and records, more nuances of medical conditions may be noticeable and it would be easier for doctors to prep for each appt with adequate resource material to provide the patient.
-1	I mostly trust her, but I feel that she is very rushed and asks few questions. I feel like she does not ask enough questions. This is compared to previous doctors I've had in the past.
-1	I believe for the most part my doctor sees hundreds of patients and is on a time restraint.  I feel that the rush to get people in and out makes looking for the most convenient option the first response. That the doctor does not know me or the other patients well enough to have a relationship beyond our charts that he barely looks over as he is coming in the room and that the nurse has actually more details and stake in personal care.
-1	I generally trust my doctor because she is highly educated and has gone through years of training in her profession.
-1	I don't totally trust anybody I trust myself most of all, I know doctors who honestly prescribe drugs because of promotions received from a drug rep.
1	I trust my doctor because she is smart she has her degrees. She's great at explaining things to me and she really cares about my health.
-1	My doctor has never given me advice or medical care or information that turned out to be wrong or incorrect
-1	He is an expert.  He has practical experience.  He seems like a good person.
-1	In the past he has provided me with the medical care I required or has referred me to someone who can give me the care I needed.
1	I have seen my primary physician for a number of years. He has always been thorough in hearing out my problems and then giving multiple options as how to treat the problems. All the times ive had to go see him the diagnosis and treatments he has recommended have been spot on
1	I've been coming to my doctor for a very long time. Over that time, there has been a lot of trust built and that's hard to come by. She always seems to be concerned about the stability of my health.
-1	Doctors are stuck within a system over which they have limited control. They have to consider the patient, the budget, and themselves.
-1	My doctor takes the time to get to know me and my life. He will allow my to voice and problems or questions I have about my health. I would like to think that my doctor actually cares about me, because that is the impression I get. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is thorough and explains options and listens to me. She is also great about communicating with me between visits
-1	I think they are more into there own money earning then into really helpping me out with my needs. They do help in the way they tell me but with the other needs I need I have to find out my own information since they dont offer it and I think they should give that information also
-1	I feel like I generally trust most doctors that I have dealt with because I usually do some good research or ask friends on doctors they have had experiences with before making a decision to visit them or not. 
1	I trust him because he's never given me a reason not to. Every time I've gone to him he gives me the correct medication or suggestions to alleviate what's going on and they've worked every time
1	My doctor has shown to be really caring and trustworthy over the years that I have known him. He has never led me wrong and always seems to know what he's talking about involving my health.
-1	I feel like drs in general go the easy route. Also, I feel they prescribe more medicine than is necessary and it causes harm, and I don't like that feeling. 
-1	I like that my doctor has no problem  explaining things. He also suggest second opinions if I'm unsure. Be takes the necessary steps to get to the problem of any issues I may have.
1	I have been going to my doctor for the last 26 years.  He is a fabulous doctor and I trust him in every way!!
1	My doctor visits are follow up type that makes it easy to communicate with him any problems that I may be experiencing.my doctor asks me questions as well as I ask him questions.we have open communication which is best for my conditions
1	I just do? He gives me good vibes, he knows what he's talking about. I feel at ease and comfortable with the care that I get.
-1	I had a doctor for many years that I trusted completely.  He retired and I haven't for a doctor that I trust. They treat me as a number.
1	I dont have a primary care doctor. The reason. I dont have one at this time. Past situations was gret amd he treated mw with respect and he was truthful. He made sure that all my questions was answered and i that i understood each and every process.
-1	I dont' trust the medical system at all, prefer natural remedies wherever possible.  A doctor is a last resort.
-1	My Doctor is so very busy that she has some helpers that see her patients. They are good at what they do I suppose, and it is easy to see them for an appointment. I do wonder if they know my health as well as my Doctor. 
-1	I have two primary care physicians that work in the same facility. Generally, I trust them with my medical needs. I don't go in too often, so usually when I do go, there is a need for treatment. They are good at assessing the symptons and prescribing treatment. Occasionally, there was a need for follow up that wasn't taken care of but overall, I trust them.
-1	I feel like we almost have no choice but to have a general trust in our doctors, right? Otherwise, what else is there? I am not naive enough to believe that there aren't plenty with special interests and motivations beyond doing their jobs well and with care, but a certain trust has to exist.
-1	She's caring and always want me to come in for check ups. She's reliable but she does take a lot of vacations. All in all she's very understanding and I know I can contact her through email or phone. Also, I can do a walk in if I need her for an emergency. I have seen my doctors only her assistant
-1	because i trust my primary care physician and i have complete trust in my doctor. My doctor is totally honest
1	I see a DO rather than an MD. I really like how current he is on  new issues in medicine. He also is knowledgeable on the body and prefers to prescribe stretches, and lifestyle changes than medication. I like that he is very thorough and really cares for our family.
-1	I trust my doctor because I trust my hospital. My hospital has a really good reputation. I have been them for years.
-1	I don't see a reason not to trust them.
1	I think my dr takes the time to listen to me and give me good feed back when needed.  He is also good at referring me to the correct ppl.
1	I trust only as far as one can trust. Certainly I would not go to a doctor if I read poor reviews about him. I dont believe in intuition however if I get a very bad feel for a doctor based on how he approaches my questions or converses with me then I will find another. The only way to really trust is to have it built over time and that is the best I can do. Its never good to trust anyone 100% but you can establish a good level of trust based on past experience
-1	We tend to put doctors on a pedestal and to me this is so absurd.  They are human and subject to human error.  There is so much medical negligence.  You read about it just about every day.  My doctor does not hesitation to write out a prescription.  He is aware that I am totally against taking prescribed drugs. He only cares about a quick fix.   I also feel that it's a money game.  
-1	I trust my PCP because a previous Dr had misdiagnosed me, so I went to my current Dr. for a second opinion.  He immediately sent me to the ER and it ultimately saved my life.
-1	Doctors don't always give the best advice and many times make the wrong diagnosis. People can fix issues on their own, such as reversing heart disease and such through diet but doctors refuse to accept that despite it being proven countless times. So for reasons such as that, I don't trust doctors in general to do what is best for someone. 
-1	You can never trust a doctor 100%. Most times they given you medicine you don't need or sometimes they can Ms diagnose you
-1	My doctor is new so I don't really know her that well.  I will however put trust into her degree. She belongs to a good insurance organization also. 
-1	I trust my doctor but through past experience I know that doctors sometimes make bad decisions that can end up in devastating circumstances. They often have support so should not make snap decisions without consenting other doctors and nurses.
1	In the past several years, I have visited and communicated with my PCP for several times. I am satisfied with the experience of each visit. There is no way to complaint at all. I also communicate with other patients and they share the same opinion with me.
1	I have been going to my primary doctor for almost 20 years. I have been fairly healthy all this time and has been good with recommendations when i have had health issues.
-1	I trust my doctor and his decisions about what is right for me, but overall I am know what is best for me and I do not trust many medications.
1	I trust my child's physician because she has been with her since birth and does and amazing job at always explaining the immunization and anything else she will do or we should be concerned about 
-1	I think that for the most part that doctors do look out for you and want the best for you but I also thing that life gets in the way sometimes and maybe they just want to shuffle you out of the office so they can go home.
-1	I want to be able to fully trust my doctors but sometimes when I ask for further information about my specific problem, they don't seem to want to go into details which makes me doubt them. I also feel when they try to lump things to past problems I've been dealing with instead of looking at the problem individually I begin to distrust their judgement. 
1	I have been going to him for a long time.  He listens to me and knows me and my history.  He values my input, as he says no one knows my body better than me.  When I had some financial problems, he understood and started with the most conservative course of action, while still giving me good care.
-1	I trust my physician because I have had the same physician for years. I also feel that he gives solid advice and guides me to making proper medical decisions
1	Now he take care of me talk too me and tell me what I need too know About my health it is a good thing my doctor is great give me the things I need too know.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician. In general, I expect and believe that doctors want to help people and be honest with them about their medical conditions. But, they can be busy or overworked. They might be a bit busy and not focus as much on patients as they would like.
1	I have a big trust in my doctor because he has chosen his profession because he wants to help people achieve good health and good life.  I feel that my doctor has no reason to give me something that would jeopardize my health and my life.
-1	My PCP is part of a group.  They need to see as many patients as possible.  They rarely have time to deliver quality health care and be able to think through all options.
1	I feel that with all his training and years of practice he does know what is best for me and tries to help with any problems I may have.  Once in a while we don't agree but can work something out that we can both agree upon.
1	I have seen my primary care physician for many years now. She has taken the time to get to know me personally and builds on this each visit. She offer medical advice as she would give to her own family
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She is trustworthy and knows what she is doing most of the time of my visits
1	I have been going to him for over 20 years.  He is frank with m.  he make sure I always no the score.  He does not beat around the bush, and I appreciate that.  
1	he is very dedicated and thoroughly professional hhe is also kbowledgeable and cring and always follows up on things i trust him completely
1	My primary care physician is very much straight to the point. I only see him once a year because I am rarely sick. 
1	I have had the same doctor for years who has helped me with my conditions and has a high level of compassion and explains things to me where I can understand and answers any questions I might have.
1	I've had the same doctor for many years and I can fully say this man does truly care about his patients. He has a very good memory and understanding of what his patient's need. That is why I put a lot of trust in him.
1	I trust my primary care physician because they always treat me with respect and care. When I get that type of respect from someone they earn my trust with their professional opinions.
-1	Doctors have operated on me and have messed their operations,therefore,I do not have much trust in doctors !!!
-1	I trust my physician because I know that she know what's she is doing. She handles it very carefully and has respect
1	I believe that my doctor is actively listening to my concerns and is treating me as best as she can. I do trust her.
-1	I trust my doctor. However, I recognize that she is very busy, probably over-worked, and cannot take the time she, herself, would like to devote to her patients. It is not her fault how quickly she has to work and I know that she does the best job she can do given the situation. 
-1	My physician takes the time to thoroughly explain procedures & health care information.  I can trust him 
-1	I don't feel they go the extra mile to check for any ailments I feel they are in a rush and don't check for everything they could sometimes we have to offer suggestions which is not cool 
1	I trust them because they are here to help us all not hurt us and for the better being of our lifes always in a positive way of life always.
-1	To be honest try to everyone a chance to know them better and its their job help feel better if know feeling well and try you in way they can.
-1	he is an okay physician. i dont visit him much but when i do, he does his job and asks me questions. he gives me prescriptions
-1	I trust my doctor is a very great doctor. And is great person. Landis good at what she does as a great doctor.
-1	I've had my primary care physician for a long time. I like him and he's never done me wrong in the past. We have a good relationship and I trust that if something were to go wrong he'd give me the best options and treatment. 
-1	He seems to be on coming about my problems. He is honest,caring,humble,and complete.they make sure that I got for needs
1	I have been seeing my doctor for about 15 years and continue to be impressed with his empathy and competence. He has been voted one of the top Internists in our city year after year and he is very well respected in the medical community.
1	She always listens to my questions and concerns without making me sound totally ignorant or a bother to her
-1	He's always been a straight shooter. He gives me the information that I need and tells me what I need to do going forward.
-1	I knew that my physician was honest and caring when he called me at home to check on how I was doing. He is a straight talker - doesn't sugar coat anything but is still kind in delivery (even with unpleasant news). He never seems in a hurry to be done with an appointment. 
-1	I trust them because they went to school for being a doctor or physician I don't trust them because of the reason they push lots and lots of medicine on people when the main thing they need to tell the patient is to eat healthy and stop being sedentary 
-1	I don't trust nor distrust my primary care physician because they are simply there to do a job and I'm a customer of their service. Nothing more, nothing less.
-1	I wouldn't say that I trust them completely because they are really making an educated guess about any diagnosis they the give you
-1	I had bad experiences in the past where the doctors that were treating me acted like they didn't really care about the patients but they just wanted to get done with the day so I'm not easy to trust them in general
-1	I think generally I do trust my doctor, however, I think that ultimately after listening to my doctor any decisions about my health are basically mine and I don't always agree with my doctor. I had doctors who would tell me I needed procedures, that I don't think would have been right for me, so I I would seek another doctor. I also feel like some doctors are only interested in money and aren't interested in your well being.I have had doctors bill me for things I didn't get or charge me for cancelling an appointment.
-1	i trust them alot. they know what to do for me. they give me meds i need.  i like her and her practice
-1	I donât go to the doctor often. I see doctors as well educated people, and their decisions and diagnoses are more times correct than not. If I have a feeling theyâre wrong, I would let them know. As for prescribing medicine, as far as I know and what I have seen, doctors prefer prescribing the more expensive medicines so they themselves profit off of it. In that regard, although they arenât being dishonest, they arenât disclosing all options either. 
-1	Unfortunately, medical care in America is a business first.  I never know if the decisions my doctor is making are in my best interest or the best interest for his bottom line.
1	She is knowledgeable about medical issues in general and thorough in individual treatment plans. She also very caring and personable which puts me at ease.
1	My doctor has never let me down or been wrong.  I have been seeing her for a very long time and she will do whatever it takes to make me feel better or to get to a perfect conclusion as to what is wrong with me.  She believes in referrals and never hesitates to get me to the appropriate specialist if needed.
-1	I have been going to the same dr for over 30 years. He knows me and all my ailments and quirks so I believe that he has my best interest in mind even if I don't aways agree with him. If anything he is a little over protective. I like the when my husband goes to see him, the dr always asks about me and visa versa when I go to see him. There are times I have had to fight with him to get my husband the specialized care I feel he needs but I dont have to fight too hard and when the office refused to see my husband once because he didn't have the co-pay, our Dr threw a fit and told them they are NEVER to do that again. He is more than our doctor, he is our friend.
-1	It seems that it depends on what mood she is in..maybe in a hurry at times and doesn't appear to be thorough
1	My pcp is thorough and listens to my opinions about my medical issues. She frequently informs me of my options and lets me decide what I think is best for myself, since I know more about my problems than her.
-1	He has studied medicine a lot more then I have, but the things I have researched have aligned with what he has told me.
-1	After years of having pain and getting sick, I am still no closer to knowing what is wrong with me that I was 6 years ago. I never seem to get answers to why I am sick, and even after tests the doctors still don't know. I am so frustrated by this. I don't have health insurance and have to go to a clinic and never get the same health care provider twice.  There is no one to trust in my case.
-1	When the physician is new I trust them because there brain is fresh from studying and learning new stuff , but sometimes I feel like they might be a little bit nervous and they might make a mistake , for explain giving me the wrong drugs.
-1	She hasn't given me any reason not to trust her. She gives me plenty of her time, answers my questions, is friendly.
1	My current PCP is much better than some I've had in the past. She is still hurried at times due to her full office visit schedule, but does her best to spend all the available time productively. She uses electronic communication when possible to continue conversations. This is a great improvement over past doctors who have listened to one or two symptoms, fired off a prescription, and hurried out.
-1	I don't think I currently have a primary care physician, but I don't always necessarily trust doctors in general. My sister has had really bad luck with certain situations so that doesn't help. She's type 1 diabetic and was underweight for a while and the doctors were trying to claim my parents malnourished her when in reality she was just thin and sick from the diabetes. She has some other symptoms going on that they've been trying to find the cause of for years and still haven't. I do believe they're trying their best in this situation but they're definitely not perfect.
1	i trust my physician because that is their job to tell the truth and help you as needed. a doctor should always provide the help you need and should have a solution to your problem.
-1	I have seen my doctor for a long time. We have a good rapport, they're honest and clear me. In aldi very much trust my son's pediatrician, he's good at what he does. Quick to the point. 
-1	i think they only want to prescribe you medications and other things that make you feel better and come back for more
1	Choosing the right doctor is often put in terms of trust. Can you trust the doctor to do the right thing? Start off with the idea that even very good doctors do the wrong things sometimes. There is so much to know. They may not know as much as someone elseâbut the good doctors will go out of their way to learn what they may not know.  And they will ask for help from other doctors. I would trust some doctors to treat some conditions out of their area of specialization more than I would trust a specialist in that field whom I knew was careless. They can be relied on to approach a medical problem carefully. I cannot describe what goes into having good clinical judgment, but it is a real thing. I am not sure exactly what quality of mind and character it involves. It is a kind of being sensible.
1	I generally trust physicians. They have a lot of education and training by ture of the profession. Also, a doctor isn't likely to give poor care for too long, because it would likely be noticed. Doctors have a responsibility to be trustworthy, and I think that's the general cultural expectation.
1	They tell you whats best for you and how to take care of yourself.And the best ways to help yourself
-1	I trust her because I've had hey for years and she hasn't let me down yet I've had two kids successfully with no problem
1	I trust my doctor because she cares about me and takes the time to answer any questions that I have.  She also explains everything so that I can understand. She talks to me like a person and not just a cash machine. 
-1	I trust my primary physician because I know my physician for more than a decade and he has demonstrated competency and a caring about my medical needs.  
-1	Sometimes they give you the wrong information . Or may say you have something and not tell you what to do about it. 
-1	I like to think that most doctors know what they are doing and try to help patients and do what is right for them in their lives.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician. Regarding doctors in general, I don't trust them because a lot of them don't seem to care about you as a person, they only look at you as an insurance claim or a cash cow they can keep milking by adding on more tests or prescribing drugs just to get the most money they can from your insurance company or medicaid/medicare.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because the few times I have been when I had a problem they were able to diagnose me correctly and do the right thing to get me better again.  
-1	I trust my doctor enough to be able to accociate basic common symptoms and figure out the a good approach to taking care of those symptoms. I do believe the pharmacist have a much better understanding the scripts that they write out.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for years.  If it were a new doctor I might be a little more hesitant in my trust of them especially if I may not agree with their thoughts or approach.
-1	I trust doctors because they are extremely knowledgeable but they can make mistakes because they work in a fast pace high stress environment
-1	I feel like no matter what Dr. I go to, no matter what the reviews are lie they are always just about the money. it really sucks and I feel really awkward. I always feel like the doctors dont care about there patients. I have yet to find one that actually cares.
1	I trust this person to provide me with the medications I need to live a long healthy life. Even though they may reccomend a more expensive option for their benefit.
1	He has been my Doctor, and my friend, for many years.  He was also my Mother and my husbands doctor.  I also knew him when he was a resident at the hospital that I worked at when he came to my floor as a student
-1	I feel like doctors are just in and out of the room so fast and I don't feel like they actually care about your situation they just need to hurry and get to the next patient.
1	I have a long relationship with my family doctor.  He is an internist in family medicine.  He looks for possible problems developing down the road and speaks freely with me.  He orders routine bloodwork and always follows up on any irregularities.  He will call on a Sunday afternoon and say I was just reviewing your chart and I think we should do.....He is board certified and makes me feel confident in his decisions.  I always do whatever further testing he asks me to do whether it be additional bloodwork, mri's, cat scans. etc.
-1	It seems as if now the doctors are in it for the money and how many patients can be seen. The patent can't get straight answers.
-1	I can trust my primary for basic everyday issues like a sinus infection or acne. But she is not a specialist and doesn't habe experience in more unusual issues.
-1	I feel that doctors now a days are under so much pressure to see so many patients that things are rushed and missed.  
1	He has always took time to listen to my concerns or questions, makes sure he answers and acknowledges everything I say or ask. He always makes sure I know how to contact him via the offices site and e-mail if I have any further questions or concerns.
1	My doctor changes about every year or two, but my most recent doctor has been very honest with me from day 1.
-1	I think they lie and some of them tell the truth but i dont believe nobody because i have trust issues
-1	I think sometimes they see only what they want.  They ignore what I tell them in regards to symptoms.  If the symptoms do not match the tests or diagnosis they do not count.  So this is why I only trust doctors part way.
1	I have never had a problem with my doctor.  They explain my medications and recommend new ones if never.  To date they have been right on the button and I don't have mother negative about them.
1	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind at all times. I don't feel that I have ever experienced health care that had other intentions at heart. 
-1	I am neural. I neither trust nor distrust my doctor, however I put the most trust in myself and my family. They know me better.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she always cares about what I do and she is very through and I love her
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part and he does spend time with me when I have questions.  If he does not have answers to my questions about a specific problem, he would send me to a specialist.
1	I trust my doctor because I am able to discuss about my health and receive appropriate care.  My doctor appointments have been good and I am able to understand and learn about my health during my check-ups.  I am able to ask questions regarding my physical and mental health and receive a professional answer from my doctor.  I trust my doctor and the services being offered at clinics, health centers, and hospitals.  During my visits to clinics, health centers, and hospitals, I was cared for, treated, and given appropriate care from staff.  I love the work that nurses and doctors do and will continue to check-up on my health.  
-1	Overall I do trust most health care professionals. but my only contact with health care is going to the Dentist twice a year and seeing the Eye Doctor about once every 3 or 4 years
-1	My neurologist prescribed me an anti-seizure medication -- I had not had any seizures while I have been taking the medicine. I trust a doctor until I have reason not to.
1	I trust my primary care doctor mostly.  I say this because I have a hard time trusting any doctors all of the way.  I have seen many doctors and have had some pretty bad experiences (one telling me that it was all anxiety and then I filly found another doctor who believed me that something was wrong and found the right blood tests to run).  I think I trust them to some extent, but I also rely on what my gut is telling me.
-1	i trust my family doctor because no matter what a hurry he is in he will sit and explain everything to me 
-1	Doctors in general can be trusted, but it's best to learn about all the options that is available in terms of treatment.
1	I trust my doctor because I would think he knows what he is doing, at least I hope he knows what he is doing. I've only had one doctor in the past that I don't think he knew what he was doing and I found another doctor.
-1	I have not found a regular doctor that I feel comfortable with.
1	I have had many Drs over the years, I have 3 right now, and I trust them all very much. They talk to me about what is being done or what I should do to do better. 
-1	She doesn't act like she is too concerned about my problems. She speaks over top of me. She doesn't do proper testing or know about the specific diagnosis, so smuts hard for her to recommend me to the proper specialist.
-1	I trust my doctor and like her but I would not place complete trust in just one person.
1	"Although we don't know what is totally wrong with me, he hasn't given up looking for the answers and what might help me in the meantime. Never once did he think that it was ""all in my head"" as many would have. He always takes the time to listen to me even if it goes beyond the alloted time and never makes the appt feel rushed. He addresses all my concerns and conditions @ each visits. "
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for years. I have gone to him for my ongoing health issues. I trust his treatment options and decisions. If I don't agree with something or a medication prescribed, he is open to listening to what I have to say. He does not rush me through an appointment like some of my previous doctors. For this reason, I have complete trust in my primary care physician.
-1	I trust my doctor because she's always looking out for me and she now also is my child's doctor and I trust her completely with him as I do myself. 
-1	I trust my doctor because they explain any thing to me .if I need further info they will obtain it for me 
1	i just trust my doctor ho when to school and I know she care about her patients. She work for her patients and not just for the paid.
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for years now, and he is very familiar with me and my history. He has never steered me wrong, and he listens attentively to any questions I have. I have a great deal of trust in him.
-1	I trust her for the most part. Any distrust I have stems from the fact that shes human and can make mistakes just like the rest of us. 
-1	i don't trust anyone especality doctors i mean what is the worst that can happen if one of their patients dies i mean after all the have malpractice insurance and the law on their side.
1	I trust my primary care because I believe that he really cares for my well-being.
-1	Really they are just humans like everyone else. They chose a career path, went to university for many years and got a job in the industry. How much they actually consolidated from their education is questionable. Often times it seems they're doing a lot of common sense work or things that a layman could figure out himself if he had access to the equipment and the internet. You also have to question if they have ulterior motives or reason to push medication that may not be the most advantageous. Their education is very very narrow as well, they don't often know much about natural medicine or even things like paleo diets or aspects/principles of primal living. I have to question what kind of person these doctors are and whether they even value their lives themselves because stepping back it looks like they slaved away at school just to become a doctor and deal with sick people all the time. A life like that would be miserable to me, so I wonder if some doctors even care about anything they are doing or if they are following a path for money or to impress others. 
-1	There's just really no way to know how much one can trust one's doctor. Sometimes the doctor may make an honest mistake--how much do you trust the doctor then? Does it depend on the consequences of that mistake?
-1	In the past when I have had medical issues, my current primary care physician has brushed me off and not listened to my concerns. Through my own research and self advocacy, I was able to get the resources I needed, but definitely not with much assistance from my own physician. 
-1	I do not put complete trust in anyone but myself. I would like to believe them but odds are I will get a second opinion or verify what they told me myself.
1	My doctor always explains the results of my visits thoroughly. I never have additional questions that go unanswered. My doctor consistently looks out for my best interest.
-1	Feel doctors treat overweight patients a little differently.  Also led some by drug and insurance companies. Too many unnecessary tests.
-1	I have had bad experiences with doctors and have been misdiagnosed. I have unfortunately had doctors with God complexes who believed they were right and would not listen to me as their patient and it turned out I was right all along.
-1	He comes into the room, asks me a couple of generic questions, and tries to get out of there in a hurry because he has other patients to deal with. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a means to his golf course membership. 
-1	
-1	Icompletly trust my primary care physician because I have been a patents of his for years 
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for over 20years and find him to be very knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions. He is comfortable explaining why and how.
-1	I trust my doctors because they take the time to make sure I get a reminder call for appointments, they are friendly and don't mind taking a little extra time to explain something to me if needed, I even have a doctor who constantly tells me not to worry about his fee. 
1	My doctor makes sure to spend an adequate amount of time with me to ensure i can have all the questions i have answered. They don't rush me and even if they feel a test doesn't need to be done, they will do it anyways just to make sure.
1	I have been going to my PCP for over 20 years now exactly for the reasons above. He takes his time with me, asks questions, and is honest about how he feels. That's why I still go to him.
1	my doctor takes time to listen to me and forces me.to.provide more details than I've had to I. the.past. never in a rush which means my wait is usually longer than I'd like, but let's me know she's providing the same level of care to her other.patients.
1	My primary care physician has been very good for me and too me. I have been going to her since my last doctor retired. The doctors that she refer me to are the one's that she trust with the care of her family members and herself. She is also an affiliate in one of the best hospitals in my area.
1	I have been going to him for years. He listens to what I say and tries to help me. If I am having a problem he will send me for test to see if anything is wrong. he sent me to have an echo cardiogram when someone said I had a heart mur mur. 
1	I trust my primary care provider because they take the time to talk things over with me. They also listen to me and any problems that I bring up. I can also rely on them to treat me and talk about treatments with me whenever I have a problem that needs to be taken care of. 
-1	They know what's best for me. Even if they aren't totally honest about the best course of action, they still more about these things than I do.
-1	I have had good and bad doctors before. The good ones really seem to care and take the time to listen. They are able to help me thoroughly. Very few doctors have been bad. They seem to not listen and want to prescribe something that I don't agree with.
1	the last dr. i had was nice but she left but i'm supposed to have another woman dr. i think that is a plus for me.the former dr. listened and spent time with me and was on time.
-1	My doctor wants what is best for me and will prescribe the best course of action. He has a lot of experience doing what he does, so I trust his decision and authority over anything that I might think.
-1	I mostly trust my primary care physician. However, there have been a few times where I go to this person over something and the doctor gave me bad/unhelpful advice.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been her patient for  many years and she is always on the ball when it comes to my health. She does not overtest, but will prescribe tests when it is necessary to make sure I am in good health.
-1	Overall I do trust what the medical provider says is true and reflects the best course of treatment needed.  \Than on the other hand I do think that because of insurance cost that some treatment options are delayed or not mentioned at all to cut cost.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has be caring for our family for over 30 years. we have had numerous family members goto see him and they all have had great experiences with him.

1	My doctor always makes sure to involve me in the decisions of my care. He always makes sure to ask if I have any questions. He spends an appropriate amount of time discussing my health with me and the reasons he is making the decisions he is. He always provides information about medications possible side effects.

1	i trust my doctor he is insiteful and forthcoming, he brings up tips and information that is  having a healthy life
-1	My doctors constantly change so it isn't like I have the same doctor every visit. You never know who you may end up with and what kind of advice they may give.
-1	I have a primary care doctor.  Sometimes he does not seem as thorough as he could be in medical checkups.  Or he keeps wanting to send me to specialists for things he could do himself
-1	He works WITH me and asks me questions and gives me a voice in my care. He used to ask if I was ready to discontinue a certain medication, but when I finally explained why I wanted to continue it, he understood and stopped asking. 
1	I like my primary care physician, he treats me fairly and gives me good advice. He also lets me know when he feels I need to do something to improve my health.
1	I trust my doctor because I do believe he wants to do what's best for me and really help me. I think that they always wanna do the best thing they can for their patients. They are their to help, and that's what they really try to do, in my opinion. 
-1	I do not trust doctors in General from past experiences.  This is in regards to family members not getting the care they needed in order to prevent death
1	My doctor is very thorough, he always listens to everything that I have to say. He also makes sure that no stone is left unturned when it comes to my health.
1	I have known my doctor for a long time outside of the doctors office. She is a family friend and I have complete trust in her decisions and what she says.
1	She is very open to listening; easy to talk to; demonstrates genuine concern in my health & well-being
-1	I think they have a lot of experience. My primary care giver was in a management position at a hospital in the past so I have confidence that they will do their best to look out for me.
1	While I am intelligent and know what is best for me and my lifestyle,  I value her education and experience in the health care system. 
1	Firstly, I tends to trust people. For doctors who are well-educated and respected, I trust most of them. As I experienced, most doctors are very nice and professional.
1	Doctors are highly trained professionals. They know what the best course of action for your conditions are better than you do. I think you should just trust and be honest with them if they have not given you a reason to do otherwise.
1	Perhaps it's because I haven't had a severe condition that has caused me to question my doctor's judgment, but I have had only positive interactions with my PCP and have received appropriate treatments. I am always given the chance to talk about my problems and able to ask questions. I never feel as though I'm being rushed out the door on an assembly line to make room for another patient, but that I am being treated by someone who is interested in getting to the root of my health problem.
1	I triust my primary care physician because she notice my kissing knees when I came in for general checkup.  It is one thing to come in for a specific need ahe looked at everything and gave suggestions.  I appreiate the time and patience.
1	I have always trusted my primary care physician, since they have always given me the means to get better when I am ill. I believe my doctor has no ill intent regarding my health, but might be more skeptical of someone who is not a doctor.
-1	My doctor just seems to be in a rush to get from one patient to the next and doesn't spend much time with any one patient.
-1	"He is generally there to ""process"" people and get his numbers. If I ask for a prescription for a given issue, he is very willing to write it and move on. Has has some misdiagnoses."
1	My primary care physician is very open to my medical needs and let me talk about what and how i am feeling at that time, he is open to organic foods to reduce my high blood pressure to relieve me of some of my medications. 
-1	Overall I feel that doctors are honest and trustworthy. For the most part I believe that doctors want to help their patients and will do what is best.
1	I have been a patient with my doctor for a while.  I have a good rapport with him.  He is thorough and follows up well.  He explains things well and answers any questions.  I trust his judgement and opinion.
1	I have been seeing my primary physician for over 20 years. He takes care of my physical health as well as mental health. He is always honest about treatment options and I feel he cares deeply about being thorough and careful.
-1	I trust my doctor to the fullest and I think she has my best interest of all I don't think see would lie to me at no point at all and she never lie to me so far don't think so would now
-1	Doctors have the training and knowledge to make good decisions about my health.  If I feel that a doctor is not thorough or knowledgeable, I'll find another doctor.
1	I trusy my doctor because i agree most of his therory. Doctor learn more extensively then we do about all on sickness if we helpwith case.
-1	I've been going to her for many years.  She is as good of a doctor as anyone.  However, sometimes I feel my opinion and desires are ignored.
1	he-she has my general helth and well benning in mind so I have to trust that what do for me will be the right thing for me 
1	I trust my doctor because he cares about what's good for me. He would not knowingly do something that would violate my trust in him.
-1	My doctor seems rushed just to get me out the door so they can move on to the next person. When I need things explained to me they bring in a nurse or someone else to speak with me. When I call with questions it sometimes takes days to get back to me.
-1	I trust my physician because they usually knows what is best for me. Unfortunately, I don't have a primary care doctor at the moment.  It I do conduct my own research and get a second opinion if I'm. It confident in my doctor. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been doing this a long time. Also, he went to medical school, not me!
-1	It's always best to get a second opinion about whatever care is needed unless the illness is minor and only needs over the counter medication.
1	Been my doctor for a long time. Family and friends have gone to him for 15+ years. He is very smart and knowledgeable. He has never told me anything that was wrong or iccurate. He is also the head doctor for the hospital next to his practice. 
-1	Sometimes I can't trust them because I'm thinking they are not being honest what's going on and then sometimes u can believe them it just depends on what doctor you go to
1	The current experiences that I have had with my current doctor has influenced me to trust him with the handling of my case.
-1	I trust my Doctor because they've had many years of experience. I trust them because I know nothing in comparison to them. They took an oath to be a Doctor and I have to rely on that for their honesty.
-1	I feel like my doctor does what is easiest when it comes to my medical condition. I don't think my doctor cares much about my wellbeing. He is just doing a job that he may or may not even care about.
-1	I do not trust all doctor's . My perception is based on a negative response I had with a doctor some years ago. . I did not like her results and when I went with another opinion with another doctor it turned out that  I did the right thing by doing so, Because my primary doctor was way off on her prognosis.
1	I trust my doctor because who else can I trust.  It leaves me no choice but to trust my doctor.  I can always decide later whether I believe it's a good advice or not.  
-1	I trust them because they have taken some health issues (depression, anxiety) more seriously than other doctors I have seen. I sometimes feel rushed though, so I am unsure if I always receive the complete truth or all my options. Overall I feel I have a good relationship with them and accept their opinions. 
-1	I trust him because he is just doing his job. He has no reason to hide treatment options unless he honestly doesn't think they are worth mentioning.
1	I feel like my doctor provides me with all the options available for me and helps me decide on the best course of action for myself. she takes the time to explain all options I may have access to
-1	In general, I will trust what my doctor has to say 90% of the time, and may do more research on my own about their suggested treatments. They have the experience to know the different treatments, surely more than I know doing research. If I ever feel like my doctor doesn't really have my best interest in heart, I will get a second opinion.  The more I've seen one doctor in particular, the more likely I am in trusting what they have to say to me. 
1	My doctor is thorough and caring. I know he keeps up with the latest research, because he mentions that. I am sure that he is doing the best he can.
-1	I don't feel like my doctor understands what I'm trying to communicate sometimes. He wants to do some test instead of actually listening to me, or he ships me off to another doctor who only knows part of the story. I would trust my doctor more if I thought he was actually hearing what I'm saying and if he would not be so dismissive of my insights into my own health.
1	"I trust my primary physician because to say the least he is a realist. He keeps things honest and it's not just about saying what he feel's is required to be said, he gives me relatable examples and tells me personally things about his life and hose around him as well and it gives me a much more relaxing feeling and the ability to trust his word. He doesn't always come with the ""Dr. Talk"" that people whom are not in that field doesn't understand. he gives me advice medically and personally."
-1	It's not that I trust or distrust my primary care physician I'm just a very anxious and nervous type of person.
1	she is very professional and understands my needs, especially when it comes to both my physical and mental health issues
1	My doctor has yet to give me a reason to distrust him and until he does I will not discredit him. My doctor, I believe, cares about me and me helath
-1	I think she is very intelligent and is definitely capable of taking care of my needs. She also makes a point to pay attention to my input about things. 
-1	i trust them, the reasons why are because of there positions 
-1	i have been with my family doctor  for years he knows our family history and has been in practice for twenty years  
-1	My physician takes time to talk, answer questions and make suggestions. He makes sure that I understand what is best for me and does not make me feel rushed and that he does not have time to discuss or hear my concerns.
1	I've seen him several times and he is always candid and straightforward with his opinion, reasons and concerns. I've never had a reason to second guess anything he has told me.
1	Complete trust in my doctors because they are truthful they explain how my medicines work and if I have any kind of questions regarding my medicine treatments I always give them a call and they always tell me how the medicine work what are the effects of the medicine
-1	I have collaborated professionally with doctors and know that they often do not know how to interpret the results of a drug or the results of a scientific paper. So I am a little hesitant to trust their knowledge as the perfect gospel. I trust doctors that are upfront, direct, and friendly.
1	Have been a patient for 18 years, he has never steered me wrong yet. He is very dedicated and thorough with me, taking his time with me at my scheduled appointments. I even have his cell phone number in case of an emergency.
-1	The physician I see has years of experience along with a degree in subjects I have never even thought about taking. They are more knowledgable in what they are doing then i would never be, in return i would believe what they say. 
-1	she's good at most stuff but doesn't believe that certain conditions exist or that treatment not conventional would be helpful.  but she does listen pretty well and has quickly diagnosed some critical problems so she's a keeper.
1	I think he's looking out for my best interest. Checks thourough an yet d doesn't do excess. Just the right amount
-1	I generally trust my doctor. He, unlike many doctors, is actually interested in what he does. He is still human, and I challenge him when I feel the need. He doesn't mind, it makes him think.
1	I have been going to him for many years and he has always been right about his diagnosis. If he does not know the answer to something then he will recommend I go to a specialist.
-1	I dont trust anyone to  be honest but i would hope doctors can be trusted to do what is in the best interest for my health 
-1	I trust my doctor because he's very professional, seems to be passionate & caring about his job.  The few times I went to him with different illments.  He seemed to be generally concerned. 
-1	You choose to trust them based on if they deserve it.
-1	I do not currently have a primary care physician, and although I am confident in the abilities and knowledge of doctors in general, I am hesitant to put my complete trust into anyone.  I like to explore various options and opportunities, and I know that doctors do not always have the answer.
-1	I trust my primary care physician in general because I am intelligent enough to be able to tell if what they are saying makes sense. I always choose doctors carefully after much research and review and persol recommendations.
-1	I have concerns about certain issues my doctor seems to just not care about or tell me its normal when i know its not normal for me, i dont like the word normal when it comes to health care because nobody is the same.
1	In my lifetime of 79 years I have had no reason to distrust my doctors. I have done research into my choice of physicians and am therefore confident that they are trustworthy.
-1	My relationship with my doctor has really changed over the 15 years I have been going to him.  When I started seeing him he was a family practitioner and I trusted him a lot more.  Now he wants to specialize in geriatric medicine and he doesn't really seem interested in my primary care needs.  I am in the process of finding a new doctor but I haven't found one yet.
1	She understands me and is a nice caring doctor And we can relate well my old doctor couldn't help me really and didn't understand me
-1	I trust my primary care doctor.  I know enough to keep myself and others safe.  He is somewhat lackluster in touching and doing needed tests.
-1	I give them the benefit of doubt.  They are schooled doctors and took this profession to help people. Why would I not trust?
-1	She  has always been  great .. answers any question I may have and askes question s I have never thought of.
-1	I know that my primary care physician is qualified to do his job, as he has gone through the necessary schooling and training to gain the expertise for his position. However, I also realize that medicinal knowledge is vast, and that doctors only see me for a few minutes and therefore do not have the deep analytical insight that would make me fully trust them.
1	My doctor has my best interests at heart and u believe this to be true because he shows genuine interest in my well being and my day to day life decisions that may affect my health and self worth
-1	I like his speech with me . It is full of love and cer toward me . He is very special in his way of speaking and learning
-1	easy to talk to have no medical problems that require anything extra than the usual  upkeep of yearly physical and any pre screenings that are for my age
-1	I've been with my doctor for 10 years and I trust her and I'm very healthy person so I tend to only see her once a year 
1	My doctor has been with me throughout three pregnancies. I was sooo sick that I was hospitalized each time.  She was always upfront with me. She and all the doctors in the practice had excellent bedside manners.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is the  one with the knowledge and experience when it comes to medical issues.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for a long time and have had the opportunity to observe what he says about different aspects of my health compared to my own observations, both of which are quite close.
-1	I have no insurance,so dr visits aren't often,some drs are great,others seemed rushed to get to next patient
-1	they always wanting to try new medicines and treat you like a guinea pig, I am not willing to be one
-1	My doctor has sent me home with prescriptions for a cold when I was bent over in stomach pain. I went to the ER and the prescriptions she sent me could have made my stomach (gastritis) even worse. She even referred me to a surgeon who has been responsible for the death of a patient, so no I don't trust her one bit and I will never go back to her
-1	I generally distrust doctors because they seem prone to prescribing drugs to put a Band-Aid on a problem rather than fix the problem itself.  I would be far more trusting if I found a doctor that was willing to help me fix the issue.
-1	I have had experiences with my primary care physician in which they have not disclosed an issue with me and the issue became worse before I was finally able to get treatment because of this.
-1	I trust my physician. He knows me well enough and has always acted in my best interest. He is always willing to listen to my concerns.
-1	I actually recently switched physicians to a PA. The town doctor the PA works for I do not trust at all because he is an jerk but on my form I have the PA as my primary and I trust him completely. He is a friend of the family and has been working in my town for decades. He is dedicated to what he does and very kind. Prior to my recent switch I had a pediatrician who was wonderful growing up and always steered me and my parents in the right direction. I wish I could have stayed with him but unfortunately pediatricians obviously only work with kids.  
-1	The doctors I have visited seem like they judge me and I feel as they know something is wrong with me but won't tell me and they always have the same pity look they give me. I don't trust any doctors because I know they just want to get rid of me and they think of me as another patient (another number) in the system.
-1	My doctor has only ever been helpful and kind when I've visited her. So far, her recommendations have been positive and yielded good results.
-1	I don't have a regular primary doctor due to not having health insurance so I see a general based on income doctor when I'm sick.   
-1	I don't trust my primary care physician very much. She is nice but doesn't know what to do with me at times when I get sick. There are very few times that she will call my specialists to ask for help or advice on how to treat me in the most effective way.
1	I trust my physician to do what he and I both think are correct in keeping me healthy and protecting my medical records
-1	I feel like I have to really work hard to convince my doctor of what I'm telling him. I never feel like he fully believes me. 
1	I have seen my primary care physician for over 15 years and he always treats me with kindness and respect.  He will take the time to explain things to me in detail and help me decide the best route to take in my care.  He never rushes the visit and this makes me feel I can trust that he has my best interest at heart.
-1	I believe that being sick is what keeps the doctors in business and the more side effects to the medicine the more sick you'll be and the more prescription will have to be prescribed. That isn't all doctors but I do believe it is the majority. 
1	Well, These doctors have been to school for this. I like to walk into a clinic thinking that I will be in good hands and that the doctors know what they are doing.
1	I trust that my doctor gives me the best options for my care, and that he considers what I might need or already be taking before prescribing anything.  I do realize that sometimes mistakes can be made, but I feel that he will try and minimize these mistakes.
-1	She takes the time to listen to my concerns. She fully explains all test results to me and answers all my questions without hesitation.
-1	Overall I think my primary care doctor is thoughtful and knowledgeable and wants what's best for me. I do think it could be possible that she might miss something that could be wrong and I also don't know that she has the time to stay up on all of the latest treatment options. 
1	My primary care person is an advanced practice nurse practitioner. She has demonstrated a high level of active care for me, and is extremely thorough in her work when examining me. She is an exceptional listener, and has even detected health issues of which I was not aware. She communicates very well, and takes all the time I need to address my health concerns.
1	been seeing my dr since 2015 after my own regular dr of 10 yrs messed up my ekg and heart condition.. my new dr found out i had high cholesterol and my old dr prescribed me pills for high blood presssure when i didnt have high bp . now i trust my new dr she never steered me wrong 
1	MY PULMONARY DOCTOR IS THE ONE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF MY LUNG FIBROSIS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER TO KEEP MY GOING SINCE 2008. I HAVE GONE TO MAYO CLINIC WITH HIS SUGGESTION TO GET SECOND OPINIONS TWICE AND MAYO AND MY PULMONARY DOCTOR COME TOGETHER WITH A PLAN TO EFFECTIVELY KEEP ME GOING.
-1	He knows my condition and what is the best form of treatment for me, always answers my questions and addresses my concerns
-1	I have not been to a doctor or care physician in many many years because I am way to anxious to do so 
-1	I have been with my doctor for over 13 years.  He has been with me from the worst (near death) to my health as of today.  I do have a complex medical history and he will check on the computer just to see if I was in the ER or Urgent Care and will follow up with me if needed.  I feel that my doctor is going far above his help for me.  And I really agree with that.  It is not always a happy road.  We may argue about some of the treatments, but we always come to an answer to the problem.  To me, that is a very big trust in my doctor.
-1	I trust doctors because I know that they care for me. I know that they only want the best for me.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is honest with me even If I don't like what he is saying. He is a gentle speaker. He thinks about what he is going to say before he just says them. He also gives me options.
-1	I don't trust doctors because they are only doctors so they can make big bucks, not because they care about helping people. They do not listen to what you tell them, they are in a hurry to get you in and out so they can charge you the money and get on to the next person.
1	me and my doctor have a great bond, because he tell the truth even if it not good times. we have this bond because he has been my doctor for 12 years
-1	I trust my doctor knows what she's doing and that we can have an open discussion.  But I usually go to my appointments armed with my latest research so I'm prepared for the visit 
-1	I trust them because they went through years of intense schooling to get where they are. That means they know more than me seeing as they are the expert. However I will still do my own research
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I know they put in the time to learn the skill. I also trust them because they keep up on everything.
-1	I trust my doctor in regards to being thorough with my medical needs but he has hundreds of patients so sometimes it feels like I'm not getting his total attention.
1	My doctor has been very dedicated to providing me with good advice and explaining situations so they make sense and in my best interest.
-1	Because they are professionals at what they do. And they know that there main concern is to help their client out in the best way possible without doing anything negative to them.
-1	I trust my PCP because she is fairly thorough.  When I explain to her that I have a specific medical concern, she does what she can to address it.  If I ask for a test or procedure, she does whatever she can to make it happen, which helps to allay my fears.  She makes appointments for me in a timely fashion, and she seems to actually care about my issues.  That's not to say she isn't usually in a hurry, but I think most doctors are because of a large patient load.
-1	I think my doctor schedules more patients than she should which causes appointment times with the doctor to be rushed and short and not enough information is given to me or options discussed
-1	I feel that doctors in general do what is best for their bottom line rather than what's best for their patients.
1	I trust my particular primary care physician because she is a friend of mine.  Most importantly, I trust her character.  I know that she cares deeply for people and takes her job very seriously.  I know that she has done a great deal of personal research on many health topics, especially those pertaining to women and children.  She also takes a holistic approach to medicine which I appreciate.  
-1	My doctors had me on to many medications plus I don't see 1 doctor it's whatever doctor is there.So no I really don't trust my doctors.
-1	My Doctor is first off human and fallible. Second, he has repeatedly failed to listen to me and my symptoms when I have described conditions, only to discover that I indeed had the condition which I claimed. He also has a tendency to talk over me and has no real regard for my health, only placating my symptoms and referring me to specialists.
1	When I was recently seriously ill, he figured out what was wrong and gave me several solutions and suggestions. When I follow his orders, I feel great.
1	They have always seemed to care about my needs and seem to be very knowledgeable. They spend as much time with me as needed. They have also never guided me wrong yet.
1	i talk to him ask questions have specific discussions about my concerns i trust him based on researched information and talking with him
-1	I trust my doctor but they are human and can sometimes get things wrong. I know they are well educated and are looking out for my best interest. 
-1	I trust doctos sometimes . sometimes I feel like they don't know what they're doing and prescribes just anything
-1	I don't trust primary care physicians because I don't know if they know what they prescribing to me 
-1	I don't trust my doctor because she just looks at her computer all the time and sends me to get test done. I need to be on disability,but she thinks I don't.
1	I've been with my doctor for almost a decade and she know my body inside and out! I trust her judgment because, so far, she's been correct about any issues I've had regarding my care. She is well educated and stays abreast of the latest advances in medicine, which she shares with her patients. 
1	My doctor spends 45 minutes every time I go see him. It is much needed. We talk about my medications and if I am on track 
-1	you can trust sometimes sometimes it just seems they just want to give u maedication for anytng when not really needed 
-1	I don't have any reason not to trust my doctor. I will continue to trust her until she does something to earn my distrust. I would apply the same standard to any doctor.
-1	My physicans has always been very open and up front with me. I have always trusted my physician. He makes me feel confident with his diagnosis. 
1	Because he is a good guy and I have known him a while now.  He often tells it like it is and doesnt sugarcoat things, but he is always honest.  He has often told me things that other doctors would tell me one way and he would say that was just a waste of money and it was.
1	In my experience, with all the conditions I have gone through in my life and went to the doctor, all the information they have given me had proof that I had found out prior to visiting.
-1	Why I trust my my primary care physician is because they are trained to help me feel better from the illnesses that I have. Also the physician would not be in this field if they did not want to help those around them. 
-1	My doctor is a good doctor but rather conventional and not always open to some of my suggestions.  I am very chronically ill and in constant pain but he refuses to allow me to use medicinal cannabis although it is legal in my state.
-1	I don't completely trust any doctor. I feel like sometimes they are just guessing what a problem or solution is. I take the information the doctor gives and make my own choices on what I believe and what my next steps will be. 
-1	I think most doctors these days are just looking to make cash from prescriptions more than really caring and treating their patients. It seems all they can offer are pills or nothing. What seem like common sense solutions are ignored in favor of drugs an constant treatment. Several lifestyle diseases, like most cases of diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol can be treated with lifestyle changes. Dangerous drugs with tons of side effects is not the best way. But how often do you hear a doctor just suggest diet changes and more exercise? Rarely, since those solutions don't make money.   
1	I trust my primary care physician as well as my specialists (rheumatologists, pain specialists, obgyn, dentist, opthamologists, podiatrist, etc.) because I have a wonderful doctor/patient relationship that I have the utmost trust in them all.
1	He is super good the best  I had he give all kind of tests  ask a million questions  my other Drs.  just gave gave out prescriptions.
-1	For the most part, I trust in doctors, but I've run into situations where they are giving the minimal amount of treatment so they can be done with me and move on to the next patient.
1	I don't have a PCP but I consider my OBGyn my most regular doctor. She is very smart, compassiote, and takes time to explain things to me clearly and give me advice and recommendations. I like her and trust her a lot. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician due to his professional background and the number of testimonies I've heard from others regarding his experience and their visits with him. He made it a point to build up such a reputation, and one should admire that.
-1	My doctor at times will rush me out the office instead of listening to my questions.  Therefore making me not trust in her as much ah I would like
1	I trust what my doctor tell me to do because he know my contional better than me he is the one that got the doctor degree so he know what is going on with my health.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very knowledgeable and able to explain to me what exactly is going on and I like her as a person.
-1	I have seen my primary care doctor for almost thirty years and have complete faith in him for my medical health. He know me extremely well and is well regarded in the community for his thorough manner.
-1	I trust her, I suppose. I was afraid that I had cancer but I really just had canker sores and she gave me a prescription to get rid of them. But she is way too expensive to see!
1	I really like my doctor. She is very thorough and friendly. Always has done the right thing. Very patient and listens to me. Never have doubted her.
-1	I trust him because he takes time to explain things and doesn't rush me out of his office and comes across as sincere and even ends visit with a prayer for you
-1	My doctor has never been judgemental with me when I'm in her office. She encourages frank and open conversations and she's been able to clarify several situations for me and always seems to be able to answer my questions or check on it if she doesn't know the answer. I really value that transparency. 
-1	Too many doctors who practice western style medicine are not willing to accept the benefits traditional Chinese medicine, like acupuncture and herbs. 
1	My PCP was researched well enough and my persol interactions have been very professiol. I can find no reasons so far o distrust my PCP, and if I did I would not see this person for anything.
-1	I have a longtime relationship with my physician, she is caring, answers all my questions, spend a good amount of time addressing my concerns, although very busy she is thorough.
-1	I really think that this person may have an asian fetish and think of me as a geisha.  It really makes me feel uncomfortable.
-1	I do trust my physician, but only when we engage in a discussion and come up with a mutual plan for my treatment. If I do not advocate for myself, I feel like he may not put forth as much effort in my treatment
1	I trust my physician or doctor because I feel safe with them. 
-1	I trust physicians, however sometimes I believe they are too busy to fully disclose all options for medial treatments and typically provide the fastest answers as possible. Sometimes I feel like physicians could be a little more thourough, but there's only so much they can do with the time they're allotted, especially with large work loads/multiple patients.
-1	"i haven't been to my primary in years because when i had a medical problem and i came to them they said they wouldn't do test because it wasn't their ""area"". they are general practitioners. everything is their area they could have taken blood and run labs and then refereed me but they didn't do anything  "
-1	I trust my physician because I did a lot of research and got some recommendations from people I trust. I made the best choice for my needs and situation. My physicians has my best interest at heart. 
-1	He seems to be open, honest and checks everything out!!  Takes the time to explain everything and gives me more than one option
1	My primary care physician has always helped me with my problems or illnesses.  She is conservative and will start with the easiest remedy to see if that works first but is always open to taking the next step.  She listens to and answers my questions and seems to care about me.
-1	I place trust in my doctor, but have not done so blindly. I take everything with a grain of salt, at least initially. I have been with my PCP for a significant amount of time now, an dI understand and trust their judgement when it comes to matters of my health, though I could not say the same for other doctors with whom I am not a patient. I mainly base my trust on my experience with my PCP, which has been by far one of the best 'professional' relationships I have had in my life.
1	I have been seeing my Pcp for about 15 years. I have never had to second guess her.Anytime I calm she is right on top of anything I ask her. She takes her time during visits to make sure you completely understand the information she is giving you. 
1	I have a really good relationship with my primary care physician.  I've been seeing the same primary care physician for over 7 years now.  He's helped me through issues that I knew I had (anxiety/depression) and also issues I didn't know I had (possible melanoma).  I have gotten to know some about his background as well, and given what I know, I trust him implicitly. 
-1	My doctor is open minded and respects my beliefs and needs and so I trust that he will respect and adhere to my needs.
1	MY PHYISICIAN IS GOD FEARING
-1	 i trust my primary care physician because she takes my concerns seriously and runs through tests and exhaust all possibilities
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has helped me whenever I went there with a problem. He has always figured out what the issue was and alleviated the symptom. He is also good at making things easy to understand so I would not be confused.
1	My PCP seems to be a thoughtful woman and is very good at listening to me and my concerns.  She is not assertive so might seem hesitant but I feel that is just her way.
-1	I trust him as he studied medicine and knows better in that aspect but on the other hand when it comes to prescribing medicine I feel like doctors have the pressure to use certain medicine
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has good advice and he follows up with me when I take my prescriptions.
-1	She's always been helpful and willing to explain things to me. I haven't run into any issues as of yet
1	If I have an issue my physician doesn't perform one test and then stop, like other physicians have. She's also very friendly and makes sure I understand everything she says. 
1	I trust my doctor because he has been a trusted part of my personal care plan for overall twenty years. 
-1	I haven't been seeing them long and when I do it's short. I get basic stuff answered. It still feels like business. Generally I trust them, because when I do ask questions about risks and side effects, it sounds like they're being honest.
-1	Doctors usually just want to peddle bullcrap expensive medicines that are just overhyped painkillers most of the time. $200 for painkillers is not justified, obviously there's some third party putting pressure on doctors to peddle this crap.
-1	I have a new doctor and she has too many patients. She hasn't returned my call. She doesn't take time needed to get all the facts and needs to cut the amount of patients she has to be able to practice medicine effectively.
-1	I think a lot of doctors these days, especially young ones, are not that concerned with taking the time need to solve a medical problem. They want to take the easy course, get paid and move on to the next patient.
1	I believe in my doctor because when I need a doctor I go to them for help and I talk and explain everything and I listen to them  than I notice when they are listening to me.
-1	I canât get a straight answer from my doctor.  I feel that he is vague and afraid to commit to an answer. It makes it hard to trust doctors in general.
-1	Do not go to doctor. If I feel good, there is no reason to waste mine or the doctor's time and money.
-1	I distrust my doctor because he may only be doing it for money or trying to finish up his work so he can move on to the next patient.
1	My PCP is very thorough in every appointment and takes the time to not only discuss options, but also make sure that there is no pressure to pick a particular option since it is my treatment. 
-1	I think for the most part my doctors are honest. However, I still factor in my own opinions. 
1	I started going to a new doctor since we moved. He is very gentle & kind. I had to have tests done, it didn't take long for him to call me with the results. 
1	I trust him because over the years we have built a relationship the is both honest and respectful.  At no time have I had reason to doubt his expertise
1	I trust my doctor to the full extent because I have been going to this doctor for more than 16 years. He speaks up to other physicians to help with anything that gives me issues.
1	Doctors are great people who you can trust. I know I trust my physician with my life. Never let me down. 
1	They listen well; will try various treatments starting with least to most intense. They make note of what I tell them and make adjustments accordingly.
1	I have now been with my particular Doctor for over 10 years.  He is the best and most concerned Doctor that I have ever had in my life time.  He watched over my health and concerns with loving kindness.  I trust his decisions for my  health Concerns completely.  
-1	Well I do not have a specific primary care physician, so as far as having a level of trust or distrust for one, it is not possible.
1	My doctor and I love each other and we have a blast every time I see him and he is very thorough with me about everything.
-1	I greatly trust my primary care physician. He is a great doctor who helps all of his patients. He's very kind, patient and understanding.
-1	In general all human beings (including physicians) share a margin of error potential.  Therefore, I do not blindly place explicit trust in any person.  It is important for all consumers who are able to act as their own advocate to assume this responsibility. Second opinions and thorough research should be considerations used to influence these personal decisions.
1	My physician is caring and empathetic. She doesn't talk down to me when she is explainging or answering a question. She is thorough and takes her time. 
-1	I think doctors are overworked and even though they might know the best thing to do, they might not have time to really consider what is best for you. They also cannot possibly keep up with all of the things they need to when it comes to research or making sure the best things for the patients arent changing.
1	My primary care physician takes the time not only to examine me for whatever I am there for, but also spends time asking questions of how things are going for me in general.  If she cannot answer a question I have she will refer me to the appropriate person.
-1	I have never been in one place long enough to establish a primary care physician. I think it depends on how connected I feel to them, if I feel rushed and that they don't care then I am less willing to talk to them honestly or feel confidence in their opinion.
-1	I trust her because I know that she listens to me and what I have to say. However I don't think that she agrees with my diagnosis of Fibromyalgia, which was diagnosed long before she became my doctor, and so I feel she does not really believe the pain that I am in. She also seems to be always looking for another reason for my pains. Which I have been through numerous times with other doctors. So I don't always trust her to believe me. 
-1	Most doctors enter into their profession to help people.  Extensive training is required to become a doctor, so they should know what they are doing.
1	I trust my doctor because she takes the time to explain things to me, answer my questions and have a discussion with me regarding my health.
-1	He seems to know what it right for me. I do not have any trouble understanding what advice he gives me.
-1	I don't know my primary care physician very well, so have developed complete trust in her. She's new to me, as my previous physician left for a job in another community and no longer is in my insurance network. Therefore, I am back to rebuilding trust in a physician.
-1	I trust them, but I also like to form my own opinion based on my knowledge and experience. Sometimes doctors are not familiar with your entire history so I think it is up to patients to advocate for their own best interests as much as they can. 
-1	Doctors can be trusted but sometimes I feel they prescribe medications because they get a kickback whenever a patient buys a prescription for a medication they have written a prescription for. I feel that there are alternative solutions for some medical problems that will work just as well.
-1	He has been my physician for several years.  I have never had a problem with his treatment plans.  He is willing to bring in a specialist when it is warranted.  I am confident in his care.
1	I have known my Doctor for many years and I trust him.
-1	I guess I trust him because of familiarity. At first I didn't trust him 100% but after 15 visits or so I've come to rely on his advice since I've seen my health (asthma specifically) has gotten better. Although he's as stoic now as he was on my first visit. Hard man to read. 
-1	this is part of a doctor's education and the Hippocratic oath, the only problem I have in trust is when insurance circumstances limit what's open or if the doctor doesn't seem to be aware of costs (this has not happened for some time)
-1	There have been mistakes made with my care that have resulted in a need for more medical services.  I am somewhat jaded with respect to receiving medical care.  
1	My doctor listens to my concerns and explains things thoroughly. If I have a concern, my doctor makes other options available and reassures me.
1	I have seen the same physician for 25 years and he has a limited number of patients as he is in semi-retirement. He takes his time and asks questions and explains things in terms the average person can understand.
1	I trust my doctor he's knowledgeable he knows my kids the next best to myself. They seriously help me 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is very polite, respectful, and reputable. He is more than willing to assist me in my health needs as well as my decisions regarding choices that are more optional than necessary such as vitamin capsule intake. Overall, he's very helpful and a great source of health knowledge. 
1	I have had the same physician since I was very young and he has always taken my concerns seriously. I have never had any issues with him. He always addresses my concerns and has been proactive about addressing any health problems I may have. He is always patient in answering questions or concerns.
-1	I feel that a physician should have the patient best interest.  I would like to know that the doctor has my vested interest.  I want a doctor who is sincere, honest and caring.  I want one who is able to be honest and willing to listen and get to the root of the issues.
-1	I don't trust my doctor, or any doctor wholly because I do feel as though they are all about the money in most cases. 
-1	I trust my doctor because that is their job to know what is going on. I have not had an interaction yet with a doctor where I feel they were not doing their part to help me understand something. I sometimes think some doctors care more about things they need to be doing than the patient themselves but maybe these particular doctors are more on the research side of things as opposed to patient facing.
-1	The doctors office i go to is always so busy. I normally have to wait a very long time for appointment. Then when the doctor sees me now it does not last for more than 20 minutes. They are always telling me to leave and that there is nothing I can do.
-1	I mostly trust my PCP. Of all the doctors I've seen in my life, he's better than most when it comes to listening to my problems and trusting that medical issues I bring up need to be addressed; a lot of doctors I've seen will try to explain away symptoms or avoid doing more tests. But even he's not perfect, although maybe his medical judgment and my instincts may sometimes be in conflict.
1	I have been with my current primary care physician for over a decade now. We have developed an excellent rapport. I have no doubt that when I come to him with an issue, that he will be thorough and thoughtful.
-1	Some doctors tend to be lazy. Not all doctors can be trusted just because they are doctors. You have to trust them obviously because who else can you trust.
1	I trust their knowledge and that they will tell me what is good for me. I do not think they would lie.
-1	i have been with him for the longest time and i have never have any issues that i might have to second gues. if i did i usually ask him right then and there 
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, but overall I think doctors will do what they can to help you. Unfortunately I think sometimes circumstances force them to treat patients in more of a hurry which may make them seem like they don't care. But overall I think most doctors genuinely want to help people and have no interest other than to help you get well.
-1	My new doctors seem to be very knowledgeable and intent upon learning all about me. I am not too sure if I agree with the judgement that I should stop taking metformin (which I have been taking for over 12 years) because I am over medicating because my A1C is below 7 (6.2) and they seem more worried about my blood pressure than anything else.
-1	On more than one occasion, just to be sure, I have sought second options and been told different than the what my doctor has said. Sometimes something as simple as a google search and bringing new questions to the doctor based on said google search has changed my doctors opinion or suggestions for treatment. 
-1	i currently have a great pa but often see neurologists and i know i need aggressive doctors and for the most part have been satisfied. i am an odd example of ms and have needed unusual treatment. 
1	okay the reason i kind of distrust and trust my primary care i start to say that my primary care has been with me all 19yrs so i have no real reason to not trust them they keeped me health ect and i havent had any major heart issues of any sort with that. That means that they must be doing something right cause i'm not dead right.. BUT the reason i don't trust them cause im not there physically seeing what they put in my meds you know what im saying like if i was there every step of the way that would make me feel more secure about what i am putting in my body just like eating food i want to know what i am consuming
1	I have used the same clinic for 20 years and even though there have been times when they have had to try different treatments to figure out what works I have always felt that they have had my best interest in mind. Sometimes they will start with a treatment that cost the least in order to help me out fincially so that I do not have to spend excess money on test and prescriptions. They have always seemed to be upfront and honest with me and other members of my family.
1	They have given me the proper care I have needed up until this point.
-1	I feel like my doctor listens to me and will do everything they can to find out what is going on with my health when I need them to. They have always listened to me. 
-1	I live in a unsafe environment very sure that with the president. We can't trust anybody because it has come to that decision when it's one for all and all for ine
1	I had a stroke last year and the care my Doctor has provided has improved my health greatly.
-1	He has made mistakes and has misdiagnosed both my wife and I. He can be very arrogant and moody too. At times, he can be downright dismissive. He got fired from MedExpress. At other times he is helpful and more thorough thinking outside of the box to find the source of an ailment.
-1	I trust them because I have to and I can read and do my own research when it's necessary to question them. But they work for large companies and i'm not always convinced they have MY best interest rather than the company or even their own intentions for a specific outcome.
-1	my primary physician always gives me advise on better health care for myself and options for treatment
1	I trust my doctor because they went to school for years to study medicine. They have a wealth of knowledge behind them I could never grasp
-1	I beelive that he knows what is best for me. He has taken care of his education, and has been training in his life in order to make sure he knows what he's doing. That is something that lets me think he is a professional,
-1	The doctors these days seem not to care about the patient. They are only interested in how many patients they can see per day and how much money they can make. They don't seem to care about the patient and how they feel.
1	My doctor always does every test to make sure I am doing the things I need to do to keep myself in good health and if I am not doing them she makes sure she explains to me all the consequences I will face. She always tells me she wants the best for me 
-1	For the most part, I have never had a doctor fail to explain my options or refuse to listen to my problems. Any issues have been because I didn't want to talk about an issue.
-1	 they see a lot more people today and do not develop the rapport they once had
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is always willing to take the time to answer questions I have about medications and treatment plans and he works with me to make sure I get the medications that my insurance will cover and he checks to see if there is one that they cover more of the cost. He also explains why he makes medical decisions, like prescribing medications or doing certain tests for me before he does it to make sure I understand completely what the reasons for doing it are and the benefits and risks of it.
1	My primary care physician listens to my questions and concerns, explains her thought process about diagnosis, and works with me to resolve any lingering health issues (fortunately, I'm relatively healthy). She also has evening and weekend hours, so I appreciate her willingness to work around patients' schedules.
1	I generally trust my doctor since he doesn't speak condescendingly or brush aside questions/concerns. He answers them patiently and thoroughly. I've been researching and trying different medications and each time I suggest one, he makes sure I know the side effects, the neurotransmitters involved, and its off-label uses before filling the prescription.
1	Typically doctors are there for your well-being and they have no interest in being dishonest or holding out on you usually they want what's best for you and will give you the best informed information about what is best for your condition and how to diagnose it and take care of it properly
-1	My doctor is a great doctor and she truly cares about her patients.  I have developed a good relationship with her and she lets me know that she is always there for her patients
1	I have researched my physician thoroughly and I have known her for a very long time.  She always has my best interests in mind and has proven herself trustworthy.
-1	I don't always feel they are devoting enough time and attention to my problems. Initial courses of treatment don't always work, then they ask more questions. They jump to easy conclusions.
-1	My past experience has demonstrated my confidence in my Doctor and his recommendations. His history of tests, advice and goals have proven correct.
1	I trust my physician because I have been working with him for a long time now. I almost see him as a friend. I can get persol with him and not have to worry because I trust him. In addition, he is very soft spoken and experienced. Overall, I would rate my doctor a 4/5.
1	I have to trust the person I am trusting my life and future with. I cannot doubt their abilities. If for some reason I find I don't trust my doctor I find a new doctor. I have done it. I don't want to have to be concerned that my doctor does not have my best interest in mind.
1	I trust my primary doctor because he is very thorough with his examinations.i trust.my doctor. I will continue to see him as my doctor. 
-1	I've had the same primary care doctor my whole life, he's never done anything to make me feel like he isn't trustworthy or qualified.  He knows me very well (and my family) and I feel like I can trust him to do what's best for me.
-1	I may trust the doctors a little bit because of there knowledge but I also feel some doctors don't know everything and just guess at what to do I put my trust in a higher power called the most high God
-1	While i trust that doctors are often doing their best and have reasons for why the do or do not recommend certain treatments, I do think they fall into patterns and often disregard complimentary medicines. They can be quick to prescribe medication or surgery with holistic remedies or simple dietary changes can help. Doctors are people and they are flawed and I believe that just like many other people, provide better care to patients they feel connected with. I feel like i have a responsibility as a patient to do my own research and ask questions. 
-1	The doctor I see most  is a neurologist.  I trust him very much, but not completely.  I have to rely on myself as well.  Ask questions, and keep asking them.
-1	as a person that knows a fair amount about medicine and practices i know that at times there are doctors that look out for themselves or the drug companies over your well being
-1	I have been one of the healthiest people ever, it seems; thus, I do not go to the doctor often. Since I don't need to go to the doctor all that often, it's hard to answer these questions. I do go for check-ups, but haven't gone every single year. I'm now 64 and am trying to go every year or two. But just going to the doctor for something so routine is not quite enough to thoroughly judge a physician's abilities.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she always takes time to listen to my concerns and explain things.  She also doesn't dismiss my feelings and thoroughly checks things out.
-1	For the most part, I trust my current primary care physician because her medical examinations always seem thorough enough, and she has always prescribed medications and treatments that have turned out to be helpful and never harmful. However there are a few issues I've brought up repeatedly that have not particularly been addressed. I assume that she believes those issues are not a big deal; whether they are as harmless as she seems to think, I can't be sure since I'm no medical expert. For now I'd prefer to just go along with her advice. I have been seen by some very poor quality physicians in the past, and my PCP is definitely not one of those. I generally don't put a lot of trust in people, but I trust my PCP more than most.
1	I have a good relationship with my doctor. She has always been very helpful. She is always willing to listen to my thoughts and concerns and is never forceful in her suggestions.
1	I trust my doctor because he has been the family doctor for many years. He has seen my mother and father in law my husband and my brither in law
-1	I think he's okay; my main thing with him is he always wants to send me to a specialist. I know myself, I am not going to make 14 different appointments to get a PAP, a colonoscopy, a mammogram...it's just too much hassle. I would rather have all my health checkups done at one place. He does listen, but doesn't delve into things, like I take wellbutrin and I'm not sure that is the solution but he doesn't ask me about or recommend anything else. He's a nice guy, I'm just not overly enamored of him but it's too much work to find another Doctor. 
-1	I don't really have a primary care physician but I did see an orthopedist last year.  I kind of felt that his wish to go through with the surgery made it more difficult for me to get him to talk about what my prognosis would be if I didn't have the surgery.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for a while.  She is very thorough.  If there is a question about treatment or diagnosis, she will refer you elsewhere.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, so I'd have to say the reason I don't trust doctors in general is because they always seem too busy to really listen to me, and are careful only to avoid malpractice suits.
-1	I think I would distrust a doctor because they aren't involved in their patients health and they aren't prepared. 
1	He's a trained professional and has always been open and honest with me and always lays out the options for treatment when I have any issues.  He's polite courteous and very intelligent.  
-1	I do not believe my doctor cares about my conditions at all. And i believe they just schedule doctor appointments just so they can bill my insurance.
-1	I like him and have used him for years. I trust him.
1	He has not been wrong about anything yet. Therefore I will continue to trust him. If there was ever an instance where he was wrong then maybe we will start to have trust issues.
1	My primary care physician takes his time trying to find out what is wrong with me. He doesn't jump to a conclusion or pass me off as a customer. There have been a couple of situations that, I could see, kind of stumped him in diagnosing the cause. That made me feel more at ease then him coming to a decision/conclusion quickly. 
1	I mainly trust him because he is a smart person who is detail oriented and when he explains something to me it makes sense to me. I have had doctors who tried to shoot me a line of bull to manipulate me which may seem good to them but if it does not make sense I can't believe anything they say.
-1	I don't feel I have a reason to doubt the sincerity of my primary care physician, as I feel that when I've gone to see him, he performs a thorough exam and blood work, etc., and has not recommended any courses of treatment that seemed suspect to me. Fortunately I have been very healthy and so have not really had many visits with him other than my yearly checkups, so I suppose I don't know if I can fully trust his decisions on treatment options, but I really don't have a reason to doubt him.
-1	I didn't trust many of my previous Dr's.  I felt they gave me lip service and didn't really retake an interest in me. I now have a new medical person who seems to care.
-1	He does not listen.  He does not take my opinions into account.  He focuses on his objectives without considering other factors.  He is uncaring and does not follow standard protocols.  He literally blackmailed me into taking a drug I have serious concerns about, disregarding the threat(s) to my health that this drug creates.
1	I've been seeing my primary care physician for a couple of years now. She takes the time to listen to my questions and makes sure I understand the answers. 
1	I have the most amazing doctor who is friendly and open to anything you have to say. He is very willing to listen when you are talking. He has great values and will give you his honest opinion. I love how good his bed side manner is. He makes you feel comfortable as soon as he walks in the room.
-1	I trust doctors to be careful and thorough, but a good bit of skepticism is healthy, and getting a second opinion is wise. It is difficult to put complete trust in someone I don't really know.
1	I trust my primary physician because he is very thorough in what he does and has been my doctor for many years.  Any time I have needed him he has been there and properly diagnosed me.  He is not afraid to involve other doctors when he is unsure or would like a second opinion.  
-1	For the most part, I trust my doctor.  He is the expert and knows what's best for me.  However, I know that doctor's are overworked and stretched thin.  I am sometimes wary that they do things that are quicker or easier.  
1	I have been going to the same dr for years. I have never had a bad experience.  She has always steered me in the right direction.  She seems knowledgeable and is always open to listen to what I have to say .
-1	I can't put all of my trust in what a doctor says until I meet them.  If they take their time treating me and looking for a solution then I can trust in what they are saying.  If they are late and then come in the room, in a rush, then I have difficulty trusting them.  They typically tend to rush through looking over me and seeking a solution to what is wrong.
-1	I think that the doctors I have used are traditional thinkers and that they refuse to think about alternatives other than traditional treatments. I do not think they take into account other options, especially holistic treatments.
1	My doctor takes time to listen to me and takes time to explain things to me. He us very caring and very through 
-1	I trust my physician for the most part. There are times though that I have questioned her. It is because medical degree or not we all have preferences and she is going to only offer me her preferences and I may not know about other options 
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because they take the take and answer all my questions. They let me know what I'm doing wrong about anything and lead me in the right path about my health. 
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. Since seeing my current doctor, he has on one occasion spent almost an hour with me explaining why my cholesterol is the way it is. The fact that he invested that much time with me instead of leaving in 10-15 minutes told me that he cares about what I need to know and is willing to take the time to make sure I understand why things happen like they do.
1	I trust my primary doctor because he has proved to me that he has my best interest in mind and he takes the time with me to explain my situation and to let me know about all medication he is prescribing for me to take. of about 
1	 All my doctors have always given me competent information and competent care. I trust them very much.
-1	Sometimes it seems as though doctors look at you as a number first rather than a person. This makes me not have complete trust in doctors that I come across because it's almost as though they don't really care what's actually best for me.
-1	I don't trust my current psychiatrist. I changed to him for the convenience of his location to my home as opposed to the 1/2 hour I spent trying to get to my other psychiatrist's office. So I changed doctor's for medication management. The doctor called my pharmacy, found out the medications I was currently on, and prescribed those to me. He does not ask me how I feel when I see him or anything really about my life like my last psychiatrist. I don't feel like I am anything other than an insurance payment to him. 
-1	Just started going to this doctor and haven't established a relationship between us yet.Therefore I need to get a feel for my new primary care physician
-1	My primary care physician doesn't really seem interested in me as a person.
-1	In most doctor I don't have a whole lot of trust. This is based on my experiences in life. I have had some good experiences as well. Not all doctors are bad.
1	I have been seeing the same primary care physician for 30 years and have established a long-standing and mutually respectful relationship.  While I trust her judgment completely, she also value my input and abides by my wishes if I prefer one plan of action over another.  when I need a referral to a specialist, she acts quickly.
-1	My primary care physician over prescribes, he's given me so many steroidal medications for simple viral infection, just because I have very mild asthma. He also gives antivirals, orders chest xrays even when I have no noise in my chest. It's too much and too often. He also isn't informed about mental health, I tried to ask for counseling and he couldn't find a list, then when he found it half the numbers on it were no longer in service or the providers didn't take my insurance.
1	My doctor and I communicate that is the key ð to a good doctor patient relationship she takes her time with all patients and explains everything 
-1	I think that I'm just a number and he just wants to me get in and out as soon as possible. I don't think that he really cares about me at all and I'm just a paycheck
-1	Idk you can't always trust somebody anyone could be lying no matter who the person you will never know what they are thinking in their head
-1	I trust my doctor with my medical health care needs. I don't have any reason not to trust her with my questions and concerns about my medical health care. 
-1	There have been a few times I have seen my doctor with issues that seemed bad and felt unable to communicate to her how bad I felt. I often feel like she isn't really listening to me. Only to go on to another specialist type and find out she should have known how to help me with this problem. 
-1	He's a good doctor and has my best interest at heart he's always telling me to eat right and do what's right for my health 
1	I trust my doctor at the VA because he is very thorough and if I don't ask enough or the right questions about things, he will start asking me relevant questions about what is going on with me. Things that I have complained about in the past, he will also cover with me to be sure that those issues have been addressed as well. Any test that is needed he will order and follow through to be sure that everything is up to date as needed.
1	My primary care physician has demonstrated competency in his profession to me. That is the primary reason I have for trusting him. The medical problems I've had over the years have been solvable, and my primary care physician has always assisted me in that regard. He also trusts my judgement on my own health issues and will issue necessary prescriptions by phone if he's convinced that I need them.
-1	we can come to a neutral agreement when its comes to my health and well being. He listen to my concerns and address them to my needs
1	My doctor is amazing. He has several degrees and is one of a handful of Holistic doctors in Minnesota. He is beyond smart, compassionate and honest. I've seen many doctors over the years, but this doctor is my favorite and only one I will ever see again.
-1	There are no problems with any of the health care people i have, they understand what iI need and supple it.
-1	I trust my doctor because I can talk openly with her and she takes the time needed during my appointments
1	I completely liked my doctor the moment I met her I trust her to do the best possible care for me she answers any questions I have and is very patient I never feel rushed
1	I trust my doctor because he is very thorough at each visit. He wanted to do 3 month check ups and I kept on saying months. He finally agreed to 6 months if I agreed to come back soon er if I needed to so I did and it never lasts the 6 months. He was going to admit me to the hospital and he had all the paper work done and they even had a room for me when I got there. He wanted me to go in an ambulance and I said I couldn't afford so I went in a personal vehicle.
-1	Overall, I trust my doctor because I know they are knowledgeable and have years of training experience. However, I don't feel that my doctor sees me as an individual and will always give the best treatment option
1	I believe they know what they are talking about. They take time to tell me things. They let me ask questions.
1	I HAVE CHANGED DOCTORS RECENTLY. HOWEVER, THE PAST FEW MONTHS FOLLOWING HER ADVICE, I HAVE LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE AND FELT BETTER. ALSO, MY HUSBAND HAS LOST WEIGHT AND HIS DIABETES IS IMPROVING. SO FAR, I THINK I HAVE RECEIVED GOOD ADVICE.
-1	my primary care physicians have never given me a reason to distrust them so i trust them until there is a reason to distrust them.
-1	Doctors do practice nothing is a hundred percent so they can say something that is wrong and we have to pay for it
1	It has always been a very open and honest type of discussion between us. Nothing ever hidden with facts and consequences always fully disclosed.  
1	I have complete trust in my doctor because I have been his patient since I was 19 years old.This doctor has delivered all 3 of my kids and I know if I tell him something that conversation stays between him and myself. He's very professional and he cares about his patients.
-1	sure about the situation
1	I trust my doctor because I have had him for along time.There is nothing that don't trust from my doctor.
1	I have never had any problems with her since I have been seeing her. She always answers any questions I have and always makes sure I don't have any unanswered questions before leaving the office. She always checks everything to make sure she has diagnoised me correctly. 
-1	My doctor explains my condition with good verbal skills and help me understand his medications and the way to take them and how to use them.
1	She listens and responds.  She is warm and friendly and seems very interested in what I have to say.  She explains things in ways that are easily understood without being condescending. She treats me like a person.  
1	I have never had reason not to trust a doctor. This could be because I have always had pretty good health but event he small issues i have had were taken care of without problems or concerns.
-1	I trust my doctor, as I have seen him for a while and several of my family members (as well as family friends) go to him too. He is knowledgable and friendly, and is also open to hearing your thoughts and feelings about what's best for your health.
-1	It's not a question of trust, but I know what's best for me. A doctor is an adviser, not the end-all be - all. I trust my docs, but as they say, I trust my mother, but I still cut the cards
-1	I think that people are often motivated by money and that sometimes doctors will not tell people the best way to take care of themselves but they will tell them what is most convenient and beneficial to themselves instead. 
-1	I don't see my primary car physician that often, but when I do she always seems kind of rushed and mechanical. For that reason I don't completely trust that she's explored all of the options, or given me the knowledge I need to know what my options are, but what she does do for me I trust is effective and not harming me. 
-1	I believe most doctors can be trusted in giving you the best advise available to you. The problem with doctors in the US, is they do not have enough time to spend with patients. They are usually in a rush to get you out of the office, so they can see the next patient. 
1	I do have complete trust in my primary care physician, because I have been a patient of his for a long time. He is a fairly young doctor and is intelligent and knows about new technology and medications. I have always been able to get same day appointments, if needed. He has never steered me wrong on the topic of health or taking care of myself.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because when I talk to her she gives me her opinion and with my medical back ground I know that she has my best interest at heart. I know she cares and can tell by the way she responds to me
1	I trust my doctor because i have been seeing her for over 2 years now.  I feel that she knows me and my diagnosis very well so most things she suggest such as treatments and medicines i believe is always in my best interest. 
1	She is mindful of my family history and as such makes sure she keeps a check on potential diseases or disorders I may inherit.
-1	I really don't go to the doctors, but when I did in the past they always treated me with compassion, and patience. 
1	I trust my doctor because he has full knowledge of my situations. He is calm and always have knowledgeable answers and solutions.
1	She hasn't stirred me wrong as yet, I feel confident in her abilities to what is right for me. I trust my Doctor very much.
-1	I believe doctors tell patients to mask their ailments with man made medicines and not Actually give real help. There are ailments that don't require medicine in pill forms
-1	I hate doctors.  I feel bad saying that but I find them to be judgy and hypocritical.  Doctors seem to think they know more than they actually do and that can be very problematic...
1	He listens to me and we discuss the findings, treatments, and plan options. He is always been right, but I'm also a good historian of symptoms.
1	I trust my doctors because they give me choices and advice regarding treatment.  They also refer me to specialist if needed.
1	My primary care physician is a nice and honest person. He has helped me through so much. He has never taken advantage of me, nor gave me any wrong medicine.
-1	I just don't feel there is enough time. My MD books a lot of patients and is cognizant of the time and need to be quick. I don't often get a chance to sak all my questions.
1	He is always up front with me and he explains thing's so I can understand what he is talking about. He really seems to care about my health. If he's not sure what is going on he will send me to a specialty doctor to find out what is going on. 
-1	I think my doctor has my interest in hand. I trust that my needs are important .
1	I trust my doctor with my healthcare needs because of his knowledge, compassion and care for my well being.
-1	Make sure to ask questions and weight out you options your doctor can only go off of what you feel and what they see is not the only thing they can go off of treating you so make sure to be open and speak how you feel.
-1	Some of the things my doctor tells me aren't true. First of all, everyone knows that medicine is not good for you and second of all, she should be more observing. ð
1	I trust my primary care physician because she gives all the information I need She gives me options on how to care of myself and my health
1	It is a rare quality these days since I have seen at least 15 different family doctors throughout my life, and the family doctor I have now actually listens, he hugs me when I walk in, he looks for any side effects for my current medications if he has to put me on something temporarily, e.g. antibiotic, and he spends quality time with me. Even after months of telling him something, he remembers it like we just chatted about it moments ago. His memory, attention to detail, and time with the patient is extraordinary!
1	I've been with the same group of primary care physicians for over 20 years. While the doctors/PAs change, they are always knowledgeable, current, honest, have a good bedside manor and answer any and all questions I have about any conditions, treatment options or costs. 
-1	i read a lot, so a dr. would really have to explain why i might need more medication or might need a procedure before i decide to go with her advice
1	My doctor always seems to be upfront and honest with me. He provides me with the information i need to be proactive in taking care of my health. 
-1	I trust him but there is always that doubt that they are just guessing your diagnosed things because they are doctor
-1	I think that they listen to me and try to understand me. But sometimes I question the treatment they suggest. I don't know if it is the only one, best one or the most convenient for the medical practice one. I want to trust them, but I do have to watch out for myself too.
1	I trust my doctor because she is always honest with me about everything and explains things in terms that I can understand. 
-1	I chose neutral because I currently do not have a primary care doctor. My medical needs are usually taken care of at an Immediate Care center due to health insurance.
-1	Because my doctor had me on a mental medication that she neglected to tell me would cause me to have memory problems
-1	I have not been given any reason not to trust my physician. She is willing to hear my concerns and prescribe necessary medication based on her assessment of what is wrong.
1	I don't have. A primary care physician. But previous ones have been very trustworthy and have my best interest in mind
-1	I do not believe that doctors know much about a lot of problems that have not been discovered and wrongly diagnose people very often with something based on very little research or facts. I also believe they are sales men for pharma company more then they are doctors who want to help people.
-1	I trust my primary care physician sometimes because he's made mistakes, rushed to his own judgment, and said things to me that made me feel like he was looking out for himself rather than looking out for my needs. That said, I still use him because he's been willing to admit when he's wrong, correct his behavior, and move forward.
1	My doctor has been very good so far in terms of honesty/transparency, letting me know my options and giving me quality care.
-1	"I have only seen my primary care doctor a couple of times, but she is someone my family regards highly and who has been very good to them. As a result of their good experiences, I am generally inclined to think positively of my doctor and trust her judgement. I do, however, feel I need more time to develop any feeling akin to ""complete trust."""
-1	Well the doctor I go to mainly focuses on my weight for my age and height but not taking into consideration that I have muscle. So her main focus at the visit is to call me fat and say I need to lose weight.    
1	They tell me the things that I have to do and not to do to be healthy. They don't beat around the bush, they tell me if something is wrong with me.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I usually have a lot of questions to ask them when I come in for visits. They take the time to answer those questions and break down the technical answers into something I can understand. They also have taken care of all the other members of my family as well for years. So a long bond with our physician created that trust over many years.
1	My doctor has demonstrated thoroughness for many years, and stays on top of my needs and/or issues. 
1	In my family we have the habit of always seeing the same doctor and socializing with him, because of that, the trust we have for him and, apart from that, he has proven to be a reliable person over the years.
-1	Doctors are good for people and the community, but sometimes they can get a little bit ahead of themselves, and diagnose you with something you don't have.
1	I'VE BEEN SEEING THE SAME DOCTOR FOR OVER 15 YEARS AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND FORTHCOMING WITH ME. THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE TIME I CAN THINK OF WHERE I QUESTIONED WHAT I WAS TOLD REGARDING MY HEALTH
-1	My doctor's seem to be laid back and more concerned with quantity than quality, coming up with treatment's before even fully diagnosing a situation
1	I trust my doctor because he is very good he takes as much time as he needs to explain things to me I  truly believe he has my best interest at heart
1	I trust my doctor because he has always steered me right and will do his best to avoid putting me through a procedure that I don't actually need. While he could make more money doing so, he will be honest with me in telling me whether or not I need something done or not. 
-1	I haven't been to the doctors in awhile, however, as alluded to in my previous answer, I don't believe dermatology doctor is through. I have had the same issues I presented to him over a year ago and he simple just keeps suggesting new types of medication instead of fixing the root cause.
1	I trust my doctor because I have yet to receive bad advice from them. They have also been a doctor for a long time, so they have valuable experience that help my trust
-1	My Father was killed by is Dr.  My Mother was killed by a Hospital.  Dr's in America are trained to prescribe Pills, not cure the ill.  I have a primary care physician, but I take charge of my health.  I am 70 years old and take no prescription drugs.
-1	I don't trust my doctor because I think they are just trying to feed me medicine they always are rude and insensitive 
1	I always make sure to choose a physician I am comfortable with. This means that I feel they have my best interest in mind and are not just out to milk my insurance or have little interest in their patients.
-1	I have a history with the doctor I see every month, and so far he listens to me, authorizes diagnostic tests when I have problems, and discusses results with me when he gets them.
1	I have been with him a long time and totally trust him with my care, medical advice, treatments and recommendations.
1	He has never given me a reason to not trust him, he always explains things in ways i can understand, and usually lets me choose my own options, though he will always let me know what he recommends and why.  He is also very understanding of my issue with when i go to him, i usually try to ask and talk about all my issues at once, which can make meetings last longer then they should.
-1	I have a rare disease. It took 4 years and several doctors before I filly got a diagnosis and effective treatment. Along the way, I had doctors who were well-meaning but unhelpful, doctors that accused me of lying, doctors that ignored me and forced me to go to a patient advocate to get them to follow through. I've learned that it isn't in my best interests to assume that any doctor can be completely trusted.
1	I've had my current doctor for three years now and he is the best doctor I've ever had. He is thorough in his assessments and is totally trustworthy.
-1	i trust my primary care physician because i have been going to him for the longest time and i have not had any reason to believe otherwise
1	I trust my physician because she seems very sincere when were are discussing my health. She listens and does not make me feel like I am paranoid. 
-1	I suppose there are numerous reasons why I don't trust doctors, but the biggest reason for me is that I feel most get into the profession because they want to make a lot of money. The concern for them isn't treating sickness out of the good of their heart, they simply desire to make a lot of money, even if they sacrifice their time/well being for it. It's about them being well off, not me. For me, this is an icky feeling and I have trouble getting over it. I have met doctors whom I have come to trust, but that takes time and they have to prove exceptional to get over that greed-hurdle I've imposed on them.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for about 20 years now and have not been steered wrong. We have a close relationship and I can talk to him about anything.
1	My doctor always takes the time to explore the best treatment options. He explains them in a manner that is easy to understand, the benefits and downsides of procedures, and how I should go about certain routines. He does not make me feel pressured, does not force decisions on me, and makes sure I complete agree with something before moving forward. 
1	She is thorough and she actually listens to me. She wants what is best for me, but doesnt put me through unnecessary testing.  She is kind and follows up. She is quick to answer questions when I ask
-1	I think that doctors have lots of time constraints so they tend to limit the appropriate amount of time necessary for their patients 
-1	i view my doctor a partner in giving me the best advice from their professional point of view, but at the end it's really my decision to make
-1	I fully believe she is doing her best, The current health care system piles workloads on top of the short supply of doctors. Due to the high workload and the short amount of time available for each patient they are not nearly as thorough as one would like. Also due to time constraints and information sharing problems they are almost never up to date on your files and past Labs, ext. They put out health fires but do little to promote general good health and long term goals. I also feel there is a long gap between current medical research and what is being practiced at the physician level, i believe in the worst cases there are old doctors practicing the medicine they learned in college, when 30 years of new science is being ignored. 
-1	i do trust him for the most part. in the past there were instances where me and some others have doubted him but as he grows older he seems to have more of a better understanding of things now.
-1	If you can do that perm or smoke the what's you can do that perm or the night long you about go to you later to you earlier I can meet you at i
1	My doctor that I see most often is an extremely intelligent and interesting person. We have talked on many subjects over the years. I trust him to treat me in the best possible way for my situation at the time. He is very personable and open to discuss whatever is on your mind.
1	I trust my Primary care doctor because he respects me and the knowledge I have about my health and body. I have some different health issues and he lets me somewhat control my treatment. He listens well to what I tell him about my body and asks thoughtful questions. He helps me plan my treatment, and defers to my preferences. He's not a pushover, but he is aware that I'm the one living in my body, so i know my body best of anyone. And i really appreciate that!
-1	I trust my doctor because he has never done any harm to me and always has my best interest at heart. I have to trust that he knows what he is doing as I obviously don't have the training that he does. The only thing that does bother me about my doctor is that he is sometimes too busy for his own good and maybe doesn't take as much time as what he should with patients. I think that his office sometimes schedules too many patients in one day and that is what causes this mind set for me. 
-1	I trust my doctor. I know where he lives. I know where his children go to school. He knows I know this.  I trust my doctor.
-1	Doctors are people too. they are practicing medicine, so they don't have all the answers to medical problems. I don't completely trust anyone. 
1	He's very blunt, like house level blunt. he may not be polite or kind or caring, but he knows the healthcare field and medicine. He has no problem saying it how it is and doesn't fancy foot around it.
1	I've been with the same doctor for several years and haven't had any issues. Always have my best interest in heart and we discussed everything from medications to procedures.
1	I trust them because it is their job.  I do realize that everyone has flaws and sometimes ulterior motives. However I still trust the doctor.
-1	I trust my primary care physician and I do have a primary care physician who has always been trustworthy. They are known to have a good reputation within the community.
-1	I believe doctors had some participatory stake in the prescription opiate mess.  While most doctors didn't have inside information on the pharmaceutical industry's practices  with respect to testing and marketing, I believe there have been relatively few doctors who have actually expressed a lot of remorse about the whole affair. That being said, doctors can't be held entirely accountable for living in a culture that is, in some sense, addictive in its makeup. My attitude toward doctors is governed by the principle that I do not expect mistake-free behavior on the part of anyone. All I ask is that doctors or other medical professionals who work with me give their best effort and use the best information available to them.
1	I have a personal connection with my doctor. It is just something that occurs, chemistry, that I feel about some people. Once that connection is made it is just easy to trust what he is telling me. I can think of no reason why he would tell me things that weren't true and would not be in my interest.
-1	I distrust some physicians because of stories I hear on the news. People are getting mistreated wrong.
-1	I have a long term history with the medical practice and have had good experiences.  I have trained with several of the medical professionals and have trust in them.
-1	"I have served in a medical sales capacity for more than 10 years and have seen doctors who recommend and even require certain patient services that will benefit them financially although they may not be the most medically necessary or advantageous service.  Medicine has become a ""business"" more than it used to be and managed care does not always allow the doctor to provide the best care, rather what is allowed."
-1	He seems sincerely interested in what is best for me.  He also sees others in my family and they feel the same way.  It is a feeling I have that he is trustworthy.  He has not given me any reason not to trust him.  I feel he is there to help.
-1	I trust my primary care provider a great deal.  He has done quite a bit to inform me of low cost options for treatment as well as flat out given me prescriptions.  He is also a big believer in preventative medicine.  The guy is a gem. 
1	My doctor has treated me well. My only complaint is that he is sometimes in a rush and I can sense he doesn't have more than a few minutes to speak with me.
-1	I'm the kind of person that likes to verify everything myself. It turns out my doctor has been right most of the time. A couple of times he's been wrong. But hey, nobody's perfect, which is why it's important to verify.
-1	They make their choices baswd on their best knowledge. Sometimes they can be wrong. I only put complete trust in God.
-1	I haven't seen my doctor very often since I've been going to him for 2 years so it's hard for me to trust him. I have seen him 4 times in the 2 years. I don't know him very well, but from past experience, doctors in general don't know it all and are humans and make mistakes. 
-1	I think he just doesn't listen to me.  I think he already thinks he knows what's wrong and what needs to happen.
1	Because I've been seeing him for years and I haven't had a any problems, He's good and professional 
-1	I trust my doctors in that they have education and experience in their fields whereas I do not.  However, I am a strong believer in advocating for yourself and getting second opinions and asking questions to be able to make the best choices for myself.
-1	She contradicts herself a lot. I'm actually in the process of looking for another doctor. She never gives clear cut answers. 
-1	It really depends on the situation, some doctors I feel like they don't have enough time to talk about a medical condition or they seem like they're too busy to really go into any type of detail. But I do have a doctor I normally see that does take the time out to explain what he thinks the root of a problem may be.
-1	It depends on the situation.  If the doctor is trying to push a new drug that is quite expensive then I would wonder if he is getting something out of the deal.  If I were to think that he may be wrong on a diagnosis then I would likely look for another opinion.  At the end of the day the doctor is a human and no human is perfect, so unless they give a reason to not believe them then I probably would lean towards trusting them unless I felt they were wrong in some way.  
1	because everytime i have went in to see him for anything he has always been concerned and always explains everything i ask him
1	He is courteous and attentive. He is very informative and talks about every option available to me in regards to my health. I always feel as if he is treating me like I am his only patient, as he devotes all his time and attention to me in that moment.
1	Because they are well trained and experienced in their field, and they know more about my health than I don.
-1	I have had issues with doctors prescribing medication that has harmed me while pregnant.  I have a son who has hearing loss due to a medication provided to me while I was pregnant.  I later found out it was not approved for pregnant women.  I also suffered a miscarriage after taking some medication prescribed for a virus from a doctor.  I can't say that it was caused by the medication or the virus, but looking back, I still don't trust that the medication was safe.
-1	I've only been with this doctor a little over a year, she seems pretty good and She had me believing that she knew what she was talking about
1	I TRUST THE PCP SOMETIMES BECAUSE THEY DO BE RIGHT MOST OF THE TIME BUT NOT ALWAYS ALL THE TIME  SOMETIMES THEY ARE MISLEADING 
-1	I trust the doctor to run blood work that is needed and shots that are needed. I trust the doctor will give me the right medications with the right dose.
1	I'm not an expert as to what is okay for my body. If I thought I was dying, I would certainly think about their opinions of possible diagnosis or treatment that was available to me.
1	I trust my provider because they are very good at explaining all the options available to me. She takes time to listen to my concerns, even if it isn't very serious.
1	It features an open communication system. He listens. I listen. Discussions are thought-provoking. He is a valuable resource to not just myself, but my family.
1	I trust my doctor because she has years of experience. I also trust her because so far she has been correct and gave me great consul.
-1	My doctor is really smart and does care, so I trust that they're not going to offer me something I don't need. At the same time, they're pretty dismissive and patronizing, so that's a little discouraging.
-1	My physician sometimes waffles or backtracks, which causes me to suspect her judgment on occasion. She has more than once recommended a certain treatment and then at a follow-up exam, has made statements about the treatment which caused me to wonder whether she actually believed in it or not. I do realize that doctors are just people, and sometimes not even terribly intelligent or competent, so I've trained myself to expect not quite so much from them as others may. 
1	i trust my doctor because he don't just tell me what to take or do we talk it over i decide together if this is the best treatment for me
-1	usually he gives me good advice.But sometimes they put you on meds with to many's side effects.
1	I have had nothing but positive experiences with doctors. They are highly trained and knowledgeable in their subject, I have no reason to doubt them.
1	I have gone to my doctor for many years. He has been in practice for a long  time and is very open and honest when he speaks with me. He tells me the things I really need to hear. I trust his judgement in regards to my health.
-1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years. They spend ample time listening to any symptoms or issues that I have to present before making any form of diagnoses or prescribing medications. They also take the time to fully explain any diagnoses to me at that time. 
1	I trust my doctor because they have never given me a reason not to trust them. They are intelligent, caring, and have great bed side manners. When ever I'm not feeling well they come up with a great plan or solution to get me back to feeling better.
1	There is a high level of mutual respect and regard between my medical team and me.  We all recognize that honest, complete  commucation is essential for them to provide me with the best care.  If I question a particular treatment, they are completely willing to discuss the pros, cons, and options for the optimal outcome.
1	He is thorough and talks to me at length about my conditions.  He is focused on my health.  He works me in whenever I need to talk to him and we can have an appointment that is long if I feel I need it.  And he has done great things for my health and is very intelligent.
1	My doctor takes time to listen to my questions and explains things in simple terms. He is very kind, compassionate and patient.
1	I trust my primary care physician. I've seen this physician for many years and have never had a problem discussing concerns or listening to what to do to be proactive in my health.
-1	Needed meds for migraines and my doc explained all meds that I could take and the pros and cons of all of them. 
-1	I feel like a doctor's office is a business like any other.  They are looking to help people but with a way that will also maximize their profits.
1	My doctor is very trustworthy. She takes her time with me and explains everything And also if I have any questions she will taker her time and discuss and explain everything that needs to be
-1	I asked my physician about certain medications and she said that she doesn't like to prescribe those drugs. I respect her respect her reasoning, as I feel the same way about certain medications
-1	I agree my doctors have my best interest but I feel I need to do my own research and ask questions to advocate myself 
-1	"Normally, I would say that I trust my primary care physician, however, there are times where they've ""dropped the ball"" on important physical issues/experiences that I've encountered, elongating the amount of time it takes to receive treatment."
-1	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is they don't sugarcoat anything and they give you the honest truth about what you should do
-1	my doctor is knowledgeable but good gracious they do not have time for you. They are always in a hurry, are as impersonal as possible and that creates a perfect distrust for me.
-1	Sometimes I feel like he does not listen or believe I have certain symptoms and instead takes the easier diagnosis. 
1	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been going to her for years. She is a very caring and understanding physician. She listens to your needs and helps you find a solution to your problems that makes you comfortable. She doesnât make you feel pressured nor incompetent when you donât understand the health terminology. She breaks things down so you can understand and she makes sure she available if you have any questions or concerns. My physician takes pride in what she does and itâs transmitted through her having our best interest at heart.
1	she is my age and is very intelignet She is going throght some of the same issues I am and i just connect with her so much and trust her a lot she is  a contol freak but i love it anyway its good for me!!

-1	I basically trust my primary care physician because she is extremely experienced and seems caring, and her treatment recommendations seem appropriate.
-1	I had a couple of negative experiences with doctors, but overall my experiences have been very positive. My doctor is very thorough, takes time to answer questions and discuss concerns, and never made me feel like I was being rushed, or like a number.
1	I have no reason not to trust my doctor.  So far, she has always been thorough and helpful with any problem I am experiencing.
1	My PCP has been very open and honest about changes I've needed to make in my life to get and stay healthy. I never felt as though they were doing anything to persolly convenience herself, and I've trusted the advice given to me.
