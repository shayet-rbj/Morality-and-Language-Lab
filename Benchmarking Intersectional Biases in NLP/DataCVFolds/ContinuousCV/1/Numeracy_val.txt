0.714286	"When the government inverted the food pyramid in the early 1990s, I told my children to ignore it. Replacing proteins, fats, etc with carbohydrates would create US epidemics of diabetes and obesity in the US -- it has. 75% of the brain is myelin, myelin is 100% cholesterol. Statin drugs inhibit liver production of cholesterol, creating our epidemic of Swiss cheese-brained cadavers from Alzheimer's disease. A 6.4 cent 100 mcg vitamin K tablet - size of saccharin tablet - prevents required blood serum calcium and blood  serum cholesterol from bonding at the molecular level into vessel plaque. When I had to tell a doctor that I had a strep throat, he took a culture, then didn't know what to prescribe because I'm allergic to penicillin. His PDR was no help to him, and he finally asked me what was usually prescribed for me, and wrote the prescription after again checking the PDR for correct dosage by weight, after asking me my weight. I was 20 at the time. Want more? Despite foreknowledge of both grandmothers dying of uterine hemorrhage and special care being taken for my first two deliveries, I suffered a uterine hemorrhage with my third child and ""died"" and I'm here only because I responded positively to resuscitation. Further idiocy? Second hand smoke was disproved in 1999, but they keep beating that dead horse. I smoked a pack of Marlboro reds throughout all three pregnancies, and gave birth to healthy, perfect, over 8 pound babies, a girl and two boys. Start looking for the correct reasons -- like minerals missing from the diet because they're never replaced in arable soil -- for birth defects."

I was so horrified I started crying. I knew that what they were telling me was going to shorten my life and change it dramatically forever. Long story short though, after 16 more blood tests they found out my blood that had came up positive for streptococcus was contaminated in the hospital because all of my other tests came up negative. It's a disease I was actually familiar with and knew previously a great deal about. I'm very thankful that It's something I do not have.

Based on my experience it was very smooth and very successful operation, now I don't have any problem with my ears, I haven't had any ear infection since then.

0.857100	I broke my arm many years ago and was told I needed surgery to fix my arm.  When I reviewed the surgery the doctor suggested I realized that they wanted to put pins in my bones to hold them together and in turn it would dramatically reduce my range of motion in my arm.  I decided not to have the surgery and found a doctor who agreed to take a slow approach to healing my broken arm.  I spent nearly a year in various casts and my arm healed on it's own, with full range of motion.  Had I not taking the time and energy to research my arm and the suggested surgery, I may not be living the life I have now and my physical abilities would be reduced.

When the first surgery was done I was a novice and only knew some things but by the time the second surgery came along I was an expert.  When he showed me the x-ray of my discs I actually cut him off and told him what the scan showed.  I said there thats the bad disc and that portion needs to be removed in order to alleviate the pain.

I had a suspicion it was a kidney problem. I went to urgent care and they said, no it's nothing, just take an antacid.

0.071400	Common interview questions and answers Be prepared to answer these common interview questions. Every interview has a unique focus, but some questions are asked so often, it makes sense to do all you can to prepare for them. In order to be successful, you need a strategyânot scripted answers.

0.857100	A few years ago, I suffered an orbital blowout. I live in a relatively small town, so when I heard that I would need surgery to fix it, I immediately began researching doctors in a larger city about 3 hours away. I knew they would be more skilled in fixing my issue. When I got to the doctor in the big city, he was horrified by the treatment I had received from the doctor's in a small town at the initial appointments (so I could receive a referral to this doctor) and was very glad I had come to see him instead. I felt this experience showed that I knew what was best for myself, and that I was knowledgeable about the type of medical care I needed to receive.

One day we arrived at the lake and there was a male resident, wheelchair bound, there. He appeared to be asleep. My mother didn't realize he was there. I immediately had concern. One of those feelings you can't explain. I decided to just keep an eye on him while we were feeding the turtles. I would look his way often and noticed he had moved his wheelchair into a different position. I continued to observe him, but I looked away for a few minutes. Next thing I know he was lying prone on the ground. It appeared that he was grabbing at a tree to pull himself up. That did it for me and I went over to offer my assistance. When I got to him he refused my help. And I realized he was using the tree to push himself to the water. He was going to commit suicide. I used my knowledge of depression (I have suffered through my own recurrent depression for 20 years) and began talking to him and listening to him all while trying to physically hold him still. I became his friend for those moments he really needed someone. I may have been the one who saved his life, but God gave me the calm and physical strength to hold him until some more help arrived.

Needless to say, another attack landed me in the ER and they did an ultrasound and diagnosed me with gall-sludge. They scheduled to take my gallbladder out and did. Pain went away.

She said she would consult with the charge nurse, I told her - why don't you just retake them now, that blood pressure is too high. She retook the blood pressure and he was fine, but I am glad I had the knowledge I did to ask for a re-take.
