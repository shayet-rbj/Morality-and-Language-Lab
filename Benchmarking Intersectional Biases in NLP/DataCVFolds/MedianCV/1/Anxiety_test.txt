1	With some health care providers in the past, I felt that they were too rushed and a little rough. During my first pregncy, I saw one doctor in the practice who gave me a quick, rough interl exam. Even my husband was cringing. When a doctor's bedside manner is impersol and they seem rushed for time, it usually makes me feel nervous, and I am much less likely to ask questions, lest I annoy the doctor.
-1	I worry that I won't get the full attention of the doctor and won't get all my questions answered. 
-1	I do not like to wait for test results to say what is going on with my overall health I like to know right away what is happening and going on .
-1	The thing that makes me most anxious is wondering if there will be something majorly wrong. I also worry that there won't be anything that can be done for symptoms that may be present.
1	I just get nervous having to sit in doctor's offices. I'm afraid of the germs and nervous about the visit itself.
-1	Nothing really in particular, I just have doctor anxiety -- along with general anxiety. I think the doctor called it White Coat Anxiety or something like that.
-1	When i feel something is wrong with my body and I'm hoping it is nothing too bad. 
1	I am just always afraid I am going to be told I have some sort of cancer or disease. I grew up with a Nana who was VERY OFTEN hospitalized and spent a lot of time there visiting her. She had a myriad of health conditions and I'm just afraid I'll end up like that no matter how much I watch what I eat and take care of myself.
-1	Don't have any complications or disorder. Still anxious about needles since I was little.
-1	If I am not feeling well not knowing what is causing me to feel ill makes me anxious and worried. After the prognosis and diagnosis I start to settle down and relax. 
-1	I get anxious about my lab results for my condition and also about my weight. 
-1	I think it is just the unexpected. I'm ok as long as I know what is going to happen, but if I don't .. then I get anxious - confused - nervous and sometimes upset.
1	I don't like going to the doctor. The examination, test and procedures sometimes makes me feel undignified and exposed. 
-1	Have been able to maintain conditions successfully but become anxious about test results that may indicate those efforts are no longer adequate or show some new and unexpected malady.
-1	I have never felt  anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office and always look forward for each and every visit 
1	I am most anxious and worried when I visit a doctor's office because I feel like doctors only look at the major illnesses that you may have instead of realizing that everyone doesn't fit into those categories.
1	I feel a little anxious when I go to the doctor because I know she is going to tell me that for my health I need to eat better and exercise.  I don't do those things and I know she will get on to me about it.
1	I get nervous when visiting the doctor. Its been like that for a long time but my GP tries to make my visit as comfortable as possible
1	when you visit a doctor the first thing is my pressure goes up feel like he going to say something bad or give me a shot hate those
1	The obvious you have cancer your dieing of a disease I've had a very dramatic childhood and the memories are always on my mind as well as alot of bad feelings over the years 
-1	I have had a lump removed from my breast and I have to have it checked to make sure it has not returned or any others have formed. I get anxious when I know it is time to have my check up.
1	When I go to the doctor's office I have a hard time not thinking of the worst possible outcome. All the uncertainty can give me anxiety. 
1	Uncertain of what the outcome might be and if it will be helpful or more harmful than how I may already feel depending on the type of visit.
1	My biggest fear is that of being told that I have an incurable disease or only have a few months to live.  I think my fear is that my mother died when I was young and my father was very sick as I was growing up.
-1	It's the unknown, the uncertainty of it.  If I am there, it's because I was uble to figure it out on my own, or uble to gain access to what I need to treat myself.  Again, a Dr should be viewed as a partner in helping you achieve good health.
1	I am generally concerned about my weight and how it may or may not be affecting my health.  I feel guilty about not exercising as often as I should. 
1	when I have a test done I get very worried and anxious while I am setting there waiting to be called back to find the results
1	When visiting the dotors office I am mostly worried and concerned about what is wrong with me. Is it something serious, is it contagious? Will it keep me from being the full time mom to my baby that I have been since He was born? Just concerned for me and my son
1	Will I actually get something resolved that I am being seen for or will I need to be seen multiple times.
1	I know that he is going to complain about my weight.  Then he is going to tell me that his wife put him on a diet and how small his plate is.  He will then tell me that his wife is blond and beautiful and that she knows what is best.  Then he will talk about his need to still lose ten pounds so that his wife will be proud of him.....every time I go see him.....same story.....
1	I would feel anxious or worried about a doctors visit if I had a strange pain or feeling in my body that I haven't had before. Not knowing what could be the cause of the pain or illness would make me worried about what the diagnosis could be. I would slightly doubt the doctor fully understands what I am feeling and if the treatment would be the correct procedure for me. I would not feel anxious or worried if I was just going in for a regular checkup or follow up. Only when I am experiencing something I have never experienced is when I would start to worry.
1	Most anxious knowing my body is in well enough condition ro perform my womanly duties worried that I mau have another health problem.to add with the rest
-1	
-1	I am very paranoid about my health. The thing that makes me feel the most anxious or worried is me thinking about what could be wrong and what the doctor will tell me. I am always afraid he is going to give me horrible news.
1	worried about what she might find. have had a lot of health issues lately and never know what to expect.
-1	Having a persistent problem that requires multiple specialists and tests to discover a cause causes me anxiety.
-1	The wait instills that feeling of unease; sitting there for any among of time in the doctors office makes your mind wander off into possibilities that could be highly unlikely.
-1	I always visit top-notch medical centers. Some doctors work very long shifts. Hence, I can become worried when a doctors appears to be very tired.
1	I am worried when I visit the doctor's office because I have numerous health issues. I'm usually afraid that something will be wrong. I feel better after speaking with my doctors regardless of the outcome of my exam, labs, etc. 
1	if i think i have something bad going on. if i think it is bad i over think and get myself worked up
-1	Follow up times make me anxious the most, as I am concerned that I haven't followed through they way the specialist has asked.  Concerned I didn't loose enough weight to meet their ideals between visits, even though most times my GP doesn't push too hard about it, and often I have lost, especially this year.  If the doctor's office calls me in my mind naturally goes to the bad news side of thinking.
1	The waiting makes me the most uneasy. You wait in the waiting room, then you wait for the doctor and then you wait for the results. I hate the doctor wait game, it hurts my stomach.
-1	I am sometimes worried that I can't convey my issues well enough. I'm also cognisant of other people waiting, so I don't want to take too much time. 
1	That I get bad news something that I might not want to hear or just thinking something negative but I try to think positive 
-1	I am too old to worry about the stupid stuff. Tons of doctors have seen my junk. I had a nursing class watch me give birth. (I was the only one not screaming, it was my 3rd kid). So unless someone was going to do a procedure that I knew was going to hurt really bad I do not get anxious.
1	I sometimes am worried that when i go to the doctor with a problem that it is going to be something terrible, or require painful surgery or treatment
1	"I have ""white coat syndrome"" because my old doctor was often mean to me - part of the reason was my fault because I am a recovered alcoholic and I was drinking when I saw him and I was terrified he was going to find something major wrong with me"
1	my blood pressure is high and my weight is higher.if i feel anxious and how to handle it.if i have to do some other tests
-1	I don't have feelings of anxiety when I visit my doctor's office. Since I maintain a healthy lifestyle, I feel very comfortable when visiting his office. I go for regular checkups and I have no need to be worried.
1	I am not a huge fan of going to the doctor but still go because I value my health. I am always a little apprehensive of visiting the doctor even though I am in excellent health.
-1	That I'll be told I've exhausted all my treatment options for my condition or that the remaining treatment options are out of my price range.
1	That where might be something wrong with me that can't me helped with medication. That I will have to have surgery and I don't have money for all of that.
-1	Afraid he might discover I have a serious condition such as cancer-I had prostate cancer-now zapped and cured
-1	Never really anxious. I'm usually pretty good when it comes to visiting my physician. I do tend to get worried  when I get an irregular result of some sort.
1	Well, no one wants to die and sometimes we have to face that when visiting the doctor's office. If something is wrong, then you have to start thinking.
1	I am most anxious or worried about them finding something I did not expect that will negatively impact my health. I am also worried that they will tell me I have been doing something wrong or that I am putting on too much weight.
1	When my doctor writes something down and doesn't mention anything about it to me. My doctor knows more about me than I do and I know nothing.
1	Not knowing if I'm going to get the proper care or treatment, and by me not having a good insurance provider you have to deal with it.
1	If I am in a doctors office I have a serious problem so therefore I am going to be anxious to know what my problem is and how serious it is.
1	What makes me feel most anxious about visiting doctors are x-ray scans, and worst of all: shots. I hate needles, and having one in me is something i cannot stand one bit. 
1	I just don't like those kinds of exams no matter who the doctor may be. But my doctor is very gentle and explains everything that he is about to do. No surprises which I hate.
-1	I have always been very nervous when I go to a doctor appointment. So that means when I sit down, and they take my blood pressure, it is sky high.
-1	That theyâre going to find something that means I have a bad disease or issue. Iâll need more medication or surgery. 
-1	I don't worry about visiting the Drs, some tests are not comfortable but they are needed to make a informed medical decision
1	I get worried that I will have to get shots. I've had a phobia of them for a while
1	I have a hard time comprehending people talking at me. I can't focus no matter how hard I try. I usually try remember key words and look up stuff later. They just get so rushed I don't want to be rude and keep interrupting. So I feel useless sometimes. And passed off that after 35 years of the pain no has an explanation.
-1	When your health isn't up to par as far as eating well or exercising , or even sickness you never know what to expect.
1	Nothing in particular causes these feelings. I just do not care for going to a doctor. It's a sense of waiting I dislike.
1	I am most anxious and worried when visiting a doctor because I am fearful that they might find something seriously wrong with me. I am not a hypochondriac but I usually only see a doctor when something is bothering me.
1	Nothing that the doctor did or said, but mostly what I might have wrong with me. I am naturally anxious in these types of situations because I always fear the worst, and getting any sort of negative medical news can be devastating for me. 
-1	I worry some about pain or invasive physical procedures. I worry about something serious being discovered. I worry about encountering new germs and getting sick from visiting the doctor's office!
-1	It makes me feel anxious when I'm in an appointment with him and he just goes away and spends a long time outside, leaving me just waiting, just looking the ceiling and worried about what problems I may have, it's really annoying and not a good action of him.
-1	I don't really feel anxious at all at a doctors office. I feel like I'm doing things that I should probably do more often, but I don't because of fincial reasons.
-1	I just feel anxious sometimes that i may get bad news.  They may find cancer or something serious that i was not expecting that could be life changing.
1	I don't want to have to take my clothes off. Most of the time the basic rule of society is to avoid being ked in front of other people, it's hard to adjust to the idea that it's supposed to be normal to do for medical professiols.
1	I hate it when they arrive late. I'm left sitting in a filthy room, waiting for them to come in and put their cold hands on me. Once she arrives, she is busy logging on to her computer and trying to convince me that I need to go on some blood pressure medication when I've never had high blood pressure in my life. It shoots straight up when I visit the hospital in anticipation of ill treatment. 
-1	Nothing really. My current doctor takes care of me very well.
1	Hoping I don't have anything the doctors surprise me with, the reason I feel that way because you never know what the doctors might say to you
1	I am worried about getting bad news.  I also worry about being embarrassed or feeling awkward.  Usually it is the fear of bad news that worries me the most.
1	I don't trust most doctors especially because I have the cheapest insurance out there. I also don't think most doctors care.
1	Them finding something wrong with me that I have no control over. Finding something in a test and their is no cure.
1	i dont like crowds the last time i went the lady told me to come in the eveing hardly any people .i got there it was so crowded no were to sit anxienty was kicking in bad.went to the window she gave me a clip board to fill out paper work was so nerves i told here i couldnt be in here with all thse people she told the nurse she got me.i had to walk pass everyone it was aweul sat in a room for 2hrs to bee seen.
-1	I think it's just the fear of the unknown. If I'm not going for any particular reason, you never know what they could find that could be potentially bad. It's just a little scary.
1	My biggest fear is that I will receive news contrary to what I'm hoping for.  This doesn't have to be life-threatening, it could be as simple as finding out that a treatment must go on loner than anticipated.  Second to that is anxiety about not remembering to ask the right things or explain myself and my symptoms or condition fully, and then being misdiagnosed or wasting my time and money.
1	I have aches and pains, and I really don't want to stop for surgery right now.  This would be my knees.  I sometimes feel afraid of worse diagnoses.  Plus my doctor doesn't hear me when I say the diabetes test is wrong.  I am diabetic and the numbers don't get good just like that.  Whatev.
-1	WHat makes me feel the most worried when visiting the doctor is that soething will be wrong and i wont have the money or means to afford it. 
1	I hate small talk with people I don't know that well. Hate answering the same questions over and over, especially ones I don't think are their business or that I know how they are going to respond and I also know I am not going to change my behavior. 
-1	Sometime the wait alone can be worrisome.  And if i am coming to grt some test results sometimes i feel a little uneasy hoping for the best outcome
1	The lack of compassion. Most doctors don't care about the patient. They just want to push drugs on you and get you out of the door instead of reviewing your background and the things you have tried that was either successful or failed. We have records for a reason and no one seems to read them. I hate having to start from scratch with each doctor I see. 
-1	Not your normal surroundings and are taken out of your comfort zone. Hoping the results will be good.
-1	I'm not usually either of these things. It's the not knowing prior to the doctors that leaves me anxious. Going there I feel relief.
1	I suppose I sometimes think about the potentially worst case scenario for a given situation, and that may lead to some anxiety. Even if hypothetical, some visits may reveal an unexpected diagnosis, but on the other end of the spectrum everything may be fine. I suppose this is a situation that falls under the whole idea of hope for the best but expect the worst.
1	Their attitude when they tell you to undress. Like it's touchy,touchy, feely time. Even when you tell them somethings not there they still want to touch. 
1	I feel this way about different things that I like to express. I worry about things just like everybody else
-1	i don't like waiting for results especially if it was for something that might be serious. 
1	i am already dealing with a few health issues myself.  so when i go to the doctor i am expecting unpleasant news.  it is like you found this last time now lets see what else we can find. 
1	I worry about all the things that could be wrong with me that I didn't notice, but the doctor might find out. These might be expensive to fix, or embarassing, or something that I was foolish not to notice on my own. I might not be in as good of health as I had thought.
-1	I am always afraid that there will be more medical problems happening that I didn't know about and will have to take even more medications. I am also afraid that treatments will become too expensive for me to pay.
-1	a possibility to hear something bad about my health
-1	New diagnosis worsening diabetic diagnosis something I have no control over.Getting a different dr. Or something worse.
-1	I try to gety the first or second appt of the day because I worry sometimes that the time I am at my doctor will drag out for hours wasting my time that I could be doing other things with my day.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried about visiting the doctor. We discuss my health and any issues I may gave and the best options for me.
-1	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is not knowing whether something serious is happening or not. I fear the worst but am unable to see whether it is true or not.
1	It is great to have a good job of doing this app to be honest you have a good time and aggravation is great for the app to play and play it too much fun game too and it I will be able too soon to be a great game and a good app to be a good game but it I will be playing this app to my son for the app to play with the game play with me the game is very fun to plat with the character and I have the same way as the game and the character is that really fun to be honest and forthright and I have to play it for the app to play with my phone call and phone 
1	The negativity that is expressed when I make an effort to take control of my health. It's not an expression of incompetence, it is trying to make better choices to improve my health and longevity. It's almost frowned upon and is discouraging to the point I am looking for another primary care physician in my network. 
-1	Nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried when I'm visiting the doctor. I know I'm there to get checked out and I'll take the next step as it comes. 
1	I always know there will be a conversation about my weight.  What makes me most anxious though is my blood pressure.  It always reacts when I'm in the doctor's office.  I've tried breathing exercises, visualization, hydrating well and distraction.  They work to a certain extent in calming me down but aren't 100% successful.  It's so annoying!  (My blood pressure is fine everywhere else but the office).  They know me well enough that they take an initial pressure and come back 10 minutes later after I've relaxed.  Totally a psychological response.
1	That some may actually be wrong with me and that the doctor may fine a serious illness that require life changing procedures 
-1	I just worry about my type 2 diabetes. I worry a little that maybe my A1C numbers may not have improved.
-1	If I'm expecting some blood work or test results I sometimes feel a bit anxious at the moment.For the most part it always works itself out
1	Fear of receiving bad news, fear of a painful procedure, fear of expensive medical bill
-1	Some times when an issue that might be serious comes up I do worry until the test results are in then I can make a plan
1	having testing done but not knowing what the results might be which can cause someone to be anxious or concern
-1	nothing it is why I do not visit them visits are suppose to be fun not fearful.  they use technology meant to make people feel sick so why go somewhere that is just meant to kill you
1	I am always concerned about cancer.  I am a colon cancer survivor and always worry that it could become a problem once again for me.
1	I am worried that they will find out I have some horrible disease, or they will give me a medication that causes bad side effects.  I also worry about how much my medical treatments will cost.
1	I dealt with some health issues in the past. So it makes me anxious when I am visiting a doctor for a problem I think I may have. Mostly I am anxious that they will tell me I do in fact have this problem but I am also hopeful that I will not have health issues
-1	nothing make me most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office.  I go to get well and the doctor is the person the I respect and seek answers.
-1	I hate getting needle or shots and really do not like them sprung on me and cuses me a bad anxiety this was the worst when its done at leasty give me warning 
-1	When I am visiting my doctor I am most anxious or worried about my weight and weight related illness or disease.  I have gained a lot of weight since I have last visited the doctors office.
1	By the time I get to the doctor I've often thought of all the most terrible things my symptoms could be and though I know the worry is mostly unfounded, I am still anxious until I'm proven wrong.
-1	I am worried that my doctor will discover a health issue and not be able to adequately explain the cause or offer treatment solutions.
1	I never know what to expect.  It's good that i go but it's extremely stressful knowing they could find something drastically wrong.  There is nothing I like about it.
-1	Being in good health and being able to maintain good health. Not wanting to have any issues with my blood work or health. 
1	My main worries are that my lab work would have shown something or that the doctor is dissatisfied with something in my health. My family has many health conditions that I am predisposed to that I also fear about showing eventually in my life.
-1	I am always concerned about discovering I have a sickness, or being lied to by my doctor in some way
1	I fear that they are going to find something really serious is wrong with me. 
1	ALWAYS AFAIRD SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN I HAVE TESTS, ALWAYS ANXIOUS WHAT THE SCALE WILL SAY.  BUT IN THE END IM ALWAYS FEEL BETTER WHEN I LEAVE AND HAVE MY ANSWERS
-1	I'm not worried just cautious and aware..educated... 
1	I've never liked going to the doctor's. They usually just tell things I already know, but it doesn't make me feel any less uncomfortable. I don't think I'll ever be ready the day they tell me something I won't know about my physical condition
-1	Coming out with some diagnosis that I did not expect. Also coming up with something that would be expensive to treat.
-1	Needles I don't like needles that's about the only thing I would be anxious about other than that I'm just fine 
-1	Weather I have gained too much weight and/or if my high cholesterol levels have increased so that she feels I need to be on a stronger medication. 
-1	Sometimes health issues come out of seemingly nowhere and even though I try to live as healthy as I can, I am concerned that I might have a condition. Family history tells me I could get certain health conditions.
-1	I dont get anxious, hes doing his job and will tell me what he thinks. Yeah there could be bad answers like i got cancer or something but for the most part its not that heavy
1	I am afraid that a recurrence of a disease might occur. I am also allergic to many antibiotics, so any time that I have an infection, I am afraid that I will have a reaction if I am taking a new antibiotic. It is just a relief when the doctor tells me what the problem is and that it can be easily treated. 
1	 cost and what is wrong if  I HAVE TO LOSE TIME FROM WORK . If there is any more cost for theraphy . this is things I can,t pay for because of the health care cost that are not afordably
1	I get worried about the test results and the cost of Healthcare and treatments. It can be stressful. 
-1	If it is not a routine office visit, I would be anxious/worried about what the test results are or what further testing is needed.  Maybe I need to have further tests to find out if anything is wrong, that makes me worried/anxious.
-1	Just knowing my weight and what it'll do to effect my mental state. Also getting any type of diagnoses 
-1	I have a gear of the telling me they have found something wrong with my health. I like my doctor to give me the truth.
1	Just the fact that I'm sick enough to be at the doctor's is enough to make me sick. Then I also start worrying about how I'm going to come up with the money to pay the over-inflated doctors' fees.
1	I get nervous because a lot of people in my family have had cancer, I've been pretty healthy my whole life but I'm afraid my luck will run out and I'll get it too.
1	Going for a doctor visit i think is just normal to be alittle worried or anxious about going, not knowing the things that possibly could arise
1	Being told things I already know or cannot do anything about makes me feel anxious. Also, being examined makes me feel vulnerable. I had an ob once who called me fat the entire time I was pregnt and that I would be obese after giving birth. I knew I had gained a lot of weight but I was eating well and was exercising. Being pregnt I felt like I had no control over being able to actually lose weight until after giving  birth. It ended up I had edema and lost 45lbs in 4 weeks after delivery but ever since sometimes I feel anxious, dread or worrysome when doctors tell me something I already know eapecially if it is something I have little control over or are currently working on.
1	I'm worried they will find something.  I'm worried that the doctor may think less of me because I'm overweight.
-1	The fact that you never know if the doctor is going to find something that is terribly wrong with you or not.
-1	just having to see what they say and do and hoping im healthy also i get nervous when i go and try to hope things turn out well
1	The unknown. Basically not knowing beforehand what the outcome of the visit might be. Also I worry if there are any changes in office staff who I don't know, due to the fact I am not all that confident if the new staff can be discreet.
1	I just feel like it always be bad news because of how I eat because I could do better in some aspects.
-1	I do not feel anxious at any time, I have complete confidence in myself and do not rely on anyone, I have a full life and is very happy
1	that they will find something wrong...or, that they can't help me with the problem I am having. that's all I can think of now.
1	I don't like the waiting room and the waiting and I can sometimes be afraid of what procedures I might need done and to talk to him about it.
-1	When I have symptoms associated with diseases that are tough to treat. I have lung disease so especially worried when I get a infection 
1	I think it has to do with the waiting and all the thoughts and ideas that enter my mind. The longer i am waiting the more harder it is to stay calm. Feeling anxious and wanting to get it over with.
-1	This question is not for me. I look forward to going to the doctor's office. There is no problem that makes me feel bad.
1	Not knowing what the outcome of what i am there for. Telling me things that i am probably not going to want to hear. Being told i am doing something wrong. I feel anxious not knowing the results of tests i have had taken. Prescribing pills that have side effects is nerve wracking.
1	That they will try to give me a shot....I HATE needles. Or that they will tell me something is wrong with me. 
-1	I GET MOST ANXIOUS WHEN I'M HAVING A TEST AND HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE RESULTS.  THE UNKNOWN IS NERVE-RACKING.  
1	He seemed to be in a hurry and it was my first viist to the new Dr. maybe i was just over reacting but that is how i felt.
-1	finding out
1	I think the routine yearly visits do not make me anxious or stressed out. I think if I have to go for something other than a routine visit there is some stress. The stress or anxiety comes from not knowing if there is an issue or what the issue may be. With the diseases in today's society, such as cancer, when you have an unknown health issue there is usually anxiety that comes with it.
-1	I maybe worried or anxious because I don't know what the results of my test maybe or I don't know what the doctor may diagnosis men with. 
1	Noodle's I don't like the pain being told something is wrong in my body really make me worried are just having to visit my doctor 
1	When visiting the doctor office I am most worried about bad news. My family has a history of medical issues that I have managed to avoid
1	I just get anxious since I'm not in good shape and something could go wrong. I would feel embarassed making myself sick for no reason.
-1	When I visit a doctor, I feel slightly anxious sometimes because of the slight chance that the doctor will find an illness based on the standard medical tests give. Also the experience of sitting in a doctors office waiting for long periods of time just waiting for the doctor to visit you.
-1	Just waiting for test results for days instead of getting them the same day of 
1	fearful of results,not knowing is half the battle but learning to trust I God through it all because He is The Doctor of all doctors 
1	Basically that she'll find something I don't want to know about.  Some illnesses I would rather not know about.  e.g. that I am going to die.
1	because i have a few health conditions that are chronic i am always fearful she is going to find something else wrong with me
1	I have generalized anxiety disorder so doctors appts for me while necessary tend to bring stress and anxiety. I become anxious about what my weight will be, what my blood pressure will be (most likely high due to the anxiety) etc. I just tend to be a very anxious person even when there is nothing to really worry about. 
1	The unknown of what they might find from running test.
-1	Sometimes I wonder if they will find something that might be a greater health risk. I wonder if it could be life threatening.
1	The fear of the unknown at times. Awaiting test results anxiously and fearing the worst from them. Just the feeling of being mortal.
-1	Just being there is sometimes unsettling. It is hard to keep bad thoughts out when you are surrounded by sick people and the smell of a doctor's office. However, I know that my health is separate from others, so I try to keep the bad thoughts out by focusing on myself first. I get a little uneasy when waiting for test results or after an exam, but I know that I can get over it quickly.
1	I am concerned that there is the possibility of another stroke in my future. I am currently taking meds that will hopefully prevent that but you never know.
1	That they may find something of greater concern than the reason for my visit, which may lead to more medication, more visits, and more side affects.
-1	My only thoughts is a dislike of tests and being poked as well as prodded, not worries or anxiety really at all
1	That they will press on an issue that I don't feel like looking into or that I don't feel is serious. That they will refuse to continue seeing me if I don't do some kind of testing that I don't want to do. That they will think I'm lying when I say I have no issues. 
1	What makes me most anxious whenever I visit any doctor's office is uncertainty. When going to see a doctor, one never knows what may potentially arise in terms of a negative diagnosis. Thus, I am always a little bit on edge every time.
-1	It is mostly that the experience will be unpleasant, not that the examination will find something wrong.  I'm also a little bit worried about being lectured on my bad habits, or pressured to do something expensive that I don't really need.
1	I have 15 minutes to get all my questions out. If I forget to ask my doctor for something I have to wait until the next visit which is typically three months away. I feel like I'm being rushed when I'm in the office and that causes anxiety.
1	Afraid of having some dangerous condition that may affect my life and work. Thats all nothing more than this
-1	The bill. And if they can actually help
-1	
-1	The waiting process is the worst. And if I feel ill or feel something different I never know what it could be. There are so many things that can be wrong with you, and that is what bothers me the most.
-1	Just the unsureness of what could be wrong with me. 
1	the doctor always seems to find something wrong that requires a referral to one of her specialist buddies
1	What makes me worried when visiting the doctor you never know what they gone tell you what's really wrong with you.
-1	I am really never anxious when I visit my doctor.  Although I may be a little worried about what might be wrong -- she and/or her staff usually are able to put my mind at ease!
1	i feel anxious or worried when the doctors come in and i dont know if im going to have to get a shot or not cause i dont really like needles
-1	I feel anxious or worried when I get blood drawn while being pregnant because there are so many things a child can get. I always worry til the results are in
1	I hate visiting the doctors office because 1) I hate getting on the scale. 2) I hate getting shots or my fingers pricked. 3) The nurses are usually rude. 4) My doctor does not know much about me. I feel like he knows my name but does not care about me or does not care much about my health. 5) My doctor has not helped me get the right type of anxiety medicine that I have been wanting. All of it makes me tired and I just need something that calms me down.
1	I worry about being diagnosed with something that I wasn't expecting or something that I didn't have any warning signs for
1	I'm not sure what they may find. Plus, I dread getting the news that I will need a blood test, which I hate.
-1	finding out that something is more serious than I anticipated. getting sick from others at the doctors office makes me a little anxious as well
1	The bill for no help. A bill just so they can shove pills at me. A bill.. When the doctor doesn't want to listen, doesn't actually hear what I'm saying. Just push me out with pills.
1	Both sides of my family have a history of cancer.  I don't really liked to be touched, and I hate the way I look.    
-1	where might my blood pressure be. I do have some white coat tension when they measure that the first time but then when they measure it a few minutes later it is much better
1	When I go, I sometimes feel like they may give me bad news that I am not prepared to hear or do not have enough money to cover 
1	TODAY to get together soon though you don't want you so very sorry for your birthday and she said that I am going to bed early and go back to work tomorrow night at my house
1	I don't like them picking at me and don't want them to find something they think they have to treat.
-1	I usually know what I am there for, or I have an idea of what my issue could be. I am able to put my trust in the doctor seeing me and I feel confident they will diagnose me with the correct issue. I'm sometimes anxious about what will happen, since I don't know ahead of time. Mostly I just want answers and relief, so I'm more than willing to let them do their job and help me.
1	When visiting the doctor's office I am always filled with anxiety and dread due to the environment always giving me that feeling since childhood. It probably roots back to a fear of needles and too much media, but it still affects me to this day. Today, it would instead be a fear of being diagnosed with some incurable disease or being told that I can no longer do the things I enjoy in life due to some pain or injuries. Outside of that, a routine doctor's visit is normally only filled with worry on the drive there. I usually leave feeling more ensured and happier than when I came in.
1	I am anxious that my doctor will criticize my lifestyle or my habits without seeing me as a person. I am worried that my doctor will not listen to me. I am worried that something will be wrong with me.
1	the blood test an how they are going to come back when dealing with cancerit to wait can be very nerving 
-1	Nothing worries me about going to the doctor. I live for my kids and I'm healthy. When God calls I'm ready to go.
-1	I have not felt anxious so far because I have not had any serious health problems. Lllllllllllllllllmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Mmmmmmmmmmm!mmm!!!
-1	When visiting a doctor's office I feel anxious about any health situations that might be brought up when having a discussion with my doctor. I need to know that everything will be fine and that a serious illness will not occur.
1	finding out something bad
-1	I never feel that way. If something is wrong, she will tell me what the problem is. We will work on a solution together.
-1	I don't like drawing blood. Last time I went to the doctor they stuck me three times and couldn't get any because I was so tense. They told me to go to a lab and I refuse to, even if I probably should see my lab results. 
-1	
-1	Not knowing what to expect regarding my health worries me sometimes.  I rarely  become anxious about anything  except for wanting to find out what the problem is and get it solved in a timely manner. 
1	I am a generally anxious person and any interaction with a doctor makes me feel uncomfortable. I am uncomfortable with my body and with the shape I am in so that plays into it as well. Mostly, I just feel like a freak and my problems are unusual or like the doctors are judging me and the shape that I am in. 
-1	When I have something wrong and the doctor takes a long time to figure out what it is. Though I suppose the worst is worrying about the cost of the procedure.
-1	The initial first visit for an issue I am having bothers me most. Without any knowledge from them yet I get very anxious. When they tell me the diagnosis I get worried. 
-1	It makes me feel worried that he tells me that I have some disease, that gives me a lot of pain if he told me that
-1	I usually get good reports for the most part. Unknown is always worrisome. Something can happen that is unexpected and you can take things for granted. Health is always one of those things. My doctor does a good job of not keeping me in the dark about anything but you always worry about the what if. Mortality is a scary concept. Worry about what happens to my family is something goes wrong. Worry about how to pay large medical bills even though I have good insurance. No matter how prepared you think you are I don't think anything can prepare you for a very bad medical report.
-1	Getting test results,the waiting part can be long some times .It makes me anxious and nervous most times
-1	I don't worry much when visiting the doctor.
1	Fear of the unknown. Waiting for a diagnosis. Waiting for test results when I have a new ailment, not just routine yearly tests.
1	The results maybe a bad. I fear that it will cause all types of questions of weather or not if I am fit to live.
-1	Having questions that won't get answered, but they usually always are answered well. Also, I always worry about my weight, as to whether I've gained any. 
-1	I think what makes me feel the most anxious is what they might find. I worry a lot about my health and always fear the unknown. 
-1	Nothing really makes me feel anxious at all when I go to the doctor suprisingly I have always had good checkups and no major health issues. 
1	i would feel anxious if  my doctor was not worried about my appointment  and didnt show up on time. i have noticed that he is on time.
-1	my quarterly lab results sometimes may make me feel anxious. As I get older I sometimes worry about something urgent like cancer.
1	What makes me more anxious and worried is that I don't know what they will find wrong with me.  Even though I feel find.  I don't like surprises.
-1	Concerned about my over all health and diagnosis that he gives me, but more concerned about his nurses following through with scheduling and medical insurance.
1	Getting some sty infectious disease or being given news about some complication with regards to my health. I really don't trust doctors or visiting them for any reason. I try to stay relatively healthy to avoid having to go to one.
1	When I am at a doctors office I am worried because I don't know what will happen. They do not converse very well about the procedures they are following. They may perform these procedures every day and seem to forget that not everyone knows what the procedure they are doing entails.
1	Health problems for me tend to get found when things go wrong. I have had serious health problems. Ever examition feels like it could lead to a new treatment, a new bill, a new health concern. 
-1	I am usually not very anxious about going and seeing a doctor.  Seeing a new doctor for the first time always makes me anxious or if I'm worried about my current symptoms and her diagnosis but generally, I'm not anxious about seeing my current doctor when I need to.
1	All the unknowns and what ifs.  Being afraid of how I have taken care of myself poorly will affect my outcome. 
1	It is only when I have to have women issues addressed that I feel uncomfortable. It is all in my mind because I know these doctors have seen it all before and I am nothing different
-1	That I may have some dread disease that cannot be cured or will take a log of treatments to cure.  That the chronic condition that I have has gotten worse or something is prescribed that I cannot accomplish
-1	nothing really. it is what it is nothing to be concerned about. 
-1	That I will be told I have some terrible condition. No one wants to hear bad news and more often than not it can come from a doctor. 
1	If I have something wrong with me that is concerning me that I want looked at, yes I feel anxious. If I am just going for a yearly wellness visit, I am at ease.
-1	I don't like shots or blood drawing but I know they are necessary so I endure them.  I know that these are necessary for my overall health.
-1	If I have a real issue that is not just pedantic-like complaining---that it will not be thoroughly dealt with due to insufficient time alone. That would be some mega bullshit. It's why Im trying to learn a lot as to how I can effectively help myself through altertive medicine options such as aryuvedic. 
-1	nothing at all, i am always relaxed , there is nothing to be afraid of, besides i trust my doctor very much.
-1	Not knowing what is going on or what problems might be occurring in my body. 
1	During my last pregnancy, OBs would have me stay overnight in the hospital for non-stress testing, simply because they wanted to spend time with their families and didn't want to wait around for the hour it would have taken to observe me. Also, the nurses would tell me to drink water so they wouldn't order an IV, but the doctors always forced me to have an IV, even when I was in the hospital for a short time, drinking water the entire time. Once, the nurse tried to put in an IV three times, permanently damaging my left arm. When she gave up on my left, and starting stabbing my right arm, I was scared I wouldn't be able to use either of my hands the next day. Anyway, all of that was unnecessary and when someone is pregnant in particular, in the US, the doctors only care for the fetus, not the mother. This is why the US has such a high maternal mortality rate...this was told to me by a nurse and public health professional.
-1	I am anxious more than worried because I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  I am always anxious while waiting for the blood results
1	Not knowing what they are going to say about my health, I'm not the healthiest person, so I don't really know how they are going to feel about my the way I look and how I go about my day to day life.
1	"Feeling as though the physician doesn't have the time to ""deal"" with you.  Questions not answered, followup not proper.  "
-1	that he may find something wrong with me that may be life altering, and I would have to go for extensive tests or see a specialist, or go out of town to another dr.
-1	nothing makes me feel anxious or worryed when im visiting the doctor because my doctor is very good at what she dose so i dont need to wory about anything.
-1	Mostly it's the cost of going to the doctor. I don't normally expect the worst as far as my health is concerned.  
1	I feel most anxious and worried in a doctor's office because I am uncomfortable in a setting where I feel vulnerable and alone. I don't like one on one settings with someone I barely know. I don't want to be uncomfortable talking about something I don't want other people to know about, or the doctor having to examine me naked.
1	What makes me most anxious is visiting the doctors office in general. Even if I don't go for a bad reason, and just a check up, I still get a bit anxious.
-1	I do not like to visit the doctor because even when there is nothing wrong they try to medicate you to death.  It seems like they are just looking for a reason to give you all kinds of medicine that is not really needed.
1	That he will give me bad news about my health. I am worried about Cancer as i have had several friends and family members die from it
-1	The thing that always gets me going is the blood pressure cuff.  It gets really tight around my arm, and I've always hated that.  But actually seeing the doctor is usually pleasant and problem-free. 
-1	what makes me more anxious or worry is knowing if i'm good or if i'm gonna need take pills, have an illness that is hard to cure.
1	i am always worried that the doctor would tell me i have cancer or some other awful disease . the worst case  scenario is always in the back of my mind, im often a little anxious at the doctors office.i worry also about catching a virus from a previous patient because alot of people who go to the doctors office are very sick.
-1	There's always the worry that they will randomly find something serious that you did not have. I feel that everyone has this worry.
1	usually what they may or may not find. You never know what problems you could have until you get an examition. I usually trust their skills and judgment and that they'll do their job well though. 
1	I never know what they will find wrong with me.  Or if they will find a cyst and want to do more tests that cost more money. 
1	Mainly the wait but also don't want to really know if I end up getting cancer etc that can be scary 
-1	The discovery of a new ailment that would lead to new treatments and medicines with uncertain outcome.  You always want to be healthy, but sometimes as you age you are not sure whether something may pop up unexpected.  Also, as you age the number of tests and labs seem to increase. This leads to a time of worry and anxiety to get the results back.  Hopefully, the doctor can put your mind at ease if relevant that the tests are just a precaution. So you do not have to worry while waiting.  Otherwise, you can just try to lead the healthiest life possible and go in to the office confident that you are ok.
-1	I just don't like the king wait sometimes and it makes me anxious because I am rest to go most of the time 
-1	I get worried and anxious when I'm not sure if my problems will require some kind of procedure or if I will get a diagnosis I don't want to hear (like having cancer). The doctor herself doesn't make me feel uncomfortable or nervous, it is the consequences related to my problems that make we worried.
1	Having to get shots or taking scans or tests. They also scare me when they say they have bad news to give me
-1	It makes me nervous. I hate weighing in. I do not like that sick people germs in the office. I don't like having to take my clothes off and get in that paper gown. It usually ends up ripping and that's always uncomfortable when that happens. Noone likes to wait to hear if there's bad news. It's always uncomfortable even when I like my doctor. It could be a head game for all I know?
1	I mostly feel anxious when my doctor has provided me with previous bad news, like a high blood pressure result 
1	I tend to worry a great deal about the bill.  This makes me overall anxious of the types of tests, etc.  When I am going for a specific issue - as opposed to a check up - I am often a little anxious about what the issue will be.  Will it cause me pain?  Can I recover quickly and easily or will it be on going?  Will it be expensive to treat?
-1	I always get anxious when I go to the doctor because I don't go there very often. It not a bad anxious it don't cause me problems or ruin my day 
1	I feel anxious when I walk into a new doctor office. I also hate going to some doctors because they are slow or way too quick in my opinion.
-1	I guess just worrying that something will turn up. That the doctor will find something that is very bad. I would say that is mostly what I worry about.
1	They talk in suspense like every single thing is bad news. Sometimes they mess up with blood work and need more blood leaving me thinking they can't do their job
1	If I don't know what's wrong with me I always worry it's goign to be something serious. Otherwise if I go in for something simple I don't worry.
-1	Four years ago I was found to have Afib.  So since then I am more concerned about the cost of meds; their possible side effects; and having tests done.  I have had a cardioversion done 2 times and the afib has come back and because of the pain afterwards (it does not hurt at the time because you're given anesthesia) I do not want to have it done again.  
1	I'm passed the point where I receive good news at the doctor
-1	I am worried that I am going to get bad news or poor test results.
1	The hope that nothing bad comes out of the exam.  I go to an exam if I think something might need to be checked, or for bloodwork ect.  Its always a worry that something will maybe be wrong.

-1	I rarely feel anxious however I do become apprehensive if I am there for some sort of diagnosis regarding a symtom I have no idea what it could be caused by
1	I experience this as many times. When I want to saw the doctor, at that time he come to office too late or leave. This behavior is the worst behavior of the Doctor's attitude. This is very wrong action. 
1	                             I feel worried when I don't know what to expect.  I don't know what the doctor might find wrong.

1	I am considered about my taste of health and an uneasy as to what new concerns might popup when visiting the doctor's office. I get worried about what the test results might show and am somewhat apprehensive about get the results back.
1	I fear getting bad test results that could potentially cause me to have to take medication. I currently don't take any medication and I don't want to have to take any in the future.
-1	The diagnosis. I have very unhealthy habits and when I have aches or pains in those areas I always assume the worst. But after my check up it's usually nothing or something minor that can be taken care of with prescription medications. 
-1	I'm worried that he will tell me some bad news, I'm always feel like it will be something I didn't spot on my own.
1	What makes me feel anxious in the doctors office is the seclusion and the thought of something going wrong.

1	Cancer runs in my family. So I am worried that the doctor will find a lump or a growth somewhere on my body when I get a physical(even though I am in near-perfect health)
1	I dread getting shots and blood work done. I have always been scared of the doctors as a child. I just hate everything about it makes me feel self conscious..... 
1	I really get anxious when I think about my labs coming out bad. The doctor always seems like it is my fault they are coming out bad even though I'm trying my hardest to improve my health.
-1	That I will only bring important things to discuss with him.  That I listen to what he says and follow his orders.
1	What's would make me feel that way would be the nit knowing what news I will be getting . Faking and knowing something bad is about to be sad is scary and I wouldn't be sure if I would be ready to hear anything like that .

1	Concern that there may be something severely wrong with me.  I also would hate to get blood drawn. 
1	I am often worried about whether I will be treated with respect, more than anything. Or that the doctor I see will dismiss whatever I am struggling with. I also struggle a little with blood draws-- I get incredibly faint. Sometimes I am nervous for my own health, but most of the time if I'm not seeing my primary care doctor, I'm just rolling the dice as to whether I'll get someone rude and disinterested or someone who's an actual professional.
-1	Nothing makes me worried when I go to see my doctor. I am anxious to see them tho. The wait is probably the worst thing about it.
1	Getting an uncertain or negative diagnoses would cause worry or anxiety. For myself or a loved one. THe feelings are the same

-1	I believe everyone feels a little anxious when seeing a doctor (or dentist or any other medical professional) just because of the situation.  If I know I'm going to be given lab test results, for example, I will be a little anxious even if I don't think they will be bad.

-1	
1	What makes me feel most axioms is the prospect of being sick and the potential threat to my health, well being and life overall.

-1	When requests blood work done and effecting expecting the exultresults or having to use the needles to test blood
1	"My doctor does my ""well woman"" exams. I don't think that any woman is entirely comfortable with that. My doctor has a good personal manner of dealing with people, though.  I think any time that I put on a gown with no back on it and nothing underneath, I am not going to be at my most confident."
-1	You just don't know what to expect sometimes with so many different things in the world today.  Your health is very important and you need to make sure that your body is working well.
-1	How my Blood Pressure will register (I take an Rx for it), sometimes my weight is a little higher that I want--just general things.
1	I don't like needles so I get really paranoid of having blood drawn or getting a shot. And the occasionally long wait to get test results back is an uncomfortable time.

-1	I feel most anxious that I might have something that I wasn't aware of before visiting the doctor regardless of how careful I think I've been.

-1	I JUST FUCKING TOLD YOU THAT I DO NOT FEEL ANXIOUS THIS SURVEY IS FUCKING JOKE ASD FAGH JKLQWERTYUI OP

-1	I am not anxious or worried when i visit my Dr's office. I'm calm I'm even and I'm in good hands. I trust them all
-1	I am worried that i will receive bad news about my health. Or he can't help me with an issue i may have
-1	I feel most anxious or worried when I have a symptom that could possibly be something serious. I am somewhat anxious when having a physical checkup because of not knowing what he is going to do, or possibly because I know what he is going to do. It makes me a little anxious when he or the nurse takes my blood pressure, for fear that it will be too high. I suppose one of the things that makes me most anxious is when a doctor asks me to describe my condition in detail, and I have trouble putting it into words or saying how frequently something occurs.
1	I am always scared to hear something is wrong. But I also don't think they are thorough enough or take my concerns seriously 
-1	My greatest fear is that they will not listen or take serious my myriad of chronic and acute illnesses. They seem to often deal with my main issue that I came in for, but don't want to give me the time to deal with the other smaller yet still importan reasons I came in.
-1	Not really feeling either or unless I have a major issue with my body.    My doctors make me feel at ease & very comfortable at all times..

1	What makes me feel most worried anxious is when my doctor is rushing me to see another pather...this is when he overbooks.
-1	I just do not like visiting the doctor.  This brings worry to me and makes me anxious.  also, I am an anxious person anyway so I stay anxious.
-1	I am most anxious when having my gynecological checkup.  I have a family history of breast cancer, and I have not always been financially able to have all the tests they wanted me to have.  
-1	The not knowing is worst but as soon as I get there all is good. So never be scared when you go to your doctor
1	I AM JUST HOPING THAT I AM HEALTHY AND NOTHING IS FOUND, IT MAINLY DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF DOCTOR I AM SEEING AND WHAT I AM THERE FOR
1	I worry he/she won't believe anything I say nor takes the time needed to diagnose a condition or illness I may have
-1	I am always afraid that my doctor will find an ailment or serious illness. These worries are exacerbated by the fact that that I am a 65 year old cancer survivor and cancer medication is notorious for causing side effects.  For a while, seemingly, my doctor found some health problem with most visits.  This has made me a little anxious about test results and examinations.
-1	
1	because you never know what she is going to tell me about my health and i might have to cut out ome of my favorite activities

-1	I am not anxious or worried at all when I visit the doctor's office. There is not point in it. If something is wrong then worrying about it isn't going to help the situation get any better.
-1	I always feel that they might give me some bad news while i'm there. along with something else I really don't want to hear at all
-1	Wondering what the outcome of my exam would be. Imagining if there is something wrong and what needs to happen next.
1	The wait, because I do not like waiting very much; I think many have a bit of anxiety at this point, nothing to the extreme.
-1	Whenever I am worried about visiting a doctor it is due to what I am in there for. I am worried something could be wrong with me and it will be a long and expensive process if something is considerably wrong with me. 
1	I do not feel comfortable in doctors office in general. It is the way I am. I watch for anything the doctor says that my end up costing me money.
-1	The expentancy of news, the fear of having a desease or having something wrong with me without a cure. 
1	That they will tell me something bad that I do not want to hear, that I am not in good health. I worry that it will be something that I haven't been doing right. 
1	Being told that something is wrong, especially if its something i may have not yet considered.  I dont like the unknown and if i have an idea of what im dealing with i can prepare and figure out whats next, but im no dr so there is always the possi bility something will be truly wrong.
1	I am typically most anxious or worried about the results of different lab whether its the standard panel, STD screenings, and the pap smear results.  I take pride in making sure that I am as healthy as possible, but the results from lab almost always have me concern.  
-1	I think I'm more anxious about not finding the cause for my pain or injury.  There is nothing more discouraging than being shuffled between doctors who say there us nothing wrong with you based on their specialty and sending you to the next doctor.  In the meantime, the condition worsens, and you can either become so discouraged that  you give up going to the doctor and try to self medicate, or you lie and say you're cured.  
-1	Whether I have managed to improve my situation since the last visit. Or had it gotten worse. Also, has anything come up in my body..
1	Finding something that was unexpected.  Going in for a routine exam and getting bad news would be the worst. 
1	They will tell me i have a disease or condition that will affect me for the rest of my life and thats scares me.
-1	Recently I worry more about if the doctor will accept my health insurance, than if there is something wrong with me. Also, I'm worrying how much of the bill is my responsibility and how much insurance's.
-1	Wondering how much the payment will be. Wondering what I might need to solve my issues. Wondering if I could get help for my migraines or would I be stuck with them.
1	I think what makes me feel the most anxious and worried is that I might have a serious condition or disease. Sometimes being examined feels a bit uncomfortable as well.
1	I'm worried about embarrassment, or that something is wrong with me.
1	I feel the most anxious about being weighed or having my blood pressure taken and it is high.
-1	The only reason i would be worries or anxious would be if i was getting test results. I would be worried of the negative outcome and hope for good news.
-1	Finding out about new health issues that I may have developed or hearing about new treatments that I don't want.
-1	What they have to tell me or if I have to take a different medication.  Also , if I have to get a shot or something .
-1	Sometimes I do when I'm not sure what is bothering me. I get that little sense of dread that it could be something bad.
-1	I feel that I will receive false or very bad news from my doctor. I have seen doctors give patients wrong information which led to worsened health. 
1	I feel most anxious about medical exams because I've experienced many life threatening medical issues that have required emergency surgery. I am fearful of death, and also of pain, and having to spend months of recovery. Also the loss of income, and the ability to provide for my family. 
-1	I am not typically anxious about visiting the doctor's office.
1	I feel worried because I think about the possibility that I have an untreatable disease or a long term disease that will affect my life
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office.
1	Something might come up. Maybe it will be caught early, or maybe something terrible will be detected like cancer.
1	I get scared of what will be bad news.wich i know is need to be heard.but its being judged secretly.
-1	I'm a pretty calm person and I don't get too nervous - but when at the doctor's for a problem I do sometimes have in the back of my head the idea that I might be really sick, or he might find a problem, or I might hear difficult news.  So I get a little uneasy and uncomfortable sometimes due to the unknown but not too bad.
-1	I'm a very self-conscious person, so sometimes I worry that something might be wrong with me. That's really the only anxious fear I ahve.
-1	I am not usually worried when I go to the doctors office.. I have had so many issues over my life time it doesn't bother me to go anymore.
-1	I think that what makes me worried the most is that they might  find something really wrong. 
-1	If I believe beforehand that there is something seriously wrong with me BEFORE I talk to the doctor, then I might feel anxious as I wait to see him and talk to him. But that is rare. I  do not usually feel anxious while I am talking to the doctor. I usually just let him examine me and listen closely  to what he tells me. But I do not tend to overreact to things. If he , on the other hand, told me Ihave some deadly disease that cannot be treated, obviously I would feel rather anxious.
1	Taking my. Mood pressure. White coat syndrom causes blood pressure to rise more than usual. Also hate checking weight in doctor office. 
-1	nothing makes me anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, I feel safe because i know I'm with someone that will work towards my well being 
1	I am most anxious that they will find something that is incurable and will end my life as I know it prematurally.
1	The only anxious feeling I have about a visit to the doctor is getting the appointment done and over with. I be very worried about visiting a doctor because I'm unsure of my health and I don't wanna hear any bad news. I know it's better to go and get checked out but I'll be worried to hear anything I don't wanna hear. 
-1	That something severe is wrong with me
1	I usually feel anxious when going to the doctor because I am afraid of what could be wrong with me. I worry about an illness or something and that it might be more serious than it actually appears.
-1	I never feel anxious or worried when it comes to doctor appointments because i know that everything is okay.
1	I'm usually worried that I will get bad news. I get anxious that they will tell me something is very wrong. Or if I don't know the doctor I get scared that they won't treat me right. 
1	Mostly the outcome. I also worry about medications, how much they cost, the side effects, how they will effect me. I also worry about my weight.
1	If my doctors find something unusual if i visit them that makes me worried. Once they find out that my certain blood level is not in sync i can't just ignore them most of the time they look after their patient. Also just going to visit doctors itself is worrisome. The thought it self will make me thinking if they find out something going on with me and then i have to go through other diagnostics taste. That takes time, money and more stress for my family.
-1	The only thing that worries me is that I might have something seriously wrong with me. Since I had a life-threatening illness about 10 years ago --involving my heart- this isn't an unreasonable fear.
1	I am worried that they will find something wrong that I was unaware of and will result in a significant financial investment from me to treat. Our healthcare system is a joke when it comes to how much medicines cost. Your health is held for ransom by the drug companies and it's disgusting. 
-1	It is the waiting time when you get to the office. Getting right in would make me feel less anxious there since I am getting in and learning of any issues as soon as I get there. 
-1	Not knowing what the problem is that you are seeing the doctor for.  SOmetimes small little pains can lead to big problems.  That will definitely cause me to be anxious and worried.
-1	There is very little that makes me anxious.  Doctors dont make me anxious at all.  I just don't enjoy hearing possible bad news.
1	Generally I am worried about the possibility of needing to get my blood drawn, as I have a severe phobia of injections.
-1	Right now I have nothing to fear. I did get a diagnosis of high blood pressure but that was due to my job and then eventual termination of said job. I'm also unhappy in my relationship so that may caused a spike.
-1	The only thing that ever worries me is of there is actually something seriouslyâwrong with me, but none times out of ten, I'm always find
1	depends on why I am there.  If I have something wrong with me and don't know how it will be fixed, that can make me anxious.  or if my observation of the office environment, or the people working there sets me on edge.
1	Usually I am in doctorâs office because itâs a last resort and I canât fix whatever is happening to me so by that point I am pretty worried about what is happening to my body and what may happen in the future.
-1	Sometimes I may feel that way but it is not because of the actual visit is. It is more because I have to be there in the first place, meaning something is really going on with me and I am anxious to find out what it is.
-1	I would feel most anxious when I have been experience unknown pain and I can't explain why and I am waiting to see what the doctor say's it is
-1	When the doctor finds something in my body that she thinks might be the beginning of a major problem which needs further examination 
-1	I fear having something really serious be discovered about my symptoms. For example, a few years ago I had frequent migraines and my doctor suggested that I get further testing down just to stay on the safe side. I was afraid there was a tumor. 
-1	I feel anxious when I have a sudden medical issue that presents itself that needs to be seen by the doctor. Also, when I'm having an unusual test done, like a biopsy, I feel very anxious.

1	I'm worried or anxious because of the unknown. Not knowing what the doctor may find makes me anxious. I dread having to take medication for an illness. The side effects sometimes causes a whole set of new problems 
1	none to be honest i feel the same and i feel like i would be not worried at all visiting the doctors offices
-1	I have high blood pressure and I don't like it to be high.  Once I know it's not high, I am good to go.
-1	I don't generally feel anxious when visiting the doctor because I'd rather find out whether or not something is wrong with me than remain in the dark. If I have to go in to have a procedure of some sort, however, then I do feel nervous just because of the uncertainty of the outcome.
1	They will rush me through. There is a large population here. In my small town growing up everyone knew everyone. I went to church with my doctor. Here all they want to know is what kind of insurance you have. Usually they don't take mine. I just don't go and treat myself. I avoid vaccinations and unnecessary treatments. 
-1	Waiting in line, hoping I didn't actually break something. In my wife's case, it was questioning who made the decision to have an OBGYN look at what turned out to not me a problem. I also don't like receiving bad news, which thankfully I largely didn't.
-1	I might get bad news or something unforeseen will rise and i might not be able to handle it. The thought of getting cancer has always frightened me. Even getting a dangerous virus has always scared me.
-1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious is the thought that something might be wrong with me.  It has nothing to do with my doctor or how he performs checkups or physicals.
1	I am just funny about people touching me so I get anxious about that.  Also that something might be found that I don't want to find out about.  Just the whole process of having to be examined.
-1	I'm worried about their demeanor. I'm worried about being diabetic. I'm worried about having to spend a significant amount of time in the hospital
1	I do not feel comfortable going to the doctor's office. Health issues make me feel tense and anxious. I am not sure about the reason. Probably is the possibility of finding something new about my health.
1	I worry about what the outcome may be.  If something is seriously wrong with me.  (like getting cancer for instance)
1	Well, in these circumstances I'm somewhat apprehensive and think that maybe there will be something wrong with me that I wouldn't like at all. So that's about it.....
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office is think if I'm going to feel any pain or any discomfort.
-1	I rarely feel either anxious or worried when I visit my doctor. The only time I feel that way is when I have to make an appointment to discuss my tests. Fortunately, this has happened only once.

-1	If there is a situation that I am to see the doctor about, I might get a little anxious that the doctor is going to tell me something that I don't want to hear.

1	Having someone exam my body and tell me that I'm unhealthy. 
-1	I do not feel any worry because I know I can control what I can control land I understand how to handle and control my life. Those feelings do not come about for me.
1	That they will find something really serious. I never want to hear any words like cancer etc. I also fear getting a lecture about my bad habits like smoking because they tend to blame everything on that.
-1	That it takes too much time to go to the doctor's. Terrible.
-1	The only way I will be anxious during a doctor visit is when the physical feeling in my body is overwhelmingly uncomfortable.
1	It's just uncomfortable having your body examined by a stranger. Waiting in the room, sometimes half ked, is really not my idea of fun. I am afraid of being judged by the doctor or afraid of finding out some sort of bad news about my health.
1	It's a personal anxiety that is provoked when an extended period of time has passed between sessions, and I have to say that it doesn't help when they start asking directly related questions back to back.
1	When I'm extreme sick I'm just anxious about what they are going to say. Usually at my doctor/hospital they have a set diagnosis for everything you come in with 
-1	Always worry something could be found that could change your life forever if I ended up with an illness and have to go through treatments or surgery!
1	I feel most afraid that the doctor will gloss over what I am saying and not try to understand. I then cannot be reassured by anything said.
1	I don't like going to the doctor because I don't like them finding different things that they never found before about me.The price goes up and the people get unkind.

1	I'm worried that something may be wrong with me!
-1	
-1	The only thing I fear is the wait. This makes me anxious because I do not like to waste time. Sometimes this can be the worst part of the doctor visit.

-1	That I'm going to have an underlying problem that is going to be a long-term health ailment. My biggest fear is that I go in for one problem, but my Dr. discovers something more horrendous. 
-1	I would only feel anxious if I had grave physical symptoms.
-1	Not a lot. It would have to be something quite serious that i'm concerned about for me to be nervous or worried. I don't recall the last time i was worried about an issue i was having to be honest. The only thing i may worry about is the cost of an antibiotic and if it's available in generic form. 
-1	That she might find a new problem or that a proposed solution to a problem isn't working. That she will have to increase the medications I am using or add additional ones.
-1	I don't want to feel anxious, but there is something about me that is turally anxious. I know this about myself because my BP reading inflates every time I go for a checkup.  I feel I am this way even in social situations although no one takes my BP under those circumstances.  
1	I worry when I go to see my doctor about my weight and how to handle it considering its something I havent really dealt with even though my doctor has given me the tools to deal with it.I worry about my lab results concerning my a1c results since they are a direct result of my diabetes health.

1	Well usually when I go its cause theres something wrong with me thats causing a pretty bad ailment and so I already go into it expecting something bad. I can be a bit of a hypochondriac and that may play on my experience a little bit. But then its also because a lot of the procedures they must do to check you out, are uncomfortable or downright painful. And sometimes, doctors tell you that there is something they found that concerns you and they get you super worried, when they shouldnt say anything until test results come back.

1	i never know what to expect them to find. generally by the time i see a doctor i am really very sick and in pain and i figure the worst. even just regular check ups make me nervous because generally i will have to wait an hour and sometimes longer to even see the doctor and i get nervous if i have nothing to occupy my time. i want to pase, get up and down. then all the questions the doctor asks me makes me forget the questions i want to ask him (even if i write them down). the whole experience just makes me a wreck unless i am so sick that i just can't care anymore because anything is better than what i am feeling at the time. just fix it!
-1	Really the worst part about it to me, is taking the time out of my day to go and wait for a pointless exam that I have no reason to be examined in the first place. It's just a huge interruption every time it comes up, because its usually completely unnecessary.
-1	I actually never get anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office. The doctor is there to make sure I am well. There is no hidden motive involved. They provide a service and I am generally alright with the service I personally receive. 
-1	It's not so much the doctor visit that concerns me.  It's the lab results.  As I am under aggressive treatments for my Cancer, my lab numbers fluctuate with various modalities and medications and that gives me modest concern.
-1	I just do not like any medical appointments. Not even dentist. There is not anything else to say I just don't like them.
-1	That I might be diagnosed with an incurable or deadly disease, if I am having new or strange symptoms. 
-1	Health matters are always something to worry about. If we dont have our health then what do we have? My doctor was very open when alerting me to things I really need to worry about and address
-1	Doctors that are detached from the patient are worrisome and I have run into this a few times. Their mind appears to be somewhere else
1	Sometimes I am worried that they are going to tell me something that I don't want to hear. Something devastating like a disease or something.
-1	Nothing really just get a little anxious when i ho there no specific reason that i can think of usually everything goes good and never had any problems there
1	Nothing makes me so. I believe in God's providence in everything including my own health.
-1	What the diagnosis will be. If there is anything wrong with me. 
1	I'm usually worried that I'll find out something negative about my health, due to the poor choices I've made in terms of diet and exercise. 
1	"I worry that the doctor might prescribe me medicines just because I went in for a consultation. In other words, the doctor could have very well known that the medicines are just a temporary solution and that my illness would have healed on its own, given some time and rest. Instead of saying ""Go take rest"", he would be forced to prescribe medicines just because he is a doctor! I am not scared of injections. However, I become uneasy and anxious of intrusive procedures like inserting swabs into your nose, throat, ears etc. I am anxious that the doctor might be a racist and would harm me in some way or the other based on my appearance or ethnicity."
-1	The arriving before time and waiting way past time to finally be seen. The medical bill afterwards and cost of prescriptions.
1	Just not knowing what the doctor  is going to tell me when I have something wrong that I don't know what it is
-1	Usually nothing.  I have reviewed my most recent lab work and all my doctors' summaries so there aren't any surprises in that area.  I guess that during the exam he might find something new and irregular, especially with my heart.
-1	I am usually worried about the results of a blood test and just making sure my numbers are okay in general.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office.  I feel at ease with my physician.  I trust what she says.
-1	I do be feeling anxious because I get nervous of the results of the test and always hope its not really bad that will mess up my future.
1	Any time I get routine checkups or blood tests, I start worrying that they will find something wrong with me.
-1	None so far as I have been taking care of my health on my own. My routine medical checkup has been good and when I do need to see my physician periodically it was more on getting the flu shots or some mild illness.
-1	I absolutely hate that most doctors base your general health on the BMI index, when not everyone's shape is cookie cutter, or fits the categories. I get anxious when doctor's bring up my weight, because rather than argue with them about it, I just let them talk.
-1	Being in a position of vulnerability makes me most nervous in a doctor's office, specifically if I'm an exposed or unknowledgeable. I feel somewhat at the mercy of the doctor.
-1	I get worried about there being something really wrong with me. I get scared that it will be worse that it seems.
-1	Because a lot of these doctor's give me a funny feeling that they just don't care if I die. Because they don't give me a great check up.
1	never know what else they may find concerning my health/afraid of needles/don't care to take medicines
1	Thinking about whether I can explain my condition exactly or not is one thing that makes me anxious. Expressing condition is difficult. Also, when getting result of test, I will be anxious because there is no grantee if the result is good one. Especially after having PAP test and mammography, I become so anxious to hear the result.
-1	The only thing I would feel anxious about are needles.  Outside of that, I trust my doctor and the advice he's given me has helped me to be very healthy.  I feel no need to be anxious when seeing my doctor.  
1	What may seem minor or unimportant to me could be something she wants checked out. I have to let her be the one in charge and let my worries and anxieties go by the wayside.
-1	The only time I have ever been anxious when seeing a doctor was when I was pregnt. I would be worried they would find something wrong with the baby. Other than that, I usually have an idea of what could be wrong, why I'm seeing the doctor, and probably outcomes, and am as ready as I can be for dealing with it.
1	Mostly just wondering if theres anything wrong with you that you don't know about, and the possibility of it being something dangerous like cancer. Everyone has a fear of uncertainty that makes them uncomfortable and nervous.
1	I'm worried that I'm going to receive some bad news or be told something that I know but don't want to face 
-1	My health is pretty good so there isnât anything that I am really concerned about. I guess just getting my yearly physical. I hate getting that every year.
1	I am always afraid that they are going to find something very serious or something that needs a lot of medical attention and I have no health insurance.
1	It is the idea of trusting this person to be knowledgeable and willing to admit if they do not know an answer and then be willing to do the research.  In my father's case, I was on the West Coast and he was in Florida.  His doctor called me at my mother's request, told me the name of the cancer he supposedly had and told me to look it up.
1	I am not a doctor so I don't have the knowledge or equipment to test and find factual results and when you do your own research or diagnosis it usually looks more bad than good and you don't know what's going on for sure.
-1	I have no anxiety or worries only of the bill. My doctor is completely capable. I am very relaxed and know with my doctor I can handle anything. 
1	I'm getting older (68).  I can see the world and other people.  In general if you are old something is gonna go wrong sooner or later and actually has.  The proof is in the pudding!
-1	What makes me feel worried is not being successful and reaching me goal in life and being broke, i want to achieve my goals and be happy
1	I just worry that I might have to go through another surgery.  I also have a fear in needles  I also just have bad experience with doctors when I was child.
1	For one thing, if there is the flu going around like now, I am very hesitant and anxious to go get bloodwork or general exam because I don't want to end up catching the flu from the sick people there. Beyond that, I just have had a few years recently that I feel going to the doctor is a waste of money for me, I leave with no answers, no solutions and just more broke. I have no confidence in the doctors at this juncture to at least point me in the right direction regarding my health. It is a frustration that I'm currently dealing with as a matter of fact. I personally feel (and many others in similar situations that I have talked with) feel that Novant Health, in particular, has ruined my family practice that I've gone to for decades. In recent years, it's just become a waste of money as I'm shuffled in and out after paying. That in and of itself, the lack of confidence I have now in the process, does cause me anxiety, as well as teh finances.
-1	That the doctor will find something that will affect my health in an adverse way or something that is life changing.
-1	The waiting room makes me feel like that sometimes just because you have to sit there and my mind starts to wander sometimes. Usually I am fine though.
-1	Nothing. At my age with my health as it is there is nothing that I fear or am uneasy about We deal the cards we are dealt period
1	certain parts of the exam are invasive and uncomfortable. it is a cold and sterile environment. i  do not like being poked and prodded
1	worried something might be wrong. 
-1	If I feel anxious and worried, it must be the test result have some issue and doctor needs to talk to me personnel.
1	Never know what is going to  happen bad news or good news that keeps me worried. And anxious wanting to get  it over with
1	Sometimes I'm worried that something might come up. Like I might have an illness that I didn't know about. The waiting is really intense sometimes. 
1	I feel anxious because I do not fully trust the physician as it is. I also feel nervous because I do not like to have a person that I do not know look at me or touch me while I am naked.
1	My mother, father, maternal grandmother and grandfather had cancer. My sister, 15 years younger than me had cancer. My sister 4 years younger had a double mastectomy, two siblings have macular degeneration, and you ask what I worry.
1	Discovering a medical condition that may be unbeknownst to me. 
1	I just worry the possibility that they find something wrong with me. I'm never worried about the doctor doing anything wrong or making mistakes. I don't have the healthiest lifestyle so I expect bad news when I visit the doctor.
1	Nothing
-1	My blood pressure runs a little high. I do not want to be on blood pressure medication so I am worried that each time they take my blood pressure it will be high.
1	I'm worried the doctor will tell me something bad. Being pregnant I'm worried the doctor will tell me something is wrong with the baby and I don't want that 
1	I feel the most worried if I think something is likely to be wrong, especially if it is my fault. Or if I am trying to get cleared to do something.
1	That he's going to tell me there's something wrong with me and the only cure is some 5-figure price tag.
-1	I think there is always the thought in the back of my mind that something might be discovered that is a big health problem. I don't stay worried about this constantly, but that thought creeps up most times when I go to the doctor. There is cancer in my family history for example, and sometimes I worry about that. Really, it's just a general thought that pops up during doctor visits.
1	I am just always worried they'll find something crazy bad with my health.
1	The physical exposure required by some doctors makes me highly uncomfortable. I will only see doctors of the same sex for certain things because it was too creepy and uncomfortable to go to a male doctor for some things.
1	That he will find something wrong with me and it will cost a lot of money and I can not afford it .or it can not be cured
-1	If I'm sick but I don't know what I have, I might be a little anxious to hear what the diagnosis is.
-1	Waiting, if doctor had to leave for a emergency,  will he wants to run tests find something good  or bad. Good is always good. Don't work self up for blood pressure  to get up
-1	Sometimes I think I have the white coat syndrome, especially when it comes to my B/P.  I used to be on B/P medication and it was getting too low so my doctor took me off the medication.  Now my B/P is slowly creeping back up.  I do not want to go back on the medication so everytime I go to the doctor and have my B/P checked, I am anxious about what it will be.
1	I feel like my doctors don't think my illness are that serious. He makes me feel like it's emotional  or physical.
-1	nothing i feel very comfortable and feel like i know what i need to do and wha ti can do and how i can
1	When I visit a doctors office the thing that makes me the most anxious is worrying about getting a shot.  For my entire life, I have absolutely been terrified of needles and getting shots.  Each time I go to a doctors office this thought and idea continuously races through my mind and I find myself often sweating and shaking out of nervousness for no reason.  Also when I visit a doctors office, I worry about how much the visit is going to cost and what is actually wrong with me .
-1	Ivan not anxious at all I am very comfortable going to my doctor he is very good at everything he does I have no concerns at all I like my doctor
-1	I just am not the kind that likes a lot of waiting. I think that it should be a quick and easy check up that comes in the office.
-1	nothing really just the quiet setting 
1	because you are afraid if they are going to find something wrong with you you feel good but they might find underlying things,   i mean they are the doctor
-1	i feel i may have wrong with me that i do not know anything about  but it is best to get an honest opinion
1	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is the initial greeting and how the conversation starts off because lately I haven't been taking the best care of myself, so I'm always really nervous to find out how much worse things have gotten with either my weight or cholesterol numbers.
1	When they have to run a lab in-house and it takes longer than I should -- I worry something is wrong.
-1	HE MIGHT GIVE ME SOME BAD NEWS ABOUT MY HEALTH I DON,T NEED TO HEAR THAT. HE MIGHT WANT TO ADMITTED ME IN THE HOSPITAL TO RUN TEST ON ME .
1	I am afraid I will get bad news.
-1	I do not as a rule feel uneasy, perhaps if there is a specific problem ,i may be a bit anxious until I have consulted with physician.
1	The possibility that there may actually something seriously wrong with my health and even more so something incurable.
-1	I mostly worry about the doc finding something that I never knew about.  Maybe in blood work or a physical exam.  I think that not knowing is the most of my worry.  once the exam or prognosis is complete I rest easy.  i don;t like needles so drawing blood is usually a stressful experience as well.
1	the outcome of the visit see when getting older everthing changes health wise.so you worry a lot more about the outcome of the visit 
-1	that he might find something wrong with me that i was uware of or that is bad.
1	I never know if something is wrong that I don't know about or if the doctor will find something that I didn't know was wrong. 
1	The reason that I feel nervous or anxious when I go to see my doctor, it is because I am afraid that he or she will neither tell some good news about my health or bad news 
-1	I feel what makes me  feel anxious is the unknown. Not knowing what the Dr. may  say or if they would take your issue seriously and try to find the best resolution possible for the issues you are having.
1	i am always worried something could be wrong that i did not expect. If you look hard enough something is always wrong
1	That he will misdiagnose and/or mismedicate me or, worse yet, give me bad news I would not want to hear.  I have little faith in the healthcare system in general.
-1	Trying to explain accurately what's going on and hoping I don't need further tests. Uncertainty 
1	I only feel anxious or worried, because I do not know what the outcome will be. I know the doctor will be a great help, but getting to the results is the anxious part. 
1	I am worried frequently that they will again tell me nothing is wrong with me, despite a variety of seemingly unrelated symptoms that have persisted. I am also anxious that I will get overwhelmed and not be able to discuss my questions or accurately answer unexpected questions. 
1	I feel anxious that the conversation will be about my weight. My numbers are good as far as blood pressure and cholesterol, it's just my weight that is high.
1	I wouldn't want the doctor to find something negative. Also, the cost deters me from going to the doctor. Medical expenses are so exorbitant that I don't like to go to the doctor if I feel like I can avoid it.
1	I get most anxious when I'm waiting for test results or something. That's when I feel the most anxious, the waiting. I also feel anxious when something painful, like a shot, is about to happen.
-1	That there is something really wrong with me and that they wont be able to do anything about it. That I have a huge issue with me even if it is only a small thing. 
-1	If I am having symptoms that I don't understand, or if I haven't been to the doctor in over a year, I sometimes afraid of what I will find out. It's nothing big, because other than diabetes, nothing really bad has happened to me.
1	About my health and needed to get test and medical from my doctor i think about it to must and make me uneasy
-1	I am anxious about the fact that she seems somewhat disengaged and tired. She yawns a lot. I also feel anxious that because I am in a wheelchair she is not doing as complete of an assessment as might be necessary.
1	I may feel anxious because you never know what you will be told or the outcome of the visit. In the back of your mind you pray that you get a good report and the Doctor doesn't find something they may need to look further into.
-1	I am concerned that there is something going wrong with my body 
-1	Although I know I am very healthy and have not experience anything that displays otherwise i still feel a little anxious during a physical exam about the results
-1	I feel as if my doctor is going to tell me either something is terribly wrong with me or that i need some sort of risky procedure
-1	It's extremely silly, but ever since I had to learn to perform blood pressure readings in a high school atomy and physiology class I find the idea of the brachial artery being shut off extremely creepy, which stresses me out and raises my (actually a bit too low, when it can be accurately measured) blood pressure. I then get anxious about the fact that the reading will be incorrect, which makes me worry more and drives the reading sky-high. It's an annoying and very nerve-wracking cycle that happens almost every time I go to a doctor's office.
-1	there is always an element of anxiety about any exam. doctors are people too.  are they having a good day? are they focused on me? do they have time to listen to me? do i really feel what i think i feel. will they believe me when i describe what i feel?
-1	If the doctor hesitate to tell me about my health reports after examination i would feel most anxious and worried.
1	I always feel anxious about visiting the doctor. I worry about my test results from my last visit. I worry that I will get better news about my health. 
-1	I get worried when I go to doctors when they give me results of blood work or tests.
-1	I am most worried about whether or not the diagnosis will be something minor or major.
-1	that something wrong is with me and it is something i can't handle by myself or an illness that will affect the rest of my life
1	When I visit the doctor's office I feel most anxious about having to open up to someone I don't know very well. I feel like the doctor will judge me without actually knowing me. 
-1	What makes me anxious about visiting the doctors office is maybe one day finding out that I'm sick with something that I never knew I had
-1	If anything it's that the doctor might tell me something is going on with me that is worse than I am aware of/anticipating. 
1	i feel like they dont tell me enuff i wish they would talk to me  more an let me decide my own health an talk to me more then they do an not judge me
1	I am not anxious when I go to the doctor.  They take all the time with me as is necessary and I never feel rushed.
1	The doctor discovering something bad or wrong with me. That makes me anxious or scared, about what will happen next.
-1	When I am unsure as to what is wrong with me and I when it's a new dr. that I have never met before. Also when I am having a medical procedure done that I have never had done before.
1	I worry that anything I bring up in regards to my health will not be paid attention to because of my history of anxiety and will be written off as psychosomatic or as a result of my anxiety. I get anxious that they will brush things off and give me the standard lines about relaxing more, destressing, etc. I also feel anxious that they will think I'm crazy. 
1	I am usually worried that he will discover something that is drastically wrong with my health.
1	The costs of treatments I will need, if any. The costs of medication. Whether or not the doctor can tell how well i do or don't take care of myself. Their tone when telling me.
1	I am not so much anxious about the Doctor as anxious about the explaining of my previous history. I hate starting over every 2 years or so.
-1	I feel little uncomfortable to describe some pain about mine body.
1	Sometimes you just do not know what they will find. I worry that they may tell me something is wrong that I had no idea existed, so I am always a little nervous. 
-1	I have a chronic pain disorder, so when I see a new doctor I'm always anxious that they won't believe that my pain is real. 
1	as i get older it seems that i get more illnesses and chronic conditions. so i am hesitant and dread seeing my physician because she might tell me i have yet another condition that i need to take care of.
-1	the unkown in general. until you talk to them or test comeback there is no actual knowing.   its just wait wait wait wait. 
-1	Like I said before changing doctors all the time and we dent have a constant doctor when I go themes different doctors everyday 
1	I am nervous about getting sick or finding out that I have something wrong with me. Overall though, I am anxious about the office's cleanliness. 
1	getting weighed even if i have a cold. My blood pressure goes way up, and I get sick to my stomach. If I didn't have to do that, I would never feel anxious or worried.
-1	after 30 years I have learned that the best time to see my doctor unless it is an emergency or need a flu shot is the early appointments. At the beginning during the day he would always run late which would create worryness or I would become very anxious. When small things crop up, the more time that you have to think about it I would become more anxious.
-1	That I won't be taken seriously or that I'll be talked down to or made like my concerns don't matter.
1	"I have had fairly aggressive responses from professiols when I ask them simple questions. When I ask my healthcare providers questions I either get unsatisfactory answers or outright defiance. It is too easy to offend a medical professiol by ""questioning them"". Studies show that for a therapist their compassion is more highly correlated with their success than their skillset or education. As computers become more capable of diagnosing health problems (and as most doctors just put your symptoms into google these days anyway), I think we will have less autistic doctors that can ace any test and less stress in the doctor's office."
1	I am transgendered and I have been treated hideously by many medical professiols because of it. Add this to the fact that I believe very little of what doctors say and you probably get the idea.
1	It was just one situation while i was prgenant and i just didn't want to go because i knew i would get myself upset at what they had to tell me.
1	I just always tend to think in extremes. So I worry about what the doctor my find or explain and it sends me to worry mode
1	I have a lot of anxiety about my body in general so physical exams are hard.  I worry that something will hurt during the exam or that I will be ashamed
-1	I get anxious when seeing my gynecologist.  I don't like the procedures. My doctor makes me comfortable
1	Finding out that I have something more serious than I thought I did in the first place. Generally I only got when I am very sick.
-1	That they might find something that I have wrong with me. I have to doctor a lot for my problems and I'm paranoid that I will get something that is caused by the medicine.
-1	I sometimes feel a little anxiety before knowing results of diagnostic and blood tests. This usually subsides as the discussions begin.
1	I don't like being touched and poked ad prodded. I also feel nervous answering questions and I worry about seeming like a giant baby so I tend to withdraw and overanalyze things. I will put off visiting the doctor because of these rasons.
-1	NOT KNOWING WHAT MIGHT SHOW UP MAYBE SOMETHING NEW HAS WENT ARRAY I AM GETTING OLDER MOST THE TIME I THINK SOMETHING NEW HAS HAPPEN SOMEWHERE IN MY MIND OR BODY IT WORRIES  ME UNTIL SHE GIVES ME THE OK EITHER WAY
-1	I sometimes feel a little anxious about going to the doctorâs office because my family has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Although I try to eat better and exercise regularly, I sometimes feel that I am going to get bad news from my physician. There are so many factors right now in regards to eating habits, physical fitness, and stress that may easily change your health outcomes. I sometimes associate doctorâs visits with something going wrong in your life. I always expect the worst and think that something bad is going to happen to me and that I need to change something.   
-1	I don't have much anxiety or unease that I can think of.  I suppose that occasionally I am worried about what sort of diagnosis might be involved and that there could be some sort of serious condition
-1	When they have to draw blood from my hand for some test.I am not afraid of the test result but the pain of the needle.
-1	Honestly just the pain that I have to go through is the only things I worry about when I go to the hospital or doctors office.
1	I just don't like the idea of being examined or judged for my bad decisions in life. 
-1	my doctor takes hours to come into the office to see me. that makes me really anxious because sometimes i have other things to do that day. also, i just met him so i get anxious about describing all my issues to him.
1	I always think something could be wrong and might go wrong and will cause a discomfort for me and my lifestyle. Hospitals are cold and not comfortable places so they make me very anxious.
-1	"Since I have diabetes, I am aware of its symptoms and comorbid conditions/disorders. The main thing I worry about when visiting the doctor's office is being ""found out"" if I didn't follow doctor's orders from the last visit or I slipped a little. I want to present as the perfect patient, though I know there's not one. I don't like being told I'm doing something wrong since I do try so hard to maintain any and all progress. "
1	I tend to feel most anxious about what the doctor may discover.  For some reason, it seems that every time I have any kind of medical test, the doctor finds something new that is wrong with me.  It makes me feel that I don't won't the doctor to run any new tests because I know they are going to find something wrong.  Based on all of my recent experiences, I am seriously considering switching to a holistic doctor.
-1	I am not worried or anxious just feel uneasy because of wrong diagnosis and prescribing or medication without looking at life changes or other factors such as what was eating prior to coming to the doctor that my skew a test. 
1	I am concerned about if they find a serious condition that could be life-altering or life-threatening.  I am not concerned about them but what they might discover.
-1	I am never worried about seeing the doctor because he always has good advise if I need it. The only thing I dislike are needles and scales.
-1	Just the atmosphere in general. I have no real issues or reasons to feel anxiety. It's probably more from childhood feelings or the idea of a hospital.
-1	I feel a bit anxious when I visit the doctor simply because I'm in a position where I may learn some worrisome things about my health. The potential is always there for negative news when you're visiting the doctor, so a bit of anxiousness seems inevitable. 
1	I'm getting older. I always feel my body deteriorating and I'm just always scared something new is going to pop up. I'm not a hypochondriac, yet I do worry about my health because it really isn't very good. 
1	I'm 55 and haven't had a medical issue in decades. While I do exercise regularly and eat well; I've smoked for 20 years and drink regularly so if I had an issue I'd be concerned as I'm far from a person who you'd consider has a healthy life-style.
-1	What foods I must stop eating. I have new health problems related/caused by my current digestive problems. I hate the word tests, prep for the tests, actually taking the test and hearing my health problems are causing me more problems.
-1	I don't think that I would feel anxious about visiting a doctor's office because I know that they are there to help me ascertain if there is anything wrong with me and prescribe whatever medications I might need in the process.  
-1	I feel that everyone gets a little anxious when getting examed. You never know what they're gonna find.
-1	Depending what the visit is for would determine how anxious or worried I would be. I think what makes me most worried would be being concerned the doctor would find something I was unaware of, or something potentially serious. This worries me sometimes.
1	Not knowing if I'll be given the best advice or options for my condition. Not believing that that doctor cares enough about to better advice my on what to do. It makes me scared, worried and anxious going to a doctor's office just to leave feeling disappointed that I didn't get the answers I was looking for or the care that I need. 
-1	I have an anxiety problem when I have something to do. It's not being nervous at the Drs. office it's that I have to go somewhere.
1	I hate feeling like I might have some lingering undetectable disease that's going to kill me at any time and suddenly finding out about it and realizing I only have a few months to live.
-1	Probably not knowing if there is anything wrong with me until after the exam and whatever tests I may have to go through, It's just not knowing if i am okay or not.
-1	The doctor may find something wrong that I didn't expect. I feel like I am in good health and don't like to find out there is something wrong that I didn't know about.
1	I usually don't like doctors offices, most likely because I have to get shots or some type of exam. I definitely do notâ like pelvic exams
1	I always worry that there is something wrong with me. Especially if there is something wrong with me that I don't understand.
1	Can I feel confertable following their advise after one Doctor seemed to be trying to kill me, by prescribing medicine that would destroy my kidneys.  Just lost a big share of my respect and trust in the medial profession
1	I have anxiety in going to the doctor. I feel that the doctor will try and diagnose me with something that I do not have. 
1	If I'm going in for a check-up i would fear finding out something bad (i.e. diabetes, cancer). I also worry if they may have found something or if my physical condition is more serious that what i personally think. 
1	That I am surprised of his decision, I want to trust my doctor, I want to know that he thinks about my case and tries to help me not thinking of his financial profit. The times are changing and humanity is so important for this profession. I worry every time how expensive will be the next prescribed medicine and what are the side effects, I try to read everything carefully and when read the long list of side effects I become more and more frustrated. Sometimes the doctor is thinking about something else and doesn't listen to me, I have to repeat what I have said, that is confusing. 
1	I get worried that something may be wrong and I don't know it.
-1	I feel worried and anxious that the doctor won't listen to my concerns and will dismiss me.  Instead of providing me with a solution, they just tell me there is nothing they can do to help me.
1	What makes me most worried and anxious is that they'll find something seriously wrong with me, like cancer.
-1	Just the rush rush of it all. I do not really trust that dr's are really listening to what you are saying.
-1	The waiting period in between the examination and diagnosis/treatment. It feels like it takes forever for the doctor to determine the problem. 
-1	I get worried about my blood pressure. something about the white coat sets it off. the older you get the more you worry about things
1	Pain from procedures and discussing irregular tests results are what makes me most anxious or worried. 
1	I usually have to go to the doctor for sick visits.  In that frame of mind, I am already uncomfortable.  I am usually worried that I will have a long way to recovery, or I will need to take expensive medication.
-1	Uncertainty if there will be something really wrong with me
-1	I worry that I'll get admonished for not taking care of myself (my weight has been creeping up lately) or that my blood pressure will suddenly be high or something else unexpected.
1	A great major of the time I am not worried just anxious for a diagnosis and resolution because I normal google my symptoms and come up with the most extreme possibility 
1	If it's a symptom I'm not familiar with affect my body and I am waiting for diagnosis. That I would say is the most anxious or worried situation there.
1	Anxious about what questions they are going to ask especially if I'm with my mom or somebody . Worried about the outcome of the test results even though I may not being doing anything 
1	i have anxiety issues which elevate whenever i go to the doctor or and it doesn't matter what type of doctor it is
-1	I go into my doctor's appointments with faith in God and prays for the best outcome.  When I've been having troubles and have some tests done I tend to stress over the outcome, but I pray about it and leave it in the hand of our Savior.
1	I have ha enough health issues in my life to get a sense of deja vu or flashbacks - I always have a feeling that something is about to pop up. And since I'm generally healthy, when I am at the doctor, it's usually for a pretty good reason.
-1	Having to sit on the exam table.  I'm a big guy and it is tough to get on that thing and sit.  I would rather sit in the chair.
1	My main concern is to find out that I have some really serious disease. However it is always better to know and start looking for the treatment or the setup a plan than not being aware and realizing it too late. The other thing that is very upsetting is the costs of the treatments. It is always expensive to go to the doctor and getting the necessary examinations. I do not understand how people are able to afford medical treatments. It is way to overpriced and after that you will live and work to pay back the costs of your medical treatment.
1	I get worried thinking about what might be wrong with me and thinking about how hard it would be to have an illness
-1	Nothing, I love visiting my doctor.
-1	I guess it's all the waiting. There is always at least a 10-15 minute wait in the office before the appointment. 5-10 would be more acceptable. Then there is also the time you have to wait in the examition room. 
-1	I feel anxious not knowing if the doctor will do a good job and be completely honest or not.  I also feel anxious not knowing if they will find something wrong with me.  And, I also feel anxious about how much things will cost.
1	I am growing older and always fear that something new may be revealed. I also have a breast tumor which always worries me although it has remained 'harmless' for over 20 years.
1	I worry that I will be referred to yet another doctor who will then refer me to another doctor. I am also worried that I will be told that the only thing they can do is give me another pill to take. 
1	That they are going to perscribe me something generic that only helps maybe 10% of my issue or just tell me to take it easy and if it gets worse call like i came out here for a answer not to be told im nuts
-1	Fear of my health getting worse.
1	They are going to tell me I'm going to die soon
1	I have a mechanical aortic valve, a dacron aortic aneurysm replacement, and a pacemaker.  The valve and graft are twelve years old, and my second pacemaker is 7 years old.  I worry the most that my valve will need to be replaced again, and that my pacemaker needs replacement again.  These things have a limited life, and I know that at some point problems that arise will need to be addressed.
-1	I am always a little apprehension about what my bloodwork will look like.  I have had high cholesterol in the past, and I don't want to see it creep back up.  It is always a relief to have all my numbers come back looking good!
1	I think it is because of the waiting so long in this little Exam Room and hearing the Doctor going to all the different Rooms before he gets to mine
1	I don't like waiting to see the doctor, and I don't like the small talk aspect of doctors in their offices. I just want a diagnosis, prescription, and to get out. I respect the medical profession but being in a waiting room full of sick people really makes me not want to go to the doctor at all. 
1	Get your tickets now that I'm a big hug can you please follow me please I love you so much for the first one to be a long time no see you tomorrow

-1	Sometimes I don't know exactly what the problem is or if it's something that can be treated with a medicine that I 'm not allergic to
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried. I mostly already know why I'm going to the doctor to begin with and always leave out satisfied. 
-1	What most worries me is being around sick people and that they might get me sick. I also worry about a mistake with my paperwork that leads to misdiagnosis.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office is the possibility of them finding something wrong with me that I had no idea that I had. It always worries me that I might find out that I have high blood pressure or something even worse that I can't even bring myself to type because its so scary and horrible.
1	I feel anxious, or worried because I wonder if I am going to be judged, or if they are going to tell me I have a serious life threatening issue going on. I wonder If something is going wrong if they will truly assist and do what they can to the max to ensure that every avenue, and the best avenue has been presented. I wonder if they even understand what I am feeling at that current moment. 
1	They may give me some bad news I am hopeful they will not because I take pretty good care of myself even though I broke my hip pretty month ago and I'm still recovering I broke it at the gym I was taking care of myself but sometimes bad things happen
-1	Visiting my doctorâs office doesnât make me anxious or uneasy. Going to my doctor is just routine to me.   
1	nothing makes me feel anxious at the doctors I really hate going to the doctors because I don't think they really understand what i'm going through
-1	
1	I worry the doctor will find something I did not expect. I also worry that if something is wrong, it will be expensive to treat. I tend to fear for the worst.
-1	Don't really like to take time to go to the Drs. Have been so sick for a while think they won't care or listen to what I'm saying so why waste the time.
-1	It depends on the situation. If I am seeing my doctor, say, because I am not feeling well or in a lot of pain, then of course I'll feel anxious and worried that something might be seriously wrong. If it's just routine checkups, then I'm relaxed.
1	I am very nervous about having my body violated or put through examinations that I am not consenting to. Many times doctors have forced me to succumb to treatment that I explicitly said I didn't want, so I have constant anxiety about seeing them. I have been sent away in a police car too many times by care providers that refuse to give me the treatment I need.
-1	I worry or make me more anxious when I go to the doctor because I feel bad and I know that I have some disease and I fear that I can find something bad in my health that can not have a medical solution, I'm afraid to know that I can say something bad about my health .
-1	I don't really feel anxious or worried unless I am getting some type of test ran on me then I get worried because something might be wrong with me
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is fear of the unknown.
-1	I dont like needels  
1	I've always been afraid of needles and visiting the doctor, but I have become better about this as I get older. Sometimes I worry that she will find something wrong that will require daily medication or some other more aggressive treatment.
-1	If I am having a certain pain or rash or anything wrong I get totally worried until I get the green light that it is not that bad
-1	Finding out something that is totally unexpected. If I'm going in for pain in my ankle, I'm expecting some good/bad news regarding my ankle.  If I'm just going in for a simple biometric screening and leave being told I'm Hep-C or Diabetic, etc .
1	I worry that the doctor will find a health problem I am not already aware of. I worry that the doctor will get short if I ask too many questions. I worry that the doctor is so attuned to conventiol options that he won't think broadly about new possibilities to address conditions with less side effects and more benefits.
-1	I don't get anxious to actually see my doctor, the only thing that may make me a little anxious is when I go to the doctor for a specific pain or something and then I worry that something may be wrong with me and I don't want to get bad news 
-1	It's uncomfortable and totally abnormal to be semi-ked in an exam room with someone you see once a year at best.   It's going to make anyone anxious.
1	it goes like the old saying , if it ain't broke, don't fix it, I don't look forward to anyone trying to find something wrong with me
1	The reason that I'm there is usually not a good reason. That in itself causes me to have anxiety, especially if I am not feeling well, or have a problem. Also, medical procedures make me uncomfortable. Examinations usually also get personal or require talking about matters that make me uncomfortable by their nature. I'm also concerned that they are going to find something terrible, or that I'm going to have to do something that requires a lot of suffering to improve the situation.
-1	I do not or rarely have those feelings as my need to visit the doctor is maybe once every two years or so
-1	Hoping for the best and most beneficial results and details given as needed services and care required, wanting the needed healthy options as well and outcome overall
-1	Any medical appointment makes me a little anxious simply because I will have to bare myself and be uncomfortable. The only time I get worried is if I suspect that there may really be something wrong that may not turn out well.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is that the doctor will find something wrong with me, and that I could possibly be put on medication for the rest of my life, treating any condition instead of being able to cure it.
-1	I'm currently still young, so there's not much for me to be worried about. My biggest concern is that there's some rare disease that I may one day develop, or that I get a family related health illness. Apart from that, I just worry that anything at all may have occurred and that I'm not a fit human being anymore. There's no real reason for me to be worried, and I understand that, but at the same time there's still a small sense of discomfort that I have. 
1	Sometimes something will be wrong with me, and we will have to wait for lab results to help figure out what is going on.  This does scare me the most.  Also, when I had one issue, it wound up later being diagnosed as bladder cancer.  The symptoms were very scary, but she did help calm me down and had me come back every day to make sure the symptoms were getting better.  
-1	Depending on my symptoms or what my reason for a doctor's visit are, I sometime worry about what the result will be & how long it will take to schedule a referral appointment.
1	I just have anxiety in general. I get anxious sitting in the exam room waiting. I also get anxious because I worry I won't be able to explain what is going on with me in a way that makes sense to the doctor.

-1	Feeling anxious about what  might be happening and what the outcome will be.hoping  everything will turn out okay

-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious when visiting my doctors office because she is very thorough, patient, understanding, etc etc etc
-1	"I'm just generally nervous when talking to people I'm not really familiar with, so going through the whole chain of interactions from front desk to nurse to doctor is a little bit stressful for me. But not the ""I'm afraid"" sort of stress. It's more of a ""where do I put my hands? Why did I say that? "" sort of stress."
1	Not knowing what the doctor was going to say made me most nervous. I'm most anxious when I'm waiting on the doctor or nurse to return to the room. 
-1	I feel worried about my doctor finding cancer because a few of my uncles and aunts passed away from cancer.

-1	Mostly, it is the fear of the unknown. I have high blood sugar, and I am always concerned that my doctor might tell me that I am a diabetic. That would be very traumatic for me. This relates to my weight, and I worry what my doctor's scale will show for that.
1	that they are going to whip out some prescription and send me on my way, or that they will  just send me to a specialist and nothing will be solved
-1	That he might find something wrong.
1	"I guess I am most worried that something will be seriously wrong with me, because I don't have time to be sick. Also, I am overweight--not more than 15-20 pounds--but some doctors make nasty remarks about it. I had one male doctor ask me, "" How do you expect to find a lover when you're fat?""."
1	I just hate being out of my element and hate having people I don't know touch me
1	I am worried about the cost, about whether or not the staff are friendly, if whatever I am going in there for is going to end up being something worse than I expected. There are a ton of reasons to feel complete and utter anxiety and worry while you're in there. That's why a lot of people don't go. 
1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when seeing my doctor. I always have faith that whatever is said will be correct and help me move forward with my health.

-1	I do not feel anxious at the Dr. Maybe annoyed because of wait times.
-1	I feel most anxious that they might tell me something is wrong with my condition when I thought everything had been fine. I worry about over-prescription instead of fixing the root issue, I think we medicate far too much in this society.
1	that the doctor would find something wrong where i would/may have to be admitted to the hospital like one time when i had an appointment for 4 pm for previous pcp and i figured icould not wait that long, went to er, diag. was pneomnia and i was admitted overnight and pres. an iv of levaquin
-1	My biggest fear would have to be going for a general check up, not expecting anything to be wrong and be the end of the visit you have stage 8 cancer and will die tomorrow.
1	Going to the doctor you never know what to expect.  You go the doctor only see's you for two minutes and you can't explain why you are their anyway.
-1	just what to expect from a check up.Just thinking what if they find something wrong with me.
1	I always feel as though something will be wrong. I try to keep myself in the best shape possible but I always fear that I'll have a disease or cancer.

1	"I worry that the doctor will not take my concerns and thoughts seriously. I worry that I will be ignored and the doctor will think he knows what is best for me without listening to what I have to say.

-1	When I go to a doctors visit I feel most anxious and worried about the doctor saying that there's an something else wrong with me and sometimes thinking the worse.
-1	I have high blood pressure. I'm always anxious about have my blood pressure tested because it varies so much and it is usually high when I go to the doctor's office because I have walked to get there. Sometimes it bothers me because the nurses get a high reading and are overly concerned. If the doctor takes the blood pressure later it's usually lower, but the nurses don't seem to understand that.
-1	Just about my health. I don't worry much at all but sometimes I think that maybe they'll find something wrong, like maybe my blood pressure is bad.
-1	If I feel that I am not being understood or if there seems to be a more serious underlying issue to my symptoms.
1	i just do not like going to the doctor, I am  always afraid they will find something even though they never do it is just me
-1	I feel anxious because offices are usually cold and the exam room can be initimadating. It would be nice if the exam rooms where more cozy and you didn't have to wait so long before you see the doctor and freeze half to death. I also hate when i have to pay out of pocket after the appointment and wasn't told beforehand what to expect to pay so that i'm not caught off guard.
1	WHEN THE DOCTOR DO THE PHYSICAL CHECK AND KEEP TESTING OR DOING THE SAME TEST AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT GET ME WORRY THAT THERE IS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY HEALTH. 
1	What makes me feel worried is the thought of a bad health report. As I get older and my body starts to slow down, I feel I'm more prone to bad health.

-1	hate having to wait in the waiting room when I get there ontime then the doctor should be ready to see me also having to give blood gives me the creeps
1	I fear what the doctor might tell me. I will worry from the day I make the appointment until I finish the visit. If I were dying, I don't think I would want to know. Doctors don't seem to understand this fear.
-1	A lot of friends my age have developed health concerns in recent years.  I sometimes feel anxious about age-related health concerns that may develop. 
1	What makes me worried or anxious is the feeling of not knowing. I'm also just an introverted person, so any kind of human contact or interaction is going to warrant such emotions from me.
1	I always worry that a simple problem is actually something very serious 
1	I feel anxious or worried about not hearing what I want to hear. Or not getting better or having to be medicated
-1	The unknown is the thing that makes me the most anxious.  I fear having to take a test that will be painful or worriesome.  I also worry about my family if anything is seriously wrong with me.  I generally don't like to go to the doctors so I am always anxious even before arriving at the office.  I don't like needles so getting blood drawn is not my favorite thing to do.  
-1	I already suffer from a panic disorder with anxiety so I tend to be anxious anytime I go out in public, whether it is for a doctor appointment or not. However there are certain factors that make me worry. If it is just a physical or a normal scheduled appointment then I do not worry so much. But if I am going in to get an injury looked at then I tend to worry about permanent damage. When I was a teenager I suffered rhabdomyolysis. I was very alarmed and it required a long hospital stay. I would get worried after I got out of the hospital because they were sure if  I would get full use of my limb after it healed.
1	Nothing at all.  I know if there is something terrible that he hE had Fox                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   was

-1	I think they will try to shove something down my throat.
-1	The only thing that would make me nervous is if I was told that I have a serious condition for which there was no hope in healing.  I am anxious for procedures that I am not familiar with.

-1	To get bad news. But know early is great to get it treated. But going to the doctor  great. Making sure everything OK. 
-1	that he finds something during my exam/test that he think may be very concerning. Or when the doctor has no clue in to what to do for a pain/issue i may have.

-1	I worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me medically. I am always happy when I get a clean bill of health after my yearly physical.
1	Due to the fear mongering that has gripped this fine country, I think most people worry about a serious or deadly diagnosis each time they visit their physician, even if there isn't a specific reason why these feelings should exist (i.e. the person being diagnosed is in good health, eats well, exercises regularly, etc.).
1	Because I have been very healthy with no major illnesses or longterm conditions, I am attentive to symptoms and feelings when I am not feeling well. I sometimes wonder when/ how that could change when I cannot identify what might be physically wrong with me
-1	When I go to the doctor I worry that she may find something wrong with me, especially when it comes to my blood pressure. 
1	I just hate physicals. I dread getting on the scale. I hate having a pelvic exam. I don't know why I get so upset but I do
-1	I don't really get anxious or worried when I go to the doctors.  It doesn't make me worried unless they tell me something is wrong with me.
1	I always fear the worst. I think I'm going to end up getting something really bad and those thoughts run through my mind while im in the office.
1	That im going to get some terminal diagnosis, or that I have to get a shot or lab work. Im horrified of needles.
1	I get anxious sometimes because you never know what is going to found or if something could go wrong. It is not a guarantee that everything will be checked to be fine.
1	I am concerned that I will not be listened to and the doctor will not take symptoms serious enough to find out what is causing them. The doctor makes you feel as if you do not know how your body feels
1	I am old enough to know the probability for health and longevity, and also old enough to have experienced times when things did not work out the way we hope that they would. What makes me feel anxious is that the older I get the more likely I will be told that I am going to die by a doctor based merely on probabilities.
-1	I worry they might find something wrong with me that is incurable. Something like cancer. Also waiting around for long periods of time will sometimes make me anxious.
-1	When I am there because I know something is wrong, i dislike the suspense of waiting.
1	That I might get life altering news that I cant do anything about. Something that I nor medicine can fix or change.
1	I'm scared of getting shots . Which may sounds weird lol . But I fainted before because I was so worried .
-1	I worry a lot about how much it will cost.  I also get very irritated at making an appointment, getting there early, then waiting an hour or more to be seen
1	A new problem or complications will be discovered that are hard or impossible to treat, that I have a problem that will kill me.
-1	i an never worried or anxious. the doctor is there to do a job and I trust they know what they are doing to heal me. if I dont trust my doctor will take care of me then why go to them
-1	
1	Just get anxious that they may find something wrong with me that will change my way of life. I also feel like there is a good likelihood of me getting sick from other sick people when i go to the doctor
-1	I get anxiety when I have to get blood work or a shot. Most of the time I don't want to be there so I get anxious to leave 
-1	Because you never know what the doctor is going to tell me. Knowing that I don't go to the doctor as often as he wants me to doesn't like that.
1	I get anxious going to the doctor because I don't know what they will say or have me do, and I don't know if I will be able to explain my problem well enough for them to understand.
-1	Well if he insist on taking another test
1	I am just paranoid alot that something will be wrong with me I guess you could say I am fearful of the unknown
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor for a medical exam.  The Lord has given me good health
1	I feel like when I go to my doctor ð¨ââï¸ for help it's helps me to understand what I am having a problem but I now know I got to fix my problem that with my anxiety because I get so scared ð³ I don't like when people stare at me because I think they are always liking at me
-1	I am mostly worried about the worst outcome. If I have a problem that I do not know what is going on, I am worried that the diagnosis will be poor and that could affect my lifespan or quality of life in general. I am also anxious when they lecture me about my health habits because I don't need a lecture as an adult, I understand my choices.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious is when i'm sitting in the waiting room forever
1	I M ALWAYS WORRIED THAT THE DOCTOR MAY FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF- LIKE CANCER OR A HEART PROBLEM
-1	i'm not anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office because I believe they are there to help me with my health issues. there are however some tests that I dread but they are necessary for my quality of life. I know what to do when I'm having severe pain from the doctor's instructions. 
-1	Nerves in general. No one likes to go to the doctors. But int he long run you know you need to go, even if its for something small. Because that small thing could be something large and if you didnt go something worse could happen to you.
1	I am pretty anxious in general, but working in healthcare, I feel I know a lot of the bad things that can happen. It's hard for me to get some of those things out of my head.
1	I am anxious at the doctors office because i am sick and do not know what is going on with my body. I worry the treatment is going to be painful or uncomfortable and this brings my anxiety up. 
-1	I always have a little unease that they may find something that is not right. I have always had good health but you never know. 
-1	probably what they are going to tell me about my condition or if i will require surgery or not, the different medications and side effects.
-1	you allways hop for the best ya would like to think it willbe ok  when visiting a doctor good news calms the mind and soul 
-1	The terrorists attacks and all the biogen the crimes ghats going across the world and the United States
1	I now equate this the same as when you get the new car and whenever it goes in everything is great and the only thing needed is what is in for, the older it gets the minor thing you brought it in for now has anlist of,things that need to be taken care of.  
-1	I was anxious about the cost.  I am not anxious about the actual visit itself or about my doctor. I recently lost health coverage through my employer so the cost is the source of all my anxiety when it comes to the doctor.
-1	
1	I am always worried that we will have to do a painful test. I really dont like getting shots or blood drawn. I always worry that they will find something really wrong. Also i dont like when they say i have to take off my clothes. I have a gyno for that.
-1	i'm not usually worried when i go to the doctor. i'm a fairly healthy person and i can usually get a prescription to take care of anything that's going on. 
-1	Knowing that I'm not doing everything I can to be healthy and knowing that the doctor will be concerned about what I'm doing makes me feel anxious 
1	I don't like disrobing and being probed, I don't like being weighed, and I can't stand gynecological exams, which I find painful. Being made to wait a long time beforehand causes me stress as well.
-1	I don't think I feel worried or anxious when I was at my doctor I know my doctor on a personal level and I feel like she's give me the honest truth and what's best for my health
-1	The needles make feel worried.  I do not like how they feel in my skin. I also do not like receiving bad news or information.  This makes me scared of my future. 
1	I always feel anxious, even at home, alone or not. At the doctor's office, I would say I am nervous or anxious about talking to people. 
1	I am worried that the diagnosis would be something completely different from what I expected it to be. I am worried that something may be more serious than it seems. 
-1	It's not so much as being actually worried, however, I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and refused to take insulin. My doctor wanted me to take 2 insulin products, 1 weight loss drug, I was determined that I would conquer this and I have.
1	What makes me anxious when visiting the doctors office is to get a negative test result which is not good at all to hear. That would make me worried alot.
1	I am worried mostly about time restraints and having to wait longer times. This makes me late for other appointments.
1	The idea of receiving bad news is what makes me the most anxious and uneasy when going to the doctor's office. I hate the feeling even though I know it is necessary for me to get a physical examination.
-1	I am sometimes afraid that my blood work may come back with something wrong on it and I will have to start a new medication.
-1	I'm only a little worried that she will find something wrong that I haven't noticed for a long time. 
-1	I dont feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctors office. I often feel safe and that I am going to get better. 
-1	I just hope that I am in good health because you never know what is wrong with you. Something can pop up outta nowhere. 
-1	The possibility of having some kind of surgery. I have always had a fear of having surgery and the operating table in general since I was little. 
-1	Nothing to much would make me feel any kind of worried about things because I try to do a good job of keeping myself in good shape in between doctor visits.
-1	idk why but the only thing that makes me a little anxious is having my blood pressure checked. For some reason when the cup goes on my anxiety shoots up and they always have to retake my blood pressure a second time.
1	It makes me most fearful that something will be seriously wrong . Or that something might be painful. But the unknown is worse.
1	they will want to take my blood pressure and start treating me for something completely different from what i came there for. if you look for something you will find something and that is what they always do they think they are not doing their job if they don't give you treatment for something
-1	My greatest concern when visiting the doctor's office is that I will be rushed and/or the doctor will not take my concerns seriously. I have a hearing loss and difficulty understanding individuals with strong accents. Therefore, this is also causes anxiety if I am meeting this doctor for the first time. 
-1	I am more anxious or worried when I feel like something is really wrong with my health. If I'm having pains or something I'm just anxious to know what's going on.
1	I am always concerned that they will find something that will require further testing. In my past experience, further tests can be expensive and painful, and for me have always turned out fine. But even still, it is scary to decide to ignore the doctor's advice and not do further tests. 
-1	Doesn't usually happen, but once had the following experience: Doctor lectured me about a health condition, in an agitated tone; and I began feeling sicker as a result
-1	I get worried about the medications i get because i often get lots of them. It cares me because i have been using antibiotics since i was like 10. 
-1	What makes me most anxious is not knowing a diagnosis. I am a planner, so when the outcome is not predictable, it makes me stressed out and worried. I am anxious until I find out what is wrong and how it can be fixed.
1	I feel anxious when i wait because i dont like my doctor to be ride about my weight. He says all my health problems is being im overweight. Which is not the right thing to say. 
1	I'm uncomfortable with people touching me, which can make me feel anxious and a little uneasy during an exam.
-1	It is uncomfortable to have someone examine my body, that is essentially a stranger, so intimately . It is uncomfortable no matter how often it occurs.
1	It's just a weird experience altogether. Having a stranger poke and prod me is not something that makes me feel comfortable. They ask a lot of questions and the little gowns are way too small and don't make me feel any less ked.
1	Sometimes I might feel like they will find out something bad and that I will be sick or hurt, this is what I'm usually like not always
-1	will not get the information I need because we all know they spend very little time with each client
1	The idea of receiving bad health news or finding out that there was something extremely wrong with me or my health.
1	Scared of the test and the results hoping not to have a condition that is life threatening and need meds
-1	
1	I am most anxious that the doctor will tell me that something is wrong. I know that if something is wrong, I will have to do/take something that is very inconvenient or expensive.
1	I am not very social and have anxiety. I assume that the worst possible thing could be wrong and I'm not very good with strangers 
1	I worry about getting blood drawn, about being declared somehow more unhealthy and having to have more work done, especially procedures or accompanying meds that I can't afford.
-1	"When having routine tests completed, there is that sense of ""what will they find""; for example, when having a mammogram done.  So many women are diagnosed with breast cancer, there is just that sense of worry."
1	As I get older I worry about what the doctor may say or find during an exam.  I sometimes get anxious worrying about it and how I will handle it.
-1	I know I am not in the greatest health. So when I go to the doctor's office I am quite worried that she may end up giving me bad news. I also have a family history of heart trouble, so I am very scared about that. 
1	The state of the unknown makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor. Even more so when receiving test results 
1	Knowing that you don't have all the information, you need to basically take their word even if they aren't telling you the whole picture, and that you don't know what the outcome will be of certain medical procedures until after the fact.
-1	nothing.  Really, I am not anxious or worried when I go to the Drs.  Ive always had a pleasant experience there
1	I worried about what the diagnosis the doctor will tell me.  Will it require surgery, how long the recovery period will be if surgery is required, is it a termil illness, or a decline in my mental faculties?
-1	I'm anxious when it comes to needles and having to draw blood for tests. I'm also worried that the doctor might find something wrong that I was unaware of.
-1	Any time a needle is going to be involved I become anxious. Also when I have to have my yearly female examine I get a little anxious.
-1	The potential of my doctor discovering something new that could completely change my life. Or my doctor telling me that something that I am doing is causing health issues. 
-1	That my health condition is stable and long lasting and good! I want to be around a long time for my disabled son and wife who need my help.  I have been blessed with good health so my slight anxiety rises if something minor happens to me before a doctors visit
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious unless I am being tested for something specific.  I rarely, if ever, feel like I am in  a position to feel worried.
-1	I feel a little worried about the possibility of the doctor finding a chronic disease that is not curable or treatable.  I also feel anxious that I may not be in as good health as the last physical exam.
1	Anticipation of bad news that I did not know or expect beforehand, that will result in an arduous and time-consuming (and possibly painful or dangerous) treatment process.
-1	The only thing that I could think of is the fear that I may be sick. Other than that I'm not to fearful at the doctors
1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is because my Mother died of Leukemia, and my Father died of Lung Cancer. I have a great fear of being diagnosed of one of these. It is very possible that one day I will be. 
-1	I am always concerned that my tests will show something or that I have a condition that can not be treated.
1	The unknown. I would much prefer to know exactly what the problem IS than to fret over what it possibly could be. The imagination can run wild
-1	My health is excellent and have never had any serious issues.  None of my physicals have ever revealed any problems so my physicals are not a source of dread or anxiety.
-1	If I can't properly explain symptoms I'm having and be able to convey them to the doctor, this would make me anxious and hoping that I was making myself clear.
1	I am worried something wrong with me will be discovered. I would prefer to be healthy and not have to worry about dying/suffering so there is always that fear in the back of my mind.
1	That I've either come in about an issue that's too trivial to need a doctor's attention, or that I've waited too long on an issue when I should have known it was more serious. Basically that there are multiple ways my own judgement could be wrong. That I'll embarrass myself by making a bigger deal out of something than is warranted. That I might have to redirect a conversation of the doctor seems to jump to wrong conclusions or makes bad assumptions.
1	I do not like to be exposed to other people's germs in the waiting room.  If I have something other than a routine condition, I often feel worried about the unknown.
1	I just worry that they're going to find something really bad, that I'm going to be sick with something deadly. 
1	I'm worried that my doctor won't take time to hear my concerns. Also, I am anxious about possible test results.
1	Being about people I do not know as they can give me social anxiety. I do  not like being alone or near those I don't know.
1	Just sitting there wondering what they will find or if my condition is changing for the worse.
1	Because I'am getting older not any younger.
-1	I have social anxiety. I feel nervous about interacting with the doctor and staff. I feel inferior.
-1	There is always a possibility that you could have something major wrong with you such as cancer or a disease.
1	I'm always anxious for any stranger to look at me in depth like that, whether it's a doctor, dentist, or person on the bus. It's very intrusive and unsettling. I'm also worried that my doctor will give me bad news or even worse will refer me without telling me why and it will take weeks to learn what's wrong with me.
-1	The only problem I have is finding a doctor who will do a thorough examition and LISTEN to what I'm saying.  I don't mind one that experiments as long as I know it is and that we are working together.
-1	I really have no problems with visiting a doctor now my commonlaw wife don't like doctor appointments and i always have to make for her then make her go because she has dementia  
-1	I worry if he finds something wrong with me, and if he did he would precribe something for me to take of it
1	I'm not sure if I know.  It seems to be an automatic reaction.  It may be in part that I don't want to be told that I need to make major changes in my lifestyle.
-1	Doctors cannot always explain what is wrong with you when you feel sick.  My brother had a serious medical condition that his doctors did not understand.  They ran a number of rests but never really understood why he was sick.
-1	Just the wait on results or diagnosis. You cant help but be a little anxious because there is an element of uncertainty.
1	I don't want to go hear any bad news about what's going on with me. I dread the bills that come behind a doctor visit 
-1	That they might find something wrong with me and I might need to be put on medication. Or that something may be wrong with me.
-1	It is a woman and though I am not ashamed to undress for her,it still leels a little bit uneasy.I would feel worried,when I have to see her,when I have sudden complaints,that don't go away.
-1	We do not feel anxious when we visit the doctor.  She has a calm demeaner and we feel at ease with her.
-1	I am an anxious person in general.  So after having waited in the waiting room, and then waiting again in the exam room as I wait for the doctor to come in I am already getting anxious and worked up.  It's not because I fear what I might learn or what might happen, but I'm just nervous in general about meeting the doctor and the waiting and anticipation helps fuel my nervousness.  I am far more nervous about meeting and talking to the doctor than I am about what might happen or what I might learn during my visit with the doctor.
1	I'm mostly worried about not asking the right questions while I am there. I'm not usually sure what I need to be asking. I then worry about whether  I'll be able to understand all the information that is going to be thrown at me. I'm just hoping it sticks so I can move on with my life as comfortably as possible. 
1	My anxiety stems from uncertainty. Each time I go to the doctor for a physical exam, I have to do blood work. Even though I am relatively healthy, I do not know what that blood work would come back saying. This has little to do with my doctor and more to do with just the uncertainty of the human body. 
-1	The only time I would worry is if I  get bad news or bad lab results I'm a pretty healthy young lady and shouldn't get any bad news concerning my health 
1	 I get that way thinking they are gone tell me some bad news after a checkup and I don't know if I can handle it.
-1	I worry sometimes that my doctor will find something seriously wrong with my health such as diabetic, heart issues, or cancer. 
1	Doctors  often time seem so anxious to get to the next patient that they don't take the time to explain things thoroughly, and unless you ask questions you may not get all the information you need.
1	I get most anxious because I don't know what the outcome of the appointment will be. I also don't know how the doctor will treat me while I am there.
-1	What makes me most anxious or worried is that the doctor could find something like a disease or something I had no idea about. 
1	I get more and more anxious when visiting a doctor's office because I am not sure if I can handle being told bad news regarding my health.
-1	The only problem I have I. Any Dr's office is the wait.  That is all I dread but I also know each patient is being cared for professionally and tenderly by the staff.
-1	I am a little worried that my health problems will be worse than what they seem.
-1	That he spends so much time looking for things wrong with me and after so much work to show something might be wrong, then I find out everything is fine, so I worried for nothing.
-1	I am usually pretty comfortable visiting the doctor, the only thing that makes me really nervous is having to be completely naked or getting a gynecology exam.
-1	honestly I don't feel anxious or worried about anything I will revenue the truth about what's going on with my Health then someone told me a Lie
-1	I hardly ever feel anxious or worried or upset or uneasy or dreadful when visiting the doctors office 
1	hearing bad news.  Sometimes I think ignorance is bliss.
-1	Because I am male and my doctor is female and I am conscious of myself. I know she is a medical professional, but I just get a bit anxious. 
-1	I have only felt anxious around a new doctor once or twice. This anxiety would likely be multiplied if the care provider were significantly younger than myself. Otherwise, I don't have issues with anxiety surrounding doctors appointments.  
1	I just do not like the whole experience, or the sterile smell of the health care faculties. 
-1	Coming back with results hoping they didn't pick up someone information .I don't want to be treated for something I don't have by someone making a mistake 
-1	i can not really pinpoint anything that makes me worried when I go to the doctor. My blood pressure is never high {white coat syndrome} when my doctor takes it,but when I am somewhere  else or someone else takes it, it usually goes up
1	I feel anxious and worried because I go with a cheater.. So I'm scared that one day in going to go and be diagnosed with something I can't get rid of. 
1	The things that me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office are my test results for my diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure.
1	Fincial requirements are number one. I have insurance but can not afford very much out of pocket expense. As far as whether the treatment is correct, I seldom worry about that cause I can just skip the recommended treatment when I get home. So I have to make sure whatever is done is covered by insurance or I probably will not do it.
-1	BECAUSE YOU HOPE YOUR HEALTHY AND DONT WANNA HERE ANY BAD NEWS. ALREADY DEALLING WITH GOING TO A DOCTOR. THATS WOULD WORRY ANYONE ANYWAYS
1	When i know I have gained weight or not been the best I could be, i worry about the dr's perception of me as well as their chastising me.
1	The anxiety from visiting a doctor's office comes from the worry that the doctor will tell me I have a serious medical problem rather than something trivia and temporary. There is also the dread about entering a hospital even to see the doctor.
-1	I do not usually feel this way but when I do it is usually because I know what I am in for. I typically like to spend time self diagnosing before a visit to the doctor. I usually anticipate the most likely outcomes. I even watch the procedures online in so cases. Knowing whats coming and seeing it become my reality is a little nerve wracking. I get a little anxious from procedures involving me being naked. I think that is just uncomfortable in any case. I also do not enjoy pain so knowing I am getting some stitches can cause some anxiety. 
1	I am turally an anxious person, but when I visit my doctor I'm paranoid he's going to find something that I didn't know was wrong with me. I think this is tural.
-1	The one thing that makes me most anxious when I visited the doctor is anything that has to deal with needles. I do not like needles. The nurses can never find my veins. 
-1	Sometimes the wait time makes me a bit anxious and worrisome, almost as if I would like to hurry up and get things over with.
1	I never know problems he might find and that uncertainty makes me feel anxious. This especially happen when he takes my blood pressure which has a tendency to be on the high side.
1	that he will tell me that i have a brain tumor and that it is uncurable and that i will die soon and that there is nothing that they can do
1	I very nervous/ anxious to talk to him about my chronic pain. He gets very gruff and makes a mean face. I don't think Alabama believes in pain management. 
-1	What makes me feel anxious is finding out a health condition that I didn't know I had or finding out treatments that can be done for a health condition that I'm not comfortable with
-1	I never feel anxious or worried when I visit my doctorI have total faith and trust in him and never doubt him 
1	Not knowing how severe the condition is. Hoping it's not as big as I'm thinking in my mind. Thinking I will never felt as good as I once felt. Thoughts I'm sure alot of people have.
-1	Honestly, the only thing that bothers me is the long wait. Besides that.... nothing really makes me anxious...I figure the worst that will happen is I find out I have some kind of flesh eating disease.
-1	If the doctor found something strange or maligns after the tests.  If I have a chronic condition that affects my entire life. 
-1	Most of the time I am not very anxious nor worried when visiting the doctor's office. But when I am it is probably because I am over thinking my sickness.
1	I feel most anxious when I go into the doctor's office for blood tests and to get shots because I greatly dislike needles. 
1	I feel anxious or worried when I feel I haven't followed the doctor's instructions properly or have been lax regarded my own health. When I am disappointed in myself, I am anxious in anticipation of telling the doctor the problem, because I don't want him to be disappointed in me.
1	I really don't know I just feel worried.i just wish I had god to come and tell me what to do.i really need Jesus more on my life
1	I'm general worried that something is going on that will make it harder for the people in my life to take care of me
1	Of course I am concerned there may be some serious issue that I didn't know about. Everyone is a bit paranoid about their health and little pains or symptoms that they experience.
1	The thing that makes me anxious when visiting the doctor's office is the possibility that I could have a health problem. This makes me anxious because even when you live a healthy lifestyle, you can randomly get health problems. So it is this dread of the unknown that makes me anxious when visiting the doctor's office. 
-1	I feel anxious and worried that I will be given news that I am seriously not well and may need surgery.
1	Why not feel anxious?  I might have some sort of disease and I don't like anyone touching me period.  I hate going to the hospital it's a depressing place to be.
-1	
-1	I do not experience anxiety ot worry very much about going to the doctor.  For me, it is more worrying when I can do it between work, kids, homelife, etc.
-1	Waiting for a result. There are times when you may not get a result back for a week or two, and you have to wait to see what is going to happen next. In that waiting time, you have to pick your head up and continue on, as hard as it may be. 
-1	When you go to the doctor you never know what bad news you can get especially when waiting for a blood reault
-1	I am most anxious about the cost of testing and treatment.  My copay is inexpensive, but some other areas of my insurance are not. 
-1	I suffer from an anxiety disorder, as well as depression.  I dread appointments with my doctor because they make me fell anxious.  In addition, I have social anxiety.  
1	If I'm seeing a doctor for a specific problem (rash or cold or pain), I think it's normal to worry about what they might find. As a general rule, going to the doctor for check-ups doesn't bother me, though I do worry they'll find something wrong sometimes.
-1	Nothing really nowâ because we have had the same Doctor for several years and we know him and converse openly with him. He is friendly and remembers persol details about us which help a lot. He is always open and honest and has always taken very good care of us when we have had needs. We both go to the Doctor regularly and because of that and our relationship with the Doctor there is a large level of comfort now
1	I never feel that way with my doctor.  He makes me feel comfortable and he is easy to talk to.  I am pretty healthy, so no reason to worry.
-1	Because I worry about that something is wrong with my body like perspiring too much when I exercise. She did a papsmear and did not find anything so I felt better. I worry about bad results.
1	I do not like being scrutinized with weight, blood pressure etc. I would prefer to never go to the doctor, however I know I need to. I don't always feel that doctors are really listening to all of my symptoms and I don't like taking unnecessary medications.
1	I feel most worried and anxious when I have to get my blood drawn and do test or they have to prick me or give me shots
-1	I always think there is something wrong with me. I'm a little hypochondriac. I think everybody feels the same way when they go to the doctor
1	Worst part is the waiting room, where I come up with worst case scenarios in my mind about all the horrible things that arenât wrong, but they could be. Basically my own mind is why Iâm anxious and worried, nothing more.
1	I feel that they try to rush and find easy solutions and not find out what the problems actually are.  I feel that they don't listen to patient concerns or problems.  I feel that doctors see patients as money and not actual people.
-1	probably the thing that makes me the most anxious if having to wait a long time past my appointment time.
-1	I get the most anxious in expecting a negative outcome. Aside from that I am not really anxious or worried at all about visiting the doctor's office.
-1	I usuall don't worry too much. The uncertainty of what may be found this time pops into my head but it is a minor issue.
-1	I am afraid that my blood pressure is going to be high and then this will be the visit I'm stuck on blood pressure meds.
1	I worry that I will have bad test results or that I will be kept waiting too long
-1	Waiting for the results to any text makes me worried or anxious. Not too other things make me anenxious at the doctor. The doctors office had a calming feel to it. I know that i take care of myself physically and mentally so i do not worry about negative results. I just get a little nervous during long Waiting processes. 
-1	Nothing about going to the doctor makes me feel this way.  Usually I feel annoyed because of the kids, the waiting, and the cost.
1	I worry that the doctor will find something going on in me that I will not be able to afford the treatment for, or that the treatment will have serious side effects. I worry that the doctor might see something embarrassing or shame me for being overweight.
-1	What makes me the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the possibility of receiving really bad news whether it pertains to me or my children. This holds especially true every time my daughter has a checkup or when my wife and I had our hearts looked at to ensure we didn't have any issues go unnoticed for the majority of our lives.
-1	I am not worried or anxious about life it's in God's hands, my Faith in God has Bless me this far, I believe God has Bless the hands of my care
1	I've always been an anxious person, I tend to think it's because my mother died when I was young. Going to the doctor for anything serious, or a new pain or issue is very nerve wracking for me. It makes me worry about death and what would happen to my kids if god forbid something happened to me.
-1	Hearing news i don't want to hear is what causes the anxiety. That's pretty much it. I'm good on all other fronts. 
-1	The unknown is frightening. I don't live the healthiest lifestyle and I sometimes worry about the further decline of my health as i get older.
-1	finding out I have a seruiuos problem that I am not fully aware of. Certain pains may be a sign of something serious that only a doctor can diagnose
-1	That I will hear bad news, or that I will be told something that will frighten me. I would not like to hear something negative regarding my health if I do not need to. I also dislike hearing possible diagnoses, when there is no reason to be worried about them. 
-1	Other people that are there that may be sick, and I end up catching what they have.
-1	
-1	My blood pressure or cholesterol might be high.  I may have gained weight.  She might tell me to lose weight or start exercising.
1	That main reason for my anxiety when visiting the Doctor is I know it is going to be the same as every other visit.  I try to explain my symptoms and it is like her doesn't listen or doesn't care.  
1	That the condition I'm experiencing may require surgery or some other drastic, or painful measure. Since there's a family history and particular diseases that people with my ethnicity, and men over a certain age experience  (prostate cancer)  I fear that I may have it too. I guess to put it simple, it's the uncertainty and the fact that with certain conditions there's really nothing a patient can do to change the situation. On regular checkups, experiencing a cold or something like that  I'm not as worried since I have had many in my lifetime. I do, however, hate needles so I get antsy when I know I have to get  a shot.
-1	If I am going to see the doctor, I may be anxious or worried that they will find a problem that could be serious.
1	I wonder if the doctors are honest and giving the best treatment practices.  I feel patients can be put in a vulnerable position and many do not know how to get the patient to communicate the symptoms adequately.
-1	Normally, I'm pretty healthy. I think the waiting time both in the lobby and in the examination room just gives the mind enough time to overthink things and think the doctor's going to be coming back with bad news. There's just a sense of uncertainty about what might pop up.
-1	I am worried that they might find something wrong with me. That a routine visit will turn into a disaster.
-1	My doctor's voice on the phone if she calls me.  My doctor's the best in the world. She is good at what she does.
1	The anxiety is more in correlation to waiting than the actual visit, it becomes a bit irritating when your appt was 10 and you're still waiting at 11:20. Thats where my anxiety begins with a trip to the doctor 
1	That he might find something seriously wrong with me. I worry about the side effects of prescriptions prescribed for me. 
-1	I only worry about what health issues may be discovered and what treatment will be prescribed should an issue arise
1	Cancer runs in my family so I am always anxious when having routine tests or examinations that something bad is going to turn up. It is always a huge relief when the appointments are over. 
-1	I always feel like this I'm about to get a cancer diagnosis or something. Or they're going to tell me I tested positive for the next black plague. 
-1	I just don't want to be unhealthy and that makes me anxious. The thought of there being something wrong and how I could afford to take care of myself. 
1	I feel very anxious when I am sick because I don't like not being in control. I don't know that the doctors make me feel any more anxious but they don't necessarily alleviate that anxiety.
-1	I just don't like being in a place that has sick people around since I get sick easily. I don't get extremely worried, but the thought of getting sicks is always just sitting in the back of my mind.
-1	That I'll get sick from being around so many sick people.
-1	When faced with possibility of non routine procedures and making sure all options are exhausted before final decision
1	Because of what he might reveal to you, that make you feel those emotions as too what degree ot help you might nrrd
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried at all when i visit the doctor's office. It's a extremely long wait regardless of appointments but overall pleasant visit.
1	I had a heart condition 5 years ago and I am somewhat trepidatious when scheduling an appointment , as I am committed in making progress and the not knowing can be a little worrisome.
1	As I have gotten older, my Dr's visits have turned from normal visits about a cold or virus to more serious health concerns.  I now worry when I go see my Dr. that I am going to be told some bad news. 
-1	That a problem may be found that I was not aware of or prepared to face.  For the most part, I've never been that anxious over an examination.
-1	maybe the result of a lab test that might show a serious condition.  Awaiting the results of a mammogram.  Awaiting the results of any test that show something is seriously wrong with you. 
1	I really don't feel anxious or worried about seeing a doctor. I am prepared to deal with whatever issues or problems that might arise.
-1	just the office in general, the coldness , and waiting
1	The unknown.  I never have been comfortable with doctors and the older I have gotten, the less I trust doctors, especially since the ovomitdon;tcare tax went into effect and we are refused treatment once we reach the age that we cannot work and support the correct number of career welfare families.  
-1	I don't like being weighed. I am afraid i will have to go to the lab for blood tests. That's all there isn't anything else.  
1	There's always a chance that they are going to see something horrible.
-1	The unknown is what worries me.  It's the idea of the doctor finding something wrong that could be potentially serious and leads to a bad outcome regardless of what a doctor can do.
1	What makes me most anxious or worried is that they will find something unexpected or recommend an invasive procedure.
-1	I think it is the diagnosis itself. My mind goes to a bad place for a bit thinking of the what ifs and the problems I have been having. My grandfather died of cancer 2 years ago because his doctor wasn't thorough and didn't catch the cancer at all. My mind always goes to that instance and I wish it didn't. I don't feel a ton of anxiety but it's enough to make me think back to what happened to my grandfather. I don't want that to be me.
-1	I really dont feel anxious going into a doctor. The only way i'd feel that way, is if I had a cigarette before the appointment.
1	If He is giving the correct Diagnosis and Prognosis of an illness and the correct treatment. If He is doing the correct testing to diagnose illness.
1	If my medical insurance will cover the cost of the bill. Also coverage of medication and whatever tests are to be performed
-1	I feel anxious because I am afraid my doctor will miss something because they don't care that much about my health they just want to prescribe me something expensive and then send me away. 
1	i have anxiety so almost all situations make me anxious i always feel like whatever goes wrong could go wrong
-1	I am sometimes slightly anxious that my Doctor might find something wrong.that I am not aware of.  This has happened several times in my lifetime.
-1	Sometime I feel I may get bad news. I always pray before I go to the doctor that I have great news and no worries 
1	I feel most anxious or worried about any possible negative diagnosis or treatments that might be advised to take (especially if invasive). Just the initial feeling of not knowing what is going on or what the problem is is already enough to cause a general feeling of anxiety. Some testing (and not just treatments) are also worrisome (fear of needles... I go through it, but I still hate any type of needles/pin pricks, etc.).
-1	The anxiety comes from usually not knowing if they ( the doctor) are gonna say im healthy or not. Making sure im as fine as i thought i was walking in their office.
-1	I am older now so things are beginning to fall apart.  It's not necessarily the visit per say but what I have and what it's going to take to clear things up and move on.  Otherwise, my doctor is very capable and knowledgeable.
-1	If it is not a routing check up and there is some physical problem that caused me to go there than I obviously would be concerned that the result might show something I would not be happy about.
1	Doctor are not down to earth at all the women doctors are more down to earth and caring  then the men the Older the better
1	I just feel like I will get bad news about my health, or will not get the answers that I need pertaining to my health issues.
1	Not knowing what my condition is like and the chances of getting some news that might make me worry. Also I worry about the length of time it might take, because often I've waited ridiculous amounts of time. 
1	I am mostly afraid of them telling me something new is wrong that I did not know before and that I will have to start taking some new kind of medications.I can hardly afford what  I am on now even with all of my healthcare. I can only imagine what it would be like if they had to put me on more.
-1	I sometimes dread getting bad test results or trying a new mediciation/treatment that might give me bad side effects. I also don't enjoy needles so that gives me anxiety. 
-1	If I am there for a new health problem and am not sure what the diagnosis will be, I am somewhat worried about what he will tell me.
-1	"For the past couple of years my Dr has been monitoring some ""suspicious nodules "" in my lung. So I always dread going in after having the xrays or Cat Scans done to monitor it. My dad died of lung cancer so it scares me and I dread going in to find out if its ok or not"
-1	I always feel like they may tell me something I dont want to hear or something thats going to be hard for me to correct. I dont like bad news and I never want to hear bad news at all
-1	I am sometimes anxious about what the doctor may tell me about my health condition. It is natural for me to feel that way even when the news may be good.
1	Oh there's always the worry they'll find something that ends up being deadly cancer or something. I'm also worried about having to do the prostate thing because I'm getting to the age where it's going to happen so I'm a bit anxious about that.
1	I don't like doctor's offices, needles, or exams. Anything out of my normal routine makes me nervous.
-1	I cannot think of anything about myself that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office.
1	My weight, mostly. Also, if I'm seeing him for a specific pain, I'm not in a good mood to begin with! I worry if there's something really wrong sometimes.
1	Finding out bad news, undergoing a physical examination that is either embarrassing or painful, and the overall waiting factor of being in a doctor's office.
-1	I am worried that I would get a troubling diagnosis.  I am worried about the potential high costs of any treatment I receive and if I am able to pay them.
1	What makes me feel most anxious and worried is the fact I may not get the proper help I want. Sometimes doctors fail to understand what I am experiencing and I end up not getting much help.
-1	Right now I'm uneasy because the treatment that has worked for me in the past is being denied to me, and the new treatment has caused a 50 lb weight gain (I was a perfectly healthy, trim weight before!). And when that comes up, doctors don't like to acknowledge the treatments I am on are the main culprit of the weight gain. They just blame me, which is dumb since I have ALWAYS been trim, and was looking good at 45 before all these stupid treatments. 
1	I have a rare and incurable autoimmune condition. It can manifest over time in several ways, one of which is almost total paralysis and untimely death.  OF COURSE I'm terrified of a full work-up, because there's always a very realistic possibility that the next news I hear will be a slow-motion death sentence.
-1	The bills afterwards. I am not really to anxious with the visits.
-1	I really don't know I just be very please nervous nervously nerves be bad as hell . Never worried just be very nervous.
1	I just feel worried that they don't have my best interest at heart. They just want to line their own pockets. They also don't spend much time explaining things or giving altertives.
-1	I do not remember feeling anxious or worried about a doctor's visit.  I am always prepared to hear what my doctor has to say, what he will ask me and what treatment he may recommend.  I am 71 years old and am very familiar with the procedure of a doctor's visit.
-1	
-1	They will rush you. Support staff seems disinterested and abrupt. Lack of professionalism in general and seem almost undereducated.
-1	Just having to be there, really. What if they find something wrong, what if there's some sort of problem, etc. Its more general, low key anxiety than anything specific. 
-1	I'm not typically worried or anxious when I visit a doctor's office.
1	I am very overweight and I'm always worried that doctor's will disregard me or judge me when they see my size and weight. I'm very self conscious about my weight and body type, and I also worry that doctor's will just see me as a problem due to my weight. 
-1	That my BP reading for that visit may not be in the good range for some reason.  Other than that, I don't usually feel anxious or worried.
1	I used to feel worried when discussing the symptoms and progression of sickness. Now I don't care to the same degree unless I am presented with a new symptom. 
1	The doctor commenting on my weight
1	I mostly feel anxious when I am at the doctor because I don't like needles or pain whatsoever. If I have to give blood or get an exam, I get so nervous because the pain makes me feel sick.
-1	not  sure   how to  react to  finding out  what  is wrong  with me  after the last time i  found  out   about my  having cancer   when  my  primary doctor  tells me  my pain  in my side  was  all in my  head  .
1	They don't care about my health and won't help me when I clearly need it. It's more important to push people through so others can be seen and they can make money than to listen to the concerns of their patients.
1	Being 67 years old, I know that age brings about potential health issues.  Also being fairly healthy my whole life, the law of averages may rear its ugly head.  I know I do not always eat right and not exercise enough and I know the doctor will ask, I will be honest and he will prod me to do better.
-1	The most anxious part of my Drs visits is getting weighed since I have a weight problem. I never want to weigh more then I did on my last visit.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried at all when I go to the doctors. I might feel a little upset if there if a long wait and this might also make a little anxious.
-1	The thought he may find something wrong with me that could be a long term problem. I feel good, but you never know as you age things happen.
1	Because I did not want the doctor to find anything wrong with me because sometimes things are hitting that you are not aware of until you get examination from your doctor that they can tell something has been going on with your body
1	Only thing makes me nervous is something unexpected is diagnosed like cancer, otherwise I feel good going to Dr
-1	I am a hypochondriac and believe that even the most minor symptom is due to something larger and i'm dying. When I visit the doctor, i feel he will confirm that i'm really sick,
-1	MY BIGGEST FEAR IS MY WEIGHT. I ALWAYS SAY I WILL LOSE BEFORE MY NEXT APPOINTMENT, BUT I SELDOM DO. I KNOW THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO HER, SO IT BECOMES A WORRY TO ME ALSO. I HAVE ANXIETY SO I ALWAYS WORRY MY APPOINTMENT WILL BE DELAYED, BUT SHE IS USUALLY ON TIME WHICH I APPRECIIATE
1	i'm afraid they will find something seriously wrong with since we all have to die sometime. i'm 54 now and in good health but you never know.
1	I think lack of trust is a big issue. I'm also squeamish about needles and other procedures. Also, bad memories about my parents' medical treatment.
1	What makes me most anxious is the thought of something being seriously wrong with me. I avoid going to the doctor as much as possible just because I really do not want to know if there is something wrong with me.
1	if the doctor will find something seriously wrong; what are my options; how will I handle it; how will I manage it and what do I do financially to handle it?
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I am attending these types of appointments because I am a laid back and relaxed person. I taking everything one step at a time and see no reason to stress over anything.
-1	I do not experience this emotion when seeing my doctor. I am never anxious or worried, as nothing wrong happens with my primary care.
-1	Not knowing if everything's gon be okay or if there's some issue the doctor might discover that I didn't know about.
1	You are not sure about the results that they give you and the long term effects on your life and family. This is very important information and thus cause worry and uneasiness because you now have to think about the next step based on the resuts/ diagnosis received  
-1	concerns that my health conditions might get worse. finding something new that i havent had before. possiblily being put in an assisted living situation or in the hospital for non-compliance with medical treatment
-1	Nothing make me feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor because I am not that person I alway feel good about my visit
1	Having to wait a long time and not being admitted during my scheduled appointment and being in a room with sick people. 
1	Hit the gym and then I will be there for a while ago and it was good and you can do that to me that he 
-1	When I am waiting to be told what is wrong, because you are left in a room alone for a decent amount of time. Your mind seems to wonder off and start thinking of everything that could be wrong. 
1	the feeling that given my age i might be diagnosed with a serious, life-threatening or costly condition. Or even worse, I condition for which I am referred to a specialist and they disagree in prognosis with the primary physician. 
-1	Getting to my appointment on time makes me a little anxious. Other than that i am pretty comfortable with going to the doctor.
1	unnecessary tests and procedures make me nervous. I don't like to have anything done that I do not feel I need.
-1	There is nothing that really makes me anxious Uncertainty when I'm not sure why I'm not feeling well
-1	I really don't suffer from anxiety at all when visiting the doctor. Potentially missing work is the only thing that worries me.
-1	I think I am generally uncomfortable with visiting a doctor's office. I have never had a particularly bad experience at a doctor's office, but I find going to appointments to be an unpleasant but necessary thing to do. I am also a bit disturbed by having to share breathing space with other sick people in the waiting room, etc...
1	I always worry that there may be something serious with my health.  Recently I have started to have all sort of problems.  There seems to be something with every part of my body.  
-1	I feel a little anxious going to the doctor on the account of the results going to a doctors appointment
-1	I am comfortable with the exam and tests themselves. What makes me feel anxious is the results of any tests or exams. I guess you could say the unknown. 
-1	I imagine I would be worried or anxious if I thought I would be found to have a serious illness or condition.  I have not had to face that situation so I am not usually worried when I see the doctor.
-1	Nothing really makes me feel worried about. I just go to the doctor to get my check ups done, ask my doctor about my health 
-1	Unexpected changes in weight, blood pressure, etc. (i.e. the unknown.)
1	Recieving bad news. Getting a wrong diagnosis.
-1	Just the fact that I am visiting a doctor. Also don't know what things like my blood pressure or weight or pulse will turn out to be.
1	I am always scared they will tell me I am overweight first off. Then just the initial exam I am afraid that I will have some sort of disease that is really bad because I am terrified of death.
1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because I am worry about that the doctor will tell me some bad news about my health
-1	I really dont feel anxious or worried during a visit to the doctors office.  Doctor's are professionals, and if I felt rushed or uneasy, I would have changed doctors.
-1	I would be worried that something may be bad as I get older.  I typically have good health, but always think the next visit could show a bad diagnosis, worse health, etc...something that could impact my family as well as myself.
-1	Not knowing if they are going to find something is wrong with me, also it is very costly to go to a doctor.
-1	The only thing that really worries me is that they will find something bad, like cancer or something that will be expensive or difficult to treat. And depending on what happens with the ACA, I am also a little worried about what they will notate in my file. 
1	I worry that I will be criticized, belittled, or that they will find something significantly wrong with me, such as cancer.
1	I worry that there will be something seriously wrong even if I am just going in for a cold.  Many times I think about what could be the worst possible scerio as far as sickness could go.  Or I am afraid that the doctor won't be able to figure out what the problem is and I will have to continue to be in pain.
1	I just generally dont like going to the doctor because you have to wait forever to be seen and then you have to sit in the waiting room exposed to all the other sick patients. Also i dont like taking medicine especially pills .
1	When I have a gut feeling that something is wrong. I try to do as much research about what I think is wrong before seeing my doctor so I know what to ask and that makes me anxious.
1	I am worried since I am getting older that something will go wrong. As you age, it's sure that something won't work like it used to.  I want to make sure that I am examined thoroughly and that the doctor spends time doing the appropriate tests.
1	The fear of something being wrong. Especially when I am feeling pain I do not know what to expect. That's why I get nervous 
-1	My blood pressure too high,and worried about weight gain. I worry mostly about the cost of visit, and how I am going to pay for extra tests
-1	I am always anxious about my blood work.   However, nothing ever turns up bad so that is a relief.  
1	I would feel the most anxious about finding out bad news.  I would be worried about finding out I have a health problem.
1	My health isn't stellar, and I often worry that there's going to be a new condition pop up that I haven't had to contend with before. 
1	What make me most anxious is the results that I have to find out. I think everyone that goes to the doctor's office always worry about if anything is serious or not. At least that is how I feel when I go there.
1	I am normally not nervous, anxious, or worried when I visit the doctor's office. I go expecting a through examination. I pray about any pending test results. 
1	I am worried that the doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. 
1	I get anxious because of the possibility that I might be leaving with bad news. I hate finding out bad news.
1	I worry about what the diagnosis might be, and I worry about my health issues. I also tend to be anxious about how the doctor might treat me as a person, or how they will explain things in a way i might understand and be honest with me. 
-1	this is a strange question considering that I checked off in the previous page that I don't worry or become upset.Is it possible that this is a biased survey?I am aware of my own overall health and don't leave my health status up to a physician to second guess.
-1	That they might find something wrong with me
1	When visiting a doctor's office, I feel anxious or worried because I am afraid they will try to prescribe medication for me I do not want/ or need.
1	Finding out that is something seriously wrong with me is usually the top worry of mine. You could be feeling fine but there may be an underlying issue that you didn't even realize was present. The cost of going to the doctor is also something that I worry about since my insurance is not that good.
-1	The only thing I get anxious about is when I have to get a flu shot or my blood drawn. I have needles and they freak me out otherwise I am fine.
1	It just the simple fact of being unsure about what I'm about to find out the unknown and whether it will have an effect on my life 
-1	I get nervous going to the dr. I am very healthy but I am always concerned I am going to get random devastating news every time I go
-1	when you go to the doctor and they take to long to give you the results and answer questions you may have 
-1	I still fear needles so I feel anxious when anything with needles is required. This includes vaccines and blood tests. Even the prick finger tests make me fear.
-1	It worries me that my doctor or PA may find cancer or so other illness or disease . I have no medical background as I am adopted, so I have nothing to watch for. It is very worrisome that some type of cancer or major illness may be found.
1	The process of getting vitals taken is nerve wrecking at times as you hope they are okay. It makes you worry as you often sit in a room waiting to hear what's wrong, if anything. 
-1	I don't usually feel upset or worried when visiting my doctor's office.  The last time I had blood work done I was a little nervous to get the results of the tests back, but they made me feel at ease and told me ways to improve my numbers and things I could do to better my health overall. 
1	I may find something out that I don't want to know so that is why I am worried when I go to the doctor most of the time but I always walk out happy 
1	The money and asking the doctor to complete forms.  They're so ready to treat conditions, but won't document it outside their notes.
1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried is not being taking seriously. It seems most doctors are so quick to send you on their way so that they can get to their next patient. It is so hard to find a doctor who acts they actually care now - a - days. Im also worried about being treated for the wrong thing while the real problem is growing stronger. I had a friend who had a tumor the size of a basket ball on her uterus. The doctor told her she was pregnant. So for two months she walked around thinking she was pregnant. Turns out she had a very progressed cancer tumor on her uterus. She almost died from being mis- diagnosed.
-1	I dread the thought of the doctor finding out that I did not do what he told me to, or did not take the medication as prescribed.
1	What makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office is wondering how I am being judged by the doctor. The doctors and nurses are human too and it is embarrassing if something happens to me that does not normally happen if someone had taken care of themselves better. Like going to the dentist for example and having bad teeth because I donât brush everyday and could be prevented if I werenât so lazy. Or getting a UTI or a yeast infection because I was holding my pee for too long when I shouldnât have or not wiping myself properly.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious about visiting a doctor is a general anxiety of being in public places in general, along with the likelihood of being undressed. Also, I usually only visit a doctor is there is a problem, so there is some anxiety as to what the problem may be.
-1	I don't really get anxious or worried at the doctor most of the time. Sometimes if I have a problem that could be potentially serious I'll feel uncomfortable, but that has only happened once or twice. I also don't really like undressing at the doctor, but I opt not to and my doctor is fine with it.
1	"I have general anxiety disorder - my default brain state is slightly worried, with a tendency to latch onto any ""abnormal"" event as a cause for worry/stress/bad reaction. Specifically with doctor's visits I worry that they will ""find something"" wrong. There is really no reason behind it, and I am fully aware of this. I can deal with it, but I still have to experience it. I actually relax/do better if they do find something, because then I can talk about it, get, and give more info. It is mostly the unknown that is bothersome to my brain."
1	Just the thought that something serious could be wrong.  The thought I might catch something from the other sick people.  That I might have to have some kind of treatment.  That I might have to have a shot.
-1	Just worried that something might be wrong. I'm in relatively good health, but there's some family history that always worries me: anemia, cancer, and heart problems. 
1	sometimes i get nervous when iam at the doctors because i had bad problems withn that when i was a kid and i never liked going to doctors and things that just scare me .
-1	Having little time with him because he stays busy all day, so I worry I may not get the time I need to talk about what is happening with me. 
1	Nothing i don't let them worry me because I don't care if I have something or not I'm going to die of something 
1	The doctor looking at my body makes me self conscious and I'm worried that when they're talking to me I'll look dumb
1	I get worried about what he is going to say and i feel embarrased about my problems but would be more comfortable with a female doctor.
1	If I already have a bad feeling before going to a doctor then I will be worried that they might confirm my suspicions.
-1	Anixous that there will be something wrong.
-1	I get anxious about  having my blood pressure read.  It seems it always goes up when I first walk into the office.
1	I am generally in good health so I don't need to visit the doctor's often.  When I do, it's usually for something that has me quite worried so it's just that.
-1	Worried that the doctor will miss something or discover something I was unaware of.  Anxiety comes from being in the doctors office for a sickness that I want cured and having to rely on someone else to make the right choice as to what best cures that sickness. Sometimes I also get a little uneasy challenging the doctor.  For example, if I think one medication is better suited to my sickness, but the doctor is recommending something else. 
1	What makes me feel anxious when I am visiting the doctor is wondering what my health problem is. There could be some kind of underlying issue that could be very serious and you don't know until you are actually checked out by the doctor.
1	If I am going in about a problem I am worried about what he tells me is wrong with me. I am worried that it will be something serious that would require more medical attention from a professiol.
1	I am a person that gets worried every time i go to the doctor.  I'm just afraid i will hear something bad while there.  Normally, everything is just fine and once i get into the examination room i start to relax.  Maybe, its all the other people in the waiting room, the long waits, ect that make me anxious.  
-1	I wasn't sure what my test results would be, so I was nervous about the test and outcome. I did not want to find out something was wrong. 
-1	nothing does    again, stop requiring such as long answer  it's not necessary   blah blah blah blah blah
1	I am most anxious when I don't see eye to eye with my doctor. I will always advocate for myself and sometimes that is mistaken for aggression from a physician. It makes me feel uneasy to have to question a doctor. 
-1	I worry about not making the appointment on time. I have to take the bus and make at least one transfer so there is a question of missing the appointment.
1	I'm most anxious and worried because you never know when something serious could be found an no one wants bad news about their health
-1	I have a  great faith not in my doctor but the doctor of all doctors he is concerned about me and my well being 
1	I have been refused meds when I needed them, because I would not play their games. Fear that it will happen again. 
-1	it's just all the procedures you have to go through, some embarrassing instances & all the forms you have to fill out
1	I am just worried they will comment on something that will make me uncomfortable. I once had a Dr yell at me about my pulse rate but this was after the receptionist told me my insurance was canceled. I panicked but it was a clerical error on her part and was quickly fixed. My heart was racing and I hadnât fully calmed down yet. 
-1	I mostly have positive feelings when a doctor is examining me because if I get a clean bill of health, then obviously, that's a positive result but even if the dr does find something wrong, I'd rather know about it so that I can do what I need to to overcome it.
1	I feel worried about what could be wrong. I rarely will see a doctor due to the fear that something major could be wrong medically. Also anxious due to feeling like the Dr does not want to be bothered with me as a patient.
1	That I'm not getting the best help possible. That my doctor is so preoccupied with what's wrong with his next patient or the one in the other room that I know he's go back and forth between that he's not paying the least bit attention to what is going on in my room. 
-1	Nothing really, maybe if they leave the examination room ans don't return for a while, I may get a little tense, thinking that something on my account is delaying their return.
1	Doctor is going to confirm my suspicions about something that is wrong with me. Basic concerns about being right about my own knowledge of my body. 
-1	If i have a new doctor that is maybe filling in for my regular doctor I tend to get a little anxious. Also nurses and receptionists can make or break my appointment, therefore I like when they are nice people.
-1	Because sometimes I get sick enough that I would go see a Dr at a government hospital and the Dr would need to look into my ears with a light prob or feel parts of my upper body and ask questions.
-1	Getting there on time and hoping to not have to wait, sometimes the uncertainly always makes  me nervous.
-1	My problem with the doctors visit is paying for the co-pays. Sometimes I can't. I hope that I am getting the correct medicine when I tell the doctor I need generic versions of medicine prescribed. 
-1	The main thing I'm fearful of is contracting something else considering my weak immune system.  If my health isn't good or if I've dropped weight I feel anxious because I know we'll have to talk about it.  I work as hard to keep on weight as other people do to lose weight.
1	I don't like having people i don't know well touching me. I also have a small fear that the visit will result in the knowledge that I have a large medical problem.
1	I'm now at the age where there is a possibility of receiving terrible news.  It ins't likely but still possible.
1	I don't feel that way at all.  I have not idea what to tell you about because I don't have any of those problems.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried.  I am prepared to accept anything that comes my way.  The only way I will be able to stop giving my murderis ex 65% of my only income, SS, is to die.
1	I feel anxious because even though I know there is most likely a problem I hate to hear that I have a problem. It's an anxiety that I have always had before visiting a doctor or dentist.
1	Finding out something is wrong with me. And then having to go through a struggle to receive correct treatment. Also the fear that I will be misdiagnoses in the first place.
-1	
1	Whenever I see the doctor, I get anxious as I always have the thought in the back of my mind, that I might have a serious, incurable illness.  It is one of those things that I can't let go, and worries me.
1	I fear that they are going to come back and go we just found something terribly wrong with you and... That or its we need to get you on this medication and its going to cost a bazillion dollars and you better take it or there is nothing I can do for you. Or lets run these other tests that I am pretty sure are unreleated but they will boost my bottom line so lets do these. To which I know I will have to seem like a butthead as I ask what specifically they need that test for and why. But of course I dont always trust the answer as again its for making money.
1	If I'm going there about something that I've noticed as a problem, I fear that it is some bigger problem that could be painful/long treatment to fix if it is even fixable.  I also know there are some issues in my family that could someday present themselves in me and I really don't want to have those problems.
-1	most likely the unknown of what exactly is wrong. 
-1	There's always a slight fear that he is going to tell me something is wrong.  Even though I know it is unlikely it crosses my mind, 
1	I don't like being weighed and evaluated by the medical assistant. I would rather not see so many people when getting care.
1	I'm more worried that I will have to see a doctor who doesn't know me at all.  That's a possibility with clinics.  I have chronic health issues and hate it when I have to explain everything from the beginning - 26 years ago they started.  
-1	If they were to tell me that I have a loss or restriction of mobility.
1	I always fear a negative diagnosis such as a termil disease or serious debilitating condition.  Some of the tests are not fun either.  Such as blood tests.  
1	I don't care for going into doctor's offices or hospitals.  It makes me nervous due to the fact that I could come in contact with germs and illness.  I also dislike people poking and prodding me.  I don't care for testing they do either.
1	"They're going to want to order more tests ""just to be sure"" so that our understanding goes from 90% likely to 92% likely, but these new tests are going to cost me enough to take years to pay off."
-1	I am always about any appoiment, every time I go se the doctor I just don't like to wait.
1	First off I have social anxiety and general anxiety. So everything makes me anxious.  Second off having a strange person poke and prod at me bothers me to a high degree.  Then there is the worry about whether something is wrong physically with me.  
-1	sometimes having ot ask for my anti depressant medicine to be refilled gives me a little anxiety because I kinda still feel ashamed and wnoder if they really want to fill it for me.
-1	Nothing really. I just go there and they take care of things. It takes a bit of extra time out of my day but it's only a hour. 
1	I have anxiety disorder so it's mostly just that. any kind of appointment makes me anxious in general so that doesn't help. 
1	It is always the test results. They give me so much anxiety, it makes me nervous and I even start shaking sometimes.
-1	The only time I'm worried if there is something wrong that I haven't had looked at yet or if I'm waiting for results.
1	It makes me worried that i might have something that makes my lifetime shorter. I alway try to be as healthy as possible but i worry that i do some things wrong with my life.
-1	There is nothing that makes me feel uneasy when I go to the doctor as I am kind feeling what to expect
-1	The only thing that bothers me is that they might not get the diagnosis correct. 
-1	I tend to worry in general, and when I get blood work done I worry that my results will not be good. I worry that conditions that I have will not improve from one appointment to the next. I'm on medication for these conditions and I worry that a combition of these medications and changes I've made to my diet and lifestyle won't have a positive effect. So far I have had positive results, but I worry every time that that won't continue. When I first started seeing my primary care doctor I was worried that I might not like her or might not be comfortable with her, but we have developed a pretty good relationship. 
-1	The only thing that makes me nervous is finding something wrong that I wasn't aware of.I also worry about the costs of any procedure that is necessary.
1	I usually feel worried about what the results of my health assessment might be. I also get nervous about interacting with doctors (or people) in general, but I usually tell myself there isn't much to worry about just to calm myself down. 
1	I worry what they are going to find wrong with me and I hate being referred to Doctor after Doctor. and they can't find what's wrong with me I just get real anxious and uneasy because it seems it always ends with me seeing Dr after Dr
-1	the wait time is too long and the cost is way too high and they only see you for a minute and never listen to you
-1	That something might be wrong or anything can happen u know am I going to get wat I came for done right am I going to found out more then I want to know n then I just be like y be so worried it's God will not mind so if anything wrong oh well be it way won't kill me Will make me stronger
-1	I would be concerned about learning that my health has deteriorated in any way based on lab results and in-office examination.
1	I don't know my new doctor and we have already had some head butting so I am not sure what to expect when I go into to see her.
-1	When my doctor is checking my weight I get worried because I am trying to lose weight to control my diabetes 
-1	I feel worried if I think I will get a bad result or hear something I don't want to. I also get nervous around needles. 
1	I have a general anxiety towards all doctors and healthcare providers. My doctor I trust very well but I still feel somewhat anxious when seeing any kind of healthcare provider. This is something that I just have to deal with when seeing a doctor.
1	I often think about the outcomes of some tests I have to take. I am just not sure how they will come out.
1	They do not listen to what you say and how your feeling. They just take a guess and most times my doctor is wrong and I am right. it upsets me alot but i have so many issues I hate the work of changing doctors.
1	I have social anxiety and any time I have to go to an office and talk about personal things it's very difficult for me.
1	My doctor expects me to follow his medical advice.  I am always concerned about how well I followed his advice.  I follow it to the best, but I hope I do not fail.
-1	"The chance that she might have  ""bad"" news for me. Something that might alter my life expectancy or be potentially fatal. In general though these thoughts aren't that strong; just a moderate sense of worry."
1	If a doctor does not take a test or takes too many tests. Also, if a doctor takes an educated guess without taking a test and reveals it to the patient.
1	not knowing what they find  out about your health  i get scared and anxious all the time especially just waiting  in the room
-1	I get anxious when I don't know the doctor and do not have a rapport or have had a bad personal experience with the doctor. 
1	I'm afraid of getting bad news related to my health. It's like going to the dentist and expecting a cavity needing to be filled.
-1	Mostly my weight and my blood pressure and   my sugar levels. Mostly my a1c and my weight. I  also do not  like to take blood work or being stuck with a needle. 
-1	More often than not it is just my own imagination conjuring up the worst case scenarios for simple illnesses/problems. There is nothing about the actual visit that makes me anxious. I put it all on myself.
1	The thought that there might be something medically wrong with me or I may be unhealthy. I am afraid they will tell me bad news.
-1	I don't know if it will be good news or bad news when something is wrong with me. What if it is something serious but it makes me worried if he just ignores it or does not take it seriously. I just normally get anxious because sometimes you just don't know what it is your'e going to expect.
-1	If the doctor seems to be in too much of a hurry, I still need to get complete information, and I try hard not to be impolite in doing so; it can be frustrating.
-1	I feel anxious about any examination in general. Being checked out physically can be a little stressful for me. I don't like being poked and prodded. 
-1	The waiting is mostly the only thing that will make me feel that way. Then actually going into the office for the first thirty seconds. And lastly just waiting for either the good or bad answers.
1	I am often sick and have chronic health conditions, that sometimes require hospitalizations. I hate being in the hospital or taking extra medicine or getting stuck with needles. 
-1	I normally don't feel anxious/worried but when I do it is normally when I get results of things such as blood test.
-1	I feel anxious or worried because, you never heart something good always you find people seek or having terrible diseases,
1	I don't like when there is something wrong with me and I don't know what it is. My fears get the best of me and I worry a lot.
1	I have been misdiagnosed 3 times in 3 years - given the wrong med for my conditions, and each time it looked as though I was having a major health issue, when it was only the wrong med.
-1	I wish I could lose the weight I need to.  I don't want a suggestion of weight loss surgery.  I feel so disappointed when I go in and I have lost very much or gained.
1	The man barely looks me in the eye. He's very brusque. 
1	well sometime sitting in the waiting room i may have a problem with.but besides that i think they do a really good job
1	Not noing the outcome of a test the waiting on outcome of it hopeing the outcome is not bad that it lest than that that all.
1	If I am getting a pap smear, I have been hurt in the past because of carelessness. So, I almost always tense up when I am getting that done due to past trauma.
1	that hd wont listen to me... fearful of set results.. and also he wont listen to me... he thinks im crazy
-1	I have not had an occasion to be anxious or worried in a doctor's office since I was cured of cancer.
-1	I'm most anxious or worried when I don't know what's going on (with a medical issue). Like a lot of people, I tend to look things up on the Internet and can scare myself with possible illnesses, but I always check things out with my PCP and they usually turn out to be not as serious as I thought (and then I feel silly). 
1	The only time I am anxious   when I visit the doctor is when I am expecting bad news. It could be when I am expecting a bad result because of recent events or symptoms
-1	Might be anxious because, hate waiting to see him.. Then might be worried because bad news!! But overall, have no problem when I have to see my doctor.
1	Worried about the doctor correctly diagnosing my problem and not just guessing and prescribing pills that will cause side effects
-1	I just don't know what will come out their mouth. I also don't know what's going on with my body sometimes. It can have you anxious to know whats going on.
-1	
-1	I am nervous about my weight and what they will say to tell me to lose it.  I get anxious that I will be judged.  I hate putting on a thin gown and the office always seems cold.  I hate the paper and waiting an undisclosed amount of time.
-1	I don't get anxious or worried going to my doctors for a physical checkup it's just a regular checkup that shouldn't be anything to worry about at all 
1	I am worried about the diagnosis I may receive and whether or not I will be able to afford the treatment or medications I need. My main concern is the cost of treatment.
-1	I think that it would be the part about receiving the worst information about your health. I think that interacting with your doctor should not make a patient anxious or worried, what worries me is receiving bad news from the doctor. Waiting for those test results is also very worrisome. 
1	I have a tendency to avoid going to the doctor unless it's necessary (even though I know it's not smart), so when I do go, it's usually because something is wrong. I worry that it's going to be something more serious than what I expect, or that something else wrong will be found. It's not really the exam itself that bothers me, but the potential for serious health problems.
-1	When I have to wait a long time in the waiting and in the exam room. If the front desk is unpleasant and not approachable. Or when the Dr. Leaves the exam room and takes a long time to come back.
-1	Usually it has to do with seeing how much weight I have gained. Other than that, my anxiousness could only be due to the unknown. But I have full trust in my PCP. 
-1	that they will have bad news about i test i did before hand or not be able to treat an sickness/illness
-1	I feel most anxious or worried that there will be some bad diagnosis but in general I don't tend to worry about this because I have good health.  I would only worry if I had symptoms that were concerning or alarming, and this has never really happened to me.
-1	I am always worried that I will have a serious illness or disease that is incurable. These are not the fault of the doctor but my own fears. I think especially because of my family's past that I have a higher chance to get cancer.
1	If I need to get a physical exam done other than that I don't usually get worried.  I have had a lot of tests done.
-1	that I might get some disease or virus from the patients in the waiting room or from surfaces in the doctor's office. He also always shakes my hand. 
1	I hate to get weighed at the doctors office. I am uncomfortable with wIting in the exam room also. I get a little nervous and sometimes forget to ask what I want to ask.
-1	The biggest concern is that a serious, non-treatable issue will be uncovered.Going hand in hand with that is that treatment for an uncovered medical issue might not be affordable.
1	the knowing of the basic uncertainty of the whole situation could just routine or a life altering diagnosis.
-1	I usually just worry that things are going to be worse than they actually are. Usually, it turns out to be the opposite, but still. The not know or that feeling that something might actually be really bad is what worries me the most. Sometimes things get in my head that I can't seem to shake off.
-1	I don't like being examined (especially pap smears) and getting shots. I feel most anxious about pain from shots and blood tests.
1	Overall I do not like doctors, and I have had bad experiences with uncaring doctors before and I do not want to repeat those situations again
1	I am worried that something will be wrong with me. That, or I worry that the doctor may judge me. I'm worried he might think I'm lazy, gross, or don't take catre of myself.
1	Like anyone I worry if he will find something wrong especially if it would be untreatable.   I of couse,worry about weight gain.  
-1	I donât feel nothing at all so I donât know how to answer this question... will get through whatever the outcome is 
-1	Since I am generally healthy, I am not worried or anxious when visiting the doctor.  If anything, I am concerned that my blood pressure will be low at the doctor's, because it does fluctuate a bit, and I don't really want any higher dosages of medication.
-1	When I am sick and not know what is wrong with me, then I have to go to the doctor and find out what my illness is. That make me anxious or has me worry about what it could be and how serious it might be.
-1	Because I want to get it done, so it dosent conflict with my schedule. So i can get get done quickly. In and out.
-1	Finding something wrong with me that I cannot afford to take medication for or something that requires me to be away from home, such as more surgery.  
1	I don't like feeling vulnerable as someone exams me.  I don't like having to get undressed in a cold room or having someone judging me.  If I do go to the doctor, I normally have to have something seriously wrong so I am anxious to find out what the problem is.  
1	Probably just fear of the unknown.  While I'm healthy in general, you never know what might happen or what tests may show to the doctor that you are not even aware about.
-1	I don't. I'm always calm when i visit my Dr
-1	I get the most anxious about how my doc will react to my inability to eat better and lose weight.  He never pressured me about it but I think he is thinking it.  I hate letting him down. 
1	The only thing that makes me nervous is the thought of my doctor actually finding something that could potentially kill me.  I get extremely nervous sometimes, but so far it's always be fine.
-1	Nothing. I am not anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office, any more than I am anxious or worried when going to a barber or auto mechanic. These people are there to help me at my request and direction. If I don't get what I want, I will go elsewhere. 
-1	I sometimes worry about whether or not I am presenting myself properly. I am worried that I may not be able to give all the information I need to in order to make my doctor be well informed.
-1	That they do not understand and beleive me that what I say is the true and not a hypochondriac. My medical disorder is hard to explain and not well know by my doctors.
1	The overall experience that i am going to get. i honestly was looking forward  to a good report. i am anxious about the pills and it's side effects.
1	The blood needle the health and care telling you some is wrong with you health and nutrition take care of your self
1	if they are gonna find something wrong did i loose any weight how much is it goona cost  how often will i have to come back am i gonna have to go for more blood work
1	When you know what the diagnosis is going to be. You have that gut feeling that what is about to be told to you is not what you want to hear.
-1	I don't like to go to the doctors I am worried they will find something wrong and they don't know how to fix the problem 
1	I always worry my regular doctor may not be in.  I don't like talking to new doctors, I have so much wrong it takes forever.  
-1	sometimes i have stuff going on that seems like it could be serious. i also worry that the symptoms i have may not be something that can be easily diagnosed and i can get lost in the world of referrals and tests and different opinions
1	Typically when I go to the doctor's office it is because I have a fear that something is wrong with me. This could be a condition, illness, injury, or anything else really that requires medical attention. I guess more than anything its that fear of the unknown, you go in expecting to hear the worst and hoping for the best. I think that would make anyone anxious, and more importantly I think they have a right to be worried or concerned when all they can do is wait to be told what is wrong with them. 
-1	I never feel anxious or worried when I visit my doctor. As I stated before, I have been with the same doctor for approximately thirty years
-1	Very little.  I have had some very difficult diagnoses to contend with.  I trust that whatever the situation is I will survive in one way or another.
-1	That there might be something wrong with my lab results indicating a problem with my health, like a disease or other issue.
-1	I rarely feel terribly anxious unless I am experiencing a very painful or unusual condition. If that is the case, I am most anxious about receiving a bad diagnosis.
1	I've always had some issues with the doctor and I have no idea why. It's bad enough my blood pressure will actual read out higher when I am at the doctors office.
-1	
-1	I do not like going to the doctor's in general so when I have to go to a doctor I feel restless and worried sometimes for no reason.
1	the doctor will think im insane or depressed. I never take the medication that they gove me so I feel like they wot care
1	I GET IN MY FEELINGS BECAUSE HE JUST DOESN'T ACT LIKE HE CARES. I AM JUST $ IN HIS EYES. HE DOESN'T FULLY EXAMINE ME OR TALK ABOUT BLOOD RESULTS OR ANYTHING. I DON'T ENJOY GOING AT ALL !
-1	I normally don't feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office. One way I would feel worried is if I was experiencing great pain and had to go to the doctors office in order to stop that pain. I generally remain calm and don't expect to find anything too wrong with myself.
-1	I am anxious when i visit the doctor and I can not pin point why I am. I feel like she is rushed and if I have a concern that day they she is not going to talk to me about it. It sort of makes it feel like pointless to even go in to the office.
-1	Some doctors do not value patients' time. They never see patients at the time of the appointment and they do not offer anything to read.
-1	If I have some kind of unexplainable pain or symptom, I worry what might be the cause or the treatment.
1	The most anxious or worried that I feel when visiting the doctors office is if I am feeling symptoms that might indicate something serious. I have a tendency to think the worst of situations and I worry that I would be facing something serious.
-1	Mostly time constrictions, which really has little to do with my doctor at all. She's pretty great, I must say.
-1	That I may be going to the doctors office with one thing wrong with me but I end up finding out about another major problem such as diabetes, cancer, or another serious illness 
1	What makes me feel worried is you never know what's really wrong with you untill you go to the doctor. You might think it is nothing seriously wrong but it can turn out to be worse than you imagined
1	I feel this way when I don't know what is wrong with me. I feel anxious and worried most of the time so its not really towards the doctor 
1	alway the unknown. with you yearly exams.
1	Knowing that a doctor could give me information at any time that could change my life forever makes me a little nervous.  Or when connected to an EKG machine and they tell you not to worry--how can you not be a little nervous.  Or, waiting for a test result that seems to take forever.
1	Nothing usually unless they find something wrong then sometimes I worry but for the most part in pretty healthy
-1	Usually don't feel negative then. Just really dislike having to wait a long time in the waiting room.
1	Just the overall experience. You never know what to expect or what they could find that isn't necessarily good.
-1	I'm always afraid he might find something wrong with me. You neveer know. I don't want to find something wrong with me.
1	Sometimes i fell worried or anxious is whet n i come back to the doctor for results of my examination or a procedure that is uncomfortable to take.
-1	Because you never know what the doctor might find. Your body might have change since the last time that you were seen by the doctor.
-1	"I always have this general feeling that I will receive bad news when I visit the doctor's office even though I usually don't. I'm a healthy individual. But there's always a sense of ""What don't I know?"" that might pop up. Receiving test results always makes me a bit anxious because of a false positive test that I received one time in my life."
1	I HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS.
1	I am always anxious and worried so it would be no different in the doctor's office. I guess I would be concerned that I would find out that I had some incurable disease or something at the doctor's office.
-1	I am worried that something might be wrong. I don't usually go to the doctor so when I do, its because of some pain or problem so I am anxious that it is very serious
1	I don't know what the outcome is going to be.  Is this going to be a serious issue?  Will it be expensive?  Perhaps, I'm also somewhat anxious about whether or not they will be able to tell me what is wrong at all.
1	"Nobody likes to be ""exposed"" to someone they barely know.  This in itself is enough to create an awkward and uncomfortable environment.  Most times I really don't want to know how much I weigh and that always makes me feel crazy too."
1	The first thing that comes to mind is just having an appointment period. Time is precious to me and I am generally kept waiting much longer than my time. I understand this can be necessary but I don't appreciate it every time.  Next, the fear of getting a flu or cold just by visiting the office makes me very anxious. I do worry about how the visit  will go such as if I will get bad news or a lecture. I really dread the lectures. 
-1	Nothing at all makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. They are very god at what they do.
-1	when I am having a physical it always makes me a bit nervous. You know that you are going to be exposing your entire body for the exam andthere is always a bit of a fear deep down that the doctor will find something wrong during the exam.
1	When visiting the doctor's office, I feel most anxious about having my weight and blood pressure checked, because they are usually higher than recommended. I also feel stupid if I need to ask for clarification if I don't understand something the doctor said. And just being around people in general (in the waiting room, for example) makes me very anxious. I fear judgment and criticism, and also fear possibly becoming ill from sick patients.
-1	Waiting around sick people, more often than most.
-1	I have not had any worries when visiting the doctors office.
1	I'm usually worried that something will be wrong with me or that I have something that requires very expensive medicine.
1	Vaccines and tests that are not needed being given. Getting sick from the people around me in the office. 
1	Everything makes me feel animus because I have intense anxiety , it's a son of a bitch . I hate it , everything freaks me out one hundred percent of the time .
-1	Just the fact that I have to go the doctor at all. I have been sick for a while so it just makes me nervous to be there at all, and a little anxious but I know I feel a bit better now, so it is getting better with the axiety.
-1	I don't feel anxious because I've learn other ways to deal with the stress of my job and other life obstacles 
-1	If I am very bad off sick and think I might have a bad disease I am afraid my doctor might give me some bad news telling me I have cancer or something and it's going to kill me and I only have so much time to get my things in order
-1	I never know what is going to be said so I always have some level of anxiety with doctors visits. I also have had a few bad experiences. 
-1	nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office.except  for reading about all the different types of birth controls.
-1	Nothing makes me anxious.  I am relaxed and calm.  I guess the only thing that makes me a bit anxious is sitting in the exam room wrapped in paper, but I'm fine once someone comes in.
-1	
-1	I'm anxious that my weight is too high. I'm also worried that my cholesterol or triglycerides are high.
-1	sometime i'm worried that the doctor doesn't really know what is wrong with me,but in the end she is correct.i get a little anxious before i see the dotor, because i'm not sure if i'm going to like what she finds wrong if anything at all
1	because I have so many different problems with my health I don't know what is going to be next because it seems like every time I go to the doctor something else is wrong
1	One of the things is my weight. I've always been overweight and I dread even getting on the scale and another person knowing my weight. I also worry I'll be lectured about it or it will be named as a cause for whatever ailment I might have. I often don't go to the doctor when I should so that my weight is never known or discussed. I also worry about my issue, which I may think is trivial, turning out to be something more serious than I thought.

1	i feel like the doctors are not being honest with me and saying that I am not healthy just so they can prescribe me a bunch of baloney. I have been depressed and very anxious for a while and wanted to bring it up to the doctor but feared they would force me to take pills or force medication for the sake of them gaining money rather than helping me which makes me step back and not want to visit the doctor unless I absolutely have to.

-1	Just general not knowing what might be wrong or what the treatment options might be. The unknowing is the worst for me. 
1	A lot of doctors don't get to the root cause of your medical issue.  They hear a few of your symptoms then give you a textbook diagnosis and send you away with a prescription for the symptoms instead of trying to solve the cause of the problem without filling you up with medication.

It also makes me anxious to talk about issues I'm having, especially if they are embarrassing. I also don't like mentioning things related to lifestyle choices that may reflect badly upon me, and it makes me anxious when things like that come up.

1	The thing that worries me the most is that there will be costs I'm not aware of to the visit. We are on a very fixed income and a lot of times there are additiol fees tacked onto bills that I wasn't expecting. Sometimes it's because I asked a question, which is frustrating.
-1	Worried that my conditions may have worsened.  I think about how my symptoms have been going.  Whether they have been getting worse and worse.

-1	It's just sitting and waiting and trying to remember everything I should tell him about how I am feeling or things I am experiencing.
1	I am most anxious when awaiting results. The unknown is always the most stressful for me, because I can't figure out how to proceed. I also don't particularly like needles, but it is more the time between seeing the needle and it actually going into my arm that is stressful. 
-1	I am always fearful that the doctor will find some unforeseen, unusual issue of which I was not aware. I also wonder what my lungs sound like considering that although I quit smoking 5 years ago, I smoked for four decades previously.
-1	doctors and nurses are always late and do not have any system that works around the clock.they also mix and lose prescriptions.

-1	It depends on my reasoning for visiting the doctors office. If its a matter of me being really sick or something that could of been wrong at a pregnancy checkup I was very worried.

1	I be worried about hearing something bad about my health. I just want to hear I'm am healthy and have no conditions .
-1	I have a general anxiety disorder so sometimes even the most common events can make me feel anxious. It really has nothing to do with the appointment. it just happens.

-1	"Probably when a moment arrives when the Doctor says, ""Hmmm. That looks interesting!"" That would make me anxious."
-1	"That there might be something wrong with me that I just didn't ""feel""."
1	Depending on the doctor I am going to at the time.  I had breast cancer not to long ago, was very lucky it was estrogen receptive very small the best to have if you have it.  I go every year for mamagram and I am anxious until I get the results
1	I am just an anxious person anyway, so anytime I have to go see my doctor I usually feel this way. I feel like when the doctor walks in he is going to give me the worst news ever, but it is not like that at my usual doctors appointments.
1	In most cases the cause of anxiety is usually the uncertainity sorounding a test whose outcome is unknown. We do not have control over outcomes of tests and however compassionate the physician is, I always get worried. I believe it's normal though.
1	There is just something about a doctor's office that is a little unnerving that I can't quite put my finger on. Everything seems a little too perfect, and I almost feel like if there's something wrong that I'm disappointing the physician or making their life harder.
1	The fear of them finding something wrong with me.
-1	Returning to the doctor's office for further testing can make me feel anxious or worried that something may be wrong.

1	Simply because you never know when you may be given the news that you have a disease that will result in pain or death.
1	What makes me most anxious or worried is that I don't know if something terrible is wrong or not. Or if I'm getting a shot or something I sorta dont like it
-1	I hate needles and whenever going to the doctor, that is my first thought that makes me anxious, are they going to want to give me a shot. Since I do not take pills, sometimes a shot is needed and I hate those. But, I can take them without much pain, it's just the idea- maybe some fear left over from childhood- I don't know. But, that is mainly what makes me anxious. The other thing is doctors always have to rub or push wherever it hurts and that bothers me.
-1	Not knowing what is wrong or if I am showing symptoms that could be a simple illness or something more serious.
-1	I don't believe they have the truth. They have strayed from true health care. Prevention is key. Not pills to treat symptoms. 
-1	I only feel anxious if there is something new in the way a symptoms --what I am seeing him for---until he talks to me and tells me what they mean for my health.
-1	What makes me feel the most anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's office is what the doctor may or may not find, if there is anything to find. 
-1	It is the uncertainty of what is wrong with me.  My doctor puts my mind at ease by explaining that my condition is not unusual and can be corrected quite easily.
-1	Wondering if we'll have the time to really talk and get me help.  I don't push enough sometimes, but don't like to be ignore either
1	It just makes me uncomfortable to have a stranger examining me. And I would rather live my life as if nothing is wrong then be sad because I found out some thing is wrong

-1	I do not feel anxious are worried during my doctor visits in general. Unless, I am seeking surgery or a chronic uncurable condition, doctor visits are generaly unstressful
-1	The reason that I get nervous when visiting the doctor's office is because I always think that the worst possible outcome will happen to me. 
-1	If I see a new doctor, I may or may not be nervous. The doctor bed side manner is very important to me. If the doctor is cold and standoff then that would make me uncomfortable.
-1	Concern about the possibility of the discovery or diagnosis of a life threatening or changing medical condition.
-1	Nothing typically does, I only answered the way I did regarding the few situations where I'm not sure what's wrong/how serious/etc. and I'm worried until the doctor reassures me/gets me the answers I need.
1	I usually not too anxious going to the doctor but there is some there.  You always here the horror stories of healthy people going in for a routine checkup and walking out with a serious disorder.  That is scary.  
1	I am worried about having to get ked. I am worried about finding out something is wrong with me. I am nervous about having to talk to a stranger about persol issues.

-1	That he's going to tell me something bad. I worry I'll have some medical condition that requires extensive treatment.
1	The wait, I'm sitting there just thinking about different things to worry about.
-1	I just don't like anyone prodding and poking me plus I don't like the wait time I have to sit through in order to see my doctor and I'm always short on money so I tend to get afraid that my insurance will somehow ask for more money as in a copay mentioned or other medical tests he may want to run
-1	If the doc were to show real concern over some issue and and ordered a lot of tests  I would be concerned that I had a seriouis health issue.
1	Finding a difficult to cure physical problem
1	I'm scared to find out bad news because of family health issues or living a risky lifestyle. I feel knowing if anything is wrong would stress me out 
-1	It depends on the examination, but I am very self conscious of my body shape, and worry they will judge or laugh behind my back. 
-1	I worry that something might be wrong with me that would be a long term sickeness and I also don't like my weight
-1	There is nothing for me to get anxious around my doctor because I trust him to the fullest he will take good care of me
-1	The bill makes me the most worried. Not only the cost of the office visit, but the deductible I have to pay as well. This is why most times, I opt out of seeing the doctor, so I don't receive a bill.
-1	Just the concern that something may be worse.
-1	That there could be something wrong.
-1	I don't every remember being anxious or worried when I see the doctor. It is usually a time when we converse about things that happen in our everyday lives and we joke around and normally have a great time.

1	I am afraid of the procedures that cause pain.Also finding something is wrong with me is scary.

1	As I get older and feel more aches and pains I'm worried that he'll find a tumor or some organ failure or some bone turning to dust or some incurable disease.
-1	taking routine examinations, such as colon cancer screening and waiting for the results. I worry when the doctor prescribes medication for me such as for enlarge prostate or high cholesterol, but he assures me it is just precautionary.
1	dont know what their intentions are. could misdiagnose me and make me pay money that i dont have. i aint got time for that mess. do your job right the first time
1	just not knowing the unknown of the whole situation. worrying about things that you might be wrong with you ect. 
1	when doctors dont care or even act like a doctor... sometimes they dont take me seriously.. going to the doctor is like hit or miss with me... sometimes i get a really good doctor then they leave transfer then i have to start over with treatment because alot of ppl i have to deal with after that are inexperienced ppl...
-1	I am rarely sick.  when I go to the doctor it is routine follow up on chronic diseases I have dealt with for over 20 years. 
1	Normally, if I'm at the doctors, I'm in pretty poor shape and it's a last stitch effort. I'm worried and anxious mostly because of how little faith i have in them... and for very good reason

-1	The initial sitting around and waiting on her. My medical needs are sometimes complicated and require further testing and sometimes that's uncomfortable 
-1	just worry about my condition and if it is improving i have had severalk close calls in the past 8 years and i want to make sure that i am doing better so i worry a little 
1	I get worried about talking about things that make me nervous. My private body parts are private to me and even the doctor makes me feel uncomfortable. I work to try to speak about these things but just never gets easier. Also worried about hearing I have sickness or disease thats not curable. Things get rougher and rougher with age and when I get older feel like somethings just bound to go wrong with my health. 
1	It is the fear of being judged and of not knowing if they will find anything wrong with me. Perhaps they will judge my lifestyle, or perhaps they will say I am eating all the wrong things or not exercising enough.
-1	I sometimes feel anxious or worried because you never know what your blood tests will show even though you may be feeling fine.

1	I worry most about my blood test results, how to deal with my multiple conditions, and now much time I will be given to discuss my problems and questions.
1	i dont like to sit there forever waiting for them to come into the room and tell you nothing is wrong with you, and they dont wanna order meds to make you feel better, and try to run up big bill too
-1	I don't like getting exams because sometimes I don't like the results!  So I get a bit nervous and anxious to hear the test results just to get it over with!  
1	what he is going to say and why. how his mood will because he has been in a pretty bad mood and insulted me
1	I worry sometimes that something serious could be wrong with me.  So, when going to get checked out I fear that they will find something bad, instead of thinking it could be something minor.
1	If anything has changed, if my health has worsened even though I feel okay. 
1	ey man. this survey is very easy to answer. Is perfect for us, for you, for your mother. enjoy this!
-1	Sometimes I feel anxious that what I think is some pretty minor thing will end up being something major.  Or that I will be one of the cases that end up in the news of doctors doing something totally wrong for the patient (amputating the wrong leg, etc.).  I also don't care for shots...
1	That the doctor will tell me that I have a life threatening decease like cancer. I also don't like waiting and the doctor being late.
1	I am most worried about the cost and pain of treatment. I also worry about how much time I might have to take off from work if something is seriously wrong. I have had a few medical treatments that cost thousands of dollars and had me out of work for a few days.
1	I really only go to the doctor when I am sick.  I am overweight and I smoke.  I dread the lectures from the doctor. I know I should lose weight and I know smoking is bad for me.  The only reason I am there is to get help with whatever issue I have.
-1	In general, what makes me the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is when I go for a specific reason. For example, STD testing or I have something I noticed that I want to seek attention for. These are the situations that cause the most anxiety because they aren't specifically routine, but conditional. While I do have an annual physical, I know what to expect based upon historical visits, but when something unexpected occurs it could be anything from minor to severe and you just aren't aware of it. What if that rash is something more? What if that mole isn't right and I need to be referred to a dermatologist? What if that cold wont go away as fast as it should? These are the kinds of situation that cause me anxiety.
1	If the doctor isn't being attentive or if there are a lot of people in the doctors office that might mean that I won't get adequate care
1	He calls me by some other person's name, refuses to answer any questions I may have. Is always in a hurry to get me out of his office.

1	I think what worries me the most is the final results of test and what procedures and medications I may be asked to undergo or take in ordet to improve my condition.
1	"Just the thought of MAYBE something being wrong with you. Sometimes I have moments of ""what have I done with my life?"" Then I think of all the things I've missed out on."
1	When I've read online about symptoms. I always expect the worst and then I worry that the Doctor will confirm what I read.
1	For some reason I'm always afraid that they won't believe me or will think that I'm weird. I get weird looks sometimes because of the way I explain situations due to my anxiety. The nurses are generally good at making this okay, but the actual doctors generally seem too busy with their shift to fully give you their time and attention. 
1	Being in that paper gown makes me uncomfortable. You aren't always at your best when you need to visit the doctor. I may have a serious problem or feel very sick.
-1	i worry that something might pop up that i didn know about  about going to see my doctor that day as for runnning blood test
-1	I had a past medical history where a mysterious illness wrecked me and spent a month in the ICU, 2 weeks in a coma. So when I feel like something is wrong again, its hard to not have a bit of anxiety or worries. However when I'm at the doctor's office, I guess its mostly just being judged about poor life decisions. 
-1	"I'm not anxious or worried when I visit a doctor, at all. There isn't a need to be. It's not as if I ""must"" by some law follow what they ask me to do, it's merely a choice. I'd be far more worried to visit a dentist and worry about needing a cavity filled then seeing a doctor. "
1	In my dad's side of the family (possibly mom's too), we all have fear of doctors. I worry that the doctor will find something really wrong with me that nobody can fix. I'd rather live my life happily not knowing instead of dreading what I could possibly have.
-1	Just the activity of going to visit a doctor for them to possibly tell you something about your body you may not know. The experience in and of itself is a little bit nerve wracking.
1	I don't want them to think that I don't take care of myself well. I also don't want them to find something terribly wrong with my body. Like  tumor
1	That my condition has worsened and soon I won't bre able to do things I want to do. Of worries me. I want to see my kids grow older
1	My situation is very bothered I'm in pain I fell injuring my back.  Some days is a real test.  My get have bulging bones a new symptom occurring very painful.  I never know what to expect
-1	nothing makes my anxious or worried expect if for she reading or tell me my results like lad work like blo9ods work or something else
-1	The most worrying issue with seeing the doctor is the unknown.  You never know what the doctor may find when going for a visit.  Also I have little trust in a doctor to really treat me as a patient, I feel like they just test you to death for money and try to get you on some meds, not much more than that.
1	it is the long wait to see the doctors that make you anxious, after the wait you remain calm for the few minutes you talk with him.
1	My health problems make me nervous and scared because what i have is life threatening if i dont get the right medication and if i dont get that medication quick enough.

1	The main anxiety I have about visiting a doctor is receiving bad news about my health. I also fear having to undress or be naked in front of people I don't know

I also tend to get jumbled thoughts and get extremely nervous and it's hard for me to articulate to them what I have going on or what I may need. It also doesn't help that when I do speak up, I get shot down and they just assume it's something that I don't need to be concerned about.
-1	Usually it's just a routine check up, so I never really am too worried.

1	The language barrier concerns me most.  What he says and what I think he means are sometimes different.  As an example, they tell me that tests I need to take for an existing condition are preventive; they are not preventive if I already have the condition.  The tests at that stage are diagnostic.  They are more concerned with a patient taking standard tests than treating them for the condition the patient is most worried about. 
-1	I am afraid the doctor will tell me my cancer has returned.  That is my biggest fear every time I go to the doctor

-1	I have so many physical disabilities as it is, am afraid of anything else that they find.  I suffer in a lot of physical pain.
1	What makes me feel most anxious is not knowing what the doctor may or may not find. Even if I'm feeling fine and believe that I'm healthy, you just never know. I'm also a bit of a hypochondriac, so in the back of my mind, I think I'm always think there couldbe something wrong. 
-1	I am generally not anxious when I see the doctor. I am rarely sick and just don't have much fear when I go see a doctor. I guess there is always a fear of something being terribly wrong with me but I tend not to think about that. I guess I am more anxious about picking up an illness at the doctor than anything else, like the flu.
