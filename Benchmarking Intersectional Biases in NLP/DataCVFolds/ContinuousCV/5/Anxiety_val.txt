0.523800	The possibility of learning some potentially life changing information.  Also the discomfort of some of the procedures. 
0.881000	In my experience people go to the doctor because something is wrong. As someone who has an anxiety disorder anyway, going to someone who can confirm that a problem is real and something could be terribly wrong just stresses me completely out. 
0.309500	Just about my health. I don't worry much at all but sometimes I think that maybe they'll find something wrong, like maybe my blood pressure is bad.
0.142857	nothing unless I have pains in my body which I can't explain. then, my doctor will have to find out the causes and future remedies.
0.809500	A lot of doctors don't get to the root cause of your medical issue.  They hear a few of your symptoms then give you a textbook diagnosis and send you away with a prescription for the symptoms instead of trying to solve the cause of the problem without filling you up with medication.  I want to be properly evaluated, not just medicated.
0.333333	I have Congestive Heart Failure and A-fib and am always a little anxious and worried at check-ups because I never know if my condition has worsened
0.380952	I never want to experience pain. Or if there is pain I want to be warned about it. Of course I also don't want to find out bad things, or feel embarassed by answers I give. But I try to be honest.

0.666667	I am worried or anxious as to what they might find and that they will tell me that I need to lose weight
0.809500	I fear that they are going to come back and go we just found something terribly wrong with you and... That or its we need to get you on this medication and its going to cost a bazillion dollars and you better take it or there is nothing I can do for you. Or lets run these other tests that I am pretty sure are unreleated but they will boost my bottom line so lets do these. To which I know I will have to seem like a butthead as I ask what specifically they need that test for and why. But of course I dont always trust the answer as again its for making money.
0.714300	I am not a huge fan of going to the doctor but still go because I value my health. I am always a little apprehensive of visiting the doctor even though I am in excellent health.
0.666700	Most doctors offices are terribly sterile and uninviting and don't foster any since of being a caring individual. It makes me feel like a piece of meat.

0.571400	I am pretty much constantly in pain or having some symptom or another, but I do not like to bring this up, even to the doctor. It was not looked well upon by my family growing up. You just toughed your way through things without whining. I would be worried that I would bring up a concern and it would not have any real medical basis and I would feel like I was complaining about nothing. 
0.214286	That he won't do what I need done and will not listen to my problems. He acts like he doesn't care about my problems.
0.357100	Anxious to see what they are going to say. Because no one or Doctor can know your body better than you. Are Bodies give us signs if something is wrong.

0.619000	I usually feel very calm when I'm at the doctor's however, I am for the most part in good health. I guess the only anxiety I have would be them telling me I have a terminal illness or something horribly wrong.

0.595200	I usually feel worried about what the results of my health assessment might be. I also get nervous about interacting with doctors (or people) in general, but I usually tell myself there isn't much to worry about just to calm myself down.

0.238095	To have to doctor tell me something serious like I have cancer or HIV is scary because that means I'll be dead sooon
0.357143	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried about visiting my doctor because I feel as if my health is good. Something that may make me feel worried is the diagnosis he may give me.

0.357143	That he might find something or I might have something new going on. Lately I've been worried about my cholesterol. I've been wondering if my cholesterol is going down. I'm eating healthy and taking my medicine, but is that enough. I be thinking the doctor going to say my cholesterol is actually higher
0.714300	I worry that the doctor is going to talk to me about my weight. I think that they are focused on it and even if I am just doing something simple they want to weight me.
0.666700	The one thing that makes me anxious is not knowing if there may be some things or issues I might have that I am not aware of. 
0.571429	I  worry  about  his   diagnosis  and  what I will  have to  do  formyself    if there r serious  problems

0.880952	I am always scared to hear something is wrong. But I also don't think they are thorough enough or take my concerns seriously 
0.309500	"My body and my car share some interesting commonalities. When I take my car to a mechanic, I dread hearing, ""Well, it could be the alternator or it might be the wiring or maybe the starter.""  The same is true of a doctor's visit. The worst possible result is lack of clarity.  That being said, of course there are situations where lack of clarity is real, and as long as doctors have a plan for clarifying a situation, I'm OK. Not thrilled, but OK. The main way that doctors reduce my anxiety and worry is by convincing me that they are telling me what they know or believe in complete honesty. If I don't think a doctor is leveling with me, then I get really anxious. I would rather have a truthful, irascible doctor than a pleasant, uninformative one."

0.547619	Do not know the outcome so feel a little anxious when it comes to tests and examinations. But overall after I see the doctor I do calm down
1.000000	I'm scared that she will find something wrong with me.  Something that will change my life.
0.642857	I'm really not certain as to why I feel this way towards doctors. Perhaps it's not knowing what's going to happen or what they might say/do (especially if going in for a physical).
0.571429	I do not like the possibility of being told that there could potentially be something wrong it me. That stresses me out a whole hell of a lpt
0.690500	I sometimes feel anxious when I am unsure of an outcome. Say I have been having a gging pain or some kind of physical discomfort, for example. It makes me feel uneasy not knowing if these things could be serious or not.
0.357143	If I am having a pain or some other problem and don't know or not sure then I would be a little worried.
0.642900	I am worried that they will find something wrong that I was unaware of and will result in a significant financial investment from me to treat. Our healthcare system is a joke when it comes to how much medicines cost. Your health is held for ransom by the drug companies and it's disgusting. 
0.761905	I feel that I'm worried that my coverage my go away and that my family may struggle to find coverage. 
0.595200	I think most people feel that way.  You never know what they will find and it is an anxious feeling every time.

0.738100	Even though I trust my doctor (and any of the specialists I see), I always get anxious about doctors appointments because there is always an element of unknown. There is always a chance they could discover something is wrong with you that is totally random and unrelated to what you came in for, and it could change your life. 
0.380952	Having a persistent problem that requires multiple specialists and tests to discover a cause causes me anxiety.
0.357143	What makes me most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is if any of the procedures they'll be performing on me are painful or not. Another thing that makes me somewhat anxious is when they ask me questions that I find to be too personal or embarrassing.
0.285700	Just having to be there, really. What if they find something wrong, what if there's some sort of problem, etc. Its more general, low key anxiety than anything specific. 
0.666667	I'm always aftraid that something will be found that is wrong with me when I perfectly feel fine. There could be something under the surface.
0.595238	Really, just waiting and taking time to sit in an office. Also, thinking what the doctor may tell me could be wrong or other health concerns.
0.857143	I have had medical issues in the past, I am scared they will return.I don't like going to he doctor for check ups, but do anyway. 
0.571429	Nothing really makes me anxious when going to the doctor,except having my blood pressure and weight checked. I always feel like my weight is an embarrassment and having to share that with a nurse makes me feel bad. My blood pressure is usually healthy anyway, but it still makes me nervous waiting for them to stop pumping the sleeve.
0.642900	I'm afraid they or going to find something wrong with me. This brings me emotional and financial uncertainty. I am also afraid they will treat me,but something will go wrong which can harm me further.
0.714300	I believe it is all pyschological because most of the time when you go to the doctor something is wrong. So then when you go for a regular visit those same feelings come back. The ones you had when you were sick, injured or didn't even know what was wrong  in the first place. Some of the uncertainty is also worrying about my loved ones if something was in fact wrong with me. What also contributes to the uncertainty is not understanding medical terminology and if whether or not what you are being told is actually correct.
0.785700	They will tell me what I am doing wrong based off of what other people in my race do. A doctor told me to stop in fried chicken when that is something I rarely eat. Not all people of color eat or like fried chicken.
0.142900	What makes me anxious when going to the doctor is maybe finding out something that is worse then what i thought
0.642900	Sometimes I worry I may get bad news about my health. I feel generally healthy but I know that cancer is something that can effect anyone at any level of health. The older I get the more I worry I may not be as healthy as I think I am.
0.142857	I really do not get anxious or worried when I visit the dotor so this really does not apply to me at all. I am very comfortable going to the doctor.  
0.738095	Usually, my fear is about what the diagnosis would be. Since I do not know much, I do not want to hear it is a serious condition.
0.142857	As a diabetic I'm always concerned about the A1C level and that I'm doing the right things. Every day is hard with knowing what, when, and how much to eat. It's a constant struggle. And even when you're doing everything right, sometimes your body does its own thing. I don't want my diabetes to get worse.
0.904762	Finding out what the test results, how his staff are going to treat me, and weary I've recommend me to get surgery.
0.738100	I fear that they are going to find something really serious is wrong with me. 
1.000000	Another appointment with nothing getting done and feeling the same or worse when i leave the doctors office.   They said surgery wont help me but wont give me anything that helps make me comfortable.  
0.666700	I worry about the cost and about having a doctor that might not seem to care about me. If I go see a doctor, I want them to wholly focus on my health when I'm there, and I worry they won't do that.
0.571400	that there is something seriously wrong.. 
0.190500	I am a little worried that my health problems will be worse than what they seem.
0.738095	Never know what to expect and I do not like strangers touching me.  I find the whole process invasive.
0.357100	I worry that I'll get admonished for not taking care of myself (my weight has been creeping up lately) or that my blood pressure will suddenly be high or something else unexpected.
0.595200	I just feel worried that they don't have my best interest at heart. They just want to line their own pockets. They also don't spend much time explaining things or giving altertives.
0.833333	I'm worried, I won't get a solution to fix my health problems. I worry that they will judge me based on my condition.
0.142900	I am usually pretty comfortable visiting the doctor, the only thing that makes me really nervous is having to be completely naked or getting a gynecology exam.
0.476190	nothing i feel very comfortable and feel like i know what i need to do and wha ti can do and how i can
0.285700	I feel one never knows what may crop up, but I really don't get worried or anxious about Dr's appointments.  Perhaps a little uncomfortable because I find Dr's appointments are not really enjoyable
0.142900	I don't feel anxious when visiting my doctor's office.  The staff are always very nice and make me feel comfortable, and my doctor has fantastic bedside manner that makes me feel at ease.  The only thing I would feel worried about is not knowing what's wrong with me.
0.285700	If I have new or strange symptoms going on, I would feel worried. Since we have some diseases in our DNA, I am often afraid of what might occur.
0.523810	I worry that I will be repeatedly misdiagnosed. It worries me that she only wants to continuously prescribe medication on top of medications. She treats you like a test dummy with medication. 
0.190476	"I do not feel either way, i feel more towards ""why can't we get to the heart of the matter without more tests or another presciption"
0.714300	I am old enough to know the probability for health and longevity, and also old enough to have experienced times when things did not work out the way we hope that they would. What makes me feel anxious is that the older I get the more likely I will be told that I am going to die by a doctor based merely on probabilities.
0.190476	Sometimes the fear of not knowing what is wrong with my children . They typically are over worried things typically turn out perfect 
0.476200	Anytime you enter a doctor's office for an ailment it's always nerve wracking. You do not know what's wrong, and for me being in the medical field I always think of the worst conditions. It's almost like the people that google their symptoms and freak out. It's definitely harder waiting for test results knowing what's out there and how many people you file claims for that actually have these ailments. It makes you very uneasy. The anticipation is very unnerving.  
0.595200	The thing that i might not feel comfortable with the different tests that they do. Especially i don't like poking my hands for blood tests and i don't like the fact of them asking too many questions which might not be necessary.
0.476200	Wondering what the outcome of my exam would be. Imagining if there is something wrong and what needs to happen next.
0.809500	I am worried that I might have something wrong with me. I am worried that I might have an illness that won't get better. 
0.857143	I don't feel that any body cares and I feel that I don't have a friend in the world. My mom died and I haven't been the same since her death
0.619000	I typically won't go to a doctor's office unless I am completely sure something is wrong. By the time I am there, I know I have a problem and I tend to worry about how bad it is at that stage. I do not like people touching me as well, so being examined always pushes my personal space limits. 
0.166667	Nothing worries me about a doctor's visit. I can go with the flow with everything that happens. They are doing their job. I know what to expect and nothing they do bothers me in any way.
0.619048	A number of statements which people have used to describe themselves are given below. Read each statement and then select the response option to the st.
0.357143	What makes me feel anxious is if the doctor comes back after doing blood samples and sa they found something unnatural in my blood 
0.690476	I said not to do this you know opinion outpost I can't do this anymore I just Im done 37)::&9@?::79@087;,!'  Gffhjkktf. Kkhfvnjb there's my characters happy?
0.547600	When I do go to the doctors office, because past doctors have never believed me on my condition I was always feeling anxious and worried throughout the visit. However, this has slowly went away. Still for some visits I become anxious or worried that my conditions may be developing further in a negative way. 
0.571400	It would be finding something terribly wrong with me, like cancer or an unknown illness. That's the worst kind of news a doctor can give someone.
0.476200	They will rush you. Support staff seems disinterested and abrupt. Lack of professionalism in general and seem almost undereducated.
0.476190	That she will find something that is not good or do something that is uncomfortable that I'm not expecting
0.547600	Their standard assessment equipment sometimes causes errors in obtaining vital signs.  The doctor often will not re-check the vitals and my anxiety usually causes my blood pressure to read higher than it is. I get anxious when they try to give me new medication for something that hasn't been examined and followed through properly.
0.476190	i guess the thing that tends to make me the most anxious when it comes to doctors and doctor's offices overall is the whole unknown aspects of things. not knowing what to expect tends to make me uneasy
0.214286	i really don't feel anxious or worried while visiting the doctor's office i'm in good enough health at my age

0.309524	When I first get into the doctors office there is a certain amount of anxiousness, just to think that everything is going to be good
0.642900	I think I always think the worst when I go, I act as if I am going to walk in and they're going to tell me I have some deadly disease. I usually feel like when I leave I feel better automatically no matter what is wrong just because I find out there is nothing wrong with me (that can be long term bad).
0.595200	there's always something in the back of your mind telling you it's worse than it is. Fortutely, it usually isn't.
0.285714	The only way I will be anxious during a doctor visit is when the physical feeling in my body is overwhelmingly uncomfortable.
0.904762	I am always so afraid she is going to take my pain medictions from me or decrease my anxiety medication
0.642857	for me the unknown logistical problems I will face for any further treatment.I am in a wheelchair and transportation is limited and many barriers often get in my way.I can't do anything to change the sitation I'm in and just have to deal with it.EX. routine bloodtest took me 3 and 1 half hrs to complete.
0.690476	I just don't want bad news, simple as that. I believe no matter what he tells me, in the end it might be alright. But if the word cancer comes up, then I would be afraid, so that explains why I would feel anxious and scared about a medical exam. I think that is common with most people.
0.380952	I don't feel anxious because I've learn other ways to deal with the stress of my job and other life obstacles 
0.666700	I feel my doctor my find something horribly wrong with me during an examination or he might give me bad news. General anxiety at being examined, poked, and prodded, its a very intimate interaction that doesn't happen often.
0.476190	always feel this way no specific reason as to why I feel this way when making a visit to my doctors office it may be this is just a natural feeling for me
0.666667	I be worried about hearing something bad about my health. I just want to hear I'm am healthy and have no conditions .
0.142857	do not get anxious or worry when going to the doctors.I feel great,so going to the doctors dont make me worry or anything.
0.571429	You never know what the doctor is doing to exactly say so that sometimes can make me nervous, because it could be good or bad 
0.333300	I might be worried something might be found that might be bad but I try to be optimistic and pray.
0.238095	I never feel anxious or worried. It's just a feeling of discomforted when I am been examined in my private parts. No reason for me to be worried. I'm pretty healthy.
1.000000	I worry that something will be very wrong with me or worse yet they will fail to find something that is horribly wrong. Additiolly I will have to worry that they will not take my concerns into account. 
0.690500	That they will tell me something bad that I do not want to hear, that I am not in good health. I worry that it will be something that I haven't been doing right. 
0.142900	I don't feel anxious when I see the doctor. I go in to the office with a good attitude. There is always a chance that he could find something seriously wrong,but I will face hat when it happens,not before.  
0.381000	I'm not a worrier and I'm not overly anxious but I think anytime I go to the doctor it's for very good reason - certainly not just a cold. So when I arrive, I am expecting something somewhat serious. Not cancer or some terminal diagnosis but something requiring treatment. 
0.452381	That I have an illness that has yet to be discovered. I don't have health insurance so these doctors don't test me they just ask questions when I go to the hospital for the same damn thing over and over
0.595238	I'm always afraid I'm going to find out something bad is wrong with me and I don't want any bad news from my doctor.
0.142900	What makes me most nervous when going to the doctor is that I will get bad news that is not easy to fix with medicine or anything else quick and easy.
0.666700	When I visit my doctors office what makes me feel the most worried is that I will be told that I have a chronic illness. I worry because both of my parents suffer from illnesses and I know that they are hereditary. My mother suffers from high blood pressure and my dad from diabetes. I want to avoid both of the illnesses for as long as possible, but since I am overweight I have a higher chance of developing any of these illnesses. Therefor on my annual checkups when I go for my results I do get nervous and anxious because I don't want to be given bad news. 
0.595200	That they will schedule a bunch of extra test just so they can bill the insurance companies for more.
0.357143	Because a lot of these doctor's give me a funny feeling that they just don't care if I die. Because they don't give me a great check up.
0.333333	Because I be anxious to know how my test results be.The wait time is something I worry about,when I go to the doctor,because sometimes you have to wait a very long time.
0.142900	I have always been very nervous when I go to a doctor appointment. So that means when I sit down, and they take my blood pressure, it is sky high.
0.238100	It is mostly that the experience will be unpleasant, not that the examination will find something wrong.  I'm also a little bit worried about being lectured on my bad habits, or pressured to do something expensive that I don't really need.
0.571429	what makes you feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is when i have to go in there at all because i dont like doctors offices and they are terrible and stuff like that
0.714300	I am not comfortable getting naked in front of man I do not know.  I do not think that healthcare providers give a patient enough information about what they will be doing BEFORE they do it which makes me very jumpy.  I do not get in another person's personal space without permission or without telling them what I am doing.  I don't think it's too much to ask of virtual strangers especially when I am already naked and vulnerable.  I worry about what tests I will be told I need as many of them are painful or at least uncomfortable especially when someone has an issue with the sight of needles.  I worry about being diagnosed with a condition that could mean significant lifestyle changes or death.
0.928600	I worry about getting bad news. I worry about being judged. I worry about appearing nervous and anxious.

0.785700	"I am most anxious when discussing symptoms and/or test results that do not conclusively provide a diagnosis. I have had a few experiences where my doctor at the time assumed that I was simply ""anxious"" and refused to take my concerns seriously. I was later diagnosed with a serious illness. It is my fear that I will be perceived as having a mental illness that causes my distress, or as ""drug-seeking""."

0.690476	having my blood pressure checked makes me nervous. I am already taking three medications to control it and do not want to add any more.
0.833300	I feel the most anxious about feeling judged or criticized by the doctor. I'm afraid of them blaming me for my conditions or just not listening or taking me seriously. I'm afraid of feeling lectured to, disrespected, dismissed and invalidated by them.

0.547619	I have issues.  I don't want them to get worse so, of course, I feel anxious awaiting the results.  It is not the doctor himself that makes me anxious

0.833333	What makes me worried is i would not like nothing to be wrong with me. I be worried that my doctor would tell me that i have a disease or something like cancer.
0.785700	I do not like being scrutinized with weight, blood pressure etc. I would prefer to never go to the doctor, however I know I need to. I don't always feel that doctors are really listening to all of my symptoms and I don't like taking unnecessary medications.
0.690500	The lack of transparency and uncertainty can be burdensome. Knowing that the doctor knows more about what's wrong with me than I do, and them not sharing all of that information. 
0.190500	That there could be something wrong.
0.619000	When I'm going in for something and I'm not sure what is wrong with me, there is always uncertainty there with not knowing what could potentially be wrong with me. 
0.833300	Just the nervousness of being there. I don't like visiting and you always worry a bit that something may really be wrong. 
0.428600	because of my past history, my body is not how a normal healthy person my  age is. It seems like everytime I go to the drs. it seems like something else pops up
0.619048	getting lost in the shuffel, not enough time, wrong diagonsithesis, cleaniness of the place, wait times, etc,.....
0.666700	I would just get a little worried about what the doctor diagnostic would be, hoping that what might be wrong would not be major or life changing.

0.690500	Thinking that you have some major disease. 
0.547600	There is always the opportunity of hearing bad news.  The memory of hearing bad news in the past about my own health, or a loved one's health.  The idea that an appointment could lead to a scary or painful procedure.  Also, the possibility of financial loss.
0.523800	I worry about being lectured about my health and also having to go through the whole procedure of tests. I don't like it.
0.142857	I don't feel that way at all I also think you are asking some very stoop thing to ask me and I will be glad when I finish this survey.
0.142857	I have absolutely nothing to be anxious or worried about when visiting the doctors office. Nothing to be fearful of doctors are there to help and mine is great.

0.547600	I am anxious at the doctors office because i am sick and do not know what is going on with my body. I worry the treatment is going to be painful or uncomfortable and this brings my anxiety up. 
0.571400	I wonder if they will find some kind of health condition I was not aware I had. I also wonder if they will judge or criticize me for things like not getting enough exercise or always eat nutritiously.  
0.142900	just the office in general, the coldness , and waiting
0.476190	I am always afraid that my doctor will find an ailment or serious illness. These worries are exacerbated by the fact that that I am a 65 year old cancer survivor and cancer medication is notorious for causing side effects.  For a while, seemingly, my doctor found some health problem with most visits.  This has made me a little anxious about test results and examinations.
0.500000	"As someone who is overweight, I feel anxious about what it might be doing to my health -- although in a general sense, I am a healthy person, with good blood pressure, etc. I also sometimes worry about symptoms when they might have a very easy explanation; I tend to ""overthink"" things."
0.761900	Sometimes, I'm worried that the exam will show something bad...a disease or condition that will require expensive/extensive treatment. Actually, the first thing that stresses me is the weight check.
0.666700	I have past trauma that makes me not like to be touched.
0.333333	Since I am generally healthy, I am not worried or anxious when visiting the doctor.  If anything, I am concerned that my blood pressure will be low at the doctor's, because it does fluctuate a bit, and I don't really want any higher dosages of medication.
0.523810	I am terribly afraid of needles. Ever since I got my blood drawn for some tests earlier in this year, I realized that it hurt me so much that I was just afraid from then on of doctors And the whole nine

0.142857	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. I have regular routine medical care, so don't have any surprises
0.452400	I feel most anxious when there is an awkward kind of conversation, I'd rather just sit and listen to music or something and relax than have to converse.
0.619048	That they may find something of greater concern than the reason for my visit, which may lead to more medication, more visits, and more side affects.
0.571429	"I get nervous/worried about ""bad"" news that I could be receiving from test or exam results. Even if it's a follow up or a re-rest, I still feel nervous that some of the news won't be positive. "
0.285714	The things that makes me anxious about going to the doctor's office is getting weighed on the scale.
0.142857	The most anxious part of my Drs visits is getting weighed since I have a weight problem. I never want to weigh more then I did on my last visit.
0.595200	I have anxiety about a lot of things. I don't think it's something in particular that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I just do and it's hard to pinpoint exactly what I'm anxious/worried about. 
0.357143	Everyone gets that white coat syndrome when they visit their doctor. I only go for my yearly check-up so being a little nervous is normal
0.642900	I am worried the doctor will find something that is wrong with me and that I have health problems I wasn't aware of.
0.142857	When I visit my doctor I am not anxious or worried because I take his advice and  do what I am supposed to do to make sure I am doing alright.
0.785714	Afraid they will find out something bad during my physical that I don't know about.  Then I won't know what to do or if I can trust their judgement 
0.238100	If my condition or the doctor find something that turns out to be worst than it really is. Or the doctor find something that's too late to be treated.
0.166667	I don't feel anxious at all. I am confident in my doctor. He knows what he's doing. He makes me feel comfortable when I come in to get my check up.
0.595238	That they will find something serious like cancer. It runs in my family so it's always on my mind at a checkup
0.595238	 I get that way thinking they are gone tell me some bad news after a checkup and I don't know if I can handle it.
0.142900	When they have to draw blood from my hand for some test.I am not afraid of the test result but the pain of the needle.
0.880952	Everything. The way I was brought up is that if you go to the doctor something is SERIOUSLY wrong with you. 
0.142900	The waiting room makes me feel like that sometimes just because you have to sit there and my mind starts to wander sometimes. Usually I am fine though.
0.357100	I always think they will find something I didn't expect before entering. No one likes hearing bad news about their health, because it could be worse than they thought. I deal with any issue that comes my way, but it's a normal reaction to be worried that something is wrong, especially when feeling bad.
0.309500	You never know what to expect in an office. Sometimes just having to wait a long period of time for a dr. to show up makes you feel anxious. Too much time to think and worry.
0.309524	I CAN FEEL WORRY IF I HAVE A PROBLEM BUT IN THIS MOMENT A DO NOT HAVE ANY. I FEEL OK AND EVERYTHING IS FINE TO ME
0.309524	when he is looking into something that looks ominous to him and not sure how to handle the situation
0.214286	Depending on why I'm at the doctor's, I might be nervous about the outcome of the tests and exams. Other than that, I'm not nervous
0.619000	I don't go unless there's something wrong, so I'm always a little nervous about the outcome.
0.595200	I am concerned about if they find a serious condition that could be life-altering or life-threatening.  I am not concerned about them but what they might discover.
0.238095	I think I feel what is a normal concern level for a general health visit. I'm not overly anxious or worried. I know I can trust my doctor to do what is in my best interest.
0.523800	
0.357100	I get nervous about the unknown.  So the until I see the doctor I am a bit worried
0.714300	That they are going to perscribe me something generic that only helps maybe 10% of my issue or just tell me to take it easy and if it gets worse call like i came out here for a answer not to be told im nuts
0.595200	For one thing, if there is the flu going around like now, I am very hesitant and anxious to go get bloodwork or general exam because I don't want to end up catching the flu from the sick people there. Beyond that, I just have had a few years recently that I feel going to the doctor is a waste of money for me, I leave with no answers, no solutions and just more broke. I have no confidence in the doctors at this juncture to at least point me in the right direction regarding my health. It is a frustration that I'm currently dealing with as a matter of fact. I personally feel (and many others in similar situations that I have talked with) feel that Novant Health, in particular, has ruined my family practice that I've gone to for decades. In recent years, it's just become a waste of money as I'm shuffled in and out after paying. That in and of itself, the lack of confidence I have now in the process, does cause me anxiety, as well as teh finances.
0.476190	Just worried that something might be wrong. I'm in relatively good health, but there's some family history that always worries me: anemia, cancer, and heart problems. 
0.404762	I JUST FUCKING TOLD YOU THAT I DO NOT FEEL ANXIOUS THIS SURVEY IS FUCKING JOKE ASD FAGH JKLQWERTYUI OP
0.642857	certain parts of the exam are invasive and uncomfortable. it is a cold and sterile environment. i  do not like being poked and prodded
0.142900	The bills afterwards. I am not really to anxious with the visits.
0.142857	The cost of the visit is most stressful.  When you don't have health insurance that can be a big issue.
0.690476	If I am sick or my child is sick, there are so many things that could be wrong. I want my doctor to listen what I have to tell them.
0.738095	"getting sick or hurt by the doctor and being told something can be wrong People have a fear of doctors for a variety of reasons. You may fear hearing ""bad news"" from the doctor. You may regularly experience a rise in blood pressure on visiting the doctor, and fear the doctor will exaggerate its importance. You may be afraid of needles and the sight of blood. If you are claustrophobic, you may fear waiting in a small examination room. If you experience panic attacks, you may fear any situation from which it is inconvenient or difficult to leave quickly, be it a haircut, a shower at the health club, or a visit to the doctor."
0.285700	What makes me feel most anxious is getting my blood pressure taken. I know I have good blood pressure but it always makes me nervous just in case this one time I don't. 
0.833300	I don't like to go to any doctor or hospital for any reason not even to visit someone else. I worry that they will find something bad so I do not like to go get a physical and I avoid the doctor's office as much as possible. They always have a pill for everything and I feel some prescription drugs take away the body's ability to heal itself. 
0.452381	Not knowing what's going on. Waiting for results. Receiving bad results would have anyone worried, so many thoughts rushing through your head, ex&gt; is it doing to kill me? Is in incurable? How would these issue effect my life?
0.642900	Finding out about something that may be a short term or long term sickness.  Having to change my lifestyle for a long term or permanent time.
0.333333	SOMETIMES WHEN I VISIT MY DOCTOR I KEEP THINKING THAT HE WILL DISCOVER SOMETHING BAD WITH MY TEST RESULTS,BUT HE ALWAYS REASSURES ME NOT TO WORRY BECAUSE HE IS ON TOP OF MY HEALTHCARE.
0.238100	I don't want to feel anxious, but there is something about me that is turally anxious. I know this about myself because my BP reading inflates every time I go for a checkup.  I feel I am this way even in social situations although no one takes my BP under those circumstances.  
0.285714	The only thing I can think of is the Dr wanting me to take meds to get my cholesterol down but they cause my anxiety to go through the roof so I stopped taking them. It causes me stress because I know the Dr will get on to me every tie he tests my cholesterol. There has to be a quality of life taken into consideration and if I have to be bouncing off the walls and living feeling so much anxiety I cannot function, then I will deal with having high cholesterol.
0.690476	I get worried about the test results and the cost of Healthcare and treatments. It can be stressful. 
0.690476	it goes like the old saying , if it ain't broke, don't fix it, I don't look forward to anyone trying to find something wrong with me
0.595238	The state of the unknown makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor. Even more so when receiving test results 
0.428571	Paying for the office visit. People who have little to no health insurance are not as likely to get the proper medical help that they need in today's society
0.571400	For some reason I'm always afraid that they won't believe me or will think that I'm weird. I get weird looks sometimes because of the way I explain situations due to my anxiety. The nurses are generally good at making this okay, but the actual doctors generally seem too busy with their shift to fully give you their time and attention. 
0.833333	you never know what's going on, what they will say, or where it will all go. There is no reason to know everything, even with a doctor. 
0.142857	When I visit my primary care doctors office, there is really nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried.
0.666700	I guess the number one thing is fear that a routine exam or test will uncover something really wrong with me.  Now, to be fair, I am a paranoid hypochondriac.  So any time I get the slightest little pain or perhaps a lump or something, I am convinced it's terminal cancer and I'm going to die in 3 weeks.  Needless to say, that has so far not happened.  So I think it's very important that I have the ability to access proper medical care (in the past I haven't always had the access)  to go and get checked out on a regular basis, more for my own mental peace of mind than because there is something actually really wrong with me.  Other than that, sometimes I do worry that a doctor or nurse will be judgmental and make comments to me about certain unhealthy characteristics like my weight or smoking, but that's not nearly as big a concern.
0.666700	Social interactions in general are a big thing for me. I am not very good at handling them without some form of anxiety cropping up. I also feel that going into the office is like going into the unkown where I might find anything to be wrong with me that could change my life.
0.523810	I worry about hearing something is wrong. I panick whenever i don't feel well. There is too much negativity around me that makes me anxious.
0.714300	That he will find something wrong that is serious. I'm at the age where that could happen at any time, and I've seen it happen too many times to my friends. So I worry about it every time I go.
0.595238	what makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors's office would be what he might find when he is examing me.
0.523810	I feel like my doctors don't think my illness are that serious. He makes me feel like it's emotional  or physical.
0.595238	Other than the fact that ever thing I walk by is scanned and I get charged for equipment that won't even be used by me, what makes me most anxious is the fact that a trained professional will know what's wrong with me, have the resources and know-how to help, but won't because I don't belong to a certain tax bracket. 
0.571400	Just being there meaning something is wrong just puts me in an anxious mood.
0.285700	I usually expect the worse. I usually find out my fears were unfounded and the problem is easily solved.
0.714286	I don't know my new doctor and we have already had some head butting so I am not sure what to expect when I go into to see her.
0.619048	I feel anxious because of not knowing what the doctor or physician will tell you good or bad. It's like waiting for a teacher to grade a huge paper and finally getting your results good or bad 
0.142900	I have a severe social anxiety problem, so being out in a public place makes me anxious, but there's nothing about the doctor's office in particular that's upsetting for me. I usually feel more calm once I'm in the examining room than I feel before I go because I know I'll be taken care of.
0.166700	Bad results 
0.333300	I'm anxious when I am really sick and don't know what's wrong with me. I go into the office expecting the worst. It also makes me anxious when she doesn't know what's wrong, and I have to get more testing done. I am also anxious when I have to see another doctor because my doctor is on vacation. 
0.285714	BECAUSE YOU HOPE YOUR HEALTHY AND DONT WANNA HERE ANY BAD NEWS. ALREADY DEALLING WITH GOING TO A DOCTOR. THATS WOULD WORRY ANYONE ANYWAYS
0.571429	even though i know there's nothing to worry about with my health, i still think that my doctor will diagnose me with something bad
0.571429	I feel worried/ anxious about visiting the doctors office because you never know what could have changed within your body . New diseases and sicknesses can appear at any time . And thoughts of something being wrong always cross my mind .
0.666700	I worry the doctor might detect an illness/defect I was not aware of or something that may affect me adversely.  
0.571429	I AM MOST ANXIOUS WHEN I GO TO THE GYNECOLOGIST.  JUST TOO MANY WOMEN WITH SOME FORM OF FEMALE CANCER. 
0.476200	The thing that makes me most anxious is wondering if there will be something majorly wrong. I also worry that there won't be anything that can be done for symptoms that may be present.
0.142900	Nothing, I know that I am in good hands with my present doctor. Previous to him I would be anxious and scared because I knew that I was wasting my Co pay on not being treated for my issues. I o lying go to the doctors office maybe once or twice a year, when something is severe, so I am in no way shape or form a hypochondriac. 
0.571429	I do not reel anxious or worried when I visit my Doctor because she will tell me if there is something wrong immediately
0.214300	That what I think is no big deal will turn out to be something a lot more serious. I also get anxious if I have to get a shot as I am not a fan of needles. I also get a little anxious being exposed to sick people.
0.404762	I feel that everyone gets a little anxious when getting examed. You never know what they're gonna find.
0.571400	Sometimes I get anxious over whether or not something is wrong with me, but mostly I get anxious because I have social anxiety disorder.
0.285714	Nothing makes me anxious about my doctor.  We have a good, relaxed relationship and I feel I can talk to him about anything and not feel any fear about it.
0.738100	The first worrying thought in my mind is always the possibility of being told some new negative information, such as my health has worsened or I have developed some entirely new health complication. I also don't like the thought of having to need some new medication since I'm already on several. Other than that, one of the main things that I'm always anxious about is the possibility of having to get a blood exam, since I am extremely terrified of needles.
0.523810	I feel anxious or worried about not hearing what I want to hear. Or not getting better or having to be medicated
0.690476	Because of my age, I'm anxious that he will find something seriously wrong with me.  My blood pressure is usually high before I see the doctor but comes back to normal after.
0.142900	When I am unsure as to what is wrong with me and I when it's a new dr. that I have never met before. Also when I am having a medical procedure done that I have never had done before.
0.238095	Probably not knowing if there is anything wrong with me until after the exam and whatever tests I may have to go through, It's just not knowing if i am okay or not.
0.309500	I don't usually have fear when visiting the doctor. I only get anxious if I have to get a shot. Those occasions are few and far between.
0.904800	they don't explain what they think is wrong with me.  they just want to run more and more tests that i can't afford.
1.000000	That the doctor is going to just get me in and get me out and not listen to what I have to say about my health and how I feel and to care about how I am going to be treated.
0.619048	I dont like to find out my co pay since it changes so much for where I go. I don't really understand why it does but it's not the insurance I use since I was told everyone no matter what get the same charge depending on what they are going there for
0.833333	"My specialists never talk about nutrition.  The treatment options always include perscriptions or medical procedures.  Health alternatives are never mentioned.  I know from experience that diet and exercise can change the need for harmful meds and procedures.  This worries me that doctors do not take ""the whole being"" into perspective when talking about healing."
0.714286	Their attitude when they tell you to undress. Like it's touchy,touchy, feely time. Even when you tell them somethings not there they still want to touch. 
0.476190	I Feel worried when i am very ill and there are several test being taken. I worry that i will not have money to cover the cost 
0.333300	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor when I have something I need to get checked out and I'm not sure what will be found or the diagnosis will be.
0.809524	I always think something is going to be worse than it really is.

0.809524	The things that makes the most worried is when my doctor has ordered a test and it takes longer than it is supposed to get the results back.
0.595238	That main reason for my anxiety when visiting the Doctor is I know it is going to be the same as every other visit.  I try to explain my symptoms and it is like her doesn't listen or doesn't care.  
0.166667	Worrying about what could be wrong and how it could affect me and my family's lives. Worrying about side effects of medications i might be prescribed.
0.357143	I don't want to hear any bad news. I am also worried about how much it is going to cost for all of my services.

0.523800	
0.881000	I dislike uncertainty, so I tend to feel a good deal of anxiety while waiting for test results and analysis.

I know that its very unlikely because I am young and healthy but I had several family members that died of cancer growing up and seeing them deal with that disease is very scary and I really hope that I go a different way.

0.595238	Anxiety is one of my diagnoses. I get quite anxious before I get there. Long wait times to see the doctor don't help. The doctors that rush, specifically my pain management physician, and don't seem interested in listening to me leave me feeling misunderstood.

0.333300	I'm currently still young, so there's not much for me to be worried about.

Apart from that, I just worry that anything at all may have occurred and that I'm not a fit human being anymore.

As previously mentioned, I have severe osteoporosis due to osteogenesis imperfecta.   It is possible for the automatic one to tighten so much that it can literally fracture my arm.  Thus as the nurses' handbook for OI states, a manual blood pressure cuff should be used on folks like me.    Doctor's office staff are not used to patients coming in and insisting on the use of a manual cuff.   I don't look forward to having to go through that each time.

0.261905	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor unless I fear that I have a serious problem, which means that I would be more worried about whatever the problem was (or could be). If I have any idea what I'm there for there is no worry.

0.142900	There is really nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried. The only thing i do not like is waiting. I am not overly cmnfrotable around sick strangers. I get a little uptight when everyone is coughing and sneezing and the room seems to get smaller. Again I have no worries at the DR other than waiting.
0.761900	The biggest fear is that something very bad will be discovered. I worry about going for what seems like a relatively normal ache or pain and finding out I have some deadly or crippling disease. No one wants to hear their upset stomach is stomach cancer.

0.333300	I feel a bit anxious when I visit the doctor simply because I'm in a position where I may learn some worrisome things about my health. The potential is always there for negative news when you're visiting the doctor, so a bit of anxiousness seems inevitable.

0.595238	Now that I'm getting a little older, I'm a little anxious because of my family medical history.

0.738100	My mind always goes to the worst case scenario when I don't feel well or my kids don't feel well. I am always worried that my own diagnosis will be confirmed or that the course of treatment for whatever is wrong will be expensive or time consuming. I really fear being sick or injured and really worry that I something terrible will happen and I will get diagnosis that something is wrong.
0.666700	"I tend to be an anxious person in general and have a family history of high blood pressure, anxiety, etc. This often manifests in ""white coat syndrome"" when my physician or a nurse takes my blood pressure. It is usually off the charts the very first test, and sometimes it stays that way throughout the examination. This issue is further compounded as my employer/insurer has a ""wellness program"" that ties the outcomes of routine examinations with insurance premiums for the year, so there is extra incentive to maintain healthy numbers (with blood pressure being one of those numbers). For that reason, I record weekly blood pressure measurements to bring with me to examinations; unfortunately, my normalized recordings are not the ones that make it ""into the record"" for the wellness visit numbers..."
0.547619	What you doing today I be home by now for you all doing good how you get old I tell my how you doing fine you doing fine I hope you get back to you
0.214300	The time necessary to identify and appropriately mage health issues sometimes worries me, as I do not feel that I can trust my PCP or any other single doctor individually.   I have had too many bad experiences in maging my own care, and that of various family members.
0.333300	My cholesterol levels and my sugar levels. I have high cholesterol though my LDL is good so not concerning. My sugar levels have spiked the last few years and several times I have been warned of pre-diabeties.
0.428600	I do not often feel worried about visiting the physician. Sometimes, however, I would worry about a potentially serious diagnosis. I do not think this is uncommon, however, and it arises from a childhood fear I had of being diagnosed with a terminal disease like my uncle (cancer).
0.452400	Just the uncertainty of the experience. Not knowing if the doctor is going to discover that something is wrong.
0.142857	i'm always worried that I forget what the doctor says after I leave the room and walk to my car. That is all I have to say

0.642900	Normally it's a matter of having to wait to hear back from them that makes me anxious. I dislike waiting for exams and tests to come back.

0.190476	If test results something might be wrong or if persistent pain cannot be attached to a reason. Usually have little or no worry when visiting doctor.
1.000000	because you are afraid if they are going to find something wrong with you you feel good but they might find underlying things,   i mean they are the doctor
0.690500	I am overweight and I know that the doctor will say something about that - and that may be what is causing some issues.  I just don't want to hear that I have something really wrong with me.  Most of that is just in my head, but I still get worried that it may be true.
0.357100	I really don't care much anymore. I am 69, have lived a full life, and I fully expect my health to deteriorate and I am capable of accepting that. The only thing that makes me close to anxious about visiting the doctor are painful shots, but I can handle it.

0.666700	I don't go to the doctor unless I really have to. It's expensive. So because I can't go for check ups when I need to, I always worry that something major could be wrong.
0.142900	There is nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. The doctor has always been patient with me, and very understanding. There's nothing that makes me feel out of place, and the doctor always explain what will happen ahead of time and the reason why.
0.428571	The Dentist. Surgeons? Cake. Neurologists?  singing in the rain.  Dentists? It's like a nightmare  but real. 
0.619048	I'm always worried that the doctor will tell me something bad is wrong with me or that I need surgery or something to that matter .
0.809500	When it's an issue that potentially requires more than a simple solution to it makes me feel concerned heavily thinking of what may be options or what could be the potential outcome of everything. There are times when I've become overly worrisome as to what could be happening to my health or whether or not these signs are going in line with what I may be thinking is the issue at hand. 
0.571400	I think that the time constraints upon my doctor visit. I don't know what to discuss with them and it seems that if I bring up too much, I may be charged for an extra visit. And, when I bring up something with my primary care physician, it will probably result in one or more referrals which I prefer to avoid.
0.285700	Well, this doesn't really apply; see, I go to the doctor when something is bothering me or once a year for my checkup. The doctor is there to help me, is my attitude, so even if I'm worried about some condition, I don't fear going and doN't feel very anxious or worried.
0.666700	I get anxious about what I want to discuss.  The things that I typically want to discuss are sensitive subjects including anxiety and depression.  Additionally, I have a tragic history with healthcare outcomes, and I'm often forced to bring it up when discussing my healthcare history.  This makes me anxious, because I don't want to cry or feel depressed in front of the doctor.  I also get anxious about getting new medications or getting blood draws.  I dislike anything painful, and I get nervous when I am about to get test results.
0.285714	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the materials. Sometimes I'm afraid their not disinfected properly.
0.190500	I am not usually worried when visiting the doctor's office, but I do get anxious waiting for test results. I hate the anticipation of having to wonder how my blood work is going to turn out, and if I have anything I need to be concerned with. My family has a large history of cancer, so I constantly worry about developing it. 
0.523810	What makes me most anxious about visiting the doctor is them finding something seriously wrong with me that cannot be treated or is very difficult to treat.
0.595238	What makes me nervous about the doctor is the unknown, not knowing what to expect, I don't like bad news so I tend to get nervous...that white coat syndrome. My doctor is very thorough so that helps the anticipation a little bit.
0.714300	I am turally an anxious person, but when I visit my doctor I'm paranoid he's going to find something that I didn't know was wrong with me. I think this is tural.
0.452381	I have always worried about what they are going to find and it is going to turn my world upside down.and that is very scary to me and the fact that doctors have needles and hate them
0.357100	Mostly just that the doctor is going to find something really bad.  I am not worried about what the doctor will do or the physical examition itself.  Just the part in the back of your mind that he may diagnose something very bad.  That is what makes me worried and a little uneasy.  Not a whole lot just in the back of my mind.
0.452400	Receiving bad news about my health. Overall, I'm healthy but something could pop up. Or if I go in for a certain reason and they can't provide good news about the condition. 
0.500000	she never listens and wont give me pain meds for a sciatic nerve problem. This has been going on for years.
0.523800	If anything it's that the doctor might tell me something is going on with me that is worse than I am aware of/anticipating. 
0.381000	High costs is a factor that always brings on a fair amount of worry .I haven't had any real major health issues/ I think it's a natural thing to be somewhat anxious and worried when it comes to my health.
0.476190	When they talk to about getting shots and when i hear screaming from the other rooms also when they ask me if im sexually active 
0.666667	I don't like being around alot of people and I don't like having to wait for any length of time. I will leave if it to look long of a wait
0.666700	That I will find out something negative or bad about my health. Not only would it be bad healthwise, but it would cost more money. And more medical bills is a nightmare in the US. 
0.928571	ey man. this survey is very easy to answer. Is perfect for us, for you, for your mother. enjoy this!
0.428600	that he might lie to me in order to make me feel better
0.285700	I hate needles and whenever going to the doctor, that is my first thought that makes me anxious, are they going to want to give me a shot. Since I do not take pills, sometimes a shot is needed and I hate those. But, I can take them without much pain, it's just the idea- maybe some fear left over from childhood- I don't know. But, that is mainly what makes me anxious. The other thing is doctors always have to rub or push wherever it hurts and that bothers me.
0.642857	Finding out something is wrong with me. And then having to go through a struggle to receive correct treatment. Also the fear that I will be misdiagnoses in the first place.
0.333300	Waiting for the doctor to see me while being exposed to possible diseases from the other patients waiting. 
0.333300	Sometimes just the unknown. It takes awhile in the doctor's office to wait. Also, what if on the off  chance there is bad news healthwise? Those are things that comes to mind.
0.142857	Im not worried or anxious about visiting a dr they dont know anything they cant help us we have to help ourselves
0.523800	
0.428571	Can't explain why I would feel anxious or worried other than just making sure I'm doing all that I can to have the best outcome.
0.285714	I really don't get nervous unless it's the first time meeting a new doctor since you don't know what to expect
1.000000	I have a phobia about doctors and I am nervous in their offices. It makes my blood pressure rise. I am afraid of what they will say.
0.428600	If the doctor will find anything that is seriously wrong with me out of nowhere.
0.595238	you never know what they may find...i'm relatively healthy, but i'm also 71 years old. i don't think i'm overly anxious, just an ordinary reaction.
0.666700	treated me as if I were a number would not listen to my needs for anitboitics insisted on new meds that are not time tested and proved
1.000000	Because of my pre existing condition I suffer extreme fatigue, yet so many of the doctors want to prescribe me meds that have fatigue as a side effect, like gabapentin. I have to explain that I won't take medication that will fatigue me because I have a small child to take care of. I can barely function as it is with my level of disability, I don't want things that make it worse. Also I have a liver issue Gilbert's syndrome, that affects how I process medication. I've had weird side effects, for example to stemetil for nausea and was told by my doctor they only saw that in children or people with compromised liver enzymes. I have had bad reactions to all types of anti depressants from tri cyclics through SSRIs, which caused me in the former to be almost comatose and dissociated to in the later case have uncontrollable muscle spasms. I feel disbelieved by doctors and dread seeing them because they always want to give me drugs that give me adverse effects. The drugs that don't bother me so much they won't prescribe. For example NSAIDs completely mess up my stomach and acetaminophen is bad for my liver, so the best drug for pain relief for me is a small amount of codeine, not tramadol, not vicodin, not percocet, all the artificial opioids make me hallucinate, but codeine does not. However physicians wont prescribe codeine to me. I have complex over lapping conditions and none of my doctors talk or communicate with each other. I see a neurologist, a gastroenterologist, a urologist, an ent doctor, a breast specialist, an ob gyn. I get overwhelmed with all the advice and the lack of effective treatments for my diseases.
0.404800	I seldom feel it. Maybe because the doctor is gorgeous or maybe If I'm afraid to find out that something bad is happening to me which I'm very thankful that it hasn't happen to me yet.
0.714286	ALWAYS AFAIRD SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN I HAVE TESTS, ALWAYS ANXIOUS WHAT THE SCALE WILL SAY.  BUT IN THE END IM ALWAYS FEEL BETTER WHEN I LEAVE AND HAVE MY ANSWERS
0.333333	Not knowing if they are going to find something is wrong with me, also it is very costly to go to a doctor.
0.523800	I feel anxious or worried that something more serious may be wrong than is really the case. I also become anxious about the possibility of having to get any additiol tests given to me because often times my doctor's office is not very quick about getting results to me, so I will wait and worry about test results. 
0.595200	them telling me something that I don't want to hear
0.500000	Whether they find something wrong as well as if my insurance will cover the visit and what i'll have to pay out of pocket
0.404800	I have high blood pressure and at anytime I expect that will effect me in a negative way, despite having it under control with meds, I do still get worried at exams or blood drain. Another is my age. I am over 50, so I know lots of thing a happen at this age range that I should be concerned about. Getting a colonoscopy is one thing I have not done yet, and I should.
0.142900	I am most anxious when I do my blood work or when I have a pap smear. I always fear the worst. I don't know why, but I always feel like something is wrong. Things usually turn out alright, but I still always doubt things.
0.261900	As I get older I worry a little bit each time that I could have some disease that people tend to get as they get older but it hasn't happened yet.
0.714300	I'm worried they'll find something really wrong with me. I'm not anxious about the doctor.
0.428600	I do not like to have my blood drawn so that is what makes me feel the most anxious and I worry about how test will come out. 
0.833300	I really do not like being there in the first place and then having them tell me what I am doing wrong in my life makes it that much worse. I am worried that they will tell me something bad or find something really wrong with me. I am almost in the mindset that it is better not to know what is going on. I know that is bad but I worry way to much about everything to begin with. 
0.214286	Finding out I have a potentially life threatning disease such as cancer.  Especially when you thought it was something else like a spider bite.
0.523800	I have a history of respiratory issues, and they pop up fairly often. If I go in for a problem like that, I'm always worried it might be pneumonia again, which I've had several times in the last few years. Other than that, I don't really worry too much when I see the doctor.
0.142857	nothing makes me anxious about visiting the doctor. i like going to the doctor's office. i just don't like the waiting time there it is too long
0.880952	I feel uncomfortable and embarrassed because I don't like talking to people that I don't know, I don't like taking my clothes off in front of people, I worry about what the doctor might find her tell me that I have to do or what tests have to be done, I feel uncomfortable nervous and out of place.
0.214300	finding out
0.285700	What makes me anxious about the doctors office is more so when they make you wait and wait in the examining room to see the doctor.  It's the physical atmosphere of the sterile environment that gets to me if I have to sit in that little room too long.  I'm not anxious about actually seeing the doctor because he is familiar to me and I trust him completely.  It's the equipment and the environment I don't like.
0.142900	Doctors can be very pleasant to be around but many can also be untrustworthy.  It has been that way for all time and it wouldn't just suddenly halt one day.  Doctors can make sure that they are giving you a prescription that may not be the best for you as long as it is the best for them. 
0.690500	The not knowing what might happen.  Also the overall wait time.  It seems to take forever between the check in and check out process
0.166700	When I have to discuss my results that do not know about with him
0.714286	I'm just worried something will be wrong with me or that my doctor will say that I appear to be unhealthy. 
0.452400	My weight always makes me feel anxious and discouraged. Discussion around how much medication will cost makes me anxious. The wait in the waiting room usually makes me feel worried and irritated.
0.666667	That they might tell me something is really bad with me or severe and it might be a problem or when they just try to get in my nerves
0.190500	The fact that there is always a chance that they can tell you something is wrong with you
0.285714	Would be worried or anxious for the results of any tests given by doctor at that time. Don't know what would come about because of it.
0.523810	A diagnosis of a disease. Finding out I'm going to die. Stuff like that is scary you know? That's all 
0.357143	Review of test results if any. Like if he ordered a blood test when I go back to get the results I'm usually axious even though I know I have a healthy body 
0.285700	Sitting surrounded by sick people, in an environment where nosocomial infections abound. A doctor's office is where sick people come, and a percentage of them are contagious.  Limiting the amount of time in a doctor's office reduces exposure risk.
0.238095	The results of tests. I'm always just nervous I might be sick but just not aware of it. Those things worry me and make me anxious when taking test at doctors. Other than that I'm only nervous of needles such as getting shots.
0.142900	I trust the doctors and I already know that they advise for the sake of every patient, and they never ought to harm intentionally anyone
0.595200	Oh there's always the worry they'll find something that ends up being deadly cancer or something. I'm also worried about having to do the prostate thing because I'm getting to the age where it's going to happen so I'm a bit anxious about that.
0.571400	I get worried because I always think the worst and that the news will be bad because a lot of times it has been. Iâm 35 but I have already been diagnosed with both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis and have had an ischemic stroke. After getting these diagnoses when I least expected them, I just feel like any diagnosis is possible for me.
0.333333	If anything would make me anxious or worried about visiting the doctor's office, it would be the uncertainty of how long I would have to wait, what the doctor will discover, whether I can afford the treatment, whether I will understand and remember what the doctor has told me, and whether or not I am able to carry out the doctor's instructions. I am most afraid that I will not understand or communicate my medical needs.
0.214286	I am not anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. I have specific medical issues to address. I address those issues when I visit the office.
0.476200	Just sitting there, waiting for her to come in, thinking about how to tell her what has been going on with me (why I'm there to see her), about what she will find/diagnose.
0.238100	first of all, I don't experience at all any anxious emotions or worries because I know that these places and persons are there for real help.
0.976200	What makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office is wondering how I am being judged by the doctor. The doctors and nurses are human too and it is embarrassing if something happens to me that does not normally happen if someone had taken care of themselves better. Like going to the dentist for example and having bad teeth because I donât brush everyday and could be prevented if I werenât so lazy. Or getting a UTI or a yeast infection because I was holding my pee for too long when I shouldnât have or not wiping myself properly.
0.833333	A new problem or complications will be discovered that are hard or impossible to treat, that I have a problem that will kill me.
0.857100	The amount of germs in the buildings are enough to make your skin crawl never mind the waiting games and lack of compassion for it at times
0.571400	Finding out that I have something more serious than I thought I did in the first place. Generally I only got when I am very sick.
0.619000	I feel anxious when I walk into a new doctor office. I also hate going to some doctors because they are slow or way too quick in my opinion.
0.523800	
0.571429	I don't care for doctors or emergency rooms that's what makes me anxious.  I waste my time.  The reason why I get anxious and worried is because of my experience with a majority of doctors, urgent care, and emergency rooms.  I had surgery for a hystertomy, got staph, had 4 doctors visits including urgent care, and ER, went in shock and no one would believe me until a nurse at the ER had tested me after I left the ER.  My GYN said it was pop, my primary doctor completely ignored me after I told her don't look at the paper results look at me, the Urgent care said to take an extra high blood pressure bill, and the ER doctor had me touching my nose with my finger and diagnosed with urinary infection i had no symptoms for.  I suffer to this day and yes I still get hairbrained answers like to go check my eyes for the brain fog.  So that is why I get anxious.  Finally I did get a good learning urologist who performed the other half of my surgery for a urinary band who saw how sick I was and she saved my life from the staph infection after weeks of begging someone to listen that I felt like death.
0.809524	He glossed over my concerns, ignoring my questions.  He insisted his analysis was correct despite the fact that the lab work does not support his claims.  He forced me to take a drug I do NOT want in my body, knowing that I am forced to see him until my divorce is final & I can choose a new insurance plan.
0.428571	No knowing what they going to say. Sometimes things go great and some time not so good. But try and be in good health before you have to go 
0.976200	I am most anxious that there will be bad news, or difficult news.  I am also anxious the dr. wonât understand what I am trying to explain.
0.404800	I tend to be a hypochondriac so when something is bothering me enough to go to the doctor I worry that he will find something wrong with me. My mind can make me fear going to the doctor stronger than it should be by a lot.
0.142857	I am not worried or anxious when I visit the doctor I feel confidence what ever he tells me I will be able to pray and ask God for guidance
0.357100	Most of my anxiety comes from the doctor feeling that I need further testing beyond what is covered by my insurance. 
0.142900	Nothing makes me anxious.  I am relaxed and calm.  I guess the only thing that makes me a bit anxious is sitting in the exam room wrapped in paper, but I'm fine once someone comes in.
0.190500	I think that will find something else wrong with me. I know that they want to make as much money as possible off of me, and so they will do everything they can to find something else.
0.666667	Not knowing how severe the condition is. Hoping it's not as big as I'm thinking in my mind. Thinking I will never felt as good as I once felt. Thoughts I'm sure alot of people have.
0.404762	I may feel anxious or worried during a doctor's visit if I'm going in for test results, other than that I am confident that I'm receiving the care I need.
0.547600	If anything has changed, if my health has worsened even though I feel okay. 
0.190476	I get nervous going to the dr. I am very healthy but I am always concerned I am going to get random devastating news every time I go
0.857100	Mostly, I am concerned that I will have a major health problem diagnosed or discovered. I am always thinking of the worst possible scenarios in the moments leading to my scheduled appointments, especially when it's not a regular checkup and I am going to the appointment because I am feeling ill or something similar. Those moments always make me anxious, and I usually feel relief when the appointment is over and nothing major is discovered.
0.666700	I always expect a clean bill of health but I get anxious and worry that they will find something wrong with me and that is why i do not like to go. Id rather not know
0.333333	"Just the thought of testing and needles.  The ""uncomfortable "" dr visits. Those sort of things.  Who likes to go to the dr?"
0.809500	That the doctor will pressure me into doing things I can't afford, or don't really want.
0.428571	simply my reaction to being in a doctor's office.  especially troublesome because there are no windows.  the problem is the environment, not the doctor or the nurses.  and i detest getting my weight checked (i am overweight) and hate the blood pressure cuff-it hurts
0.452400	I worry about nearly everything, but that is one thing that I oddly don't general worry about.  I would say the only thing I might be slightly anxious about would be to find out I have something I didn't realize (tumor, heart condition, cancer), but that seldom crosses my mind.
0.309500	if it isn't something that is easily diagnosed then there would be cause for concern. most of the time it's a cold or a cough so not anxious usually.,
0.952381	It's not easy place to be and with dealing with insurance to seeing dr so many things to think about 
0.142857	If he is crowded and I got a long wait before getting seen nothing else .I have no fear of bad news or  bad health reports, test.
0.571429	Nothing really unless I'm going in for a specific reason and there are tests to be done. So far I have been blessed with good health.
0.690476	The results maybe a bad. I fear that it will cause all types of questions of weather or not if I am fit to live.
0.166667	You never know what a visit to the drs office will turn up.  Its that which causes me to feel anxious about an office visit.
0.666700	The fact that I may find out bad news about my health makes me feel worried. For example, my last visit was a pap smear. A few days later, my doctor emailed me saying that they have to do my pap smear over because there were not enough cells to test.
0.285714	I felt this way becausr or seemed like the doctor didnt take the time to hear all of my symptoms and he uses a computer to give him a diagnosis for whats going on with me
0.142900	I am most anxious about the cost of testing and treatment.  My copay is inexpensive, but some other areas of my insurance are not. 
0.666667	I think the main thing is that I'm uncertain about what the outcome might be.  While for most of my life I have been extremely healthy, the past 6-7 years have been extremely rough physically, and that has contributed to my apprehension.
0.738100	I am always worried that I have some form of cancer. I smoked for many years and did not take care of myself becuase I was taking care of others. Now I am suffering for it. I want to live a long life, but I fear cancer
0.214286	I have never felt any sense of dread or nervousness or anxiety about an exam . I really have no reason to feel that way. 
0.142900	Uncertainty if there will be something really wrong with me
0.809524	The not knowing...what I have, will they take it seriously... it's a crap shoot if the doctor is having a bad day.  My experience with doctors has been discouraging for the most part
0.857100	I'm worried the doctor will tell me something bad. Being pregnant I'm worried the doctor will tell me something is wrong with the baby and I don't want that 
0.142857	I do not usually feel anxious or worried about anything about my visits with my doctor, I would only be nervous if I felt ill an ddid n=know why
0.666667	having testing done but not knowing what the results might be which can cause someone to be anxious or concern
0.476190	What makes me feel anxious is finding out a health condition that I didn't know I had or finding out treatments that can be done for a health condition that I'm not comfortable with
0.571429	Because you never know what kind of information they're going to tell you so you have to be prepared for any kind of news
0.238095	I get anxious a lot it is part of my makeup I take medication for this when I go to the doctors office you have to wait in the waiting room full of people
0.714300	As I have gotten older, my Dr's visits have turned from normal visits about a cold or virus to more serious health concerns.  I now worry when I go see my Dr. that I am going to be told some bad news. 
0.142857	nothing, i do not feel any of those things, feelings when at the doctor. in my earlier years but not at my stage of life  
0.452400	I feel anxious that I will find out there something is wrong with me that I was unaware about.  The sterile atmosphere in general also makes me feel a bit anxious.
1.000000	I feel the most anxious or worried about finding out there may be something seriously medically wrong with me. I usually don't feel super worried if I go in for sinus infection symptoms, or something routine. Last time I went, it was for a breast lump, and I was terrified. 
0.642857	I'm afraid of hearing bad news or having my negative suspicions confirmed. Who knows what you can be diagnosed with during a doctor's appointment 
0.619000	I guess I am always afraid that something will turn up on a test that I was not anticipating.  There are so many detriments that can lie dormant, and something may turn up even without symptoms.  In some cases, I tend to wonder whether its better to know than not, because then you begin to live as if you have the indientified ailment.
0.547600	It depends on the doctor and the reason for the visit. If I have to go to the gynecologist, it's stressful due to the extreme invasion of privacy. I'm normally not anxious when going to my primary care doctor, unless I have to provide a blood sample. I have an extreme fear of needles.
0.642857	i get scared.I dont want to find out something went back.I dont want to find out something wrong with me that cant be fixed or treated.
0.452400	There are a few things that could make you feel anxious when visiting a doctor's office.  A couple things that make me anxious or worried is how much the copay is going to be and if I paid my  Deductible yet or in my going to get charged a ton of money.  The next thing I worry about is sitting in the waiting room with all the sick people.   Another thing that makes me anxious on the way to The Doctor's office is how long the wait is going to be in the waiting room.  Also if your blood pressure is going to be high when you 1st get there because all the waiting.
0.285714	Mainly wondering if he's going to recommend something like shots or blood work that will be unpleasant. 
0.547600	I worry about getting bad news. I also don't really like strangers touching me so this causes anxiety.
0.833300	I fear what the doctor might tell me. I will worry from the day I make the appointment until I finish the visit. If I were dying, I don't think I would want to know. Doctors don't seem to understand this fear.
0.571429	The thing that makes me mist anxious is needles those sharp little pointy needles that they have makes me anxiety
0.666700	There's the concern that something could be wrong. I avoid testing altogether. There's just a generalized anxiety with visiting the doctor as well as it can feel like an invasion of privacy.
0.142857	nothing really unless I am going for a followup to a previous issue. my dr and staff is great about making you feel at ease
0.547619	Never they are confuse me know when you're done and best of care they can give you to make you better 
0.833300	When I go in for something where I'm not sure what the diagnosis is going to be.  Like in my latest example regarding the cyst found in my thigh.  When I went in for examination, I didn't know if it was going to be a tumor or cancerous or a blood clot.  If I was just going in for a physical checkup, it wouldn't be as nerve racking.  However, even then, you never know if they're going to find something wrong with you and that is always a little unnerving.
0.285714	nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried except just making sure the doctor knows what they are doing because were I live they really do not
1.000000	Once I am waiting over 20min I start to panic severely because the wait alone is bad - it is exhausting, then you kind of lose your momentum and forget to tell the doctor things which makes me more anxious - then I am fearful once I tell her my symptoms that she will tell me 5 different BAD deadly things that it could be and she wants to run a bunch of blood work and tests which then make me have panic attacks until the test day and then weeks until the results are in - the waiting for everything is the most difficult
0.595200	I worry that I will get a positive test result for a chronic condition. For example, recently my tests showed that I have high cholesterol. 
0.619048	I worked in the field for a number of years, but not in a professional capacity. I have some knowledge but math is not my strong suit..
0.261905	I feel totally relaxed and if I have questions I ask him.He is very direct and fortunately I have no serious issues other than age.
0.642900	If my doctors find something unusual if i visit them that makes me worried. Once they find out that my certain blood level is not in sync i can't just ignore them most of the time they look after their patient. Also just going to visit doctors itself is worrisome. The thought it self will make me thinking if they find out something going on with me and then i have to go through other diagnostics taste. That takes time, money and more stress for my family.
0.142900	I worst fear is that of catching a cold or flu from someone else that does not take the same needed precautions as I do. for example, washing hands.
0.714300	Not knowing what will happen
0.428571	Because I want a solution to my problem and i'm not sure if she can solve it. I worry that I have to keep suffering.
1.000000	The uncertainty of what is wrong with me and what else they will diagnose during their examination and what the possible treatment's will be
0.571400	I am scared they will find something that is termil. My father passed away from cancer when I was very young, and I get extremely anxious that I will get blindsided with something terrible. 
0.500000	Generally, I'm not worried, unless I'm in pain from a specific problem.  Then, of course, I'm concerned about finding a solution for the pain.
0.261905	Nothing makes me anxious or worried when I visit my physician. She always make me feel at ease during my annual checkup.
0.642857	I feel that way some times just because I don't know if my condition is getting worse or better. I think it is some what normal to feel this way.
0.452400	I am not sure what the outcome will be. Is he going to give me any news I may not want to hear.
0.309524	what makes me worried when i visit the doctors office is if the injury i received had gotten worse, anxious because i really want to know whats going on with me if i have and health problems 
0.238100	I tend to worry in general, and when I get blood work done I worry that my results will not be good. I worry that conditions that I have will not improve from one appointment to the next. I'm on medication for these conditions and I worry that a combition of these medications and changes I've made to my diet and lifestyle won't have a positive effect. So far I have had positive results, but I worry every time that that won't continue. When I first started seeing my primary care doctor I was worried that I might not like her or might not be comfortable with her, but we have developed a pretty good relationship. 
0.976200	i dont like crowds the last time i went the lady told me to come in the eveing hardly any people .i got there it was so crowded no were to sit anxienty was kicking in bad.went to the window she gave me a clip board to fill out paper work was so nerves i told here i couldnt be in here with all thse people she told the nurse she got me.i had to walk pass everyone it was aweul sat in a room for 2hrs to bee seen.
0.452400	I get worried or embarrassed if it's something super gross that I need the doctor to look at or I have a question about. I worry other doctors might know about it and think I'm weird, even though I know they've seen just about everything from their patients. 
0.714286	i am worried that the doctor will find something that will indicate that i am sick or need further care 
0.309524	afraid that he will find something dramatically wrong with me - afraid he might be upset with my smoking and weight
0.190476	sometimes i have stuff going on that seems like it could be serious. i also worry that the symptoms i have may not be something that can be easily diagnosed and i can get lost in the world of referrals and tests and different opinions
0.642857	I feel most anixous about being touch and in a place where frequent sick people seat. Being in a place geeked with germs makes me nervous
0.166667	I am not anxious or worried when visiting the dr. Being in the Healthcare profession puts me at ease. Having medical knowledge helps me not to feel nervous in that atmosphere 
0.857143	Every time I get lab work done and they send my test results in the mail in week I read the results to see if everything is alright. 
0.333300	"For the past couple of years my Dr has been monitoring some ""suspicious nodules "" in my lung. So I always dread going in after having the xrays or Cat Scans done to monitor it. My dad died of lung cancer so it scares me and I dread going in to find out if its ok or not"
0.690476	That they are going to find something else wrong with me, as if there aren't enough already, and it is going to require more tests and my insurance won't pay for it. 
0.785700	I think it is the closeness and intimacy in a stranger looking at and examining my body, as well as not knowing what is wrong or what could be wrong with me.
1.000000	I'm general worried that something is going on that will make it harder for the people in my life to take care of me
0.476190	I am not too worry about going in for a doctor visit.  I am pretty healthy and have no current health issues.  My biggest issue is being overweight.  I hate getting on the scale in front of others.  
0.404762	I am unsure of exactly what the test involves and what the outcome would mean. I am worried about the means to pay for any possible diagnosis' treatment.
0.142857	that he may find something new  as i have several items i am dealing with.                              
0.404800	Even though I feel fine, there's always lingering doubt in my mind. Like I'll get some bad news or he'll tell me I have some disease or medical issue I wasn't anticipating.
0.547600	More worried just in case doctor told me something worst thing. 
0.190500	Except for routine visits, I go to the physician because of an acute condition. I usually know the best and usual course of treatment because I have researched it prior to the visit. I am anxious because my physician is sometimes blase and doesn't show the concern that I would expect.
0.357143	That he might find something wrong, even in a routine check-up exam and I may  have to make uncomfortable choices to deal with something.
0.785714	Im always worried that tjere is something wrong with me that my dr does not see.  But i domt know what tests to aks for or how to say to him that i think hes wrong and there is something definitely wromg with me
0.619048	Taking my. Mood pressure. White coat syndrom causes blood pressure to rise more than usual. Also hate checking weight in doctor office. 
0.166667	Her talking over me and not actually listening to my problems. She would just listen to part of the symptoms or issues I have and explain that I am too young to be diagnosed with anything so she gives me at home remedies to see if the problem stops or persists.
0.904762	I always think something could be wrong and might go wrong and will cause a discomfort for me and my lifestyle. Hospitals are cold and not comfortable places so they make me very anxious.
0.547600	I just do not like the whole experience, or the sterile smell of the health care faculties. 
0.595200	I really know what the doctor or nurse is going to say to me. If I gain a few pounds I feel like they are saying 'lose the weight fatty'. Also when it came to my mental problems they want to push drugs than get to a solutions so I worried they are just going to turn me into a zombie on drugs.
0.357143	What they will find in their tests and examinations and sometimes they even have misdiagnosis because they confuse you with another person sometimes.
0.333300	Really the worst part about it to me, is taking the time out of my day to go and wait for a pointless exam that I have no reason to be examined in the first place. It's just a huge interruption every time it comes up, because its usually completely unnecessary.
0.476200	"I feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I""m afraid that I won't be believed, they simply won't care about my problem or that my individual concerns or needs will be ignored simply so they can see more patients that day. I'm afraid, anxious and desperate when they ignore me and my symptoms. So, if my original concern isn't addressed then I usually leave feeling physically as well as emotionally unwell after that. Subhuman almost that I don't matter enough to listen to. Then I question why I spent money to be ignored and still have the same symptoms that I walked in with."
0.380952	I cannot think of anything about myself that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office.
0.571400	That I'll actually find myself and that will actually read to do something that I don't actually either want or need; basically that I won't be completely honest with the Dr.
0.238095	Everyone that visits a doctor get anxious or worried, if you don't, something is wrong with you.  Anxious, because I want to be taken at my time of appointment, not 30 min. later.  Worried that she might find or see something that she hasn't seen or heard before, that is natural
0.214286	Whats makes me feel the most anxious or worried is being told I have some sort of condition that can kill me.
0.261900	I just don't like being in a place that has sick people around since I get sick easily. I don't get extremely worried, but the thought of getting sicks is always just sitting in the back of my mind.
0.500000	I feel anxious because I am afraid my doctor will miss something because they don't care that much about my health they just want to prescribe me something expensive and then send me away. 
0.523810	My child I'm always worried about him. I dont know how to stop my worry. I know things will be okay but I still worry alot
0.976200	I cried last time I went because I couldn't handle the stress of him treating me like I'm stupid or asking why I'm gaining so much weight. All he could say was I'm referring you to a phys doctor. 
0.547619	The atmosphere always seems king of abrupt. Cause my doctor is very beautiful. I'm always anxious to tell her that.
0.833300	I am most anxious and worried when I visit a doctor's office because I feel like doctors only look at the major illnesses that you may have instead of realizing that everyone doesn't fit into those categories.
0.857100	Because they hold the key to knowledge i am unaware of so giving up control to random people is fearful and naked. Putting trust in a stranger for my well being is also not as controlling as I typically like and i know i am my own best fighter. The sickness that i am walking into at a doctors office is also seems like i will walk out worse than i walk in it seems counterintuitive to what im looking for.
0.166667	If he is going to tell me something wrong.I am not anxious about my doctor.I feel good most of time when I go to my doctor office.
0.547600	I would worry the most that they would find something life threatening or dangerous that is not outwardly apparent, and can only be found in a checkup.
0.833300	I often worry that they will discover something is wrong with me.  I also worry about how much the doctor's visit will cost and whether or not I will be able to afford by bill when I check out.  In general, visiting the doctor gives me high anxiety.
0.809500	Noodle's I don't like the pain being told something is wrong in my body really make me worried are just having to visit my doctor 
0.595200	I'm always worried when I go to the doctor because of the history of cancer in my family.  I get worried that little things may be precursor's to cancer or something worse.
0.214286	if I have a new symptom then I get nervous since I have had cancer twice already. I worry that there is a new cancer or the old one has come back. 
0.214286	I feel most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor's office when I have to have my blood pressure taken. I can take it at home and it is fine, the minute I get into a doctor's office it gets high. The doctor told me I have white coat syndrome. Always a little concerned whenever they do an EKG. Since I have had a triple bi-pass back in 2004. But it always comes out OK. Get a little anxious when I have to wait too long in the doctor's office. Unfortunately that happens from time to time. But I would rather wait a little long then have the doctor rush through with everyone.
0.714300	You just never know what is going to be found out. I have a lot of iffy family history that makes me nervous so I always dread going to the doctor
0.595238	That they will say something they saw in my lab test results was not looking good and it will be bad or not so great news, that they say something is wrong with me
0.166700	I have white coat syndrome.  Any Doctors office makes me nervous, you feel like you're being judged.  I have gotten mostly over that but a new doctor will still make me feel that way. When I was younger I had a particular doctor that talked down to me and was unkind and it stuck with me for a long time.
0.857100	I am just anxious and apprehensive when I go into new environments and have to deal with people that I don't know and situations that are uncertain, that includes doctor's offices.
0.642857	I don't know if i'm doing good physically, or if the is a health problem I didn't know about. This is what makes me anxious and worried. When they have to use a machine to examine me it also makes me anxious. The longer I have to wait in the doctor's office the more anxious I get.
0.142857	nothing makes me feel anxious or worryed when im visiting the doctor because my doctor is very good at what she dose so i dont need to wory about anything.
0.380952	When whatever is wrong with me could be a number of issues so we have to discuss how to go about figuring things out.
0.309500	you never know if they might find cancer. You could go to the doctor for something you think is probably minor, but it is actually something really bad
0.666700	I am always worried that we will have to do a painful test. I really dont like getting shots or blood drawn. I always worry that they will find something really wrong. Also i dont like when they say i have to take off my clothes. I have a gyno for that.
0.333300	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office for something that is not routine (outside of my regular appointments). It is the unknown that I worry about.

0.785700	Gynecological examition makes me so anxious and worried because first thing you have to show your private parts, second the thought about the test results.
0.476200	I always worry what they might find. I have a history of cancer and diabetes in my family and I am always concerned that is going to become a issue in my life as well. I guess that is what I am most worried about, something that I can not control happening and altering my life.
0.142900	When a treatment is not working and we have to explore altertives
0.833300	I don't like feeling vulnerable as someone exams me.  I don't like having to get undressed in a cold room or having someone judging me.  If I do go to the doctor, I normally have to have something seriously wrong so I am anxious to find out what the problem is.  
0.309500	I'm a very self-conscious person, so sometimes I worry that something might be wrong with me. That's really the only anxious fear I ahve.
0.666667	I fear getting bad test results that could potentially cause me to have to take medication. I currently don't take any medication and I don't want to have to take any in the future.
0.142900	well if it is not my own doctor I guess the thing I would be worried about would be judgement or not listening to me.
0.404800	I don't worry so much about getting a predictable diagnosis or treatment for a physical condition I have already noticed and/or need to have taken care of. What I worry about is whether the doctor will tell me it's worse than I thought or find something else wrong with me.
0.666700	I feel most anxious about some bad news I could get from the doctor's. I am overweight, so I am always worried that I could have a diagnosis related to that.
0.142857	Worried that my conditions may have worsened.  I think about how my symptoms have been going.  Whether they have been getting worse and worse.  If so,  that makes me increasing nervous about speaking to my doctor.  I worry that he may put me on more medication,  which I really do not want to do. 
0.166700	Just finding surprises regarding my health. The next thing would be the cost. Though I have insurance, It's hard to see what it covers or not and what I will end up paying.
0.619048	mainly the things that make me most worried or anxious are the follow-up appointments and anything new she might find
0.285700	I just generally feel this way whenever I am out and about, doing things. I am a bit shy so I get nervous when I'm interacting with a lot of people.

0.500000	I am anxious when i visit the doctor and I can not pin point why I am. I feel like she is rushed and if I have a concern that day they she is not going to talk to me about it. It sort of makes it feel like pointless to even go in to the office.
0.571429	Worried that something might be very wrong or require surgery or an invasive procedure. I am very afraid of needles.
0.380952	I have not had success with overcoming my low thyroid disorder, so with every visit I am concerned with the extra expenditure, and not having success with my health.
0.738095	Thinking that the doctor's going to do things that make my life difficult, and he'll bully me if I try to stick up for myself. I've had doctors tease me, tell me that I should purchase life insurance (I was in college at the time and NOT a fan of risky behavior), the works. 
0.642857	sometimes i worry that the doctors wont give me the specific medicine i need. my friend has this problem frequently.

0.285714	I sometimes feel worried how my blood pressure will be because I do take medicine to control my blood pressure.
0.523810	I'm not anxious about visiting the doctor unless a procedure needs to be done. I don't like leaving with the same questions I had going in with the same amount of uncertainty as before. It feels like a waste of time.
0.714300	Whether they are going to find something wrong and try to pressure me into some 'treatment' which will suppress symptoms and interfere with my body's attempts to heal and rebalance. I really wish that I could find a holistic practitioner who could help me live a tural and healthy lifestyle, making the most of traditiol medical knowledge and modern medicine. 
0.928600	I am worried that the doctor is going to tell me that I have something seriously wrong. Ever since my dad's cancer diagnosis 4 years ago (and his ensuing death in 2015) I have been close to terrified every time I have to see the doctor. 
0.285700	I am usually pretty good when going to the doctor.   I do get anxious waiting for them to come into the room but that is more due to me hating sitting there cold in the gown waiting and nothing to do with the actual appointment

0.642900	I feel anxious that they are going to find something and give me bad news. No one wants bad news in their life.

0.428600	I do not usually feel this way but when I do it is usually because I know what I am in for. I typically like to spend time self diagnosing before a visit to the doctor. I usually anticipate the most likely outcomes. I even watch the procedures online in so cases. Knowing whats coming and seeing it become my reality is a little nerve wracking. I get a little anxious from procedures involving me being naked. I think that is just uncomfortable in any case. I also do not enjoy pain so knowing I am getting some stitches can cause some anxiety. 
0.690500	Uncertainty is the key to promote anxiety in my opinion. During the visit, I am worried when I meet with the PCP to discuss the outcome of the examination. The main reason is the uncertainty about the result. What if something really bad happens? What is my current health condition? I cannot control my feeling in the uncertain condition.

0.809500	I'm not sure what I get so anxious or worried about, I just hate doctors offices. From the time I walk in (even if it's just to get a vaccine), my blood pressure elevates. I think that it stems from a time when I had a life threatening condition but I didn't know and went into the appointment thinking it was something simple, but instead I was rushed to the emergency room and spent several days in the hospital. 
0.452381	The arriving before time and waiting way past time to finally be seen. The medical bill afterwards and cost of prescriptions.
0.928600	It is just uncomfortable.  It is not something you do everyday so when the time comes for an appointment it makes me anxious.  I worry about gaining weight or my blood work numbers not being in the range they should be.

0.190500	there is always an element of anxiety about any exam. doctors are people too.  are they having a good day? are they focused on me? do they have time to listen to me? do i really feel what i think i feel. will they believe me when i describe what i feel?

0.500000	I hope that it goes well, but a 65, things can happen and happen quickly. I'm on blood pressure meds and have been treated in hospitol for liver issues associated with that. I'm always concerned that something may crop up.
0.357100	I'm worried to get bad news and I don't particulary enjoy needles. I try to, however, be mature and remain realistic. Whether we're perfectly healthy or struggling with a medical condition, we just have to do our best to achieve the best quality of life and health as possible.

0.714286	I hate visiting doctors and having to take prescriptions and feeling old and having health problems I hate getting older
0.714286	Just worried that the will not understand my symptoms and I will not get the proper treatment for my hypothyroidism
0.690476	 I am someone who worries and can overanalyze situations easily. The way I feel can be circumstantial. For example, if I'm in pain and don't know what's wrong, I'll be very nervous to visit the doctor because of what could be wrong. Fear of the unknown or what's to come. 
0.571400	Being told that something is wrong, especially if its something i may have not yet considered.  I dont like the unknown and if i have an idea of what im dealing with i can prepare and figure out whats next, but im no dr so there is always the possi bility something will be truly wrong.
0.881000	When I visit a doctors office the thing that makes me the most anxious is worrying about getting a shot.  For my entire life, I have absolutely been terrified of needles and getting shots.  Each time I go to a doctors office this thought and idea continuously races through my mind and I find myself often sweating and shaking out of nervousness for no reason.  Also when I visit a doctors office, I worry about how much the visit is going to cost and what is actually wrong with me .
0.714300	I am most anxious when awaiting results. The unknown is always the most stressful for me, because I can't figure out how to proceed. I also don't particularly like needles, but it is more the time between seeing the needle and it actually going into my arm that is stressful. 
0.214300	I only get anxious/worried if I think I could have a serious health problem - and the doctor is giving me feedback on it. It is typically something I am familiar with so I am not that worried.

0.476190	I just get a little nervous in general when I go to the doctor usually when tests are being performed; no specific reason to my knowledge.

0.500000	I may get worried or anxious if i have an appointment and have a long wait period. I dont mind waiting a few minutes to have time to relax but after about fifteen minutes i get restless. 
0.714300	I feel anxious because of potentially being told some bad news. I also feel anxious at potentially having more of my time wasted by the purposefully inefficient system they have.
0.857100	I'm afraid they will find something else wrong or needs to be taken care of that will cost me more money out of pocket even though we have insurance.
0.476200	Concern about what they may find and what they may have to say about my weight! :-) Other than that, I find it an enjoyable experience.

0.142857	I only feel worried when I'm being tested for possible serious health problems. I'm worried that my doctor might find something serious.

0.285714	I don't feel worried or anxious when I go to the dr.  When I go to the dr it's because I have a issue I need answers to.  
0.571400	Iâm most anxious that lab results will have indicate I need some kind of medication.  I worry about my blood pressure, cholesterol and liver enzymes but so far they are OK. 
0.214286	That my blood pressure will be elevated or my cholesterol levels will not be in the acceptable range.  Otherwise, I have no worries.
0.142900	I would feel anxious if they did testing and looked at the results and said things didn't look good. 
0.214286	I do not go to a doctor. Therefore I never feel anxious or worried. If you feel good why waste mine or the doctor's time.
0.952400	I worry about what the doctor might find wrong with me. I worry whether the doctor will make a mistake or whether they will listen to my concerns. I get very anxious having to wait a long time for the doctor to examine me. In that period of time, all kinds of thoughts go through my mind. 
0.142900	I only feel anxious when I know there's something wrong with me already. I worry that the treatment might be expensive or not effective.
0.857143	If I am being seen for something I feel is serious then I have probably already researched symptoms and possible causes and I am worried about what the diagnosis is going to be. I also feel anxious when having an exam because sometimes it is just awkward
0.642900	"I have general anxiety disorder - my default brain state is slightly worried, with a tendency to latch onto any ""abnormal"" event as a cause for worry/stress/bad reaction. Specifically with doctor's visits I worry that they will ""find something"" wrong. There is really no reason behind it, and I am fully aware of this. I can deal with it, but I still have to experience it. I actually relax/do better if they do find something, because then I can talk about it, get, and give more info. It is mostly the unknown that is bothersome to my brain."
0.238095	I only worry about what health issues may be discovered and what treatment will be prescribed should an issue arise
0.857100	The doctors always like to blame the patent for  everything.  They dont understand  that we  have a  real life out side  our health. I  cant make  it  to  6 doctors  in a  week and  still work enough to be able to pay for gas  to get to them doctors appointments  
0.476190	i feel worried that the doctor may tell me or diagnosed me something that can be dreadful and heartbreaking to hear
0.428571	I have overcome any fears or hesitation which plaguey younger years. I look forward to being declared totally fit and healthy.
0.381000	I would say the only thing that really makes me worried is the chance that my doctor will have some bad news for me after a checkup. Something like cancer or another terrible disease.   
0.452400	I think it is just the unexpected. I'm ok as long as I know what is going to happen, but if I don't .. then I get anxious - confused - nervous and sometimes upset.
0.666667	i am already dealing with a few health issues myself.  so when i go to the doctor i am expecting unpleasant news.  it is like you found this last time now lets see what else we can find. 
0.380952	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor because im worried about the results and the diagnosis
0.785700	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried is not being taking seriously. It seems most doctors are so quick to send you on their way so that they can get to their next patient. It is so hard to find a doctor who acts they actually care now - a - days. Im also worried about being treated for the wrong thing while the real problem is growing stronger. I had a friend who had a tumor the size of a basket ball on her uterus. The doctor told her she was pregnant. So for two months she walked around thinking she was pregnant. Turns out she had a very progressed cancer tumor on her uterus. She almost died from being mis- diagnosed.
0.523810	I worry about what may show up in tests. Sometimes I'm unaware of a problem, but the doctor will find something that needs attention and/or treatment.
0.738095	i feel uneasy beause i am worried about the outcome and what i would have do do for treatment if i need some. i had cancer in my family, breast removable and i sm worried that i might have to go though that or but my family through that.
0.261900	Doing blood work. 
0.714300	That they are going to tell me that something is seriously wrong with me. Not really anything in particular but that something will require some surgery or a massive change in lifestyle. I always think about having cancer, or how scared I would be if I had to undergo a major surgery. If I'm going in for say blood tests, I'm going to worry that my blood tests are going to show that I have major health issues, etc. I still always have these worries and fears, despite the fact that I've yet to have anything like that occur. It's always something minor, but I always am terrified of something major.
