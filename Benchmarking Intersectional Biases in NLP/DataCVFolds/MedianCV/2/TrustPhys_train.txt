-1	Sometimes they are in a hurry to get to the next patient and make quick, sp judgments that do not apply.  Sometimes they are much more interested in what insurance plan you have than your well being.
-1	I feel that my primary care physician is adequate. He does listen and try to help with my medical issues. However he also refuses to try new procedures and treatments that might help me.
-1	With my PCP, there has been a long relationship, he know my needs/wants and is able to accommodate them in most instances. If I did not trust my PCP, I would get a different one. 
-1	I trust them that they think they are doing the right thing. What worries me is what they could be doing wrong.
1	I trust my doctor completely. He has never wronged me and he is always willing to listen to my most intimate problems and give objective advice on what to do to treat any ailments I have.
-1	Well he knows what is best. I'm sure he doesn't want to get sued for doing something wrong. He wants to do the best he can do. 
1	My primary care physician was able to correctly diagnose a rare inner ear condition that I have.
-1	Some doctors are in it for the money
-1	I think my doctor is generally trustworthy.  I wonder sometimes with the things he says if he is pushing me to get on drugs because he wants to write RX for those types of drugs.
-1	Doctors are human, they are arrogant and used to getting their own way, they are inclined to listen to the powers that be instead of to their patients, and they are often lapdogs for the pharmaceutical industry.
1	He has been our family physician forever, I trust him to make decisions that positively affect our family. 
-1	My doctor listens and allows me to complete my sentences (doesn't interrupt). My doctor asks me pertinent questions.
-1	Because I do feel that sometimes doctors pushes way to much medicines
1	They have given me the proper care I have needed up until this point.
-1	I do trust Docs but they also are human and can be moody, high strung and sometimes jackasses
-1	I'm usually a pretty healthy individual, so I only ever go see him for my regular annual physicals. I really have no reason to doubt what he tells me, since I'm a very low-maintenance person health wise.
1	I trust my primary care physician.  I have been seeing her for 17 years so I completely trust her as a doctor. 
-1	I more or less trust my doctor. I think it has primarily due to how she treats me. She's very nice and that inspires trust.
-1	My dr. won't let me ask a lot of questions. Like my diabetes medicine. I tried asking about getting something else but he told me no. I wish there was a way that I could learn more
-1	My doctor tends to diagnose most problems as the same thing so I don't always agree with all he says.
-1	I trust them to an extent. However, they are human, they make mistakes and they can't always devote full attention to every patient.
-1	Just started seeing this doctor and they harp on and on about needing to lose weight.  I get the feeling that they would blame any issue I'm having on my weight and not want to investigate further.
-1	I do not know my physician well enough because I do not visit him very frequently. I also do not trust people too much to begin with.
-1	I feel that they generally are trying to rush you out of the office and don't really care that much.
-1	It's not necessarily that I don't trust my doctor but  I think she's far too rushed for such a serious matter. She is very casual and nonchalant about things that are of great importance to my life. She brushes off side effects/symptoms as if they are normal every day things but then puts me on medication to alter them and brings up having to have heart surgery. I am getting mixed messages and it makes me unsure of the severity or what she is thinking about course of treatment.
-1	I trust them because I have been with them since I was a kid. However, their practices seem a little bit outdated compared to others.
1	I have been going to the same doctor for 40 years.  I completely think he understands me and has my best interests in mind.
-1	Overall I have slight trust in the medical world. I think my doctor is persuaded by large pharma companies and I think a lot of the times they do things that are easier or make more money.
-1	They have gotten prominent degrees and I have good reason to trust them.
1	I trust my PCP because she paid attention to the fact that I had a goiter, when no one else would, and she's treating my hypothyroidism, when no one else took it seriously.
1	I picked my physician based on ratings and reviews and when I met with her I realized and I could trust her.
1	The first time I went to see my primary care physician he spent a lot of time with me getting to know about my problems. He sat down, looked concerned, and wanted to know more information so that he could help me. He also listens to me when I have a different medication request and he is very easy to work with.
-1	I have been to him for over a decade as has my spouse. He is a great doctor
-1	I usually trust my doctor. Sometimes when he is rushed he doesn't give me the attention I ask for. For example, I had concerns over side effects from medication and he was in a hurry so shrugged it off. 
-1	I feel my doctor is knowledgeable and genially concerned with my health and well being. He is a caring person and isn't worried about how much money he can make.
-1	I have gone to him for several years.   he takes time to listen and gives useful feedback.   
-1	Not a special reason
1	I have built up trust with my doctor because I know that they are being honest with me. I have been going to them for a long time and they always seem to have my better care in mind.
-1	I'm not crazy about him, but I'm on Medicaid and few good doctors. take it.
1	I go to him because I do not understand enough about what is wrong to make a decision. If I didn't trust my doctor, I wouldn't have gone
-1	I really want to trust my doctor but I think we have gotten away from the family physician model and now we just see anyone.  And each doctor is different so you basically always start over at square one each visit
-1	"Doctors are only out to make as much money as possible. There should never be a time when you make an appointment at a doctors and have to wait a month to see them or be told to go to the ER ""if"" it's an emergency. Doctors should have patient CAPS and all doctors should be required to take all insurances. Also a doctor should never have so many appointments that you see their nurses aid instead of them."
-1	I trust my PCP to an extent, but my full confidence and faith does not rely on man--but on my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
-1	I don't distrust my physician. However, they are often rushed to get to the next patient so I don't always trust that they are being as thorough as possible.
1	I trust my doctor because he has always been honest with me. If I had any problem in the past he always told me my options and explained the consequences. 
-1	I think for the most part my doctors are honest. However, I still factor in my own opinions. 
-1	I don't trust them anymore. I will go to the Emergency room if I have to but the doctors where I live are all foreign. The nurses in the hospital are all from Haiti. I live near 33460 and we have tons of illegals and foreign people here. They don't seem to care as much about quality of care, like I had growing up in Alabama.
1	My PCP is very thorough in every appointment and takes the time to not only discuss options, but also make sure that there is no pressure to pick a particular option since it is my treatment. 
-1	It's all about the money, not the patients... they are just a sick-people mill.
1	Because they take a medical oath and have ethics that they have to follow. It's not about what they want to do, its about what's right and what's wrong. They have always looked out for my interest in health care and are not subjective or bias.
-1	I believe he's a good guy I generally trust him. Gut reaction
-1	I don't trust them. They've screwed up before.
-1	I trust him as a person but I'm not sure if I can fully trust any doctor. I've seen a lot of documentaries and read a lot about the health care system in regards to Black people. I don't believe they always have my well being in mind. 
-1	Trust by verify. I am smart enough to know not to trust my internet/google searches when it comes to my health, but I'm also smart enough to know that 99 times out of 100 my minor ailments and annual checkups are best handled by my PCP and I can rely on his expertise
-1	They have always been open and honest and answer all my questions throuhgly
1	I have a good relationship with my doctor. She has always been very helpful. She is always willing to listen to my thoughts and concerns and is never forceful in her suggestions.
1	I really like my primary care physician. He is never in a rush with even though he may be busy with patients. I ask a lot of questions and he always answers them. He gives me his thoughts but allows for me to make my decision on my own
-1	He is very young but seems to be engaged with his patients 
-1	I don't know if I trust doctor's in general, I feel that they may be only looking out for themselves, but I can't pinpoint why. It's probably just distrust for that type in general.
1	I trust my doctor because he is a professiol and knows what he's talking about. He has never led me wrong so far.
1	I have just never had any problems. I've been seeing the same doctor for years and years. I feel like there is no reason to not trust her.
-1	My doctor takes time to listen and try to explain things to me.  She seems very thorough in here assessment of my situations and has not steered me wrong yet in health decisions.
-1	I trust my PCP because a previous Dr had misdiagnosed me, so I went to my current Dr. for a second opinion.  He immediately sent me to the ER and it ultimately saved my life.
-1	I think alot of the time they make alot of money off people having disease that they over diagnose and over medicate
1	My doctor takes the time to sit with me and make sure I understand what he is saying.  He has day with me doing research on medication and takes my opinion seriously. 
-1	I think they are very busy and default to common diagnosis.  Seems like it takes a few follow ups before they go into any depth.
-1	At times, non-traditiol treatment options may be overlooked or undervalued depending on a doctor's experience and history, when altertive options paired with modern medicine can find a useful balance.
-1	I trust her because I have know her for years and she is very approachable and friendly. She is willing to be honest and frank with me, even if the truth hurts.
-1	I find that often doctors just do whatever is needed for them to get from patient to patient (take as little time as needed) and sometimes just don't listen to what their patient is saying to them.  I can understand their busy schedule but sometimes the care doesn't seem persol, just rushed.
1	I really trust her because she listens to me and takes my views and opinions into account. She also is very smart and thinks out loud with me about options to address my concerns rather than just deciding on an option for me.
-1	Most doctors really want to help. Though there might be some out there that don't want to help. Those are the kind that are in it for the money. But most doctors can be trusted
-1	He's fine.  I generally trust him or I wouldn't go to him. He's honest but that doesn't mean he knows everything or is up to date on the latest treatments.  He's not afraid to refer me to a specialist, which I appreciate.
1	My physician seems concerned about my health. She is willing to talk to me and takes my concerns into consideration.
-1	I grew up around a lot of christain science folks and saw how healthy they are. most long term medication has consequence and I avoid it. Doctors are trained to treat symptoms, not the problems cause
-1	I THINK HE IS A GOOD DR. HE TRIES VERY HARD TO LISTEN TO ME AND HELP ME OUT. WE ALSO TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO HIM. HE IS VERY THOUROGH
-1	she's been the only doctor that has found an antidepressant that didn't give me side effects
1	My doctor can relate to me and anybody else for that matter. She listens to me and my concerns and make sure that I have little to no worries. 
1	I have had a long-term relationship and we communicate well. I have never had any issues with this doctor.
1	I trust my doctors because every time I had a problem with my health she steered me in the right direction 
1	She is knowledgeable and up to date on the latest research. She is caring and attentive as well. 
1	This doctor is a colleague and friend of the family. He was once my pediatrician and pediatrician to my younger sister that is now 25. He is also the pediatrician to my children as well. I can always go to him for a second opinion if needed. 
1	I feel that my doctor and I have a good relationship and that we can trust each other to work through any problems that might arise. I feel that my doctor knows that I want to know how my health is going and what I need to change in my life.
1	I trust them with my care. They know more medical stuff than I do. It would be crazy not to trust them.
-1	Sometimes it feels as if they just want to get through with you and onto the next patient.
1	I have been given no reason not to trust her. She always has good advice and doesn't push pills as the fix for something.
-1	Recently I was diagnosed with Lung Cancer. I've been telling my Dr. I had problems but he kept saying it was bronchitis. He got it wrong.
1	Because he saved my life. He was very good indiagnosing my illness.
1	I trust my doctor because he knows a lot more than me. He has vast experience, I have none.
1	I have been with my doctor long enough for him to know my history. I think he always chooses the best path for me and we work together on long term plans for health. 
-1	Doctors are human, Some are qualified/competent, some are incompetent. Some put patient care over money, some put money over care, etc. I wouldn't blindly trust anyone for anything without doing some reasearch on my own, getting a second opinion if necessary, and considering the facts myself. 
-1	I don't really trust my primary care physician because he doesn't tend to remember information from visit to visit and he seems quick to throw a medication at any complaint without considering other options.
-1	i trust them because i have used them for years and they have no reason to be dishonest to me
-1	I feel about average about these things. I think there are goo physicians but I also think some don't take things seriously. 
-1	I don't really trust doctors because in the United States, where I live, healthcare is a for-profit industry. Doctors are basically no different than salesman, and, selling products myself, I know what goes into trying to get people to buy a product. It's not honest; it's not about care; it's about money. I also think many doctors are not realistic about the way people live their lives.
1	I trust my doctor because he has always done right by me. He answers all my questions and listens to my concerns.
1	My doctor has always been very honest about everything...even if I might not want to hear it.  I feel like we have good, honest conversation and I feel comfortable discussing anything with him.
1	my doctor have decades of experience and it great at treating me correctly and with the right medication
1	I'm not an expert. I defer to my doctor because they are far more qualified to tell me about my health than I am. 
1	He took an oath to make sure his patients are cared for to the best of his ability. He went to school for years to get to where he is, and that means it's persol for him.
-1	i do trust him for the most part. in the past there were instances where me and some others have doubted him but as he grows older he seems to have more of a better understanding of things now.
-1	I distrust my primary care physician because she is always in a rush and in a hurry and basically often ignores what I am concerned about by brushing it off as no big deal. She often pushes medications as well when I make it clear that I do not want to use medicine as a first resort.
1	I believe that doctors enter the profession because they want to help people. It would be unethical for them to mislead their patients. 
-1	I've had the same primary care doctor my whole life, he's never done anything to make me feel like he isn't trustworthy or qualified.  He knows me very well (and my family) and I feel like I can trust him to do what's best for me.
-1	Overall, I do have some base trust in doctors. I recognize their position, and what it would take for them to make it there. Obviously, they've gone through extensive schooling and are well experienced. Thus, I should at minimum, respect their opinions and strongly consider them.
-1	While I do think that they can sometimes be thorough and careful, I do believe that sometimes it's only to fit their hypotheses. I don't firmly stand by that, but I do believe some just want to get patients in and out without so much as a second appointment or a scheduling more exams. 
-1	My doctor wants to give his all, but the time crunch between patients can make it difficult for him.  
1	I really like my current doctor.  He's younger than me, which is a little weird, but he is very open minded, more so than me.  He always gives me different  altertives  on how to treat myself 
1	We have a great relationship where he fields my questions appropriately. He also understands my background when giving explations.
1	Always honest with me, asks me questions to really know what's going on and to also ensure I understand
1	Doctors care about people, thats why they do what they do. They are properly trained and can generally be trusted.
-1	I have been seeing my primary doctor for several years, and she is well known and thought of in our small community. I know her outside of the office as well. I fully trust her to help me solve any medical issues, or to at least help direct to any specialist I may need.
-1	My doctor is relatively new, and I had not been in a few years. I was very nervous, because I have never liked going to the doctor, hospital, etc. She was so easy mannered, understanding and really listened to my concerns. I liked that, and have been going back ever since for regular check-ups/ins.
-1	I trust my current PCP very much! I had very negative experience with a previous PCP who didn't want to take on my complicated medical history, but I am currently very lucky.
1	I've been going to my primary care doctor for years and she hasn't given me any reason to not trust her.  To the contrary, she lets me know that she is going to do what she thinks should be done, regardless if I like it or not.
-1	My doctor has never tried to push any medications on me. He is more likely to send me home and tell me to give it a few days than he is to prescribe a treatment. He's a no nonsense kind of guy.
-1	If I didn't trust them I would stay home. Ginger!
-1	Sometimes I fear that the pharmaceutical industry makes the decision what pills I get, rather than my persol doctor. I trust my doctor in terms of surgeries and maybe pain magement but outside of that, I wouldn't take any pills they recommend. 
-1	I wouldn't have complete trust in anyone over decisions regarding my health.  I think it's important to verify things and get second opinions to make sure I have as much information as possible.
-1	I trust my primary physician because he has always given me good advice and never steered me wrong 
1	I trust my doctor because he cares about what's good for me. He would not knowingly do something that would violate my trust in him.
-1	He seems capable, but not particularly out of the box or persol.  He seems a little confused and passive when I talk to him, but mostly that's because he's giving me basic info and agreeing with me.  There's also nothing particularly wrong with me, I just go for checkups, so it's not like I've really strained his abilities.
1	I just do? He gives me good vibes, he knows what he's talking about. I feel at ease and comfortable with the care that I get.
-1	I feel that most doctors are there to meet their bottom line.  They care more about the money they can make than the people that they see.  
-1	I don't trust them because they have god complex.  I don't trust them because they think better of themselves.
1	He has been my family doctor for over 15 years now, he has made me feel very at ease as a teeger and young woman and I felt like I could really trust him with all my issues. He is always very interested and patient and doesn't make it look like he has better things to move on to.
-1	I trust doctors in general because they have a deeper understanding of the things I don't know about my body.  For example, I have chronic heartburn and I trust that my doctor can share information about which treatment is best for me.
-1	I trust them because I have to and I can read and do my own research when it's necessary to question them. But they work for large companies and i'm not always convinced they have MY best interest rather than the company or even their own intentions for a specific outcome.
1	He's always taken the time to explain things about my care thoroughly to me and without complaining. He seems to genuinely care about my health.
-1	They know a lot more about the medical field than me. They wen to medical school, studied and learned more things than I know. Its usually better to trust an experts opinion on things like this. 
-1	I trust the doctors because they have been in the field and schooling for a long period of time.  I do struggle with them telling me what is convenient for them and what is best for me. 
-1	My primary care doctor usually seems rushed and annoyed. I can tell she wants to do her job but perhaps doesn't like the scheduling or the company that mages her. Overall I don't really trust her to make educated decisions for me, and had to beg for a cholesterol test. It had been six years, at least, since my prior one. 
-1	"I think he is too focused on certain health issues (my weight) and not focused enough on the things that are causing me to have poor quality of life (chronic migraine, chronic pain from arthritis) even though my poor quality of life is a major factor in why I am overweight - because I'm uble to exercise without pain, I have no energy to cook healthy food, etc. etc. But people don't like ""fat chicks"" and doctors always seem to focus on that as a #1 problem no matter what. "
-1	i trust them, the reasons why are because of there positions 
1	He works in a small town and is well-known in the community. He has a high reputation to uphold. 
-1	My primary care physician waves off my chronic health concerns and pretending my chronic stomach issues are normal or not a cause for concern even though I see them as very serious and suffer because of them.
1	She listens to me
-1	I am forced to go to a clinic by my house that rarely lets me see an actual doctor. Many times when I go for specific reasons or health issues they ignore those and don't do anything for it. I am always forced to see a nurse practitioner who always has to look up stuff in books to treat me.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she took the time to get to know me and listen to my concerns. She regularly asks questions about things we've discussed previously.
1	My GP knows more about medicine than I do and the only way diagnosis and treatment will work is if I participate and do my best as a patient.
1	I trust doctors in general because I grew up around them, and saw that almost all of them were there to help people. I don't believe any of them would suggest a treatment for any other reason than it being the best thing for the patient at that time.
-1	I don't completely trust Western medicine and only seek it out when it is absolutely necessary.  I don't always trust the doctor's information especially when they just want to prescribe a pill to mask symptoms and not really deal with the core of the problem.  I take everything my doctors say with a grain of salt.
-1	I trust my doctor because despite his hurried overall attitude he has done nothing but provide me with proper medical care and make the best choices for my health.
1	I have a very good Doctor. I have no reason not to trust him. 
-1	My doctor has always been honest with me, even if it means telling me something I don't want to hear. She gives me a variety of treatment options when they are available, and that helps build trust. 
-1	I am very new to my provider. She came highly recommended and I felt comfortable the few times I have seen her. But I have not had to use her for anything more than basic check ups.
1	My doctor always spends a good amount of time talking to me when I go for a visit and answers all my questions thoroughly.
-1	I trust my doctor because she was someone my mom trusted. My mom had her for years and later recommended her to me. She was instrumental in referring my mom to a doctor who diagnosed her as BRCA1+. So we ended up trusting her. My mom has since passed from BRCA1+-related cancer, but this doctor even called her after my mom was termil, just to say hello and see how she was doing.
-1	my doctor sees so many patients they usually diagnos you with what everyone else has. they only spend like 5 minutes with you.
-1	
-1	Doctors seem to often be in a hurry to move on to the next patient. I feel like they don't ask me enough questions. I feel like they don't take the time to fully and accurately diagnose me.
-1	Doctors these days are money motivated and are paid by the system. It's rigged to get people on prescriptions that kill you!
-1	I have been to my doctor, been waiting in the waiting room and seen him talking to a friend. When my doctor notices that he has patient's waiting he gets angry and tells them they could look for other doctors.  I also don't trust him as he does not do thorough exams.  He simply refills my prescription every year without checking anything.
1	I trust my doctor because they went to school for years to study medicine. They have a wealth of knowledge behind them I could never grasp
1	I trust my primary care physician as I have been going to him for a few years now.
-1	My primary is very knowledgeable and listens to what my concerns are, I feel very comfortable trusting him.
1	I trust my primary care doctor quite a bit.  She is upfront with me about things, and straightforward on her opinion of what I need to do. She also has been right so far about everything.
-1	I trust my physician.  They are licensed and educated
-1	I trust her because she is the one who is looking over my health. I myself have to as well, but she knows the ins and outs of hte human body and what is good and not good.
1	I trust doctors in general because of my experiences in the past. There are good and bad doctors, but I believe that overall they are trustworthy. 
1	I've had the same physician for years now. So,  he has gained my trust.
1	My doctor takes my concerns seriously. In fact, I had a problem with itching during my pregncy. The nurse line told me that it was in my head and to just deal with it. When I mentioned it to my doctor, she immediately ran tests and diagnosed me with a condition that required me to be induced right away, as it could have resulted in my baby being stillborn. The fact that she took my concerns seriously over something as small as itchy hands and feet shows she cares.
-1	I know they have the knowledge, but they also deal with so many patients on a daily basis, that I feel like they can get careless and annoyed easier because of that. I worry they don't care as much as they should.
1	She is laid back and doesn't get worked up about stuff that isn't important.  She let's me know to relax and not worry. 
-1	The last time I visited my primary care physician, I felt they were a bit distant and basically told me to put ice on a foot injury, then walked away. Was kinda weird. Seemed like they wanted to leave.
1	I trust my primary care provider because they take the time to talk things over with me. They also listen to me and any problems that I bring up. I can also rely on them to treat me and talk about treatments with me whenever I have a problem that needs to be taken care of. 
1	I have been going to my primary care doctor for many years so I have built trust in him. He encourages questions and is great at asking what I think because he says I know my body better than he ever could. His confidence in me and listening skills are what really make me trust him. 
-1	I trust my physician. He knows me well enough and has always acted in my best interest. He is always willing to listen to my concerns.
-1	i trust that he has the experience and knowledge to handle basic issues but is always in a hurry which makes me think he doesn't want me to ask too many questions
1	My doctors have always been the type of people to relay a sense of trust. Not only in their ability to explain what is happening to me, but in their demeanor.
-1	 I have wonderful doctors at always put my needs first if I have a question or problem they're happy to answer it or get me information to make a better choice 
1	It features an open communication system. He listens. I listen. Discussions are thought-provoking. He is a valuable resource to not just myself, but my family.
1	I trust my doctor because they tell me what I need to hear not what I want to hear.
-1	I think that my doctor and doctors in general face a number of pressure outside of being an advocate for best outcomes for me. Furthermore I do not trust the expertise of only one person in any situation. This means that if I feel something is serious I look for a different opinions and research the issue myself. I also feel that doctors are often unwilling to address my concerns to satisfaction due to time constraints, so this makes me feel that I ought not to trust them compeletly. 
-1	I trust them because obviously they must be doing something right to be in business
-1	I trust him because I have been with him for so long. I know he is looking for my best interest.
1	He is good and addresses any issue or concern that I have. 
1	I've never had a reason to doubt a doctor when I've seen one. Every meeting I've had with a doctor has always gone well. The doctor has always given me a sense of confidence in their decisions.
-1	My doctor just seems to be in a rush to get from one patient to the next and doesn't spend much time with any one patient.
-1	I just switched to a new PCP after a move. I have a very pleasant visit with my new doctor and I felt he was honest, listened to my concerns and friendly. 
-1	My doctor is highly trained and highly regarded in the community.  I am comfortable with him and my treatment plans and therefore trust him.  He is highly rated.
-1	"In general, I trust doctors. In the area where I live we have a good selection of doctors and health professiols to choose from so it is in their best interest to provide quality health care.  With the abundance of information available on the internet, people often use that information to get a ""second opinion"" of what doctors tell them as well."
1	My doctor seems very knowledgeable in his field. He takes time and doesn't rush. Not glued to his laptop. So far he has been right with any diagnosis.
-1	I think my doctors take the time to answer questions but also try to make sure I have the most options covered.
1	We have an understanding and friendship and know that we can trust each other.
-1	I believe that they generally have the best interest of other people in mind, and do not want people to suffer. 
-1	Well, I just met my new doctor not too long ago, and I believe he's wrong on some points, but I don't believe it's out of trying to hide things from me.  I think he just believes every last thing that he was taught, and does not alter from that reality.
-1	I mostly trust my current health care provider, a nurse practitioner. She listens and took some of my recent experiences and behavior seriously. For example, I recently took someone else's pain pills because I was in serious pain. She saw that as a need for my pain to be addressed, not me overreacting.
-1	I normally distrust them. They love to hurry my along and don't seem like they're really listening to me. They just rather get me in-and-out quick to make fast money. I always leave there disappointed in them.
-1	I trust my doctor will listen and provide adequate care. However sometimes i feel like they need pushing in the right direction or motivation to provide the care. Sometimes I think it's easier for them to avoid a situation so they don't have to deal with it.
-1	I feel like my primary care physician and most in general just want to constantly put people on medication to fix everything. I don't want to be on a bunch of medication with negative side effects and that's all they try to push in order to fix problems. The lack of options causes my distrust in my doctor.
1	My PCP has been very open and honest about changes I've needed to make in my life to get and stay healthy. I never felt as though they were doing anything to persolly convenience herself, and I've trusted the advice given to me. 
-1	I dont disturst him, but I also dont completely trust him..  Dovtors do not know you from one visit to the next.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a persol friend and he was y friend before he became my doctor. He knows me very well.
1	I trust my doctor because when I come in asking about a condition or medication, she provides comprehensive guidance about why that might not be the best for me, as well as altertives. I feel that she's not just trying to placate me to get me out of the office or quickly move to her next patient. 
1	Because I have experience the medical field and I like his approach. I've had second opinions from colleagues on his diagnosis and treatment recommendations and they usually are consistent with what my colleagues suggest. 
-1	I think that these days that doctors are trying to push more and more drugs that half the time you dont need. That is pretty scary to think about. Also treatment varies greatly from doc to doc even on simple things like a infection. So there are times i cant trust the doc 100%
-1	You choose to trust them based on if they deserve it.
-1	I have not found a regular doctor that I feel comfortable with.
-1	They have many years of training, and I do not. That's the long and short of it, really. I trust them.
-1	I trust my primary care, however sometimes I feel like she doesn't have all the information and that she's just trying her best. Sometimes I leave feeling confused. I feel like she is honest about all the different treatment options available, I just feel like she doesn't give the correct info because she doesn't know. 
1	I fully trust my PCP. He is always verbose in his explations and open to any and all questions. He has fostered a great trusting relationship.
1	I feel they know a lot more than I do and I can trust their opinions. They are not out to just make money but also to help people and part of being helpful is doing the right thing as far as diagnosis and subjestions on health.
1	I trust my PCP because he seems to care about my health.  He takes time to understand my questions and give me advise.
1	I've been seeing my primary care physician for a couple of years now. She takes the time to listen to my questions and makes sure I understand the answers. 
1	I get along very well with my doctor. I feel she genuinely cares about my well being, both physically and mentally. She is very sweet and kind.
1	My primary care physician has taken care of my family for years and is pretty trustworthy. She's also very open about how her decision process works. So I'm fairly confident in her.
1	I don't have any specific reasons, I think I am just inclined to believe what my doctor is saying is accurate. I almost never doubt my doctor, or any doctors I have seen.
-1	My PCP seems rushed when I see her. She also seems tired and overworked. She seems like she cares a little, but she explains things to me but doesn't try to be super thorough. I probably wouldn't keep seeing her if I had actual health problems.
-1	i think they only want to prescribe you medications and other things that make you feel better and come back for more
-1	"I have a new PCP so I don't totally trust her yet. She seemed to just gloss over any ""problems"" that I addressed with her during our first encounter. "
-1	"I think my doctor is very, ""typical"", in that they tell you what is on the paperwork with little regard as to your persol situation. While they are obviously competent, they are not exactly empathetic."
-1	He's always been a straight shooter. He gives me the information that I need and tells me what I need to do going forward.
-1	I'm pretty neutral on this one. I feel that most doctors DO want to help you, but they also want to drag it out as long as possible for profit reasons. The end goal is a cure/help, but it's going to be VERY expensive.
-1	i don't usually trust doctors because they just make me feel uncomfortable. sometimes i feel like they don't listen to me at all. i also oftentimes feel like i am being judged by them. 
-1	I don't always feel they are devoting enough time and attention to my problems. Initial courses of treatment don't always work, then they ask more questions. They jump to easy conclusions.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician but I on the few occasions that I go to the dr, I trust what they tell me.
-1	I think in general most Doctors, the ones I've seen have your best interest at heart, I don't always agree with everything they say, I believe most doctors are paid to prescribe medications. This makes it hard to completely trust at times.
1	He listenes and talks with you about things, always explains well.
-1	I trust her to do what is right for me but I'm not afraid to ask for a second opinion if I need to (thankfully I've never had to do that). She hasn't let me down yet so I have trust in her. 
1	I trust my doctor because they're always helpful and open with me, they take the time to answer any questions. My doctor has also returned emails and chats in my medical portal, so I have more trust in them.
1	I generally trust physicians. They have a lot of education and training by ture of the profession. Also, a doctor isn't likely to give poor care for too long, because it would likely be noticed. Doctors have a responsibility to be trustworthy, and I think that's the general cultural expectation.
-1	I do not think I do not trust my doctor, I just think she is rushed. She always has a ton of patients and book them so close together to make money that the care suffers. She rarely has time to talk about any concerns she is more in and out of the room. 
-1	In regards to doctors I feel like they can be trusted for the most part. They have a lot riding on being perfect in their profession. They can lose their jobs and whole practices if they don't perform. I think they can mainly be trusted because of this.
-1	typically it is best to trust your instincts. if the doc seems good trust him
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician due to the relationship that we have developed. Over the several years that I have visited their office I have come to know and trust the opinion of my doctor and feel that he is looking out for what is the best for me. 
-1	My doctor is a professiol and uses their best judgement in dealings with my health. They also explain things to me and answer questions I have. This is why I trust my doctor. 
-1	I believe he is looking out on my behalf.  He is very down to earth and honest.  He gives me the facts and I do my best to understand anything he tells me.  I do believe him, I do not think he tries to give me any false information.
-1	I think that it would depend on what they need in their life. That will affect what they tell me.
-1	Doctors are just like everyone else. Some you can trust, and others you cannot.
-1	I think that the doctor is good at her job, but she is young and seems a little inexperienced. I am not sure if that's a good or bad thing though, as generatiol differences can cloud judgement and can cause physicians to not keep up with the times or to not realize the correct standards of care.
1	I've been going to the same primary care physician for about 20 years. He knows my medical history and has given me sound advice during that time. It is a relationship built on trust.
1	They have not let me down. They have a lot of experience and they know what is best.
1	I trust my primary care physician because they have not given me any reason to not trust them.  I believe in the basic trust of professiols that I interact with.  If I didn't trust them I wouldn't go to them for treatment.
-1	My insurance recently changed, so I go to a local clinic and never see the same doctor more than once, so I never have a chance at building trust or a relationship with them. Usually, where I go, appointments are only a few moments, regardless of the severity of the reason you go, so I find it hard to believe they're really devoting enough time and energy to treating me in the best possible way.
1	I just started seeing a new doctor so I suppose I don't know enough to completely trust her yet, but she's already much better than my previous doctor. She's very friendly and treats me more like an equal than like a patient she has authority over. She's easy to talk to and joke around with, and seems like she wants what's best for me even if she has to go out of her way to do it.
1	I have no reason not to trust my primary physician . He has always seemed concerned and knowledgeable, always making sure my needs have been taken care of.  
-1	I feel that doctors now a days are under so much pressure to see so many patients that things are rushed and missed.  
1	I trust my primary care physician. I've known my doctor for years and haven't had a bad experience dealing with the doctor or doctor's office in general. The information I've been given thus far has been correct and helpful. Therefore, until I have a bad experience, my trust is secure.
1	I trust that my doctor gives me the best options for my care, and that he considers what I might need or already be taking before prescribing anything.  I do realize that sometimes mistakes can be made, but I feel that he will try and minimize these mistakes.
1	If I have an issue my physician doesn't perform one test and then stop, like other physicians have. She's also very friendly and makes sure I understand everything she says. 
-1	It really depends on the situation, some doctors I feel like they don't have enough time to talk about a medical condition or they seem like they're too busy to really go into any type of detail. But I do have a doctor I normally see that does take the time out to explain what he thinks the root of a problem may be.
-1	He doesn't spend much time with me and it seems like he is just trying to get me out of the door as fast as he can.
-1	Overall, I trust my doctor to give me honest answers to my questions. I can't prove they are 100% accurate, however, I have never had an issue with her diagnosis. 
-1	"I really hate how ""trust"" is even a factor. It bothers me that when I'm given information, it sounds a lot like a factual answer when in fact it is an opinion. I've met young doctors who are bright, older doctors who are dim, and vice versa, so it's difficult to gauge the competency of who I'm speaking to. And really, the only way to tell if someone is right or wrong is if I know the answer already, which I almost never do. "
-1	My primary care doctor knows both of my parents and is a very blunt person in general. I do not shirk from getting the information I want so I am not scared too ask questions.
-1	I trust my doctor because they are more knowledgeable than I am but I do not give them complete trust until I read and understand the options myself and am able to agree or disagree with them. 
1	I have a relatively good experience with the doctors I've visited. I made sure to ask close family and friends about certain doctors they visited and which ones to avoid. I was able to draw conclusions from there.
-1	I trust my physician because I believe he is very knowledgeable and he considers different possibilities- he doesn't jump to conclusions. 
-1	I trust him because he is just doing his job. He has no reason to hide treatment options unless he honestly doesn't think they are worth mentioning.
1	My physicians seems to want me to stay healthy. They give good and reasoble advice.
-1	"I distrust any doctor because I have had bad experiences with them in the past.  Ultimately I believe they are interesting in making money and nothing else.  Most of the time they seem bothered by your problems and do not listen to what I have to say.  I've been told before to take antidepressants for a pain in my stomach, which turned out to be a cyst on my ovary.  It took FIVE doctors to get a diagnosis that wasn't ""you're crazy."""
-1	I will trust my doctor because he can find the minor issue that other doctor may not be found.
-1	I feel with their busy schedules, as much as they like to dwell on a patient, unless you're going to ask lots of questions.  They will give you a primary brief overview and description of your issue and then move on to the next.  Doctors are forced to see so many patients in a day and in between squeeze a break in.  With that limitation there is only so much persol care they can have.
-1	Doctors can be wrong, I have been in scerios where I have gotten multiple diagnoses from  multiple doctors upon getting a second, and third opinion.
-1	I don't really have a primary care physician, I have been uninsured for many years. I try to put my trust in any doctor that is willing to see me on a self-pay, emergency basis. That is reality, and those are my choices in that reality.
-1	I distrust physicians because the way the medical system is set up isn't about quality of care. The way the medical system is set up is to push as many patients through as quickly as possible. Once we start incentivizing quality care; then my trust in physicians will rise.
-1	I like my doctor and he has always been conservative in his treatments.  He lets me know when something will have a side affect and also lets me know when he is doubtful that something will work but is willing to try.  I feel that he is in general very honest with me.
-1	It depends on the situation.  If the doctor is trying to push a new drug that is quite expensive then I would wonder if he is getting something out of the deal.  If I were to think that he may be wrong on a diagnosis then I would likely look for another opinion.  At the end of the day the doctor is a human and no human is perfect, so unless they give a reason to not believe them then I probably would lean towards trusting them unless I felt they were wrong in some way.  
-1	I trust most doctors in general. I feel they provide adequate enough healthcare services. I don't really have a reason to not trust them because I feel like they know enough about whatever health-related things to made accurate assessments of my health. 
1	I have been going to my primary physician for almost 4 years now and never once have I felt that I was not important to her. She has been supportive and attentive always.
1	I trust my doctor because i've built a relationship with them over a number of years. We have open communication regarding any health issues i may have. We talk about those issues openly and at length. I never feel like i'm being rushed out the door. I never wait for a long period of time in the waiting room. I'm given ample resources in order to understand and educate myself. 
-1	He's been honest but one doctor is not an end-all game when it comes to my health, I should consult multiple doctors if a problem arises. Therefore, I don't have full unwavering trust in one doctor.
1	He's always been there for us and has had good results in treatment. He hears me and has addressed my needs. So far he has been good at curing us.
-1	I feel as if there is too much for a physician to gain by their own self interests, they have medications that they feel are important to push on people with the side effects and all that considered they often over look the most simplistic things like change of nutrition, or even considering the factors of the patients life.
1	She is always patient with me and takes as long as I need.  She never seems bothered when I ask her questions, and if I call with a problem, she usually can see me that day. 
-1	i really have no choice but to put my trust into my doctor sometimes, because health is theyre field. 
1	I trust my doctor because I think he has my best interest at stake. He takes time to listen to my concerns and actually tries to help me. 
-1	I have great trust in my current position because I have seen my physician long enough that I trust what she will say and I trust that she understands what treatment is necessary. At this point I have established A rapport to give her complete trust. 
1	I always make sure to choose a physician I am comfortable with. This means that I feel they have my best interest in mind and are not just out to milk my insurance or have little interest in their patients.
1	He seems to have a good understanding of what goes on. He lets me know whatis likely and will order a test if I'm worried even if it's unlikely. Seems nice and caring
1	I trust him because he's never given me a reason not to. Every time I've gone to him he gives me the correct medication or suggestions to alleviate what's going on and they've worked every time
-1	I do not really like my doctor but it is hard to change to a new one. I live in a small town. I trust many doctors though because they have a lot to lose so they tend to try very hard to do their best.
1	I trust my doctor because she has been my doctor for 24 years.
-1	my appendix had burst and my dr couldnt diagnose it
1	I trust my doctor because she is always honest with me and I have never had a reason to not trust her. She is good at her job and a very nice person, so it is easy to trust her and her opinion
-1	I do trust our physician, but feel that we are often hurried in and out of his office. It would be nice if they got to know us a little more and asked more questions. 
-1	Most doctors choose to do what's right because if they get caught doing otherwise, they could lose their license. That is why I trust them in general.
-1	I haven't had a major sickness that would require me to seek out a new PCP so I've stayed with the one I've had since I was a teeger.  
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he has been seeing people in my family for over 40 years. Most of my immediate family go to the same doctor and he is very persoble and a straight shooter. He does not beat around the bush when he needs to tell you something.
-1	I feel they have a lot of knowledge and this is their expertise.  I also feel like my doctor tries to get to know me. 
1	My physician is highly regarded and always takes the appropriate amount of time to see me. He doesn't rush me out of his office for other patients, and I feel that he gives me his full attention.
1	For the most part I trust my doctor (who is actually a PA).  I can see in his eyes and actions that he really is reading my material and really does want to help.  It is my responsibility to make sure anything he says applies to me but for the most part I go along with what he says because of the time and care he puts into his words.
1	I have a very nice woman as my primary doctor. I can trust anything she tells me to do or take.
-1	I've been seeing my PCP mostly for anxiety issues and so because we've talked about the reasons why the anxiety might be happening, she was very understanding and informative.
-1	I trust her for the most part except when I had my first kid she didn't figure out ahead of time that my baby was breech so I ended up having an unexpected C-section. 
-1	She is there for me when I need her. She does not rush through appointments with me. She explains everything and makes sure that I understand. She is knowledgeable about current trends in health care.
-1	In my experience they just want you in and out so they can make their quick money. I had gall bladder pains for a year, and they kept telling me I was just constipated. I filly got someone that did an ultrasound and I had to have immediate surgery, and I was jaundiced. A YEAR of incompetence! 
1	I chose my doctor out of a few that I've visited over the years. She's always eager to answer questions and is professiol, all the while still having a kind demeanor.
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for many years, and the care I get from her is always excellent. I am able to ask questions and get answers when I need to and she is never rushed or indifferent to my needs.
1	I've had my PCP for a while and he is probably the most down to earth doctor that I've come across. Always explains things throughly, always gives options.
-1	My doctor just seems so busy. It's hard to tell if he really pays attention to me and my health because I am only seen for a few minutes. 
1	I trust my doctor because she's willing to answer questions. I don't ever feel she's rushing me or dismissing my concerns. If I ask about altertives she gives a lot of facts - I like to hear it all and not generalized statements meant to pacify.
1	Very caring doctor. She is non-judgemental.
1	I believe he is smart and thorough. I don't usually need him for many things but he has always had good advice when I do have a problem.
-1	For the most part, I trust my doctor.  But I know that we are all human and humans make mistakes.
1	I have known my PCP since I was 13 and friends with his daughter. I am usually very healthy and don't go to the doctor very often, but I do trust him as my doctor. 
1	FIRST, HE IS WELL EDUCATED AND HAS TAKEN AN OATH.   SECOND, I DID RESEARCH ABOUT HIM AND HIS BACKGROUND.  ALSO, I CAN TELL BY HIS PERSOLITY AND TALKING WITH JIM.
1	Well I think you have to trust that your doctor knows more than you do and is trying to do what is best for you. My doctor always explains all of my options and makes recommendations but still asks for my input as well. I trust he wants to do what is best for me.
-1	As of late, my doctor has been pretty dismissive of my health concerns. He is very busy and spends almost no time evaluating me. Because of this, I am currently searching for a new doctor. I feel that he does not take what I have to say seriously. 
1	I have been with my primary physician for years and we have built up a rapport. He has never given me a diagnosis that I felt was wrong to real degree. Even if I did not have my own trusted doctor, I believe that it is in a doctor's best interest to provide the best care possible, so it is easy for me to trust a doctor.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been doing this a long time. Also, he went to medical school, not me!
1	I have done a lot of research and tried several different doctors in the the surrounding cities until I landed with one who I trust greatly. 
-1	I often feel as if they are already thinking of the next patient. It is usually a hurried experience.
-1	I usually trust doctors. I think it's pretty risky for them to be deceitful. In my experience, doctors are honest and kind and smart.
1	He's the expert. I don't know much about medicine, so I don't have much choice. Additiolly, he's always been open and honest with me about my treatment options, side effects, etc.
1	I feel based on the information in front of them they make the best decision possible.  I think if they do not know they are at least diligent about sending you onto a specialist, or double checking things like lab work, etc. to rule things out and make sure nothing serious is going on.
1	My doctor has been my doctor for over ten years. He is never rushed and always takes time to answer my questions and concerns.  I like that he values my input and will look up things that I tell him about.  He seems genuinely concerned about my care.  He is easy to talk to.
-1	Doctors are influenced by the number they can put on your bill.  If it costs more they'll recommend it.  Also pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to push their drugs over something that may be more appropriate for my condition.
-1	they have a duty to do their job at least competently, but i don't know my PCP very well so I can't really make a persol judgment, my doctor seems pretty busy and rushes me a lot
1	I know my primary care physician outside of the office, and I know what kind of person he is. I trust his judgments for my medical care because I know he is a good person who truly cares about other people and wants what is best for them. I know his family, and how he treats and cares for them. It puts me at ease when I am dealing with him in a professiol capacity.
1	I have a long-standing patient/doctor relationship with my doctor. She is trustworthy and thorough, and always takes time to ask me in-depth questions and relate to me on a human level.
1	i trust my primary care doctor because that's the doctor i've had since i was born. She has all of my medical records. So, its just easier to stay with her and trust her knowledge of me.
1	I trust the doctor and I rely on their education and experience.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a family friend and has been looking after us for most of my life.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has proven trustworthy.  He listens to what I have to say and develops treatment plans based on what he believes the issue is.  He treats the problem and not the symptoms.
-1	I have switched doctors until I have found one I trust.  Prior to that I truly felt as though the Drs wanted to make money on procedures and medications.  I felt as though they pushed the same things and it was for a monetary reason.  Currently my Drs really listen and I am involved with my health care choices.
-1	I trust them somewhat. They do want the best for their patients. They are also in the pockets of medical industry. They at there to make money too. They may not have the best information and think they are experts because of their education. 
-1	I trust my doctor. However, I recognize that she is very busy, probably over-worked, and cannot take the time she, herself, would like to devote to her patients. It is not her fault how quickly she has to work and I know that she does the best job she can do given the situation. 
-1	I have gotten a new primary care physician in the past year and she has been more thorough and careful than any doctor I've had previously.  My past PCP rushed through appointments and gave me prescriptions without much concern.  My new PCP is careful to suggest medications and tries to find if altertive therapies may work better and to ensure that I am really getting something I need.  
-1	She seems like a good doctor. I don't have any complaints. If she thought something was wrong I'm sure she'd tell me.
-1	I trust that they will tell me what they think. However, I'm not always convinced that they're up to date on the very latest options. I also think they sometimes omit borderline information (i.e., risks or treatments that are on the extreme ends of the normal bell curve) just out of the sake of time. I generally trust them, as far as it goes, though.
-1	My primary care physician keeps leaving and I haven't met the new one, but I think they are fine. I worry that I don't know what a patient is supposed to do.
1	My doctor makes sure to spend an adequate amount of time with me to ensure i can have all the questions i have answered. They don't rush me and even if they feel a test doesn't need to be done, they will do it anyways just to make sure.
-1	My primary care doctor never ask me what I want or how I feel about a treatment, she just tells me what to do. She wanted me to remove my gallbladder but never asked me if I was ok with it or if there were altertives. I cured myself with limonene. I feel i no longer need her help most of the time.
-1	I do not think that he like women or respects them as much as men. I feel like he talks to my husband with respect and caring but dismisses me when I try to tell him my mental health issues.
-1	I do trust that doctors are not in it to just make the money, but to provide good health care. They will be honest it what they think is the best treatment for you. However, I know doctor's cannot go into detail about the possible long term effects of a treatment so I always like to do my own research. Particularly reading forums and such.
1	The Physician's Assistant that I see (I normally do not see the actual doctor) is very pleasant and seems caring. She does not seem rushed or like she is trying to hurry through the appointment. She also gives me the opportunity to ask questions about any diagnosis or treatment.
-1	I think that their reputation are on the line so they are generally honest.  There are people who expect miracles from doctors so sometimes the doctor has to answer the best he can but needs to move on to the next patient so he may be a bit short with answers. 
1	I trust my doctor because I have never been led astray. I have never had a negative experience with my doctor. I have no reason to doubt my doctor's competence or motives and have had good outcomes.
-1	He is usually in a hurry when I go to see him. I imagine that is because he sees so many patients. Since I see him rarely, I imagine there isn't enough of a connection for him to really care outside a professiol capacity.
-1	There have been times where my doctor has been wrong. But I do have two specialists that often go the extra mile for me and I feel I can trust. 
-1	I generally trust my doctor. He always goes above and beyond to make sure my needs are met and keeps me up to date regarding my health.
1	I have never had a medical issue where I didn't know what was wrong before going in to see him. I usually show up for an appt and explain what's going on and know exactly how he's going to treat me.
1	Always takes the time to explain things in detail and answer questions, never rushes me and believes in finding the cause and not just treating the symptom
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been able to help me. I have been going to the same doctor since I was a teeger.
1	My doctor explains most things clearly to me. He genuinely shows he cares and checks up on me outside of the office. Quick to answer my concerns as well.
-1	I trust the GYN I have, she takes her time and sits to answer my questions and chat. I never feel rushed or neglected by her. I have been to doctors in the past though that spend minimal time with you and it doesn't feel like they actually care about you.
1	My doctor tells me all of the options I have, even if they don't benefit him.
-1	Sometimes my doctors can be in such a rush I simply get a nod and they would try and attend me as quick as possible to get even more patients in. Half the time I end up having to go back because he didn't feel like listening to my problem so it wasn't tended to and I end up getting worse.
-1	I trust my primary care physician for the most part, I have only meet her once. I am still working on putting my complete trust in her. I completely trusted my previous doctor since I had been with her for many years. Switching made me uneasy. But I trust in her and her education. 
-1	I usually trust my primary care physician because I know he cares about my health. He usually takes the time to explain things thoroughly if he feels like I don't understand them.
1	I've been seeing the same doctor for a long time. He knows by medical history very well. He's a very friendly man who doesn't rush through appointments, and really does listen to my concerns. I've grown to trust him very much and feel he makes good decisions for my health.
-1	Honestly, I trust doctors to a certain extent as far as diagnosing a problem, but I think their treatment options are generally given according to what makes them the most money. 
-1	My doctor seems to care about me when I visit. She does not contact me often, but when I need help she is helpful.
-1	I trust doctors to be careful and thorough, but a good bit of skepticism is healthy, and getting a second opinion is wise. It is difficult to put complete trust in someone I don't really know.
-1	Because I know him very well. And he is a very knowledgeable person also.
1	My physician is always honest without being judgmental.  She tells me steps I can take, but understands when these steps are difficult to fit into my life.  She also is happy if changes are made as small steps or trying to complete one healthy change at a time, rather than expect me to completely alter my lifestyle.
-1	No one should completely trust a doctor. He has an invested reason to tell you all these things that you can do without. His pockets get bigger when he gets you to do more things that are not needed. 
1	I feel that my doctor does all that they can to provide me the best healthcare. I have never felt that they were being dishonest with me. They alwayws are open to my questions and doubts.
-1	I trust my doctor because she has shown me, over the years, that she has my best interest at heart. She listens to me and my concerns and together we come up with a plan to take care of whatever problem I am experiencing at that time.
-1	I don't currently have a primary care physician. My last one, who I'd see once a year for a basic check-in and a prescription refill for my anti-anxiety med, told me last year not to come back anymore because I'm uninsured (stuck in a state-caused ACA loophole) and can't afford more in-depth exams. Being told something like that kind of dented my trust in medical professiols in general.
1	I've been going to him for quite some time now. We've developed a good relationship. He's frank and honest and that's exactly what I expect.
1	I trust my doctors because I feel their goal is to keep me as healthy as possible. Their advice that they give me is the best that is for me in that particular situation, not the best for them.
-1	
1	I trust my doctor because she knows that sometimes treatment options work differently for different people and she lets me know that I might not get the results I want but she has always been willing to work with me when I need to change a treatment option without hesitation. 
-1	My doctor seems genuine and intelligent. She generally provides me with a range of options before prescribing a particular one. She seems heartfelt and concerned, and takes time to talk with me.
1	He lets me be a part of the plan of treatment and always asks what I think aand if I agree or disagree. He always takes the time to listen and is very willing to see me whenever i need him too. He explains everything to me in a way that I understand and is very patient, kind and gentle. is office always calls to see how I am doing.
-1	She takes the time to explain things and answer any questions I might have.
-1	I trust him because he has been right on his diagnosis so far.
1	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him. He is looking out for my best interests. He takes his time to listen to me. He is never rushed - or at least doesn't show it. He is friendly and helpful and I trust him.
-1	I feel she is very thorough.  She has done more tests on me then previous doctors, and usually has answers for me on any questions I have.
-1	I am not completely happy with my current physician. He tends to rush patients in and out of the office, spending very little time. I always feel rushed and try to obtain the most important information first. I feel like my physician always looks for the quick and easy answer instead of spending time looking into something more seriously.
-1	Dr's goto medical school so they know their health. Sometimes people dont want to hear that they are sick so they might want to disagree with the Dr. to feel better in a sense of denial. I think medical school vs. no school its better to trust the dr.
1	I trust my doctor since i feel like they are just looking for what is best for me
-1	I trust my doctor because I trust the profession. I appreciate that he explains things alytically, which is consistent with the way I process information.
1	My doctor has been working in the field for a long time, so I trust her. I can also tell from her tone of voice that she really cares about the welfare of her patients, so I can trust her 100%. 
-1	Is open to talking with me, never makes me feel rushed.  Listens to my concerns about potential treatments.  Keeps a level head, and is persoble...not a robot.
-1	I have just started with her, but she seems to be communicative, alytical, takes time to explain, moderately to highly intelligent, sympathetic, and experienced.
1	They have always been helpful and informative. I've never had a problem  talking with them. They are respectful and I feel I can talk honestly to them.
-1	Doctors in general seem to be more jaded with their profession. They seem more concerned with simply medicating and moving patients along rather than spending time to determine what the best course of action is. I have seen it with a lot of doctors as well as vets for animals. It could be because there is an increased number of cases that they process, I'm not sure. But it's alarming.
1	"My doctor always suggests tural remedies first if the condition is not serious. She is not a ""pill pusher"" like most. My mother used to work with her also. She is also my mother's doctor now that she no longer works with her."
1	My PCP doctor has been treating me for more than 20 years now.  He also is part of a very small practice that is in the country side.  Even though I live farther away from his practice now, I still commute to see him because I trust him based on our long history and the experiences I have had with him in the past.  He tends to be very honest with me with regards to everything that we talk about. 
1	love my doctor. Explains everything really well and understands me. 
1	My doctor has never given me reason for distrust. He is always knowledgeable, friendly and professiol.
1	I have generally had positive experiences and never had a bad experience with a doctor. I have always received proper care.
1	My physician seems like they are well educated and seem to communicate well with other people. Their ability to portray information to me is critical in deserving my trust, and I have had no problems at all regarding this. I feel that most doctors are so well educated that they have a good idea what is going on and how to treat it, and they can get more information readily if necessary, so overall I trust them due to their education and ability to communicate.
1	He always seems to care about my health. He takes time to explain and talk to me. 
-1	i feel that i just depends on how you feel in the moment with the doctor. 
-1	It's always wise to get a second opinion or look for more information. Doctors are not perfect and cannot know every single bit of medical information in the world. There may be newer treatments or updated diagnoses. Also, some doctors are kind of in bed with the pharmaceutical industry and might recommend a drug just to increase sales. This is not necessarily common, but not unheard of either.
-1	I trust they'll do just enough to keep me alive long enough to bleed my pockets
-1	I mostly trust my doctor, except when he seems to have more patients on his plate than what he can handle with the utmost care at the moment. Sometimes my appointments feel rather rushed and I know he has not had adequate time to alyze every possible solution to whatever problem I may be dealing with, and that he is simply giving the fastest and easiest solution rather than the best one. I know that he is competent and knowledgeable and has always taken care of me, but I wonder sometimes if better care and more close attention is available elsewhere. 
-1	I have great trust in doctors because it takes a lot to become one. Lots of school lots of practice and lots of experience make for great helpers.
-1	because my doctor has been inconsistent in his actions and negligent in his recommendations 
-1	usually he gives me good advice.But sometimes they put you on meds with to many's side effects.
-1	I feel as if my concerns are not addressed by my doctor.  I feel he is too busy with too many patients and will tell me one thing in one phone call and a week later will forget his direction to me or forget what we discussed or what my initial concern was about in the first place.  He isn't a problem solver for me but rather he dismisses my concerns and makes me feel unimportant.
1	I trust my doctor because he has never  done anything that has made me question his ability of motives. Everything that is done or tested for me has a specific reason that he explains to me. 
-1	I like my doctor.  She took me on as a patient even though she was not accepting new patients.  She helped me through a very difficult time.  She listens to what I have to say and especially how I feel.
-1	I completely trust this doctor because two years ago I had a knot in my neck, and right away I went to see my Primary Care Doctor. After examining the knot, and telling him my other symptoms, he did not beat around the bush, he sent me directly to a specialist who then biopsied the knot, and it turned out to be cancer. This doctor does not waste my time or his, and cares deeply about his patients.
-1	My doctor is really smart and does care, so I trust that they're not going to offer me something I don't need. At the same time, they're pretty dismissive and patronizing, so that's a little discouraging.
1	He has saved my life on one occasion and my daughter's life in another. He is very thorough and helpful. I have been seeing him for over 25 years. He knows me. 
-1	I trust my doctor. He's been thorough in diagnosing issues. He's open communication and will try different things in order to assist me
-1	I am not smart enough to not trust my doctor completely. I don't go to the doctor that often, but when I do I take them at face value. They have never steered me wrong when I have needed them in the past.
1	I trust my doctor because whenever I have questions that need to be answered he is always willing to answer them honestly and right away and he always gives me all the info I need when I go to him.
1	I trust my physician because I have been working with him for a long time now. I almost see him as a friend. I can get persol with him and not have to worry because I trust him. In addition, he is very soft spoken and experienced. Overall, I would rate my doctor a 4/5.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he listens to what I have to say and thoroughly explains whatever I do not understand. I trust his opinion and I feel like he cares about me as a patient.
-1	I have had experiences with Workers Comps doctors who only care about workers comp and not my well being.
-1	i am aware of how they push medications that are provided them by certain pharmeceutical companies.  i also have witnessed first hand a doctor going to his office after assessing patient, and consulting with an encyclopedia to see what the patient has.  I think doctors are smart, but sometimes I think we give them too much credit.  They have to remember a ton of shit.
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because they take the take and answer all my questions. They let me know what I'm doing wrong about anything and lead me in the right path about my health. 
-1	My doctor seems always pressed for time everytime I go there. He rushes me in/out without really talking in depth. But he seems to know what he's doing, so I sort of trust him. I will speak up next time it bothers me.
-1	In general, I trust doctors as they have a tremendous amount of experience, but they are also sometimes rrow in their views of what types of remedies work. So, I trust but reserve my right to question things.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for several years, and he has always provided me with great care, and I have never had an issues with any of his decisions/ diagnoses. He has a good record of quality and care.
-1	It's not that I think he's intentiolly deceiving me for some insidious purpose. I'm just read and heard about doctors getting bonuses for the amount of patients they can get on certain drugs (they get kick backs) weather this is true or not, we shouldn't ever just blindly follow someone because they went to school for awhile. Would if the school was corrupt? Would if Big Pharma changes the medical doc-turn so that the doctors believe its right, but it's actually wrong. 
-1	My doctor is very knowledgeable but he sees many patients each day. I feel that he can make mistakes from time to time.
-1	I trust him because he is persoble and lets me tell him what I am comfortable with and not. He isn't pushy, but will always do what is best for his patients.
-1	I trust them for the most part. I haven't had any issues where they were wrong. Most of my experiences with doctors have resulted in proper solutions for why I was there.
-1	I do believe my doctor is honest, thorough, and careful for the most part. I think sometimes time constrictions can force her to be a little less thorough, especially when it comes to explaining why she is choosing a certain treatment. At times, I have trouble trusting doctors because I don't understand how they know the treatment they have chosen will work.
-1	I don't go to the doctor often, but they are more knowledgeable than me so I believe them
-1	Dr's work and are obligated to the pharma business. That is their main goal, patients are secondary.
-1	I've had a few doctors and most i feel cared about me, but sometimes i did feel like they weren't putting their full thoughts into correct treatments.  Sometimes they'll let a problem sit and see if it fixes itself, or sometimes they'll try to do whatever would be easier for them if it does require prescribing something.
-1	He seems to know what he is talking about most of the time, but he doesn't explain things in detail that I can understand. I have trouble keeping up at times so sometimes I don't think he wants to see me anymore. I trust that he knows what he is talking about, but it all just flies over my head. 
1	I've been seeing them for most of my life since I was a young child.  I believe they've always treated me with their best interest and care.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because so far he hasn't done anything to erode my trust for him. I am wary of my physician when he tells me treatment methods. This is more so because I am a cautious person.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she as highly rated in my state, she has cared for 5 other of my family members, knows my entire medical family history better than I do, and she is very comforting and kind. She always explains everything I need to know, is very thorough and makes me feel comfortable with asking any questions.
-1	She is competent and very thorough, but I feel she relies on prescription drugs too heavily as a course of treatment. I would like to know about altertive treatments and therapies.
1	My doctors have saved my life, and I believe that they do an outstanding job.
-1	I trust my Doctor because i feel that he geunuinely cares about serving me properly, and has my best interests in mind. He has told me that he wanted to be a psychologist after he finished his Medical Degree, but it is too late now.
1	I tend to trust my Dr and their opinions because I have disclosed all the symptoms that I have been experiencing therefor I believe they can accurately provide me with a diagnosis.  I also believe that my Dr is also looking out for my best interest.
1	 I trust my doctor as he has never steered me wrong.  I have no reason to believe that he would or that he would be not being honest with me.
-1	My dr. explains my options and asks me which I want to do. She will offer her opinion on what she thinks is the best option for me but ultimately it is my decision. However, she and I disagree on the usefulness of supplements. I think it's helpful to take the ones that I do and she disagrees. I don't completely trust her because of this.
-1	my dr is easy going but very honest. he tell you what you need to do to get better . he doesn't seem snobby like some drs.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been honest with me and has always given me clear direction. He has never pushed any drugs or treatments on me that would be unnecessary. He is very thorough and complete when I go in to visit. He makes me feel very comfortable when I am with him, and I never leave his office feeling confused. 
1	Most of the time I feel like I can trust my doctor. He obviously knows more about health than I do. I don't think he would steer my care in the wrong direction, and it never seems like he is trying to push some unneeded treatment on me for something silly (i.e. restless leg syndrome or something like that) that would make me think he is being paid a commission by pharmaceuticals.
-1	I can't put all of my trust in what a doctor says until I meet them.  If they take their time treating me and looking for a solution then I can trust in what they are saying.  If they are late and then come in the room, in a rush, then I have difficulty trusting them.  They typically tend to rush through looking over me and seeking a solution to what is wrong.
1	They have gone above and beyond to check in with me after appointments and procedures. They seem genuinely concerned about any issues I am having. I feel like the believe me when I have pain and are not dismissive of any condition. 
-1	I have been seeing my Pcp my entire life. He has always been honest and helpful. I have gained a lot of trust over the years
-1	I have always had good experiences with doctors so there is no reason for me not to trust them.  I also believe that doctors are trained well and that they know what is best for me 
1	My primary care physician is very nice woman. She knows a lot, always friendly, and ready to give me any explation I need.
-1	I have a new primary care doctor, but she is kind and well-respected. I trust her based on others' experiences and honest reviews, in addition to persol experience. 
1	I do trust my primary care physician because they are a person who I've been seeing for several years now, and whenever any health problems arise, the solutions provided by said physician are very effective in solving these problems.
-1	my old doctor was wonderful he explained everything in a way someone could understand and he was nice and cared.  He got a new job with the government and now I go to his partner he had at the practice.  The new doctor (old doctors partner) doesn't care...he just wants to get you in and out of there fast.
1	I do not go to the doctor often, and when I do, it's usually a different doctor, so I don't really build trust. That being said, I've had largely very positive experiences with my doctors-- especially psychiatrists. They seem to have my best interests at heart.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for years.  If it were a new doctor I might be a little more hesitant in my trust of them especially if I may not agree with their thoughts or approach.
-1	I generally think they are looking out for me and have my best interests at heart. 
1	She has been my doctor for the last 11 years, and as soon as I met her I trusted her.  She was warm and caring and took time to listen to me.  She is extremely thorough and such a great doctor. 
-1	My doctor seems in a hurry. I think my doctor does not care for me because I refuse treatments for things like the Flu shot. He seems in a rush to get to the next patient. He says things that are contradictory and confusing to me without leaving time for me to follow up on what he said.
-1	I trust doctors because I think they genuinely care about treating their patients. They have high reputations and they don't want to risk diagnosing something wrong. 
-1	You can't always believe everything the doctor says in terms of options sometimes they are just looking for the money
1	I have had the same doctor that my dad has been using.  She has been our family doctor for 20 years, and really helped a lot in some trying times.  She is simply the best.
-1	I don't think I receive adequate care, attention, or consideration.  I often feel hurried along and my doctor doesn't explain things in much detail, so I'm really under the impression that my doctor just sees each patient as something to cross off a to-do list.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for a couple of years and she is thorough and trusting.  She is always ready to listen to my concerns.  She addresses preventative medicine with a passion.
1	I mostly trust my doctor, however, I will never 100% rely on their word or advice without looking into myself or seeking other opinions.
1	My doctor is awesome. He's smart and funny but he is also serious when he needs to be. He has always been honest with me and given me many options on what to do next and how to proceed. In almost every single case of him suggesting something, that has been the right suggestion, whether I took his advice or didn't. 
1	I have had the same doctor for a long time and we have come to know each other. I feel she has an exceptiol persolity as well as the skills and knowledge to care for my body.
-1	I trust my doctor because he does not judge me when I bring health issues to him. He is always very thorough in suggesting treatments. He does a good job explaining WHY I am having the symptoms  I am. 
-1	I have a good doctor, it's his sense of humor. He is like a comedy central roast comedian, it fun but it make think more about my health 
1	I trust my doctor because he has shown me that he can be trusted. I have been going to him for many years now and he has helped me a lot over that time.
1	My doctor is new to the family due to the fact the old doctor had to retire. So far from meeting him, he's great. He seems to really want to help and make sure you are taken care of.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my doctor for a long time now. I've experienced good results and up till now I only have positive reviews. 
-1	I would hope they was tell me the truth about everything 
-1	I trust doctors because I know that they care for me. I know that they only want the best for me.
1	I am able to easily talk to my doctor about issues I may have. She is very thorough and takes the time to answers my questions in a way I understand. I appreciate this.
-1	I think sometimes they care more about money than actually helping people.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor. I have had good experiences with her so far. On the other hand I have only seen her a couple of times.
-1	I think in many occassions this is a result of a bad system. I have yet to see a real benefit for a physician to make me healthy. In most cases the physician is looking to see me, diagnose me, treat me, and get me out the door in a short window. With this model there is very little time to have a real conversation about me and my overall health.  
-1	The doctor that I have seen does not have a lot of time to see me and does not (because she cannot) remember information about me. She relies on her notes, which I don't find accurate to the information I give her, even when I have corrected her. For example, she had written down that I started birth control a month later than I had. She also changes her mind about my treatment very often and doesn't seem sure about what's necessary or helpful to me.
1	I like my doctor. He is very intelligent and I have been going to him for years. 
-1	I trust that the Dr believes he is being thorough. The PCP gives basic care and refers you to specialists who I believe try to help.  I don't trust any Dr.  I have been to so many for a chronic condition that I don't have total faith in any of them.
1	He listens very well and addresses all my concerns. He knows me and what I'm like, so he can tell when something is wrong. He really cares about his patients and takes the time to listen.
-1	I am pretty neutral with doctors - it is their job to tell me what is wrong, but most of the time, I already know what is wrong with myself. Ideally, I'd like to just get a solution to the problem from what I tell the doctors, instead of having to go through the process of them telling me what I already know. 
-1	He tries to help me. He also gets met the only prescription that I need full time. He is pretty helpful.
-1	Sometimes I think they may do what makes them the most money. They may not send you to a Specialist because it takes money away from them. They may also not listen to your idea because they feel they are always right.
1	i feel my doctor always has my best instrest in mind because he always fixes my problems. i trust him 100%.
1	I've known my primary care doctor for a long time already. He is a family friend, the husband of my mother's coworker. As a result, my trust in him is very high. 
-1	I think that the medical profession has a rrow view of the patient and does not look long term.  It is ultimately up to me to decide on the course of action in my healthcare, after taking the advice of the doctor with a grain of salt.  I do not wholly believe that the doctor knows what is best for me after a brief office visit, only I can know and make this decision.
-1	The physician I see has years of experience along with a degree in subjects I have never even thought about taking. They are more knowledgable in what they are doing then i would never be, in return i would believe what they say. 
-1	I feel like there have been other treatment options that my doctor didn't tell me about because they got extra money for getting me on something they were in business with.
1	I trust my doctor. She is very thorough and follows up on any concerns I may have. If she is not familiar with something, she researches it so that she can better help me.
-1	I have been to many primary care doctors in the past. Because of this, I have gotten to know who is a good doctor and who is not. My current primary care physician is very helpful and caring. She never rushes me and spends as much time as I need answering my questions. She is also familiar with my condition, so I trust her in giving me the correct dosing for my medication. She is also empathic and can explain things in a way that makes sense. 
-1	I find my doctor to be very trustworthy. He is open and honest with me and make things easy to understand.
-1	He did not provided all the answers I needed. It took him less than 5 minutes to see me and guess what's wrong with me. I felt like I visited a quack. I spent 100 dollars in which I can diagnose myself online for free.
-1	"I never get the sense that my doctor really cares about me. I feel like she is just ""punching the clock"" and not engaged in my healthcare."
-1	My doctor is very well intentioned, but he will opt for conventiol medicine without turning to lifestyle choices first. For example, he would immediately prescribe a statin rather than addressing food choices first. He would prescribe a thyroid drug without first asking if one is eating a lot of sea vegetables or other high-iodine foods. He recommends mammograms despite the evidence that they really don't save lives (in the aggregate), they simply make more people patients.
-1	I trust my doctor because she hasn't ever given me a reason not to trust her.
1	i trust him because when i have been to the doctor he has diagnosed my condition and treated it effectively with a few exceptions.  I don't like to go to the doctor though and if i can still function with my illness i will try to ignore it until it goes away.
-1	I had a doctor I could trust but when we moved to a new state several years ago, I haven't found one I could trust here. I've found larger medical practices where the doctors are in a hurry and you usually end up seeing someone different every time you go.
1	I've been seeing my doctor for a number of years and she has never been anything but honest with me. If she doesn't know the answer to one of my questions, she will admit that and then help me find the answer. She always takes her time and goes over everything with me thoroughly, and I never feel rushed when I am in her office. She knows quite a bit about my persol life and always asks me about my family when I come in. I feel like we are friends.
1	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. I have always had a good experience with them. They are thoughtful and clear and always make sure I have my questions answered.
-1	I just feel like he doesn't listen to my concerns sometimes. He also seems distracted a lot. And he doesn't spend very much time with me, either. 
1	I trust my doctor. He really seems to care and treats me like family.
-1	I have went thru a few primary care physicians in the last 2  years. I've had trouble finding one that wants to listen and help me with my problems. They always seems like they are rude, in a hurry or just push me off on to a specialist. Thats not what I want. 
-1	My doctor is very concerned about my questions and always listens to me so that help me develop trust.
1	my doctor has really been great for me in the past. Him and his office have treated me spectacularly through a number of different situations that have arose. I haven't ever felt rushed or uncared for after seeing him.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She is thorough and always asks me the right questions. She takes the time with me that expect and answers all my questions and handles all of my concerns. She has a great reputation.
1	Perhaps it's because I haven't had a severe condition that has caused me to question my doctor's judgment, but I have had only positive interactions with my PCP and have received appropriate treatments. I am always given the chance to talk about my problems and able to ask questions. I never feel as though I'm being rushed out the door on an assembly line to make room for another patient, but that I am being treated by someone who is interested in getting to the root of my health problem.
1	I've known this doctor for a long time. He's very trustworthy and kind. I believe in him.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for a while.  She is very thorough.  If there is a question about treatment or diagnosis, she will refer you elsewhere.
-1	I trust doctors because they have a lot of medical knowledge. Their assessments and recommendations usually work for me. I've never had a serious problem with a doctor that would make me lose faith in them.
-1	sometimes i feel like i am told i need things i don't really need to milk money out of me. i do not think they would harm me but just trivial things that aren't needed are made to sound like bigger deals then they actually are.
-1	i dont have other choice, im not a doctor
1	I have had the same doctor for over ten years and she has always gotten the diagnosis right the first time. I have complete trust in her and we can talk about anything. She always spends time with me and answers my questions.
-1	I do trust the doctors I see for the most part. In a few cases it seems that they are not engaging with me emotiolly. If I feel emotiol connected to a doctor I am more likely to trust them
-1	He is honest and caring.  However, he is not entirely well versed in health issues outside his specialty.  He has made mistakes before and shown that he does not  know how to do certain procedures.  He is good at interl medicine but not at neurology .
-1	I don't trust my doctor, or any doctor wholly because I do feel as though they are all about the money in most cases. 
-1	sometimes I think my doctor tries to make money off of the medicine he prescribes for me. I've been recommended some medication that could help but wasn't quite necessary. Persol fincial gain is a problem I find with some doctors.
1	I trust my primary care doctor.  I have a very open relationship with him.  He will tell me the good things as well as the bad things.  I think that he is focused on recommending the best things for me as a patient.  I believe that his recommendations change based on the patients that he is dealing with.
-1	We all are human with all possible mistakes. I like to have second or even third opinion almost always.
-1	I've had many bad persol experiences with physicians in the past. Several have initially denied treatment because they didn't think their patient (my wife) was acting in enough pain for her condition that they eventually correctly diagnosed and medicated. Many have been uble to diagnose fairly common conditions. One LITERALLY told me the video game Street Fighter caused demons to come out of my TV and give me a skin rash that was later properly diagnosed as scabies. That is not a joke, or me having a go at the survey. That actually happened. Many doctors only seem to care about money, many don't care about their patients. I have had a few positive experiences as well, but as I lack a permanent primary care physician I've not had many positive experiences.
-1	My doctor is great and I trust him and his judgement. However, I always verify things for myself and do my own research as my doctor can never have the knowledge of my health history that I do - so he might miss something. 
1	I feel I get many explations throughout any of my appointments that educate me on what is happening and why at all times.  It is very helpful to be able to feel educated. 
-1	"In past experiences, visits to my primary physician have resulted in absolutely nothing. ""Take this medication"" is pretty much the only advice I receive. "
1	Generally I always trust people. My doctor cares for me. So I always trust him.
-1	I feel that my doctor is generally knowledgeable and competent; I just think that sometimes my sessions are rushed through, as if I'm just another customer to pay for their services. I don't distrust my doctor, but I do often believe that my doctor should spend more time with me.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing them since I was young. My whole family goes to the same practice and we have had a lot of positive experiences and received good health care.
1	my doctor is no nonsense and to the point. he does not sugar coat things and has never kept anything from me. trust him implicitly.
1	I trust my doctor because he is a family friend. He would tell me the truth about whatever I see him for. I believe he would anyways because it is not worth it for him to lie to anyone. There is so much information out there that doctors can quickly be checked if they are not telling the truth or are incompetent. 
-1	I trust my pcp because she always take time to make sure I understand and really explains all my options and possible outcomes. 
-1	I trust doctors in general, but sometimes if the place is busy I might feel like they don't care very much about me but more about moving to the next person. I don't like it when doctors don't seem to care about a more persol engagement.
-1	I think doctors miss a lot of things because they are trained to treat the symptoms and not the causes. They don't often trust that people know their own bodies.
1	My doctor has never wronged me. He is very friendly and always answers my questions. He genuinely cares about my health and his solutions have always worked.
1	My doctor doesn't seem like a bad guy. He doesn't push any medicines or products on me, so it doesn't seem like he's benefitting in any way that would make him disregard my care.
1	I pick doctors that really care about good outcomes and satisfied patients. Also, if a doctor gives the hint that he/she isn't doing the right thing I will question and leave if necessary.
-1	I feel that medicine is a business and not a one on one profession.   The doctor tries to make money off you.
-1	I overall trust my doctor but there is so much information out in the world regarding health and sicknesses and treatments that he couldn't possibly know everything that is best for me.
1	I have had doctors I did not trust, and quickly sought a new doctor. To me, it is one of the most important decisions a person can make. I need to feel they are thorough, caring, and aren't just passing over any concerns I have. If I am unhappy with a doctor, I have no problem asking to see a different one. The one I have now is very caring, compassiote, and listens, even if the appointment takes  a little longer than expected.
-1	I believe that they have my best interest in mind. They want to do the best for me that they can.
-1	I dont have a strong persol relationship with my doctor so I can't really say that they have my best interest in mind. I'm sure they dont want to actively harm me but I don't know if they really care that much. 
1	I think my trust comes mainly from the time my dr. is willing to spend with me. She takes the time to talk and get to know me and what my life looks like. She integrates any options into what works in my situation. 
1	I've been with my doctor for about 5 years now and she has always taken the time to answer my questions and address any concerns that I have, even taking extra time to figure issues out.
1	I have had the same physician since I was very young and he has always taken my concerns seriously. I have never had any issues with him. He always addresses my concerns and has been proactive about addressing any health problems I may have. He is always patient in answering questions or concerns.
1	I generally had positive experiences with health care providers. I trust that these people took their education and their training seriously and that they value their job enough to make correct recommendations. I have yet to have any reason to distrust medical professiols.
-1	I don't believe I have any serious medical conditions.  My physician doesn't seem too concerned about me.  Some mistakes have been made when I visited him.
-1	From my last couple experiences with my doctor I feel that they have my best interests in mind and that they are trying to help me, but I feel they are overworked and sometimes don't have enough time to get to know me.
-1	Sometimes my doctor doesn't listen to my main concern and instead changes the subject and discusses other things that I didn't come in to discuss that day. 
1	I have been with my primary care physician for five years now and she has always steered me in the right direction. I feel I have total trust in her and always listen to and follow what she says. 
-1	Most physicians are time constrained, they do not believe in altertive medicine nor ways to treat problems, they want to prescribe a pill and have you out the door so they can make more money by seeing more patients. 
1	My Primary care physician is very thorough and can recognize the problem very quickly. I have seen her for anything from a serious illness to a fall and she has known what the problem was so soon as I explained to her how I feel and she saw the injury. She has always been correct in her diagnosis and has sent me to great specialists when the need arises.
1	I trust my current doctor since he seems pretty honest. He is friendly and has told me that he's interested in my well-being directly at least once. He wants to hear what I have to say, and if I ask a question about something, he does his best to answer it to my satisfaction. I haven't experienced anything that makes me feel I should distrust him thus far, though I won't say I completely trust him 100%, since I know he's not infallible.
1	I have been with my PCP for 10 years. I have always felt like I could tell her everything, like being a lesbian and an alcoholic.
1	"Just saw my PA yesterday. Here's what I wrote in the survey sent by the hospital. ""Kandace has literally saved my life. I had an onset of PMDD and was suicidal. Her triage nurse, ncy, took my concerns seriously and got me in within 2 hours. I had untreated lifelong anxiety disorder and had been on five different benzos. Kandace put me on Zoloft and I had peace of mind for the first time in FIFTY years. I had debilitating sinus migraines and she put on Allegra and I haven't had one since. She diagnosed hypothyroidism when I came in bundled up for Antarctica. She has controlled my HBP. She diagnosed a Vitamin D3 deficiency confirmed by blood test. She is simply the best primary care provider I have ever had in my 66 years."""
-1	Sometimes the doctor will tell me what i need to do or take, instead of giving me options. I know that he isnt always right all the time, so that makes me question him.
-1	My primary care physician hasn't given me any reason to think he has ulterior motives. He has been pretty spot on every time I have seen him so I will continue to trust his judgement.
1	I have had the same primary care doctor for quite a number of years and she has always taken the time with me to figure out any problems and treatments available. She helps me come to a decision with treatment plans, taking my day to day life into account. If she doesn't know an answer, she will tell me, and refer me to a specialist she trusts to help me.
-1	I trust him for the most part. But, even he can have gaps in knowledge and is perhaps more wanting to do the expedient thing than the most thorough. 
1	She is intelligent and asks thorough questions.  She is good at following up.
-1	I do not have complete trust in any doctor. You have to be your own advocate. Doctors struggle with the amount of time spent with patients versus the number of people that need to be seen each day. Any time I am given a medication or advice from a doctor, I do my own research before trusting it completely.
1	I trust my primary care physician because in the past he has never gave me any reason to doubt him. Every time I've came in with a question or concern, he's spent the time to sit down with me and address all of my concerns. He's never tried to rush me me out or just disregard me. I am very comfortable around him, and would go to him about any medical concern I had.
1	I trust my primary physician because I have seen her for a long time now and she has never let me down. She's always helpful, always within reach, and she has never given me bad advice. I trust her because I consider her a friend and she feels the same way.
-1	I have just had bad experiences with doctors in the past. I don't want to go into my persol history but sometimes they don't care about patients. 
-1	I have only gone to my primary care physician for about a year now and hadn't had one before that for 20 years. So far he has given me no reason to distrust him and has been open to conversations about various problems. I don't have enough data to have a strong opinion on how trustworthy he is but I am assuming he is.
1	He has dedicated his life to helping people with their life. I don't believe he would lie to me. I believe he always has my best interests in mind and gives me the truth.
1	I have only know my newest primary care physician for about 6 months. My past primary care physician was used for almost a decade. I believe a relationship with a doctor is important. I'm not saying that will not develop with my newest doctor, but at the time total trust is not present. 
-1	My primary care physician has been generally thorough and helpful, and when he says something is wrong he is very thorough in providing me with all of the information about treatment options available to me. However, I answered neutral for some of my responses because there was a time when I had a lot of non-specific symptoms and eventually began having a lot of pain, and he did not look much further into it and prescribed me muscle relaxers. I visited again and his PA took the time to do a full examition and determined based on my pain that I had fibromyalgia, which also explained many of my other nonspecific symptoms. In this case, I don't believe my PCP was as thorough during the visits I made to him because he didn't discuss this possibility with me. 
1	My doctor is a great doctor.  He tells you straight about medical information.  I have researched him and he does not participate in pharmaceutical company kickbacks.
-1	I have a rare disease. It took 4 years and several doctors before I filly got a diagnosis and effective treatment. Along the way, I had doctors who were well-meaning but unhelpful, doctors that accused me of lying, doctors that ignored me and forced me to go to a patient advocate to get them to follow through. I've learned that it isn't in my best interests to assume that any doctor can be completely trusted.
-1	She takes the time to listen to my concerns. She fully explains all test results to me and answers all my questions without hesitation.
-1	Doctors are fallible human beings, no different than you or I and they can, and do make mistakes.  What is in their best interest may not be in yours as well.
-1	I wouldn't trust a doctor 100%, I would seek a 2nd opinion if there was ever a serious matter. 
-1	I trust my doctor because they seem trustworthy and have had more experience than me.
-1	I don't trust any doctors anymore. I have seen so many that are not involved in my care as I feel they should be. I like my doctor now but I don't trust him.
1	I have known my doctor for years and he has always been good to me. I haven't ever had a reason to stop trusting him.
-1	I feel like most doctors will try their best, but I have experience with some who have clearly not known what they are doing. So while I generally trust them, I am always skeptical.
-1	I believe my doctor is looking out for my best interest, that being said he is only human and is prone to making mistakes like everyone else. But deep down I do think he cares about my well-being.
-1	I trust my doctor because I've never been given a reason not to. They are the medical professiols with years of training and education and I should defer to their recommendations unless they give me a reason not to trust them.
-1	My doctor does not make me feel like they have my best interest fully at heart because the last time I went in for an ongoing, painful issue they ran tests and told me that they did not know what was wrong, that was it. No further follow up to figure out what the problem was. 
-1	They seem to worry about other issues when I go to see them. I went for a sore throat and end up getting a test for something else.
-1	He may not have the best bedside manner but he's always utd on all new and current medical information and I feel I get great care just too faced paced if that makes sense
-1	My dr has helped me with several things over the last couple if years. She has even let me try a couple of meds that i had wanted to. I seem to do well under her care.
1	I feel that my doctor-patient relationship is well established and she feels comfortable telling me things even if I won't agree with them. She is aware I will ask questions and I will always be respectful even if I disagree with her recommendation. 
1	My PCP has been very open about her reasoning and thought processes and gone out of her way to set me up with the next steps for me to pursue. She listens to my concerns and thoughts as well.
-1	
-1	I generally trust my doctor. I have been with him for years and would not continue the relationship if I had doubts about his care. When it comes to my health I am somewhat cautious so I do not completely trust my doctor.
1	My primary physician hasn't failed me yet. The other week I went in because I had an horrible cough and headache. He took a look into my ears and prescribed antibiotics, one week later I am feeling better.
-1	I trust my physician because I know he graduated from a really good medical school. He also is very kind and takes him time to explain everything so you can understand it.
-1	I do trust my primary care physician or else I would be choosing another physician.  I am also aware that physicians are busy and that sometimes things can get missed in a busy office so it is my responsibility to keep myself well-informed regarding tests, results and treatments and to ask questions if needed.  
-1	Everyone I go in with a concern I get a few words in  then suddenly there is medicine without test..
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for years now, and he is very familiar with me and my history. He has never steered me wrong, and he listens attentively to any questions I have. I have a great deal of trust in him.
1	I don't feel like he pushes medication on me, which is a fear I have regarding most doctors. I don't want a doctor who is in the pocket of Big Pharma. 
1	"I trust my doctor because he is very direct and ""no-nonsense"".  He explains things very clearly and presents me with options."
1	My PCP is a former Director of the CDC and is a Board Member of the American Cancer Society.  His experience, knowledge and wisdom, associated with viral infections and Cancer, have proven to be a profound blessing.  Also, his associates and other specialists work well as a team when preparing my treatment plans, explaining all of the parameters associated with them, and carrying them out.
1	I've been with my doctor for almost a decade and she know my body inside and out! I trust her judgment because, so far, she's been correct about any issues I've had regarding my care. She is well educated and stays abreast of the latest advances in medicine, which she shares with her patients. 
-1	They have more medical training than me. I do not know anything regarding the field of medicine and that is their job. I have to depend on what they know, similar to how people depend on me for IT advise.
-1	They have never given me a reason not to trust them and everything they've ever done for me worked out well. I also generally agree with the treatment or advice they give me too.
1	i have had the same doctor for 10 years and know him and his decision making abilities and he has a good persoble quality and is fairly accurate
-1	As I only see a doctor once every few years, I would say I have had no reason to mistrust any of them.  In general, I feel I have been given adequate information and care.
-1	I haven't been seeing them long and when I do it's short. I get basic stuff answered. It still feels like business. Generally I trust them, because when I do ask questions about risks and side effects, it sounds like they're being honest.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he is patient with me, listens to all I have to say and consults with me regarding his decisions.  He has very well trained office staff that provide excellent services.
1	I trust my primary physician based on how he has helped me in the past. He is always thorough and I went through other doctors before sticking with him. He always explains the options and when possible, we decide things together.
-1	I will never trust anything in this medical system ever again. It is as simple as that.
-1	I have always felt rushed and just another number when going to the doctor. I have also been shamed by a few doctors for carrying some extra weight. Overweight people know they are heavy and need kind and conpassiote care, not being lectured to. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is always honest with me about everything and explains things in terms that I can understand. 
-1	Sometimes they don't listen to everything I need to tell them, and they come to a conclusion/diagnosis before I tell them everything I'm experiencing. Sometimes I'm left with some concerns. However, I generally trust their judgment.
1	My primary care physician is always patient with me and does not seem rushed. He is very clear in his explations of his diagnosis and how to move forward no matter the issue. He is able to provide trustworthy and good recommendations in my experience. 
-1	I rarely go to the doctor, and in fact, don't really have one that I would call my primary.  When I do go, though, it is usually for a specific issue, sickness, or injury and I always have the feeling the doctor just wants to get me in and out so he or she can get on to the next one.  I rarely feel like they have my best interest at heart.
-1	While there may be those in the field who truly want to help others, the bottom line is that people will look after themselves one way or another. I don't trust anyone. Doctors are no exception.
-1	My doctor is the same doctor I had as a kid.  He is super Christian and super American.  I haven't been to see him in over 10 years because he always wants to talk to me about Jesus and democracy.
1	Docs are only human, by definition they are not perfect.
1	My primary care physician actually listens to me, takes the time to hear and understand my concerns, and is willing to explore alterte treatment options er provide referrals to other specialists if we agree there may be some benefit.
1	I generally trust my doctor since I switched to him after having a bad experience with a previous doctor, and my current doctor was very honest in giving me new treatment options. He is very good at communication and seems to listen very closely and with interest in what I say. 
1	My primary care physician is my uncle, so I've known him my entire life and certainly do not think he'd put any concerns above my health. Also because he's a family member I've had lots of people approach me who are patients of his to tell me how much they trust him as well. As a doctor, he's both extremely careful and reassuring, and very experienced.
-1	"I receive medical treatment through a public health service. These people are over worked, under paid, and emotiolly drained. They have no incentive nor energy to deal with people who are uncooperative, and thus will try to give few options that leave people with ""obvious"" choices. "
1	in order to feel comfortable and know you have the right doctor for you is to be able to completly trust him and the desicions he makes.
-1	Well, I marked neutral on all these because my PCP has only been with me 4 months. If i don't believe in my doctor or the doctor doesn't have faith in me about fixing things with a diet and exercise they get the boot. If they don't listen to me or make me feel ignored they get the boot.  So far I like him and he is  being a cheerleader for me 
1	My doctor is very open and honest with me. He never rushed me, answers all of my questions. He goes above and beyond by calling and checking on me. He is very genuine in his treatment.
-1	They have good intentions and want to help. They also have rules and regulations they have to comply with and don't have the time to get into the details about individual patient care. I trust that they are giving good advice, but it's only part of the picture. As an adult I need to research any conditions I have and find the best overall plan to treat it, including their treatment recommendations or medicines. 
-1	My primary care physician is very forward with information and makes sure I understand everything he tells me. He is very open to questions and is very considerate.
1	My doctor seems to be honest and trustworthy. She has given me good medical advice in the past and I can't see a situation, unless something changes drastically, where I wouldn't trust her. 
-1	I don't have a primary physician, but I feel that overall, doctors are more concerned about the bottom line than the patients. In the past, I have been prescribed medicine I don't need for a condition I don't have, just because the physician I was seeing was paid to do so by the pharmaceutical companies. I don't feel that doctors really listen to their patients. 
-1	I believe doctors in general want money. I think they make stuff up to scare you.
1	My family doctor has always treated us great including my two year old child with a serious heart disease and if it weren't for them we may have found out about her disease in the worst way possible which would be finding her dead. My doctor gives it to me straight and certainly does not sugarcoat anything which is good considering I am obese.
-1	"I do trust my doctor because he ""knows"" my family. He's been through a lot with us and we can talk about it all. That is nice to have someone that is easy going enough to be able to open up. It used to be called a good ""bedside manner"""
1	I trust them because they committed to very many years of schooling to do what they do. They're trained in their profession and do it nearly every day which quickly builds experience. The most experience I have is Google searches so I have no choice but to put my trust in them.
-1	I trust them nbecasue they are professiols. I am going there because I value their opinions and trust them whole heartedly.
-1	I believe that for the most part physicians have their patients' best interests in mind. However, because of the economics of healthcare in this country a patient's interests might not always be met.
-1	There's just really no way to know how much one can trust one's doctor. Sometimes the doctor may make an honest mistake--how much do you trust the doctor then? Does it depend on the consequences of that mistake?
-1	I don't fully trust doctors in general because I've had bad experiences with them in the past. I feel like the process to become a doctor 1lpeople who actually care from completing it, and a lot of doctors I've met are self centered and see patients as puzzles instead of real people.
1	She listens to my concerns and offers options. I have learned that I need to write down my symptoms over time and let her know what I've been feeling and for how long. She is then quite willing to listen and explore options
-1	When I delivered my baby it was near dinner time at the close of the business day and the doctor wanted to be done. He was frustrated that I had a birth plan that I asked him to follow when there was no medical indication not to and he injured me by speeding up the delivery in yanking out my baby. Following that there have been instances where I have sought help for a condition I have and the doctor has only told me he doesn't want me to continue the treatment I have been using without an explation as to why and he was pushing me to use a contraceptive rather than the altertive treatment that has been effectively working. 
-1	I recently encounter a medical situation in which most of the problem was created by doctors non-expertise in that area. 
-1	I trust my doctor because they are medical professiols. Since I am not knowledgeable in the field it is in my best interest not to doubt my doctor unless proven otherwise. I not denying that there aren't incompetent doctors out there, but I will give them the benefit of doubt unless evidence contradicts.
-1	I've had 2 doctors in my life give me bad information.  So, I'm a little weary. I had one the was obviously getting paid to prescribe a certain pill and he pushed it hard on me.  When I got my second opinion the Doctor told me I didn't need pills.  I do think Doctors know way more than me but I'm cautious now with them. 
-1	I like her a lot and she hasn't steered me wrong so far.  I feel like she's honest with me about her opinions and my options.
-1	I haven't been seeing my PCP for that long.  For a long time I didn't have one, and this Dr. was one that was accepting new patients.  I find her manner rather brusque and hurried, I actually need to make her stop and answer questions.  I get a lot of my information from the nurses, but i want to hear it from the Dr.  She seems to always be thinking about her next patient instead of me.  I feel like I don't hold her attention for even the five minutes she spends with me.  For that reason, I will be looking for another PCP, it's just hard to find one that will accept new patients.
-1	I have felt rushed in the examition room, even though my doctor was kind. I was also prescribed something and told it wouldn't affect my mood at all. In fact it made me extremely anxious, and the research I did on my own, after the fact, cautioned that it would.
-1	While i trust that doctors are often doing their best and have reasons for why the do or do not recommend certain treatments, I do think they fall into patterns and often disregard complimentary medicines. They can be quick to prescribe medication or surgery with holistic remedies or simple dietary changes can help. Doctors are people and they are flawed and I believe that just like many other people, provide better care to patients they feel connected with. I feel like i have a responsibility as a patient to do my own research and ask questions. 
-1	I've been with my doctor for many years now and have had no issues with her. She is very nice and I do trust her very much. That said on a big medical decision I may get a second opinion.
1	I trust my doctor because I have yet to receive bad advice from them. They have also been a doctor for a long time, so they have valuable experience that help my trust
-1	My PCP usually addresses all of my concerns, and will triage them accordingly. He's also cared for me during some more recent, complicated health issues, so I trust he knows my health concerns just as well as I do.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have gone to their practice since I was a newborn and have had no problems, and have handled all of my vaccines and health issues appropriately with them. I figure that my doctor knows a lot more about health than I do and that alone is a reason to invest a lot of trust in them.
-1	I have been going to my doctor for over 20 years, I trust her. I feel as if she treats me based on my needs not as a guideline of treatment, but for individual needs. She talks to me like a person and shows respect and compassion.
-1	"My PCP is worthless. i have been going there for 5 years, sick as a dog, and he keeps telling me I am ""healthy as a horse"" on paper. Just great.  I am in the process of finding another doctor before i croak."
1	I completely trust my physician.It is important for me to stay healthy for myself and for my family.My physician is a very good person.She is very caring and understanding. She really makes me comfortable.
1	My doctor tells me like it is. She's honest and thorough with me. She tries to relate to me. And speaks to me in a way I would understand.
1	If I didn't trust my PCP then I would look elsewhere (as I have done in the past). One of the most important aspects of a PCP is trust. If I can't trust him/her then the relationship is worthless to me.
-1	"I have not seen this primary care physician that long and feel that they aren't as familiar with my background as they could be. I have also been denied certain medications that I feel I need just because they ""are not comfortable"" with prescribing them. I would have to go to a different doctor just for that then. I miss my ""old familiar with me"" doctor as well."
1	I don't see my primary care doctor very often, but I do see my gastroenterologist on a regular basis. I trust him because I've been seeing for three years. In that time, I've been hospitalized when I was very ill and he made the right medical decisions for me. He's always informative when I see him and explains things well. I have never had any problems during any interaction with him.
1	I trust that my doctor knows what is best for me. If he tells me something I have a disagreement on, I question his logic. I know my body pretty well and he knows that I give him all the information he needs to make a decision about treatment. I don't hold back and he doesn't either. 
1	She takes the time to really understand what is happening and asks thoughtful questions to provide better health treatment without making you feel guilty about how you responded to her. She makes thoughtful suggestions without coming off as pushy or judgemental.
-1	
-1	It's not that I don't trust them it's they always seem to have altertive agendas then what you feel you need. You go in for one thing and they test you for eight other things, they find out what's wrong and then they experiment with different medicines. 
1	If my primary care physician see that his way is not working he will send me to another doctor , he will explain every thing to me , sometimes draws pictures and shows me how something will work , he takes his time with me and make sure I know what is going to happen 
1	I have known my doctor since my first daughter was born over 13 years ago.  She has treated all of my children.  I started seeing her myself 4 years ago and she has always given me insightful options and thorough testing.
1	I've been with my primary care physician for several years, and we have a good relationship. I feel like my physician is open and forthcoming with me, and I feel like I can be as well in return.
1	I trust my physician because I have a long history over many years. I have experience with situations where there were options and feel my physician always had my best interest at heart and offered me the truth.
-1	For the most part, I trust physicians but I do believe in getting a second opinion where treatment for cronic health issues are concerned. I saw both of my grandparents almost die because of a doctor who was more concerned with his bottom line than caring for what they needed. They were heavily over medicated and taking medicine they did not need. They were both in need of a pacemaker but he would not refer them to a cardiologist. The family had to take over and get them to different doctors so that they could have a healthy life instead of slowly wasting away.
-1	I feel as if some times my doctor is not listening to my whole story. I try to say something and it is sometimes disregarded when I believe it would be important to take into consideration.
-1	After years of having pain and getting sick, I am still no closer to knowing what is wrong with me that I was 6 years ago. I never seem to get answers to why I am sick, and even after tests the doctors still don't know. I am so frustrated by this. I don't have health insurance and have to go to a clinic and never get the same health care provider twice.  There is no one to trust in my case.
-1	There are a lot of changes in medicine constantly and there are a ton of options it would probably take days  to cover the ones for each condition. Doctors tend to go with the simplest or maybe cheapest if that is the way insurance providers make you go. Sometimes the best answer is not simple or cheap.
1	My doctor explains everything to me and then presents options for me to choose from. This creates a relationship where I trust her. She is providing me with the opportunity to be involved in my healthcare decisions instead of being extremely paterlistic and telling me what I should and should not be doing.
1	I have had the same doctor all of my life and rely on them to make sure I feel good in all situations.  I believe that normally all people are in this world to do good, especially doctors as I know they are there to look out for people.
-1	He's been my primary doctor for years already and his cure is always effective.
-1	i trust them. But no one is perfect so its best to do your own research as well as get a doctors opinion.
1	because my doctor will always give me choices and will always be honest with me. He will advise me on what to take and what not to take .
-1	I don't think MDs know all of the options for treatment and, therefore, always recommend the options that they are most familiar with or have the latest buzz in jourls or commercials or get the best meals from the local sales representative. They are human and they habits and are easily influenced.
1	I have been going to him for over 20 years.  He is frank with m.  he make sure I always no the score.  He does not beat around the bush, and I appreciate that.  
-1	I have always had good experiences with doctors. They have all been professiol and seemed to be competent.
-1	I normally trust them as I have high hopes and respect to them.I know if they were fooling me because I can somehow sense it. And i always asked my sister about it.
-1	I do not fully trust anyone completely, even a doctor. I always have a sense of questioning about what if. No one is perfect and even doctors make errors or are wrong.
-1	I generally trust my doctor.  If I had doubts, I would seek a second opinion. My doctor has many years experience and I am generally in excellent health.
-1	I feel like my doctor does what is easiest when it comes to my medical condition. I don't think my doctor cares much about my wellbeing. He is just doing a job that he may or may not even care about.
-1	A lot of doctors see too many patients to be very through with each patient, which I fault health insurance companies for the doctors needing to see so many patients. I was prescribed a medication that could interact with another medication I was taking. I took that medication for months, seeing the same doctors and using the same pharmacy. It wasn't until my regular doctor (pain magement) was on vacation, an older doctor recognized the risk and took me off of it. This greatly reduced my amount of trust in both doctors and pharmacists. My PCP was also aware of the medications but, did not recognize the interaction. 
-1	I feel my PCP sometimes rushes through appointments. Plus they are handcuffed by what my insurance allows them to do. 
-1	i trust my doctor because she knows more than i do about human bodies. i can look things up and give her my symptoms, but at the end of the day she knows a lot more than i do about how things work. I trust her.
1	I have been seeing him for years and he knows what best for me. We both do research on things to see what will work the best.
-1	I think my doctor has my interest in hand. I trust that my needs are important .
-1	they do not want to see you back again in a few weeks so they are inclined to give you better treatment. 
1	My doctor never seems to be hurried and answers all of my questions in depth.
1	My doctor always take the time to explain things to me.  My doctor never makes me feel rushed.
-1	My last primary care physician wasn't necessarily a bad doctor, but she was pretty busy and quick to get my appointments over with. She even ended up missing key signs of a very serious problem I was having by diagnosing the symptoms as common ailments that had nothing to do with each other though she's not to blame for that (it was a very bizarre chain of events that led to the discovery of my problems). I know she did what she could with what she knew but I think if she spent more time with me in my appointments, maybe she would have seen something different.
1	My primary care physician is very thorough in explaining things and likes to make sure I understand what she has told me before the visit ends. 
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part.  A doctor isn't always aware of all the side effects of a medication or its interactions with other medications.  Medicine is changing very quickly and it is hard to keep up with the latest developments.
-1	They didn't go to school that long and learn nothing
-1	I'm in between PCPs (switched insurance based on marriage). I answered the questions based on my last one, who was a resident, fresh out of med school. She would take a lot of time to talk with me about issues, but more for herself/understanding things. She referred me to a dermatologist for an issue I still have, and I completely mistrusted the derm because he wanted me on 4 medications for something simple, even after I told him none of them worked in the past. This made me not want to trust my old PCP in her referral judgement.
-1	"I haven't had a primary care doctor for years because I'm poor and couldn't afford to go to doctors, but I did go to the emergency room a few years ago and that doctor totally ripped me off. I had a sty bleeding wound on my eyebrow. The doctor glued it back together, gave me 2 Tylenols, and a tetanus shot. All of that cost almost $2000. You can explain it to me a million ways but there's no way those actions cost $2000. It took the doctor 5 minutes and the bill said that the ""physician fee"" or whatever it was called was $800. They charged me $10 a piece for the 2 Tylenols. All some of these medical people care about is money. It may have once been a noble profession but now they're just as crassly capitalistic as any other big business in this country."
1	I have been seeing my doctor for almost 20 years now. He knows me and I feel like I am at home there. I can come to him with any problem at all and he knows what to do. He has never let me down once. He know when we can speed through and exam but if I have any questions or need to talk he will stay with me as long as I need him to explain or talk to me.
-1	She put me on a medication and took me off another cold turkey and I developed serotonin syndrome which has completely turned my life upside down.
-1	I believe that doctors and general can easily get caught up in the formulaic behavior of routinely prescribing prescription for patients A, B, and C, so when the next patient comes along with a similar issue it is just a wag of their pen to get them out of their office and another person into the exam room and go on with their day. 
1	I've been going to her office for a few years now and I'm always impressed by her high intelligence, her warmth, her competence and professiolism and the way she is always calm, attentive, quick and relaxed at the same time. And she is also greatly regarded in the profession - she has won many awards, which definitely inspires confidence.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I usually have a lot of questions to ask them when I come in for visits. They take the time to answer those questions and break down the technical answers into something I can understand. They also have taken care of all the other members of my family as well for years. So a long bond with our physician created that trust over many years.
-1	I trust my doctor because when I go in for a visit, she listens to me and usually has more than one option to try without immediately going to medicine. I feel like I am heard and she typically solves my problems without multiple visits of trial and error.
-1	I had a wonderful primary care doctor but he had since retired due to too much paper work involved in the practice. For the time being, I don't have a primary doctor. However, I come in contact with different doctors. Many are good, normal people. They do their best to treat patients with their specialized knowledge that they spent years to acquire. At the same time, they are just humans and could only do so much to treat patients. 
1	I trust my doctor, she asks good questions and always seems to take the time necessary to understand my needs. She doesn't seem in a hurry like other doctors I've seen in the past. 
-1	"The dummy put me on birth control for headaches and then when I spiraled into panic attacks and depression, then came the zoloft and birth control. I knew there ""had"" to be some other answer because this all just came on so suddenly. They want to give you the typical ""disease"" bullshit and that you'll be on meds the rest of your life to mage. F no. I spent days and asked the universe several times to lead me to the answer, and it did. My diet was high protein, high fat, high processed vegan junk food, and ever since switching to a high fruit, mostly raw vegan lifestyle, I becoming a new person, and don't need their bullshit meds. They get handouts for prescribing meds to people and they don't fully understand the lymphatic system, in fact they completely ignore it. Unless Dr. Morse on youtube who was the ONLY one, that actually completely explained the lymphatic system, how all diseases are connected and the underlying problem of too much acid chemistry in our bodies."
1	I trust my physician because she is caring and honest. She is open and you can talk to her about any of your health concern and she will give her honest advice on what should or shouldn't be done. 
1	My physician is very though and takes the time to explain things to me. And he shows patients and eager to answer all my questions. And makes sure that I completely understand before I leave his office. He always make sure we have a plan and a time when we will follow up.
-1	I trust my doctor because he does not beat around the bush. He tells me when I need to address something or if I am over reacting. He also tells me to not be afraid to get a second opinion. That he is only human and that he wants me to feel comfortable and if that means getting another doctor's opinion then so be it. 
1	I do trust my doctor.  He is very kind and thoughtful.  If I do not want to have an x-ray done, he does not force me to have it done.  He always asks me how I am feeling and if I have any questions and concerns that he can help me with.
-1	I trust my primary care provider a great deal.  He has done quite a bit to inform me of low cost options for treatment as well as flat out given me prescriptions.  He is also a big believer in preventative medicine.  The guy is a gem. 
1	I trust him b/c he has proven that he cares and wants to find out what is wrong with me no matter what.  
1	I have complete in my doctor, Ihave been seeing her for quite sometime, She always give the best treatment , So for she have taken good care of me.
-1	I generally think he is honest and trying hard but I don't think he is a very good communicator and sometimes it feels like he is hard to read. I don't always know how urgent or serious something is.
-1	The practice I go to has SO MANY PATIENTS. The care is generally good, but I often feeling like I'm on an assembly line and their time with me is on the clock, so they might be more expedient than thorough.  
-1	I trust my doc becasue he talks to me like a person, not just throw meds at me and call next patient.
-1	I think that a lot of doctors would rather have you get on some medication that might help you some, but would cause side effects that would make you have to continue going to the doctor, rather than really emphasize the importance of changing the things that people eat, so I don't trust them too much in that regard.
1	I trust my doctor because he is very knowledgeable in his job and knows what he is doing and what is best for me to do and take.
-1	I have been several times to my doctor and have mentioned certain pains or issues and if it is not the focus of the visit they are kinda brushed off.  This has happened several times so I don't completely trust my physician.
-1	I have no primary care physician now. Dealing with doctors in the past is the main reason I don't bother with them. I found them to rarely be good listeners. They are too concerned with covering their own ass these days than actually taking care of people.
-1	 Trust my primary care physician because not only did he go to school to be in his profession but he also has taken the time to get to know me.
-1	I usually trust my doctor if I agree with what they think is best to do and if I don't agree I question him.
1	"I don't ""completely"" trust anyone, but do I believe my doc is being honest and upfront with me?   Yes.    Not that I wouldn't get a second opinion if I had a serious illness, that's a common sense thing.  "
1	I trust my PCP completely as he is the one who has the credentials, knowledege and experience to give advice and treat patients, including myself.I believe my doctor is honest and  I trust his decisions completely based on his thoroughness and willingness to answer and address any questions I have.
1	Although my PCP is fairly new to me (&gt;then one year) he quickly takes action on long term conditions I explain and gets me into the correct specialist if he is uble to provide treatment.  He listens well, asks about previous experiences, explains his ratiol and appears to be transparent in his thought process.
-1	I am lucky to have a great Dr. In the past, I have not. She listens. She knows me. She also has chronic pain, so that helps in her understanding.
1	She listens and responds.  She is warm and friendly and seems very interested in what I have to say.  She explains things in ways that are easily understood without being condescending. She treats me like a person.  
1	They listen and are observant. They care.
-1	I distrust western medicine in general. I feel it is a business more than anything else these days. I also feel it is ignorant about the conscious ture of the universe.
1	I completely trust my doctor to give me correct, accurate and complete information and not mislead me.  But I don't fully trust that my doctor knows which medical treatments are best for me.  I take the information they give me and I do my own research and I make my own decisions taking into consideration what my doctor has told me.  I am neutral that my doctor knows what's best for me.  
1	I trust my doctor because he is compassiote about helping others and takes the time to answer any question I might have. I've always received prompt service and have never had to wait too long to be seen on in an office visit. He also has been willing to work with me if my insurance has not covered the full price of a medicine I needed.
-1	I feel my doctor doesn't really listen to me or take my concerns into consideration. He glosses over everything and will focus on something that isn't a true problem. I also feel he likes to give me every test in the world even if it doesn't pertain to any of my complaints. 
-1	I believe doctors are mostly concerned with selling drugs to patients. Their main concern is treating symptoms, not the actual disease. Sometimes they spend just a few minutes with each patient, people get more attention at the mechanic .
1	"In the past, I did not trust doctors much due to some bad experiences with being brushed off and accused of ""looking for attention"".  I have since dealt with two very nice doctors, both of which were easy to deal with and took me seriously.  They talk to me and help me through issues, explaining everything as necessary.  "
-1	He seems sincerely interested in what is best for me.  He also sees others in my family and they feel the same way.  It is a feeling I have that he is trustworthy.  He has not given me any reason not to trust him.  I feel he is there to help.
-1	I do trust my doctor most of the time. But he only knows what the AMA has taught him. Medicine is centered around prescription medications and most, if not all, the time I believe there is a better tural solution. 
-1	I have had my doctor for a long time and she knows my history well. She also knows I prefer tural treatments and to monitor things instead of masking with pills etc. Because we have established a good rapport I do trust her when I need to make decisions about my health.
1	My doctor takes extra time to look for different altertives for me. She also always finds different ways to explain things to make sure I fully understand.
1	For the most part, I trust my primary care physician. I've seen doctor's before where they felt almost robotic in dealing with me. No emotion whatsoever and looked to have one foot out the door already. My current primary care physician is none of those things. It actually feels like he cares about my well being. He remembers things from my persol life in previous conversations and brings it up when I see him, like a human being. He takes the time to deal with me, which I like.
-1	I'm not a very trusting person in general which is why I answered as I did, but I trust my pcp as much as I trust as anyone. 
-1	In general, I would trust my doctor to recommend what he honestly believes is the best medical advice for me. However, I have done a fair amount of research and reading regarding certain health issues, and in general I don't trust the medical community to always have the best or most up-to-date information on some issues, particularly regarding nutrition and diet. 
1	I trust my doctor in that he has answered all my questions and has been right about everything I have asked, especially in regards to my own research about issues or topics I bring up to him.  The is a little distrust which is by my own doing in that I don't feel I can trust someone 100% without multiple opinions should something serious happen to my health.
1	I do trust my doctor for the most part.  I know that not a lot of doctors study nutrition or altertive forms of medicine so I also study on that to and make my own decisions.  My doctor is very thorough and seems to care about me.  I feel comfortable talking to her.
1	I have been his patient for several years.  My entire family is a patient AND there have been instances where i have requested weight loss drugs and he has refused to prescribe to me as they had adverse effects.  I trust him and his judgement completely and really do believe that for him, patients come first.
-1	Too many doctors follow a set of rules and protocol. They are not open to altertive medicine and would sooner give you medicine than try and treat things turally. They have too much at stake with the pharmaceutical companies.  
-1	I never trust a doctor 100%. I JUST got a new doctor, and I was happy with him when I went to have a physical back in November.  I like his temperament, his openness to listen, he followed up when he promised that he would, his staff was friendly and so was he.  He looks at things from multiple views.
-1	I don't necessarily trust nor distrust the doctor.  I would assume I trust them more than distrust because she has been trained to be a doctor.
-1	It's not that I distrust my physician, it's that I distrust the medical establishment, to include govt intervention.  I trust that my physician is doing the best she can with the training provided by the medical establishment.  The reason I distrust the establishment is due to its record.   Food pyramid, dietary cholesterol, fats are bad, massive numbers of people on statins with no resulting drops in CVD related deaths.
1	My doctor seems very competent and knowledgeable. She makes sure to listen to my concerns before discussing treatments. If I have questions about the situation, she answers them thoroughly. She has many years of experience and seems to know what she is talking about.
-1	I trust my doctor with my health or else I wouldn't go to my physician. I am a person who once I find a trustworthy doctor, I will stay with them until I need to change physician or I am not able to.
-1	I trust my doctors advice on care because I am a relatively healthy male with no preexisting conditions.  I only usually go see the doctor when I am really sick.
-1	I stay in the middle when it comes to trust.  I trust their opinion, but they are still motivated by self interests first.
-1	I believe you have to trust them. If I'm not mistaken they sign some oath to verify they will be honest and forthright with patients, and do what's in there best interest.  Also they make good money, and if it was found out they were being deceitful it would be hard for them to find work.
1	She never seems rushed with me, and she will always take the time to research an issue to make sure she's considered every possible solution. There was a time when I felt her treatment recommendation was too drastic, but she had no problem referring me to a specialist.
1	My doctor seems to genuinely care about her job. She seems worried and really listening when I am telling her my problems. Then I can tell she is thinking hard and trying to help me to a solution.
1	I have had a good relationship with him in the past. I feel like he would tell me the truth about any potential diagnosis. He has given me reason to believe that he would not falsely lead me on with some diagnosis or other.
-1	i trust my doctor 
1	I generally trust doctors and I never asked for a second medical opinion (unless I noticed that they had a bad attitude towards me and towards other people in general).
1	I trust my doctor because she feels that if I am able to get healthy without prescription drugs, that is the best route. That is respectable to me since most doctors just want to push pills.
-1	"I feel that a lot of Doctors "" Herd Sheep"" because we don't have enough Doctors out there."
-1	My physician is reserved.  I do not feel totally comfortable with him.  He is nice but not very talkative.  He is a general doctor, so I am not sure that he is up on everything that is specialized.
-1	In general, as doctors have years of training to understand medical knowledge and how to apply it, I trust their judgement.
1	My primary care physician has my best interests and health in mind. He has always chosen the best options for the sicknesses that I had and brought me back to good health. I trust in his opinion and his explations of the issues that I deal with.
1	I believe they know what they are talking about. They take time to tell me things. They let me ask questions.
-1	I have seen many relatives have horrible doctors who could really care less about their well being. It was like the only good they were was for the diagnosis. I have had a few like that as well. 
-1	"The doctor I was seeing was not good at discussing things of importance with me.  Apparently he had too many patients because he left to go be an ""Amway"" doc.  I lost faith in him when I was literally dying and too stupid to realize it one time.  My throat was infected and slowing closing off my air.  I called for an appt on a Monday knowing he was in the office to do paperwork.  Would he see me?  No, he wouldn't.  I didn't think he would because for some reason Monday's are sacred to him.  I saw a perfectly competent doctor who referred me to someone else, a specialist.  But I never saw my doctor and I've always resented that a bit.  I literally was very ill and he could have at least popped his head into the door.  I lost a lot of faith in him after that."
1	I have not trusted all physicians completely, but my current one has been a gem. He's been completely kind, compassiote, gives multiple options and educates me on what he's telling me (whether I ask for further explation or not) and spends time with me instead of rushing. When I had blood work done, he called me persolly to discuss my results even though they weren't all that remarkable and gave me further thoughts on how best to approach my health.
-1	I haven't been to a doctor in over a decade. In general I don't trust doctors. Many of them are so profit driven. I hope to never have to see a doctor again.
-1	The least that doctors can do is provide guidelines.
-1	I don't think I currently have a primary care physician, but I don't always necessarily trust doctors in general. My sister has had really bad luck with certain situations so that doesn't help. She's type 1 diabetic and was underweight for a while and the doctors were trying to claim my parents malnourished her when in reality she was just thin and sick from the diabetes. She has some other symptoms going on that they've been trying to find the cause of for years and still haven't. I do believe they're trying their best in this situation but they're definitely not perfect.
1	I trust my physician because they always give me the best treatment options. I can always trust my primary care physician to select the right treatment for me. More importantly, I can trust my physician not to do the wrong things.
1	"I've always had a good experience with my primary care physician. I can understand why some people might have had a bad experience with their persol doctors, but that doesn't mean their experience is the only experience anyone has ever had with doctors - my experience with doctors has certainly been positive. I'm certainly not desperate enough to rely on those ""THINGS DOCTORS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" ads, anyways."
-1	I trust my primary care physician in general because I am intelligent enough to be able to tell if what they are saying makes sense. I always choose doctors carefully after much research and review and persol recommendations.
-1	I trust my doctor because he is a human being and doesn't want to see me suffer; he wants to help.  I do believe that he will give me different options that will make the most money for him though.  As long as it helps me, I don't really care.  There may be some options he won't mention due to the fact that it requires me to go to someone else, thereby not giving him the money.  I do believe medicine is based on money, sad but true.
1	Because he answers all the questions that I ask, and gives me other altertives if needed.
1	Most of my experiences with doctors have been positive ones.  The exceptions are with two doctors I saw (one time each), who were employed by hotels I work at.  These positions are given to the lowest bidders, and both doctors were somewhat hostile and incompetent.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is knowledgeable in his field. While I try to gain understanding through probing, I ultimately defer to his knowledge in coming to certain conclusions. Past experience has taught me that he is usually right, so that's another reason I generally trust him.
-1	I neither trust or distrust doctors. They seem to be in between when it seems like the really care about their patients or not. I don't see them too often, so I don't know alot about them.
-1	"She is young and doesn't really seem to have confidence in things.  I'll tell her my ailments and symptoms, but nothing really comes of it.  She'll prescribe some drug for depression or mood and have me come back in a month.  After a month, I always feel worse and she's just like ""huh""  Seems to me like it's more about getting you a prescription and out the door.  Get us in, prescribed, and out the door as soon as possible.  Who cares about your symptoms, the side effects of this new drug will make you forget about your old symptoms, because the side effects are worse. "
1	I see my physician as someone who truly believes in his work and entered this profession due to a strong desire to help people.  He has never failed to help me when I have gone to him with a problem and I have been completely satisfied with the results I have gotten.
1	My doctor has been a good doctor and I believe he does his job well.
1	I trust my doctor because i've been going to him for years and years,  and after every checkup and everytime i've went to his office i've just got a good wholesome feeling from their practice. I just get the sense that he just wants what is best for me and my family.
1	She's kind but straight forward and tells me how it is. She listens to my thoughts and concerns. She's never given me a reason to not trust her.
1	I trust my doctor because he has never given me a reason not to. He's always very thorough and he gives me options when appropriate. 
1	My PCP has stood by me through 2 years of complicated medical issues collaborating with a team of doctors to ensure continued progress and diagnosis. He discusses all factors pros and cons with me and takes the time to ensure all factors are discussed. Time is one of the keys.
-1	My primary care physician has asked me to spell and remind her of the me of my rare condition each of the last four times I have seen her. She has often forgotten or ignored problems I was having. She seems overbooked and scattered. 
-1	I just havent had the best physicians. Ive been wrongly diagnosed in the past so there is little trust when it comes to doctors.
1	The doctor I see most often is actually not my primary care doctor. I trust him because he listens to me. I feel like he understands what I'm saying. We make decisions together. It's not like he's telling me what I have to do. So I guess I feel like we collaborate. I'm the one who knows about me, and he's the one who knows about treatments. 
1	I have had a wonderful primary Dr. the last 5 yrs. He looks me in the eyes when I talk and it makes me feel that he is truly hearing me. He asks my opinion on treatment when it's an option. 
-1	Sometimes doctors prescribe you medication that you don't really need. They're also more likely to recommend a procedure that costs more. Doctors work to make money, I think there are few doctors who are ethical but most of the ones I've been to are not.
-1	I have used the same doctor for years.  He has always made sure I understand his recommendations/decisions.  I have never had an issue with his performance.
1	I trust only as far as one can trust. Certainly I would not go to a doctor if I read poor reviews about him. I dont believe in intuition however if I get a very bad feel for a doctor based on how he approaches my questions or converses with me then I will find another. The only way to really trust is to have it built over time and that is the best I can do. Its never good to trust anyone 100% but you can establish a good level of trust based on past experience
-1	I trust my doctor because she explains everything in depth and uses terms that are understandable. Also she is very comforting and has a good bedside manner.
-1	"My primary care doctor is fairly new. She has a new practice and I just signed up for treatment. However, she has not given me any reason to distrust her. For the most part, my trust is rated at ""neutral"" because I just don't have enough experience with her."
1	My primary care physician demonstrates a willingness to listen to my physical and emotiol complaints and can empathize with me.  She demonstrates a level of caring for her patients that I have not seen often in a clinical environment.  She even remembers who I am and what I am dealing with without having to consult my records.
-1	"I had an experience with a doctor where he over prescribed pain medication.  I wrote an essay as a witness statement which was used in the case against the doctor by the India Attorney General.  When I was 16, I was hurting so bad and didn't know what to do so my parents took me to a pain magement clinic which would be described as a ""pill mill"".  I don't blame my parents at all.  The first thing I signed was a waiver for them to prescribe me opiates.  The first time he prescribed tramadol, ambien, vicodine, and a muscle relaxant.  He told me it would only be one month and then he would get me off all medication.  Months went by being told the same thing.  It took me 3 years to get off the medication.  I was a zombie.  Now all I need is medicil canbis, and no pills.  I feel better than ever.  This is why I don't trust any doctor and I don't  think I ever will."
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part, but at times I feel he rushes to get to the next patient. When I feel he is rushing, I usually wonder how thorough he has been in my case.
1	I generally trust my doctor's years of expertise and practice in the medical field. However, I also know that medicine is not a precise science and that there is still much that is not known about health conditions that afflict the human body. I know that there is always some chance that I may be misdiagnosed no matter how experienced my doctor is. However, overall I feel that my doctor has the wherewithal and the knowledge to give me the treatment that I require. My doctor shows compassion and concern when I visit her and has always answered my questions with clarity.
-1	It feels sometimes like they are extremely overbooked, and maybe get kickbacks from the insurance company for making certain recommendations. It's hard to trust doctors.
-1	I do not trust my doctor. It's not that he is a bad guy, but he was taught in school to throw pills at most situations. I would rather take a holistic approach to my healing.
1	In the past, my doctor has been very receptive to my needs as a patient. He has taken the time to explain to me anything I did not understand.
-1	I believe that the doctor is looking out for my best interest.  However, I also feel as though he is trying to make money with as little work as possible.
1	I trust him because I can tell he cares and is thorough and not dismissive of me. I have previously seen doctors who I do not trust, and who dismiss my symptoms or concerns, so I know what the other end of the spectrum feels like. 
1	I have never had bad experiences with my doctors in the past, so I have no reason to doubt them. most doctors care about their professiol reputation and will not be willing to jeopardize that.
1	I completely trust my primary physician because he is aware of my health issues and can suggest me with good care.I believe Doctors always work for our betterment.After God we have to trust God for cure.
1	I trust my doctor completely to give me the best available options.  Having this doctor for many years has built a relationship of trust in him.  I would follow any of his orders without question.
1	When someone goes to a Dr, it's a serious step.  They need to trust what the Dr has to say.  It's ok to ask questions and do independent research.  A Dr should be looked at as part of the team that helps to take care of you.  Ultimately, it resides within each of us to take persol responsibility.
-1	I feel like people have flaws just like physicians do. Your doctor is not good at everything therefore could be wrong about things. It is always good to get another opinion
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because he is extremely thorough. During appointments with him, he often exceeds the general '15-30min' exam time, but just because he's so informative. For example, the at my last appointment with him when we were discussing medication options, he was actually showing me published articles from the New England Jourl of Medicine so I can see the data for myself and be more informed in my decision. Obviously he's far more well versed in these things than I am, but he doesn't just assume that these things are 'beyond my comprehension'. He can explain things in a thorough yet not unnecessarily complicated way so I don't feel forced to just take whatever advice he gives me.
-1	"My doctor loves to golf and seems like that's his primary concern most times I'm there -- being able to get out of there early so he can hit the course. I call him a ""cough & cold doctor"". Basically he's good at that stuff, but for anything bigger I would prefer to see someone else (i.e. a specialist). I don't necessarily distrust him I just don't think he cares enough to dig deeper into things. He does what he has to to just barely get by."
1	"I trust my doctor to make the right decisions for my persol health.  I have never felt that I was ""putting out"" my doctor by my needs or questions. "
1	She is a very caring doctor and has always been very persoble.  She takes time to talk to me, address any concerns or issues.  She is very thorough and attentive and I feel this is what makes her a great doctor, she likes people and helping.
-1	I trust my primary care physician based on 4 years experience with her. I receive my care through VA and I know she's always busy, but, hey, she even laughs at my jokes.
1	I am uninsured and haven't seen a doctor for 14 months. When I do, I like my doctor very much. He is thoughtful and attentive, speaks in normal civilian language, not medical terms I can't understand. He takes all of the time I need.
1	I trust physicians including mine. I do not think doctors are out to hurt us. I do not think it is likely to have a doctor make a horrible mistake so it is probably best for my health to trust in them. 
1	I have known my Doctor for many years and I trust him.
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for many years, so I feel that he knows my background and my problems very well. I always feel I can ask questions if I don't understand something. I also find he is very willing to listen to my feelings about taking a medication and he seems to give them some weight in his decisions.
-1	I trust a doctor because they wouldnt have gotten here if they did not do well in medical school. 
1	My doctor never makes me feel rushed. She always makes sure to answer my questions and make me feel involved in deciding my treatment. She makes it seem like we are a team and equals. She tells me about different types of treatments and recommends what will have less strain on my body. 
-1	I always find that my primary care physician is too busy to give me the time I need. I have gone to appointments countless times and left feeling like I really didn't solve my issues. Sometimes, I even feel that they get annoyed if i ask too many questions and keep them in the room for too long.
-1	I have had surgery in the past where the doctor told me there were two different options on the way he could perform the procedure.  I told him that I highly preferred the one method and didn't want the other at all.  He chose to do it the way I didn't want because it was easier for him.  Sometimes they don't tell you everything either, if they don't think you can handle it. 
-1	I trust that he means well, but I don't trust his ability to see things clearly.  And in general, I think most doctors have too many patients and not enough time to focus on them long enough to really see what might be apparent early, until it's so obvious and too late.
1	"I'm sure there are ""bad"" doctors but I have only had positive experiences. They have been attentive and seemed to genuinely care. I also trust their expertise."
-1	My primary care physician doesn't really seem interested in me as a person.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for years and they always seem to be able to fix my problem and seem concerned about my well being.  I have trust that they will continue to fix and help my issues as they arise.
-1	I trust medical professiols except in the rare instances where I know more than they do. That's scarily common in mental health fields, especially.
1	I really like my doctor and have been going to her for several years. However, there was one time when she misdiagnosed a problem I was having. Perhaps part of the problem was the way I described the situation. However, she put me on some medication which, after reading about it, I felt wasn't necessary at all. It turned out the problem was with my teeth and a dentist was the appropriate doctor to fix my problem.
-1	I am moderately trusting of my physician, I'm confident there are some motives behind what she recommends that are not 100% in my best interest and I try to be mindful of that.
-1	I trust my doctor implicitly but he has alot of patients and his time is severely limited with each patient. It's the one thing that annoys me. But he is excellent at his practice even if his time magement is lacking. He still mages to be caring and attentive but the rushing in and out does sometimes give me pause.
1	I am not currently in the care of a particular doctor, but all of my experiences, save one horrid anesthesiologist, have been excellent, which certainly says something because, as I said I have had a good handful of this and that over the years.  
1	She listens well and I never seem rushed.  She is willing to answer questions and look up information if I ask something specific.  She is persoble and warm.
-1	I feel like I generally trust most doctors that I have dealt with because I usually do some good research or ask friends on doctors they have had experiences with before making a decision to visit them or not. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is the  one with the knowledge and experience when it comes to medical issues.
1	I trust my physician because she has known my family for a long time and I know she would never do anything to double cross us. She is very knowledgable and is always very in depth with her examition of me, which shows that she cares. She speaks to me like a person and makes me feel comfortable, instead of trying to just prove how smart she is like some doctors do.
1	He prescribed medicine that he believed to be helpful, and made sure that I get enough information to use it properly. My doctor cared enough about my condition such that simple follow-up sessions were free. He likes to listen when I ask questions, and makes sure to explain them properly. 
-1	Have been seeing the same doctor for longer than I can remember....knows my entire family
1	My old doctor is retiring and the last few times I have had the doctor that will replace her when she retires. He is young but seems competent. I haven't really seen him so often as to really build any kind of relationship with him yet. 
1	My doctor is good because he is older and experienced. He is not overly persoble or chatty, so I don't feel a closeness with him. That is okay to me, as long as he is doing a thorough job. I know he has a lot of patients, so I never feel like I am getting extremely persolized attention, but he is a pro.
-1	I like my primary care doctor but I don't really see him enough to have perfect trust in him. I see him for maybe 15 minutes once or twice a year. 
-1	I persolly have those feelings towards all physicians as well. I also lean more towards altertive medicine.
-1	I trust my doctor. He's certainly smarter than me and I let him know what's going on. I feel like because I'm open and honest with him he's that way with me.
-1	I think that they want to do what is best but I also feel with the insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies around that it is hard for them to always do what might be best for the patient. They try to use universal fixes for everyone and instead of fixing the underlying issue they just prescribe medicine which causes more issues.  
-1	I think doctors tend to rush and don't really go in depth to things to give you all the options. Typically they just give me whatever the most popular treatment is without listing options
-1	I sometimes trust doctors about certain things, but overall I'm a bit suspicious of healthcare providers in general. I've got friends and family who work in the healthcare industry and they talk about all sorts of shady, crappy things that go on. In addition to the fraud I hear about in the news, and my own negative experiences with doctors, it's difficult for me to take everything they say at face value.
-1	I had a new PCP the last time I visited the doctor. I was not pleased with her performance. I am now awaiting an appointment with a new PCP.
-1	We have recently moved so I've had to find a new primary care physician and I am having a hard time trusting him.  I have been on several of the same medications for years and years, but a couple of them he is not comfortable with, so he is wanting to change them around even though I have been the most stable on these ones for the longest period of time.  I feel like he doesn't trust what I'm saying, and it doesn't make me feel good.
1	I have had the same doctor for many years. He has always been upfront with me and what my options were for that particular ailment.
1	We went to the same high school. She was always a smart and sweet person. By knowing her background I trust her completely. She has always been good when I visit her at the doctor. 
1	I trust my primary care doctor mostly.  I say this because I have a hard time trusting any doctors all of the way.  I have seen many doctors and have had some pretty bad experiences (one telling me that it was all anxiety and then I filly found another doctor who believed me that something was wrong and found the right blood tests to run).  I think I trust them to some extent, but I also rely on what my gut is telling me.
1	I have been with this doctor for over 10 years and no matter what he always treats me with respect and kindness. I have a lot of faults such as my struggle with my weight and depression and bipolar. He gives me options, but does not shame me. 
-1	"I usually have to see a doctor at the E.R. because I have no insurance, so I tend to feel they obviously won't have anything ""persolly invested"" in me as an individual. I think sometimes they just do whatever gets me out of there the fastest, whatever treatment is easiest and quickest. I usually have to remind them to try to keep my lack of income in mind when writing prescriptions and such. This being said, if it is an issue that does not directly involve mental health or drug addiction (these are areas I am knowledgeable about because I have issues relating to these areas), i.e., if it is something I probably don't know much about, I generally trust the doctor because they obviously were smart enough to make it through medical school."
-1	i live in a very small town i broke my wrist and was told it was healed after 3 months wearing a cast it was still broken no one here could properly identify the fracture i drove 3 hours to a specialist did an xray and said so yea your wrist is broken and now it's detioriated since its been so long (i walked around with a broken wrist 5 more months before going to a specialist it was hell) so yea i have no faith in medical professiols especially ones in my small secluded town
1	I trust my doctor because I feel she's always done great with me as a patient. She's thorough, explains anything I don't understand very well, and is just extremely reliable all and all. I trust her because I've had great past experiences with her.
1	I believe in giving my doctor all the information so as to get the best treatment options.  I trust that my doctor has my best interest at heart and feel she would not purposfully give me bad advice.
-1	My doctor and most doctors in general persistently push prescription drugs for every ailment. Any attempt at altertive care is, for the most part, overlooked or brushed off when mentioned. 
1	Our family has been going to the same doctor for 25 years, we trust him very much. He takes time and explains everything.
1	I have had the same dr for years and she has never steered me wrong. Always disagnosed properly for whatever i came to them for, or gave the correct medicine that healed me for any sickness. My privacy has never been invaded. I trust my doctor
-1	my doctor misdiagnosed my low sodium  
-1	I trust my doctor because all of the things I have gone in for over the past years have been small and mageable. My doctor is friendly and caring even under time constraints and has been candid but kind in regards to things like getting my weight down, etc. I trust that overall he has my best interest in mind. 
1	I trust my doctor because he has always given me good advice. I have never felt the need to get a second opinion. He takes his time and is thorough.
-1	I think most of them try what's best for a patient. They might not be right, but their heart's in it. I think they make mistakes, but as long as they're not too stubborn to change what they're doing.
1	I've had the same doctor for most of my adult life. Any issues I've brought up he treated or ran tests to find out what was going on. He's always taken action on anything I brought up and is great at communicating and returning phone calls. I wouldn't extend blanket trust to all doctors just because they are doctors but i would give them the benefit of the doubt
-1	The primary care doctor can't possibly know everything there is to know and keep up with all of the current research. I am also concerned about the conflict of interest between doctors and drug companies. My friend who is a nurse told me she's attended several pharmaceutical company dinners. And the FDA has approved medicines that were upproved years later for being dangerous.
1	I've been seeing my primary care physician for a long time. She always explains everything to me in clear, easy to understand way. She thoroughly explains all the options of treatment and suggests the best one for my needs.
-1	My doctor is often in a hurry because he has many patients to see. I always trust he uses his best judgement. I think he makes honest decisions.
-1	I have been one of the healthiest people ever, it seems; thus, I do not go to the doctor often. Since I don't need to go to the doctor all that often, it's hard to answer these questions. I do go for check-ups, but haven't gone every single year. I'm now 64 and am trying to go every year or two. But just going to the doctor for something so routine is not quite enough to thoroughly judge a physician's abilities.
-1	Sometimes I feel like he does not listen or believe I have certain symptoms and instead takes the easier diagnosis. 
-1	Follow up information is idequate.
1	I had a stroke last year and the care my Doctor has provided has improved my health greatly.
-1	Last year, a test result showed I had a chronic condition. The only thing the doctor recommended was a prescription medication. That's it, nothing about lifestyle changes, etc.
-1	She has shown me that she wants the best for me and my well being
-1	I trust him enough I suppose. He's my oncologist I still see once a year. He's a nice guy and everything but he's always busy so when I go there I do all the tests first (CT scan, blood work, etc.) Then he gets all the information before I see him and if no cancer or nothing new that's pretty much it. Usually only see him for 5 minutes or so. But all in all I'm happy with him, I still go there so he must be ok.
1	we have had a long relationship and I have never had any issues with and concerns that have come up with my health that was not resolved.
-1	I have taken pre-med courses and have a friend who is a doctor.  Sometimes I think that's why I'm not as blindly confident when it comes to healthcare in general.  Doctor's make mistakes.  It is up to me ultimately to make the decisions about my own healthcare, given a doctor's guidance.
1	I trust my doctor.  He is always very open about all my options and is willing to help me.  He always treats me like family and sometimes even calls to check up on me.  I believe he really does have my best interest at heart. 
-1	I trust my PCP because she takes the time to listen to my needs and concerns. She takes the time to thoroughly explain my conditions and the medications I'm taking. She has a great bedside manner and is really nice.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has never steered me wrong. He's been great in answering my questions and is quite knowledgeable. He's very intelligent.
-1	I generally trust doctors as I only see doctors who I have done a lot of research about - to see that they are generally revered in the medical world. I believe if they are that successful and well known, I can trust them. However if it was an ER doctor, I'd be cynical. 
-1	I really like my doctor but I do find her rude at times and it is apparent when she is having a stressful day. Unfortutely a few months ago my summary of my doctors visit was given to another patient. The visit was incredibly persol and I was horrified. I have lost a fair amount of trust at the office since.
-1	I trust my doctor. However in the modern world, science is just one more are of Leftist rrative making. I am mindful when researching that doctors and scientists have an agenda which is certainly not truth. For example: Climate Science, Bill Nye, Neil Tyson, when people talk about settled science I laugh at their retardation and misunderstanding.
-1	I saw the results of his work and I know I can trust him in terms of whats best for my health. Not sure about what he is charging me for it...
-1	I trust doctors, if not to know what's best for me all the time, at least to have a much better shot at it than I do. But I don't necessarily trust them to have the same priorities I do. That doesn't even necessarily mean that I don't trust them to put my health as the top priority - sometimes that's not MY top priority. I'm still kind of ticked off at a doctor who ordered $1000 worth of blood tests for PCOS, which it turned out I don't even have and which was nowhere close to his specialty (he was a psychiatrist!). Yes, there was a small chance I had PCOS. Yes, if I had had it, there would have been a small chance of heart problems (all the other symptoms were things I considered either no big deal like hair, or actually beneficial, like amenorrhea and infertility). But good God, $1000! Insurance wouldn't even cover it! I could NOT convince that man that I was poor. So I no longer trust him to make decisions for me, because we don't see eye-to-eye about what's important.
1	I trust my physician because she is very caring, knowledgeable, and understanding. She works with what my medical plan covers and anything I pay out of pocket which takes a lot of stress off my mind. I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off and I'm getting the services required.
-1	I think my doctor is smart and knows what they are doing.
-1	Sometimes I feel my appointments with my primary care doctor are rushed. There have also been times when my doctor wasn't very informative on treatment options when I have been sick. Because of this I feel I have to do a lot of independent research when I am sick or am given a diagnosis. 
-1	Although I don't have a certain doctor that I go to, I trust most doctors in general. Of course, there are bad ones that don't do everything that they are supposed to, or that don't do their job as they are supposed to, but I do trust most doctors in general to do their jobs properly.
-1	For the most part, I trust my doctor and her looking out for my best interests. I tend to not fully trust anyone and always think there's a possibility for alterior motives, but for the most part, I trust my doctor's advice.
-1	I feel like doctors  have to ear n your trust.  My doctor has not done that as of yet.  Sometimes he speaks to me in a very condescending manner and I just don't like that.  I also feel like he doesn't ask me alot of questions, and just gives me a diagnosis without getting to the meat and potatoes.
1	I see a DO rather than an MD. I really like how current he is on  new issues in medicine. He also is knowledgeable on the body and prefers to prescribe stretches, and lifestyle changes than medication. I like that he is very thorough and really cares for our family.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is clearly very knowledgeable, and also comes across as confident and direct, which I find reassuring. She is very no-nonsense, which I really appreciate. She is thorough when it comes to tests and exams and I have no reason to believe she has ever misled me with regards to treatment options or anything else.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician. Regarding doctors in general, I don't trust them because a lot of them don't seem to care about you as a person, they only look at you as an insurance claim or a cash cow they can keep milking by adding on more tests or prescribing drugs just to get the most money they can from your insurance company or medicaid/medicare.
-1	I feel like all they want to do is make the most money they can so they refer things for no reasons like procedures and medicine
-1	I trust my physicians because he is generally very thorough in our exchanges. He takes the  time to listen to my concerns and will provide me valid answers and options for my treatments.
-1	My experience with doctors has always been that they tend to treat or guess rather than actually putting thought into the process of healthcare. 
1	I trust my physician or doctor because I feel safe with them. 
1	I've seen him several times and he is always candid and straightforward with his opinion, reasons and concerns. I've never had a reason to second guess anything he has told me.
-1	Doctors don't really have enough time to deal with all the solutions that might benefit a patient, so I think the routinize things in a way that I don't trust entirely. For the most part, I do trust their recommendations are genuine and effective, though. 
-1	I have had more than one doctor.  The last one I have I get more information, but am not sure about advice.
-1	I trust my doctor most of the time. Sometimes I wish she would show a little more compassion but she is a very busy doctor so I overlook it. There are times I wish she would consider different treatments or at least give a referral. All together I do trust her opinion and judgement. 
1	I feel a general trust in doctors because hopefully they are doing their job to help people. 
-1	They have years of school and  experence  
-1	For the most part I think my doctors have been thorough and did what was best for me.  I think that many times they are over scheduled and are not able to spend enough time with each patient but I think they do what they can.
1	I've been coming to my doctor for a very long time. Over that time, there has been a lot of trust built and that's hard to come by. She always seems to be concerned about the stability of my health.
1	I trust my doctor because she always makes a point to bond with me and explain her reasoning. I've also been going to the same doctor for four years now and they are completely involved in my family. 
-1	"He is generally there to ""process"" people and get his numbers. If I ask for a prescription for a given issue, he is very willing to write it and move on. Has has some misdiagnoses."
1	I trust my doctor because they are honest. If I didn't trust them I would get a doctor I do trust.  Trust in your doctor is very importan . 
1	I simply trust them because I know that they are a professiol. Usually the person I go to has been in the area for years and is well known by the community. So I assume if they had a history of doing the wrong thing then people would have said something about it. 
1	I don't have much experience interacting with my physician because I'm pretty healthy.
1	My doctor has always taken the time to listen to my concerns and follow up with appropriate treatments/testing.  This has not always been the case so I can definitely see the difference in what a good doctor and bad doctor are.
1	I believe that for the most part, doctors have their patient's best interests in mind. I think it is somewhat uncommon for doctors to be more concerned about what is best or more convenient for themselves.
-1	They are in it for the money, prescribing medications instead of recommending more tural vitamins, minerals, foods for diseases. 
-1	I have limited experience with my current primary care doctor but she seems to be pretty thorough and honest.
-1	I trust doctors in general because most of them are probably good people. I believe they chose to be doctors to take of and help people. However, there are still unethical and potentially dangerous doctors out there. So, I think it is always important to trust your gut when you get the feeling that something isn't right and seek out a second opinion.
-1	My doctor does not always tell me all options available. Sometimes this is due to his time constraints. In general I trust him and his opinions.
1	I trust my doctor because she has been my primary care physician for many years. She has never steered me wrong. I have confidence in her abilities because even though she has been with me for many years, she has been a doctor many years before that. She is very knowledgeable and she is very kind. We know each other well and I trust her completely. I feel very comfortable with her. 
1	I trust my doctor because he has training and experience. I will question him if I have doubts, and do some of my own research, but I think my doctor is my best resource. 
1	I've had the same doctor for a very long time and she's always put in the time to see me and help me feel better no matter what's wrong.
1	i trust them because they are professiols
-1	I have had things happen in the past-(wrong doses prescribed, not listening to serious concerns and misdiagnosis that cost me a lot of heartaches and physical consequences- as a result I am very apprehensive in trusting fully what any doctor tells me. I question everything a doctor tells me and I research my issues. 
-1	I trust the information provided by my doctor. She is very thorough and ensures I do not leave with questions. I sometimes wonder if she doesn't provide me with all the information regarding my health if she deems it irrelevant. I do find myself frustrated with waiting as that does make me seem as it's more to accommodate the doctor vs. the patient. 
1	I have a high trust with my primary care physician because I have been going to the same physician for a long time. If there is something I do not understand I can ask for more clarity on the matter. Long term relation with my physician have helped me secure my trust in all the things my physician say, and I can tell that my physician cares deeply about me.
-1	She just appears very genuine. I don't get the slightest hint of anything off about her. I've been seeing her for a few years now, and on more than one occasion, even when she's clearly running behind schedule, she shows no rush to be through with me. She feels like an ally.
-1	My primary care physician does a good job of looking at all the possible treatment options, and talking with me in detail about which option would work best for me.  I think it would be great if they incorporated a more holistic approach to my care and not just looking at the medication treatments.  
-1	My doctor tends to be really straightforward without sugarcoating anything. If I have something wrong with me, then he just says it and tells me how to treat it. 
-1	I think it varies from doctor to doctor. I had one doctor whom was vary vague with me. While I liked her and trusted her, she really didn't give me any additiol info when I was diagnosed with a heart murmur. She knew I was a smoker but didn't suggest any lifestyle changes. My second doctor told me that smoking would make it worse and I should have quit a long time ago. So it's really hard to trust doctors when one will say something and another won't mention other important information that you might want to be aware of.
1	I have a lot of trust in my doctor because he is a close family friend, but I sometimes notice that some of the things he says are a little bit for his convenience.
1	I trust them because I've known them a while and they listen to me.
-1	I have been with my doctor for a number of years, and he has always been able to take care of my problems. I think I could better answer this question in regards to why I don't trust him. Sometimes, I read and learn about treatment options, but when I discuss them with the doctor, he generally doesn't give them any merit- I am not talking about radical treatment options which have no backing in the scientific community. However, as I think about this now, I realize that he ought to have my full trust, as he is lettered in medicine and has never done wrong by me. I am virtually experimenting when I offer my input for treatment options. I don't have as much certainty as he does- I could say that I am just trying to see if I could find a solution on my own, sort of like a test of my ego.
-1	 they see a lot more people today and do not develop the rapport they once had
-1	DOCTORS THESE DAYS ARE OFTEN NOT SUFFICIENTLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THEY TREAT. THEY DO NOT LISTEN OR HAVE AN INTEREST IN LISTENING TO PATIENTS. THEY HAVE 15 MINUTES TO SEE YOU. LESS IF THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. IF YOU TRY TO ASK A QUESTION THEY ARE IMPATIENT AND TELL YOU THEY DO NOT HAVE TIME. THEY HAVE A SUPERIOR AND JUDGEMENTAL ATTITUDE. THEY ARE OFTEN FLAT OUT RUDE. THEY ALSO BILL FOR THINGS THEY HAVE NOT DONE AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT REASOBLE.
1	I HAVE CHANGED DOCTORS RECENTLY. HOWEVER, THE PAST FEW MONTHS FOLLOWING HER ADVICE, I HAVE LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE AND FELT BETTER. ALSO, MY HUSBAND HAS LOST WEIGHT AND HIS DIABETES IS IMPROVING. SO FAR, I THINK I HAVE RECEIVED GOOD ADVICE.
-1	Although I do trust her, there are times that she is so busy, that she barely has time for me. I don't ask questions or tell everything either.
-1	I believe my doctor has no reason to lie to me unless it happens to do with trying to sell me a pill of some sort. That does not work for me because I can't swallow pills, so the subject usually moves to altertives or something I can do myself, at home,  to help the problem. I think a doctor can tell who is serious in trying to get well and who just wants attention and/or a prescription of a magic pill to get them well. I am willing to do the work to get myself well, so I get along fine with any doctor I see.
1	My doctor is open and listens to all of my questions and answers them in ways I understand
-1	I trust them, but there are times when they rush things and I'm left wondering if they were caring about me at all.
1	I trust my doctor because she tells me things I don't want to hear. She will also tell me altertive methods to getting better and not just shoving pills down my throat.
-1	In general i trust my physician. It's not because I don't trust her that I don't tell her everything, it's because I worry about her thinking I'm being silly and a waste of time.
1	I trust my physician because when i have any doubt he is always there to help me and understand any difficulty that i am going through. H e tells me things more in a friendly way than in a doctor type of serious situation. I completely put all my trust in him and he has given me alot of reasons to trust him.
-1	Doctors don't always give the best advice and many times make the wrong diagnosis. People can fix issues on their own, such as reversing heart disease and such through diet but doctors refuse to accept that despite it being proven countless times. So for reasons such as that, I don't trust doctors in general to do what is best for someone. 
-1	I don't currently have a primary care physician at the moment, though I have had a few over the years. I've generally had good experiences, but I also take modern medicine on the whole with a grain of salt. The doctors themselves I trust and believe to be good people doing what they feel is in my best interest. But I think the profession on a whole is quicker to treat symptoms than address causes, and put figurative band-aids on things by prescribing pharmaceuticals to address most things. I've persolly solved some of my own medical issues through my own research and by simply applying that knowledge to take better care of myself through nutrition and exercise. I don't think those basic things are offered up and encouraged often enough - but that may be just as much a reflection on our quick-fix society itself who wants a fast and easy way out of a problem rather than putting work in themselves. So in that case doctors are often doing what their customers want.
-1	"I am, in fact, in the middle of changing primary care doctors due to a lack of trust and proper ""fit"" persolity wise. She was too authoritarian and didn't listen, brushing off many of my concerns. In general, I find most doctors to be caring, thoughtful individuals, though often very busy. I trust them until they give me a reason for pause, or concern."
1	Me and my wife have the same doctor now for 15 years.She is a wonderful caring and nice person.We trust her with everything.
-1	I guess I trust him because of familiarity. At first I didn't trust him 100% but after 15 visits or so I've come to rely on his advice since I've seen my health (asthma specifically) has gotten better. Although he's as stoic now as he was on my first visit. Hard man to read. 
-1	I have had the same physician for more than 30 years. Also he is the same physician for all my family members.
1	My doctor takes all the time I need him to take to explain everything I want or need to know in great detail.  He respects the fact that I do not like taking pills, and is willing to work with me on lowering my dosages to the minimum effective dose for my condition.  He explains all my options thoroughly, and does not let me leave the office until he is sure I understand them.  He will also squeeze me in immediately if there is a sudden worsening of my condition.  
1	My doctor has always spent the time with me that I need to help me with any issues I have.   I am comfortable with my doctor and his ability to help me.
-1	In general I trust doctors and the science that backs their field. That being said they are human, and for any serious diagnosis I would want an independent second opinion.
1	He has never given me a reason to not trust him, he always explains things in ways i can understand, and usually lets me choose my own options, though he will always let me know what he recommends and why.  He is also very understanding of my issue with when i go to him, i usually try to ask and talk about all my issues at once, which can make meetings last longer then they should.
-1	I have actually gone to my doctor self diagnosed, only to have him tell my I was wrong, but later realize I was correct. I've also caught him being dishonest by neglecting to tell about specific treatment options, and even explaining options incorrectly.
-1	I have a medical condition that has been ongoing for years. The last time I went to visit the doctor, I asked her about what procedures I should do for that issue. She said to me that she hadn't seen that in my chart, went and checked, and seemed surprised that I had that condition. I have been seeing her the whole time. Then when she gave me instructions about procedures and what I should do next, she also gave me the last set of test results from the past year, and there was some disturbing results that should have been followed up on at the time. Needless to say, we followed up on them then but it could have been catastrophic for me if the results turned negative, which thankfully they didn't.
1	I trust my doctor as he spends all the time I need at every appointment answering questions and explaining all options, side effects and testing results.
1	He seems to know what he is talking about so I trust him.
-1	I have lost over 90% of my sense of smell due to a deviated septum I was born with and has gotten continually worse. It has changed how my voice sounds, makes it difficult to breathe through my nose at times, gives me sinus headaches and makes it hard to chew. After get a cat scan I was told by my doctor it was nothing more than allergies and prescribed flowze. Lost all my trust only adding to the multiple reoccurrences of bad doctor stories I've had.
-1	My doctor is great.  He doesn't talk down to me because of my GAD and PTSD, and he listens to me.  He has absolutely no problem admitting that he doesn't know everything, and refers me to a specialist for things he feels are out of his field of knowledge.  He's also got common sense.
1	Some doctors are not transparent and they just tell you things without giving you the opportunity to ask them questions and address your concerns. The doctor encourages me to ask questions and tries to clarify my concerns.
1	I have done a lot of research on my current doctors and have taken the necessary steps to be sure that I am being seen by competent and caring individuals. I trust their opinion and knowledge with regards to my healthcare. When I am seen by them I feel welcome and encouraged to speak about my concerns rather than rushed and ignored. 
-1	I mostly trust my primary provider. I feel that she has my best interests in mind and provides good care. However, I wouldn't fully trust any single human with serious health decisions. I have a need to research things myself, and even though I know my doctor is a good one, she's human, and we all make mistakes. 
-1	I don't get to go to the best Dr.s My insurance sends me to a clinic. The Haitian men Dr.'s there speak English as a second language. I do not trust them. 
-1	While doctors are educated in their field, they are still human and are capable of making mistakes. Some of them are more interested in their wallet than in you. Some of them have varying degrees of experience. Some of them are just better at specific conditions and not so good at others. Doctors are still just people and suffer the faults of people.
1	I have noticed that she's gone above and beyond when she didn't have to so that makes me very comfortable with her. She also actually listens to what I have to say too instead of brushing me off.
-1	My doctor is set in her old ways. She insists putting me on blood pressure medicine with a diuretic is excellent, but in reality it made me sick,lethargic,dehydrated, and I fainted constantly. In fact, it made my blood pressure too low. Now once again my doctor wants to put me back on the diuretic. She doesn't care what it did to me the last time. I tried to explain to her how it made me feel the last time but she doesn't seem to listen. Also, I have hypothyroidism. It took them 4 years before they took me off synthetic thyroid and put me on NDT thyroid. I had to put my foot down to filly get her to switch me. I'm doing a lot better now I'm on NDT thyroid.
-1	My primary care is a nurse practioner. I don't feel she has the qualifications to deal with the many serious issues I have. Her office is packed, the time with her is very short and she does not answer my most pressing questions.
1	I HAVE HAD A LONG EXPERIENCE WITH MY CURRENT DOCTOR, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A GOOD RAPPORT. WE SPEAK EASILY, FRANKLY, AND OPENLY. I FEEL THAT I CAN TRUST HIM GIVEN OUR HISTORY AND HIS NON-JUDGMNENTAL ATTITUDE AND FRIENDLY TURE. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY REASON TO NOT TRUST HIM, AND FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH ALL OF HIS REASONS FOR DOING THINGS, HIS EXPLATIONS OF THINGS, AND CONDUCT IN GENERAL. HE NEVER PRETENDS TO KNOW MORE THAN HE DOES, ALWAYS LISTENS, AND I UNDERSTAND OUR INTERACTIONS, MOTIVES, AND COMMUNICATIONS TOTALLY.
-1	I trust my primary doctor because he have treated my diseases for a few years without any significant errors. He treated nicely and friendly. He gave me a lot advice and suggestions on my health condition.  
-1	I think Dr offices have become more of an assembly line, long waits and I just think sometimes they are so rushed patients do not get enough time to get all their questions answered and time to gather information about medications and treatment options in depth.
-1	My physician is okay, she seems scattered at times and has made mistakes in appointment times or reading records. But nothing that was critical was overlooked. She is convenient, a female, and although an MD believes in altertives.
-1	"I have little faith in the medical system as a whole simply based on what I have persolly experienced as a person with arthritis and chronic pain, and based on what people I know with other chronic conditions have experienced generally.  In the past, my condition has been ""written off"" as being caused by things I know it is not caused by (for example, the last time I went to a rheumatologist, I them I have had joint pain for most of my life, and their response was it is the insomnia I have only just recently been plagued with that is causing it when for 90% of my life I had a very healthy sleep schedule), thus preventing me from getting proper treatment and having to jump through hoops to ""disprove"" what I already know.  I generally feel doctors do not trust my own knowledge on my health, and therefore I am not totally trusting of them or their motivations.  "
-1	My primary care physicians does her best, but is still just one woman. She does tend to rush, and if what she recommended could drastically alter something going on in my life, I would prefer a second opinion. OR at least a long talk about why she believes this instance/course of action to be the case. People make mistakes, I wouldn't want to be hurt by such an accident.
1	He asks what is bothering me and makes different appointments for different medical problems that I might need to do to better my health.
1	Trust but verify, using the popular vercular: Never buy a pig in a poke!
-1	I don't believe my doctor would deliberately lie to me or mislead me but I do think that at times it just isn't convenient for him to answer my questions or explain things thoroughly to me - that doesn't inspire trust.
1	I generally trust doctors because it is in their interest to make people feel better, and they have the training to do that. I think it takes a lot of caring for others to be a doctor and most physicians have the patient's best interests at heart. Most of them are proud of what they do and want to do well. 
-1	I generally trust doctors to provide a reasobly high level of care with persol integrity. However, I know that as in any field, there are fincial, administrative, and moral/ethical pressures weighing on these professiols. I am sure that sometimes they feel that they must go against their preferred ways of behaving and communicating with patients.
-1	I have learned over the years to trust in doctor's opinions as they have never let me down in a serious way. Sometimes they tend to be hurried and most do not like to do a lot of chit chatting but the advice seems to be very good. They have the experience in these areas so I usually go with whatever they think.
-1	My doctor acts like a know it all.  It seems like they are in a rush most of the time.  They could be more thoughtful and considerate.
1	I trust my PHC because diagnosis and prescribed medicines have worked in the past.
-1	The physician I had been seeing for the last several years left the area, and I only recently saw a new doctor. I have usually had female doctors in the past, but my new doctor is male. He is also my husband's doctor, and my husband likes him, so I decided to give him a try. I've only seen him once, but we got along very well. He took his time, asked questions and patiently allowed me to ask any questions I had. I liked him but it may take time for me to trust him as much as I did my former physician.
-1	She listens to me. Also I have other family members that go to her and they have gotten wonderful care from her also
-1	The few doctors I had some don't seem to interested. They just ask for symptoms then just prescribe medicine. They feel like their disinterest. Just write a prescription and your done.
1	I am on a persol level with my doc. She knows who I am and what I have been through in life and will get right down to the nuts and bolts of my health so we can work on things together
1	I trust him. He always runs extra tests and checks on me clearly.
1	I feel my doctor has no reason but to tell me the truth.  I feel they want the best for me.
1	I am the type of person that will trust a person until they give me a reason to not trust them.  Simply put, my physician has never given me a reason to not trust them. 
-1	I trust my Doctor because they've had many years of experience. I trust them because I know nothing in comparison to them. They took an oath to be a Doctor and I have to rely on that for their honesty.
-1	Through my husbands insurance (which I have no choice over) I just feel like this set seems not to care to much about the patients.  They seem not to want to listen to me.  For example: when my back was hurt and I could barely walk.  They did an x-ray but they did not see anything on it.  They acted like it was all in my head and that my pain was not real.  I could barely walk for over a month.  I lost trust in my doctors.
-1	My health is more important to me than it is to him.  I have read the results of the 8 year study by Arizo University on chelation.  My physician who offers chelation has not read the results of the study.  Absolute trust would mean that a second opinion is never justified.  My wife just had a bacteria eat away some of her bone below her lower jaw tooth.  Many periodontists would still treat this using bone grafts, while a better treatment using a laser is available.  We selected a periodontist that uses the laser approach.
-1	I trust my physician due to feedback from others I know who also use him. I never see a doctor I have not researched about because there are many out there that should not be practicing medicine. 
-1	My feelings are at a neutral state with my doctor. I feel this way because I believe that  physicians give you some truth but they can also throw in some lies as well. They are money-oriented so therefore they will do whatever they can to get you to spend more money.
1	i trust my physician because she does a great job of going over different options to my problems. she doesn't just say there is only one path of treatment. she looks at the whole picture.
1	I feel that my primary care physician always listens to me so this has helped build up my trust over the years.  I have always felt she has taken the best path for my medical needs.
-1	I feel that she wants the best for me however, trying different medications with no foreseeable outcome has been rough. She hears me but doesn't give me the drug in which would benefit me most. She has the best intentions in trying the safest method however it seems to be a bit stunted.
-1	I don't know my doctor all that well, but I believe her sincerity, and that she cares about how I am/feel.
-1	I feel like a lot of the time the doctor is just more interested in getting out of the room as quickly as possible. Anytime a question is asked, there is a quick, rushed response as if the question was annoying. Sometimes I even ask for addition tests and they are disregarded as not needed even though there have been times when the additiol test would have helped healing faster and was later proven to be so.
1	When I first went to him, I was leaving a Dr that did not take my problems seriously. This Dr. listened, without interruption, to what was happening, asked many questions. He knew exactly what needed to be done to find and fix the problem. He never rushes his patients and always listens to what you're saying.
-1	Doctors have the training and knowledge to make good decisions about my health.  If I feel that a doctor is not thorough or knowledgeable, I'll find another doctor.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel like she really listens to me. She is thorough and willing to explore different treatments in order to find the best one for me. I never feel like she is rushing me to move on to other patients.
-1	From what I've seen in the past several years, their too much emphasis on time magement and payroll correlation than on what's really beneficial for the patient. Issues are only addressed if it's convenient for the doctor and his/her staff. 
-1	sure about the situation
1	I like my PCP a lot. He is patient, thoughtful, and always listens. He is also very willing to utilize care that is more holistic. If I tell him that I'm confused or uncomfortable with a potential medication or treatment, he listens and is willing to explore and consider altertives.
1	I have known my primary doctor for about a year. In this year, I feel I can trust her to want what is best for me. She is very understanding and allows me to question her and even decide (e.g.) not to take a preventative medicine she has suggested. She makes me feel I am listened to and respected.
1	my doctor has always shown compassion and caring for me. im never rushed 
-1	"I have been with the same primary care doctor for over 10 years now. For me persolly, I have never had a misdiagnosis or a recommendation that required further visits (I don't feel that my doctor is out to cheat people out of their money). However, I do agree that sometimes he might ""wing it"" during my physical checkups. However, I do put trust in him because I know that if there as really something serious, he would let me know. "
-1	"I am a skeptical person in general.  I feel that for the most part I can trust my doctor, but sometimes people forget that doctors are people too.  I work in a hospital and have heard doctors and nurses talking ""off the record.""  These kind of experiences can really change the way a person views healthcare."
-1	I do trust my doctor to a large degree. While I am aware they are going to suggest drugs based on their own connections with certain companies.
1	I have had a long doctor/patient relationship with her and she always remembers the different reasons for which I have seen her and follows up. 
1	My doctor is up on medical issues and tries to explain everything in a patient-friendly way.  He always goes over all the options and helps me decide based on my needs and desires instead of ordering me to do something.  He is not tied to any particular treatment and is open to different approaches.  He is experienced and not just out of med school, which makes me feel a little more secure--he has seen a lot over the years which gives him a great perspective on what does and doesn't work.
-1	I think they probably had altruistic motives in becoming a doctor.  I think their professiolism dictates that they act properly.  I think they're probably well-educated and intelligent. 
-1	They work very hard throughout their lives to become doctors. I have much faith and trust in them to stick to their oath. 
-1	Like all professions not all doctors are perfect.
-1	I trust her, I suppose. I was afraid that I had cancer but I really just had canker sores and she gave me a prescription to get rid of them. But she is way too expensive to see!
-1	I trust that my doctor is not going to do anything overtly damaging regarding my care however I do not trust that he is willing to fully treat some medical issues of mine. I have severe anxiety and depression and my doctor is unwilling to treat this issues medically to my satisfaction which causes some quality of life issues for me that greatly reduce my functiolity as a person.
1	I trust her because she listens and discusses with me any health issues or concerns I may have. 
-1	I trust my care physician to gather the information he needs to make an informed decision. I trust them to be honest in their assessments and recommendations.  That said I don't always trust that they are giving me every reasoble option and sometimes feel I need to prod for altertives (real Western medicine altertives, not to be confused with altertive-medicine).  Sometimes with prescription recommendations I get concerned over whether I can trust my care physician due shady pharma-reps.
-1	I respect and trust in the ability, expertise and intentions of my physician. However, he is still just a person, and no one is infallible.
-1	"As recently as TODAY, May 4, 2017, the US Congress is voting on repealing ""Obama-care"". This whole concept of the free market guiding healthcare is absurd. The US is long overdue to adopting tiolized health. I hate to use this worn out saying but, if the US can put men on the Moon, and now spacecraft to Mars and Pluto, then the US can easily have basic healthcare to cover its' citizens. Doctors are hindered by insurance companies and people have ridiculous expectations as to what healthcare should be."
-1	I feel like there are too many profit based motivating factors with doctors in America that directly work against my best interest. I hear all the time about doctors strongly recommending expensive tests that prove to be unneeded in the eyes of a second opinion. 
-1	He takes time with me, but I think he probably does not try very hard (probably due to dealing with people).  He does not seem to try to find the cause, just treat the symptoms.  I don't distrust him, I just trust my research more.
-1	My doctor is a bit snobbish, so I sometimes worry that he thinks so highly of his opinions that he fails to consider other points of view that might actually be valid. He has a lot of pride because of his immense experience and impressive education. But perhaps he has too much pride. 
-1	I don't really have a lot of trust in the medical decisions of doctors. There is almost always pressure to diagnose and get the next patient in as quickly as possible. If I had serious concerns that I wasn't sure of I would get a second opinion. Just a few days ago I read about a women who was told her breast cancer was only cysts and the cancer spread throughout her body in the year after her diagnosis, and she wishes she had got a second opinion. The cancer is termil for her and she is only in her early 30's. 
1	It has always been a very open and honest type of discussion between us. Nothing ever hidden with facts and consequences always fully disclosed.  
-1	Icompletly trust my primary care physician because I have been a patents of his for years 
1	I trust them because they have always been straightforward with me. There is  no reason to question them so I don't.
1	My PCP was researched well enough and my persol interactions have been very professiol. I can find no reasons so far o distrust my PCP, and if I did I would not see this person for anything.
-1	I trust my doctor because I trust my hospital. My hospital has a really good reputation. I have been them for years.
-1	After speaking with several primary care physicians, I have concluded that this group generally cares deeply about patients and acts in their best interests. I believe doctors make mistakes or seem cold sometimes because of work pressure and empathy fatigue.
1	I trust my doctor because she has given my no reason not to trust her.  She explains her thought process when it comes to diagnosing any issues I am having and she explains the pros and cons of various treatment options.  If she makes a recommendation for a certain course of action she explains why.  I guess maybe a primarily trust my doctor because she is transparent.
-1	I just feel like when I visit my doctor or doctors, that I am just another person for them to get  through. I feel that they are always in a rush to get in and out. Its not always because they have other people to see, sometimes it just feels like they are ready to take a break and they rush just to get out. 
1	I trust my doctor to give me the medical knowledge I need to mage my life the correct way.  I've never had a doctor who is so willing and able to take the time to listen.  They block out time for each patient.
1	It's simply in their best interest to do their job to the best of their abilities. There's little to gain and a lot to risk if they do otherwise. Of course they're humans so they're not perfect and things happen sometimes.
-1	I think most doctors are out to help you. There are some money hungry ones who just want to earn as much as possible and do not care much about you, but all in all, I think most doctors generally care about their patients. 
-1	"I trust my physician because he is a trained and qualified professiol. Even if he ""cares more about what is convenient for him than about my medical needs"", I can not know about it. He would not tell me. I can only trust him."
-1	I trust my doctor in a very basic sense. I feel that doctors don't take the time necessary to thoroughly go over medical issues with patients. They are quick to prescribe medications without considering the harm it can do with the side effects. I try to keep up with my own needs and search for medical information to better help me. I feel that I'm the best to look out for myself.
1	My primary care physician has been giving me care for many years. He is a family friend and has always been competent and attentive to my needs as a patient. 
1	I have gone to him a few times in the past couple years.  He has always been diligent and has diagnosed my conditions correctly each time.  He had to do a couple small procedures which went great.  I have gotten better each time and have had no complications when recovering.  He has done a fantastic job.  Takes the time to make sure he knows what is wrong and goes over everything I need to know and answers my questions.
1	I've gone to the same doctor for the past 20 years so I have a decent relationship with him. While I don't go to the doctor often, I know if I do need to that he'll be honest and up front with me. He knows me and is interested in helping me.
-1	In the end I feel neutral towards doctors. I know there are some that are good but I have had mixed experiences with them. Whether it be misdiagnosis, bad bedside manner, over charging, etc. So it is hard to feel anything but neutral towards them. But you have to have enough blind faith in them to get the job done because that is what they are educated in. 
1	I have been seeing this doctor for years and I trust his judgement. I have never had any issues or problems with him that would make me doubt his ability or honesty. I am comfortable with him as well.
1	Other members of my family see the same primary care physician as me, and she noticed a serious medical issue affecting my mother before any other doctor.
1	I believe my doctor is competent and knowledgable.  She has specialized training, so I often defer to her.  She is always professiol, and I trust the hospital she works for.  She is a good person who genuinely seems interested in promoting my health and well being.
-1	My doctor has been honest with me since I've been with her. 
1	I've only been seeing my doctor for about 6 months, but so far he has helped my take care of my health needs by referring me to specialists and prescribing medication which has helped me. He has also ordered tests to make sure nothing is wrong with me. He talks to me like a person and not just a patient, he understands my needs an listens to what I have to say.
1	I have a lot of trust in my primary care doctor. My first meeting with her was a little awkward because it seemed like she was a little distracted and it took a little time for that feeling to go away. Subsequent appointments have been much more relaxed and she has been pretty easy to talk to. She always gives thorough explations and goes over my lab results with me, paying closer attention to anything that has changed since my last appointment. I feel very comfortable asking her questions. She gives me time to ask questions and give me good answers. She also hasn't hesitated to give me referrals to specialists when that has been needed. Overall I find her to be very helpful and knowledgeable.
1	I have always had very good doctors and fully trust there opinions. Both of my parents are doctors and I think that influences my opinions of doctors. I trust my parents so I trust other doctors too. I have never had reason to not trust my doctors.
1	I trust my doctors because they've always been honest with me.
-1	some times i can trust doctors but not all the time some times doctors advice go wrong because if we cant explain our doctprs how he can guide us. many times we never know our situation so how can we trust them in all casses.
-1	I feel my doctor is rather caring about my medical needs. He tries his best to cover all bases when an issue comes about to elimite any possibilities of what the issue can be causing any underlying illness.
1	I have been going to this same doctor for several years; I feel she knows me well. She considers my emotiol status as well as my physical status to determine the best course of treatment for me.
1	My doctor says a good businessman can never be a good doctor and a good doctor cannot be a good businessman. My doctor has a simple practice in which he spends considerable time with each patient.
-1	I don't have one but the ones I had in the past do not fit the category of fully trusted.  
1	Been my doctor for a long time. Family and friends have gone to him for 15+ years. He is very smart and knowledgeable. He has never told me anything that was wrong or iccurate. He is also the head doctor for the hospital next to his practice. 
-1	I do trust them, but I want to be informed as it is my body, and I want to agree with everything that is done to it, or put a stop if I am not. 
-1	I feel that my PCF is a kind person and has intentions to help yet does not want to realty invest in the thought and process needed to truly uncover my medical issues. Specifically my secondary infertility issues. I have seen her twice and she can't seem to ever move things along in the process and sort it out. I am extremely discouraged by her lack of urgency.  
-1	There hasn't be a major illness I've had to deal with in my life or my family members life.
-1	I think there is a mindset is medicine today that you need to get the patient in and out quickly. You have to consider what insurance will pay for when running tests. Doctors rarely get to know you well enough to have a complete understanding of your life and finding out what underlying causes may be contributing to what's wrong with you.
1	I think for the most part doctors are persoble and want to help their patients. Doctors are generally fairly nice to their patients and want to find the best care practice for them.
-1	i always follow  our   family doctor because he is updated the lated treatment and medicines etc
-1	In regard's to doctor's in general, I have a lack of trust of doctor's for the reason that I have had multiple friend's and loved one's die from cancer. Cancer is a business in this country and patient's with cancer are not told the complete truth when it comes to treating cancer.
1	I trust my doctor because he if very thorough and explains things well. He is very caring and takes time out at the beginning of my visit to ask about my life and family. He never rushes his patients and takes a good amount of time with them.
-1	I feel that today doctors are just trying not to get sued. So they go with the safest least liable option always and what is convent cause the most patients they see means the most money for them. 
-1	My primary care physician does not care to fully diagnose me or most of his patients for that matter. He will do a series of tests or ask questions to get a general idea of what may be wrong, and will then prescribe antibiotics, painkillers, etc. without even confirming I actually need the medicine.
1	I have used the same clinic for 20 years and even though there have been times when they have had to try different treatments to figure out what works I have always felt that they have had my best interest in mind. Sometimes they will start with a treatment that cost the least in order to help me out fincially so that I do not have to spend excess money on test and prescriptions. They have always seemed to be upfront and honest with me and other members of my family.
1	I have never had any problems with my primary care physician. He is very experienced, wise , efficient and considerate. 
-1	Most doctors are in the pockets of big pharma, and too willing just to prescribe pills insteas of really looking into the problem.
1	I have been seeing him for a few years now. He is very thorough and he explains things to me very well when I have questions.
-1	My feeling towards them stem from a simply fact they only want there money. They provide only temporally fix to the issue just so you visit them again.
-1	Even though I have been going for at least 4 years, he often mistakes details about my conditions.  Also there is a language barrier communication problem.  He often prescribes medications which I find out later are harmful to take given some of my other conditions.  Unfortutely he is one of the only providers of my insurance carrier within my local area. Some of the problems I try to fix by writing out questions.  All in all, he will correct mistakes when I point them out.
-1	I trust my doctor's abilities and believe him to be honest. That being said, he has hundreds of patients and I'm not his friend or family member. I'm sure he does a great job, but why should I have complete trust in another person, just because they are my doctor. I don't have complete trust in my friends or family members, why should my doctor be any different? 
1	I have been a patient with my doctor for a while.  I have a good rapport with him.  He is thorough and follows up well.  He explains things well and answers any questions.  I trust his judgement and opinion.
1	MY PHYISICIAN IS GOD FEARING
-1	I would trust my primary car physician because it is a doctor that you regularly see and they know you and your health. they will know if something is wrong.
-1	I trust her because she is very professiol and through with everything. I have had her for several years and always glad to see her
1	My PCP is very mellow and always has a calm demeanor when engaging with me. He asks questions, is not judgmental when hearing my responses, and often makes suggestions about types of treatment even when I am always willing to go with whatever he recommends first. He has never rushed me during our meetings and I never felt that he saw me as just another patient or that he only saw his profession as just work; he seems to genuinely care about all his clients.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he will tell me that I'm doing something wrong. For example, my blood sugars were elevated and he told me directly that if I don't cut down my candy consumption, he will not see me as a patient anymore. He really cares for my health and not only that but explains things in real context.
1	With one notable exception, all the doctors that I have dealt with have been professiol, if a bit brusque. For the most part though, I've never gotten any bad advice or diagnosis, so I can't really complain about the bedside manner if they tend to do the job well.
1	she is my age and is very intelignet She is going throght some of the same issues I am and i just connect with her so much and trust her a lot she is  a contol freak but i love it anyway its good for me!!
1	I have never been given any reason not to trust my Doctor. He has always been able to provide the level of care that I expect and always answers my questions satisfactorily 
-1	My doctor seems sincere in his concern for my problems. He typically lays out what I need to know about my condition. He seems to make as much time for me as possible despite seeming like he is always busy.
-1	My doctor is very knowledgeable and thorough but I still feel more comfortable researching and getting second opinions. I don't trust anyone blindly. 
-1	There are two levels of trust I have for a person who is providing me a service. The trust of them as a person and the trust in the service they're providing. I trust must doctors as good people, but that doesn't mean they can't make mistakes or not be adequately informed about something. I may rely on a doctor, but that doesn't mean I trust him or her 100%.
1	Well I have known him for a long time and he is a good guy. He has never made a serious mistake in regards to helping me so I have great trust in him. He is also always quite nice. 
1	My doctor is very bright and because of this I have learned to trust her more and more.   It is my own persol distrust of people that made me not trust her 100% when I first starting going to her for care.
1	He is a board certified doctor. He has over 40 years experience in the field. 
1	I love my doctor!  I started seeing him several years ago because of some mild but confusing symptoms a GP thought needed special attention from an endocrinologist.  My mom had been seeing this doctor- Dr. Marcus- for some time before, so I had a good recommendation.  Dr. Marcus is very kind, very thorough, and an impression diagnostician.  He was able to guess at possible causes for what seemed like very strange symptoms and had me take various tests to confirm things and rrow down the possibilities.  He always answers all my questions and believes strongly in preventative medicine.
-1	I've had some pretty negative experiences with PCPs. Mostly due to the fact I smoke canbis and don't want medication. I and my new PCP find that canbis is much safer than being prescribed benzos and adderall my whole life.I trust her because it doesn't seem like she is pushing pills.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very knowledgeable and open.  She tells me why she makes a diagnosis.  She gives me time to ask questions.
1	In general my physician does a thorough job. Never seem to be in a rush or anything.
1	He's always been upfront with me and has given me multiple ways to go about a situation. 
1	I trust my doctor to treat what symptoms I have explained to him but sometimes I do not know how to explain my symptoms and will have to make a couple of trips to the doctor's office to get the correct diagnosis. 
1	My primary doctor is really good with patients and caring.  I think she has her patient's best interest in her heart.  She is careful not to give me too many pills of the same med.  For example she didn't want to give me any more of the pink blood pressure med, so she gave me a different one so I could have more of what I needed but not too much of one kind.  
1	I trust my primary care because I believe that he really cares for my well-being.
1	Overall, I trust my physician.  He is professiol, courteous, and always patient in answering my questions.  He is also prompt and ready, when I set an appointment with him.  He is also open-minded and discuss various options and aspects about my health.
-1	I have a friend who highly distrusts most doctors due to her extensive experience with them, and I trust her judgements about things. However, I have seen nothing strange from my own doctor. 
1	They always take their time, aren't rushed and explain to me any test results.  They have a conversation with me rather than just reporting things.  They have a genial and relaxed manner.
-1	She has been open about what I have and how to treat them.  She seems to listen me sincerely and in a warm, attentive manner.  It doesn't look like she's going through the motions of pretending to listen and care about me, not brushing me off if I have concerns or questions, and she is accommodating towards me.  She also provides articles that she has her nurse print out for me to take home and study about treatments and conditions.
-1	I think that I trust my doctor but always try to relay on my own instincts also. If there is something that I don't agree with or a treatment that I'm not sure about, I always wait and do my own research before jumping on board. 
-1	I have a good doctor.  In most things I trust what she says.  However I am responsible for my own care and if something seems risky it is best to get more information on it first.  I try to avoid taking a lot of medications that has bad side effects.  
1	I feel really good when I go to my doctor because I know that I can go in the office with a bunch of questions and I will have them all answered by the time I leave. I do not feel rushed, which is a huge deal for me. I think my doctor is thorough and very interested in my as a patient rather than just a number or someone written in his appointment book.
-1	My physician is extremely busy and usually seems preoccupied by something. I live in a rural area and patients are often seen by assistants and students rather than the physician. I am concerned that local practitioners are not up-to-date with current findings. Medicine here seems to consist of ibuprofen, Gatorade and Jesus.
1	My doctor listens to me and thinks about what to do often if he can not figure things out he will send me to a specialist.
-1	I know they get kickbacks for prescribing certain medications from companies and so they do in fact go out of their way to prescribe them when the might not be the best medication for the ailment or might even be harmful or just plain not need medication at all.  The can put their bottom line first which is never good for the patient.  This is not always the case of course but it happens way more than it should (of course it should never happen at all)
-1	"My primary care physician treats me with respect and understanding. He has great ""bedside manners"". He always listens to my needs, likes, and dislikes. "
-1	My husband and I moved to a new state and we didn't know anything about a Primary Care Physician, so we looked up who seemed to be best in this town.  The doctor was not taking on new patients, but there was another doctor in his practice.  This doctor who I just mentioned is awful!  He barely seems to care when I have an issue and need his help.  We are currently looking for a new PCP and are getting ideas from others who we trust.  Also, our previous PCP where we used to live was AMAZING!  She took her time, asked questions and made sure that I was cared for!  That just makes this new PCP so much worse!
-1	I don't see the doctor frequently enough for them to know me or my health, so it'd be difficult for them to be particularly insightful. They are usually behind and seem very rushed. They don't really examine me or ask questions. They'll look at the part pertinent to the complaint that prompted the visit and prescribe the treatment I would have guessed I needed before I went in.
1	My doctor always takes the time to explore the best treatment options. He explains them in a manner that is easy to understand, the benefits and downsides of procedures, and how I should go about certain routines. He does not make me feel pressured, does not force decisions on me, and makes sure I complete agree with something before moving forward. 
-1	I don't know them well; we're on insurance and don't get top notch treatment, and I don't know the doctors well enough to know how objective they are.
1	I went to many doctors before I chose mine. She is very caring and very careful and attentive. I can tell she really cares and has my best interest at heart. 
-1	My doctor asks questions to be sure he is treating me effectively.  He listens without judgment (as I have encountered with another doctor) and he doesn't make me feel belittled.  
-1	I feel that i am just a number and a pay check most of the time. I have had a few different pain issues over the last 10 years that no medicine, exercise or checkup has been able to diagnose, help, or fix. 
-1	I do not know my primary care doctor.  He was assigned to me with the ovomitdon'tcare tax went into effect.  I have yet to be able to get an appointment with him.  Every time I need a doctor, I call and, first, I am told he is not taking any new patients.  When I tell them he is my assigned doctor, I am told the first available appointment is 6 to 8 months away.  Thanks to the ovomitdon'tcare tax, the emergency room is my primary care doctor.  I answered the above questions based on the two times in the past 4 years I have had to go to the emergency room.
-1	I have only seen my physician twice.  I do not know him that well. I believe that he is capable, and that he really does want to keep me healthy as can be.  At the same time I think he is also out to make money, which may mean unnecessary tests.  I have to see him more to find out if I really trust him before I am willing to say that I do.
-1	I trust my physician because I don't feel like he's trying to oversell me to get more from my insurance. His answers and explations are quite clear. 
-1	I have been repeatedly misdiagnosed and handed pharmaceuticals that only mask the symptoms, not treat the problem. The doctors often seem so preoccupied with getting to their next patient that they don't care to take the time to properly resolve my ailment(s).
-1	Some are not very persoble and always feels like they're in a rush.  The ones who have practicing for too long appear to fit this description.  It seems they have loss interest in their profession.  
-1	I'm not very trusting of him, because he shows no concern or care for the problem he is treating. His main focus is money, and when he recommends a treatment or medication, I need to go and research it myself to make sure it is even a viable option. He has suggested some options that are laughable at best.
1	He is a good doctor and has always given me the best care possible. He is always willing to see me on a last minute basis if I need to come in. 
-1	Doctors don't really seem to take their time with the patients, that's usually the nurses job, so they don;t seem to care too much or the cherry-picked the patients they went to care about..and I generally don't just anyone that pushes unnecessary medications and treatment on their patients so they can line their pockets or an money for their hospital. 
1	Over the years, my doctor has proven that he knows my issues, listens to me carefully and always makes the right choices for me about my care and well being. I completely trust him because he has fixed many conditions and proactively treated me to prevent complications and other issues.
-1	I've found that physicians rarely agree which makes me nervous.  Often there are treatments or reseasrch on existing treatments that unengaged doctors are not aware of.
-1	He's very open and discusses the options with me openly.  He takes the time to answer my questions and provide me with options.  What he's done so far has worked well.
1	I trust them because I don't think they would want to hurt me.
-1	Most time my health got recover after seem them.  Their got high degree and was well  train. 
-1	I believe my doctor is competent and concerned. He is  nearing retirement himself and is pretty conventiol in his thinking. Old school is his approach and he doesn't stretch his thinking to consider newer treatment options. I think there is some value in looking at treatments like acupuncture, pain magement techniques beyond meds and holistic treatments. He pooh-poohs such ideas and finds fault with altertive practitioners. So I believe he has my best interest at heart but I think he stopped expanding his views on what options might be.
1	Their overall experience and rating among the community. I have not heard any bad statements about them.
-1	I don't like or trust her, she comes in looks at my chart prescribes another pill and walks out without hardly talking to me.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physicians. However, I've had recent experiences where the judgment was wrong and it's since made me somewhat skeptical. Two doctors prescribed an antibiotic that wasn't the right choice for treating an infection that almost led to serious consequences. I ended getting advice on a different medicine from family friends that ultimately led to a change in medication. While that experience has made me a little skeptical, I still generally trust doctors and think they have my best interests at heart.
-1	The body is meant to heal itself give the proper environment. I don't think taking chemicals and drugs are the way to make that happen. A lot of allopathic doctors don't want to acknowledge tural altertive treatments for their patients because they are being paid by big Pharma to solicit their drugs.
-1	Doctors are humans too and sometimes they might be limited or bound by other things like insurance, law (like they can't insist/suggest rather strongly on doing something when you don't want to) etc. Doctors can make mistake and that's why you always need your second opinion (or even third sometimes).
1	I trust my doctor because he has taken an oath to treat his patients as such. No doctor wants the reputaion of bad advice. They take this seriously to become esteemed physicians in the USA.
1	The doctor always takes their time when dealing with me and he doesn't feel likes he is in a hurry. He explains every thing that I need to know and ask me if I have any questions. He makes always has me come back for a check up when I get medicine that I need to see if it is working like it supposed to. I do trust my doctor to act on my interests.
1	i feel that i can trust my doctor because they always give me all the information that i could possibly need regarding treatment plans. they always treat me like a person. and whe also treats the whole person not just the issue and she doesn't just try to push pharmaceuticals on patients.
-1	"I don't care how much of an expert any doctor is, you should never trust any one completely. If you want to be healthy then you need to be actively involved, not just relying on someone else for all the answers. So, while I do have great confidence in my doctor, I don't take everything he says as ""the gospel"". I'm not at all above obtaining a second or even third opinion on an issue that I'm still not certain about. At the end of the day, I see it as a 50/50 relationship between doctors and myself...in order to achieve optimal results we both have to do our part."
-1	I like my new primary care doc very much but had really negative experiences with docs for way too long when I lived in another state. I am extremely cautious about all medications and am generally skeptical so I do my due diligence with all doctors and treatments they recommend. Right now I am dealing with some significant side effects from meds Rx'd in the late '90s and at that time absolutely no one told me the long term effects until a dentist did years afterward. So although I like my current pcp, I don't let down my guard and just accept everything they say as the complete story.
1	My doctor gives me no reason not to trust them. They always make time for me even when they are busy. The health of their patients is their number one priority. 
-1	"I never have total trust in anyone. I do ""mostly"" trust my primary care physician. He's a good man. I like him and he hasn't failed me. But that doesn't mean I don't look online to learn more about the things he tells me to do. I think that's a good thing to do and I don't consider it to be distrusting."
-1	the doctor i used to see,seemed to just want to prescribe more pills.even though the previous prescription didnt help.almost like he was guessing.
1	I usually have been healthy so my doctor visits are really short but If there is a problem my doctor is right on top of it and either gets me help or helps me right away by getting me an appointment with the appropriate physician.
1	I trust PCP because I have been a patient of his for over 10 years and I have never got the feeling he has ever been less than truthful with me. 
1	I trust my doctors because they help me get what I need for my kids and make sure they are healthy.
-1	I don't have complete trust in them.  They are so busy and trying so hard to get patients in and out I don't feel they totally are dedicated to providing me with the best care. 
-1	I like my doctor. She is very thorough in some areas but a little cavalier in others. I've had to come back twice because she said something wasn't important and it turned out to be more serious.
-1	been my family doctor for a long time not just me but friends and family and has alway do their job well
-1	I believe if a person has dedicated their life to healing people, then their suggestions would be valuable. Doctors have a lot invested (time/money) in their careers, I don't believe they would throw that investment away by providing false information to their patients.
1	I can relate to my doctor with some challenges that we've faced with our kids.  He is my son's doctor also (Family Practice). He gets it.  He is very professiol but could not hide his frustration with the school system for special needs children.  It really helped me to not feel alone especially with a doctor who is so understanding.  He has such a good bedside manner.  He really does care about my son and I as his patients.  I truly feel that he gives his best advice and I would trust him with any health concern that I have.
-1	I sometimes get the feeling the doctor is thinking more about what the insurance company will pay for rather that what is best.
-1	I trust my doctor and their diagnosis because I feel that they take the time to listen to my symptoms.  They also take time to evaluate my problem areas and run the necessary test to get a proper diagnosis.
-1	I trust my doctor and like her but I would not place complete trust in just one person.
-1	I have only seen my new primary care doctor once.  She was thorough in her questions and seemed very involved in my health care with recommendations for action and followup.  (Of interest, I had also seen a dermatologist about the same time... that physician/assistant seemed to actually be grossed out by me and responded with a lot of 'i really dont know what to tell you' and with no recommended treatment, and the clinic calling me with the wrong information only to have to call me back and tell me they made a mistake.)   Truly, I think going to the doctor is a crap shoot as to whether or not you will get someone that cares and doesn't treat you like someone they just need to move through the system.
1	I have been seeing this doctor for over 12 years and he has always been honest with me. I know my welfare is his top concern and he has always taken very good care of me and health issues that may arise.
1	Doctors are in a profession to heal people so I would think that in general that they would care about people. And I'd trust them because I think that they want to give the best treatment either due to common human decency or pride in one's profession to do the best work.
1	I have been with my primary care physician for a long period of time.  I have gained a healthy relationship and trust level with her. She has always giving me straight-forward advice and information. Whenever I've asked of side effects or possible outcomes she has always giving me the knowledge and confidence the positive effect greatly out way the negative.
-1	My doctor is pretty old, and set in his ways. I haven't been to him that many times since I moved here, but the times that I have been to him he was not that great. He seemed to rush through appointments, not spending much time with me. The information he gave me about an issue I had seemed pretty outdated, so I didn't take his advice on that. I have been meaning to find another primary caregiver, but I have not found the time to do it yet.
-1	I trust doctors I general to a degree, but often I think they are too overbooked to provide the attention most patients need or would like. I think they check symptoms, provide a diagnosis, and a treatment plan, but don't stick around to fully answer patients questions. I feel like a wait around for the doctor and then am rushed once they arrive.
-1	I am seeing my doctor for about 2 years.   I have to visit him every 4 weeks.  I distrust him because he doesn't answers the questions important me .  He just follows standard procedures every time.
1	My current PCP is much better than some I've had in the past. She is still hurried at times due to her full office visit schedule, but does her best to spend all the available time productively. She uses electronic communication when possible to continue conversations. This is a great improvement over past doctors who have listened to one or two symptoms, fired off a prescription, and hurried out.
1	I have had nothing but good experiences with my doctor. I always got the feeling that they really care about my health and what is best for me.
1	I trust my PC because I have been with him for years. He has no steered me wrong in all the years that I have known him.
-1	It seems that doctors can be too detached from their patients. They can sometimes forget patients are people not problems. 
1	My doctor tell me like it is ,he always tell me if im doing good are bad. and will call and see how im doing on the meds and to make sure im taking them the way he wants me to,
-1	Because she is thorough. I have been going from doctor to doctor before I find this one about medical problems. She was the only one that ordered tests and found my problem, which was a spil cord tumor.
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for years and it's obvious she's someone who truly cares about her patients and isn't just trying to make money or has been burned out by the job. More than once she has told me I might want to get a second opinion on something, which only increases my trust in her, for I much prefer that rather than a doctor who thinks they're always right.
1	I trust my doctor because he tells me what is happening without sugar coating it and I really appreciate that.
-1	I feel that physicians are highly qualified, of course more so that me, with the knowledge on medical issues. A PCP knows you and there is trust in that
-1	i trust my doctor because she takes time to give me as much information and advice as possible and does not shy away from my questions. Most importantly i find that doing want she advice's me actually helps and improves my health and happiness. She is also very kind and friendly.
1	My primary care doctor has given me no reason to distrust them, so I trust them. The Hippocratic Oath and medical licensing process are enough for me to trust them so long as they don't give me reason not to.
-1	I don't put too much trust in my doctor and I always research the pills he prescribes me. The reason for this is that I know a lot of big companies offer money to doctors so they prescribe their pills. I've seen few documentaries about it.
1	I have built up a great relationship with my doctor.  He allows me to contact him anytime and that makes a very persol relationship. 
-1	I really have little experience with my primary physician, one incident that stands out is her interpretation of an x-ray when I injured my ankle.  Upon viewing it she decided that there was no fracture, when we looked at it together I thought there looked to be a small fracture - she insisted that what I saw was a vein.  Later that evening I received a call from the radiologist who had reviewed my x-rays and he confirmed that there was a fracture.
1	I trust my doctor.  She never seems to be too busy or distracted to answer my questions.  She is not arrogant some some doctors I have know.  She asks a number of questions about how I am feeling.  She responds very persollybout any medical tests or lab work that I have done.
1	I don't have a PCP but I consider my OBGyn my most regular doctor. She is very smart, compassiote, and takes time to explain things to me clearly and give me advice and recommendations. I like her and trust her a lot. 
-1	Having known a number of doctors, I know that they are human like the rest of us, and make mistakes like the rest of us. I also know that many are over worked and will sometimes rush a patient through his appointment. Others seem to care more for their bank accounts than their patients. And still others are hemmed in by rules and regulations where they work to really provide honest opinion. So no, I don't completely trust any doctor.
-1	If you can't trust your Doctor, who can you trust? Even if you have some misgivings, it doesn't hurt to go get a second or even third opinion to allay some of your fears. It's not like Doctor's really have an incentive to lie to their own patients.
-1	I had to switch plans and have no history with this doctor. His entire knowledge of me is post traumatic times. He doesn't know when I was healthy enogh to do normal things but i look perfectly fine. I describe chronic issues that I think he considers whiny or malingering. He is only my doctor because I can access his location the easiest. He seems to be a doctor who prefers wealthy clients. That being said he did I.D. one condition that others had missed or advocated wild treatments for. That is the basis of the level of trust I DO have in him.
-1	I think that doctors are people to so they can make errors.  I trust my doctor but still use apps such as WebMD so I can get a sense of what might be the problem before going to the doctor.
-1	i just got a new primary physician not too long ago so i dont know him too well. overall i think some doctors, especially psychiatrists (my primary care doctor is a psychiatrist as well) do what is most convenient for themselves.
1	I trust my doctor because we have a great understanding. We are able to openly communicate and I can also ask any questions that I have. I am comfortable with my doctors. I usually only have doctors I use if I feel comfortable with them.
1	I have been with my doctor 3 years. He spends more than enough time going through things he thinks I should know. He answers my questions and will explain them where I can understand. I am able to email him with questions and he or his nurse will respond within a day. I receive updates on my health and tests. If he feels I need additiol tests done, he or his nurse will email or call me directly and explain why. 
1	I've been lucky enough to have a female doctor who understands my female health related issues.  I trust this person for the most part.  I understand that people are not perfect.  
1	My primary care physician has always had my best interest in mind.  He is always willing to answer my questions or concerns regardless of time.  I feel we have a good relationship and can count on him to provide the best health care. 
-1	I don't have a primary care right now but my specialist that treats me has always been trustworthy and is a very pleasant doctor to deal with.
1	My doctor is very persoble and doesn't talk down to you when he explains things. I have been lucky enough to not have any serious health issues in a long time, so I don't really have any reason to distrust him. He's never given me anything that I'd call bad advice, and he did give me some useful info about the tension headaches that I get now and then.
-1	I dont trust anyone to  be honest but i would hope doctors can be trusted to do what is in the best interest for my health 
1	He is caring and listens to what I have to say and how I feel.  He has had to pass all the testing done to become a Doctor and I don't think many untrustworthy people can pass all the testing that is done.  And he has taken an oath to do no harm all trustworthy people will adhere to any oath they take.
-1	Sometimes I trust her judgment other times,I do not. When it come to basic healthcare needs and minor ailments, I trust her. But major issues ,I do not. She is too quick to offer medicines, when I don't think it's a good idea. For example, she encouraged me to take pain medicine after a minor surgery and I refused.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never failed to solve my problems, he has always done his best to find the best solutions for me.
1	He examines me throughly and he runs test if needed.  I see a neurolgist due to a muscle disorder.  I have seen him for the past five years.  He has helped me with every aspect of this disease. Ran every test possible.  Also discussed my diagnosis with other neurologist.   He explains everything so I and my husband completely understand
-1	 I think my pcp is honest about the treatments she is aware of, but being a general practitioner she has to rely on specialists for certain conditions. I trust her decision in treatment unless I have found other information that needs to be discussed first.
1	I trust doctors because when I do have to see them they are always willing to answer all of my question. I have not had any issues with a doctor not spending enough time with me to makes sure I understand all the options available to me. I haven't had a doctor make a poor decision in my healthcare.
-1	because they always show me how much they care about me.They answer any questions I have and calm me.
-1	I have a primary care doctor.  Sometimes he does not seem as thorough as he could be in medical checkups.  Or he keeps wanting to send me to specialists for things he could do himself
-1	I don't fully trust my doctor because sometimes I feel he just wants to get me in and out and like he doesn't take much time asking me questions. I have to always tell him I have some questions so he answers them, rather than him asking me if I  have any questions or concerns.
-1	Majority doctors are trustworthy but i feel that some can't be bothered much. Just looking for there persol benefits. 
1	My doctor is very good at his job. He's also very honest with me. He works hard to help me stay healthy no matter how much work it is for him. That is why I trust him completely. 
-1	I think doctors are doing their best according to their training. Few have any training or knowledge about altertive or tural remedies. I wish they did. 
-1	 Again, I'm sure overall my doctor is a good physician,  but i feel like if my opinion does not match with his,  it becomes a battle of wills rather than a helpful exchange.  And of course I don't always get as much time as I would like with him,  but more with the nurse,  which makes it seem I funny really matter to him. 
-1	I don't put complete trust in no one. That goes for doctors too. Everybody are human, and their well-being, opinions and feelings can affect my medical treatment.
-1	anyone who has spoken to a health professiol knows they don't know everything. more often than not, they have no opinion about some new drug or treatment you are going to ask them about because in fact, you have done more recent research and are probably talking about something that has yet to be in widespread use. they will rely on things that have worked in the past and give the same answers they always give rather than go out of their way. speaking for myself, I don't have a regular routine so I may never see them again and they know it
1	I trust my doctor because he listens to and trust what I have to say about what is going on with me and doesn't try to tell me that I don't know myself and my own body. He talks to me and doesn't talk down to me and I believe he provides me all the information that he has about me and my condition.
1	My primary care physician takes the time to fully explain things to me, because she knows I want to know what I am taking. She never rushes me. She never tries to give me medicine that she knows won't work just because she is getting a kickback from the company. She doesn't over-medicate patients, only prescribing medicine if she really believes I need it. The only times I distrust her is when we disagree on a course of action. But the fact that she allows me to disagree, and talk it over with her makes me trust her more. 
1	I trust my doctor to provide me with the best care that is in the scope of his capability.  If I have a problem that is outside the scope of his responsibility I trust him to recommend another competent person.
-1	My experiences with doctors in general has been extremely negative.I once broke my ankle and the medical staff wanted to amputate.I refused treatment got a second opinion,had surgery and now walk fine.I had an infection from stepping on a il.The doctor said I would die if I didnt go through a horrific procedure.I refused treatment again and am still alive and healthy.I find most doctors lack the proper skills to diagnose and treat medical problems and have lost faith in the system.If I had trusted the doctors I dealt with in the past I would be in terrible shape.Im glad I was brave enough to stand up to these individuals who are trusted with peoples lives and health and find the proposition of consulting with a doctor as scary and unreliable.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a professiol and knows what he's talking about. He's never led me wrong so far.
1	I have a long relationship with my dr. She has earned my trust over the years and is normally very accurate in her diagnosis. Her explations and communication is top notch.
-1	At the moment I don't have a primary care physician so I am answering based on my previous doctors and the many doctors I have taken my parents to.  I believe all these doctors are trying to be responsible and do their best.  But primary care physicians are much too quick to prescribe a pill or CHANGE medication based on one reading in their office (especially for blood pressure). I honestly don't believe some doctors understand that 'more' or a drug is not necessarily better. I don't think doctors have much time (or take much time) to problem solve these days.  I think they often make sp judgements based on how much your symptom looks or sounds like somebody else's rather than assuming your symptom might be unique.
-1	I do not trust doctors in general because I believe they are trained to treat symptoms and not to get to the root of the problem, which, is often related to lifestyle or environment. I feel that sickness is very politically fraught, and that a doctor who was truly honoring the Hippocratic Oath would be obligated to be politically active and to advocate for improved environmental and economic conditions for the poor. Essentially, I feel that doctors and the medical establishment have a vested interest in maintaining people in a state if illness which requires ongoing treatment, rather than helping people become optimally healthy and teaching them how to improve and maintain their own health. 
-1	i think doctors have a general sense of care about the patient that over exceeds any kind of selfishness they may have 
-1	Sometimes I feel like the doctor doesn't believe me when I say I have a problem and she makes excuses as to why I couldn't have this issue because of my age etc. She doesn't even try to find out if there is an underlying issue and just thinks I want drugs which makes it hard for me to get treated for things. 
-1	I have always had a good experience with my PCP. She's about my age, which makes me sometimes wish that she had a bit more experience. She always listens to what I have to say although sometimes I feel like she is a bit rushed and just wants to wrap up the appointment. I've never had anything serious come up that she had to treat me for. 
1	My primary doctor has been my doctor for almost 10 years. She is the most caring, loving and thoughtful doctor I have encountered. 
-1	I have trust in my physician because they usually provide the right details for me and they thoroughly look into why I feel sick or whatever it may be. I trust their information and they rely to me the appropriate things I need to recover. Reason I put faith in them is because every time I went to them for help, they did their job well. 
-1	My doctor augmented my lexapro prescription with wellbutrin, and her knowledge to do that was very thorough in my opinion.
1	I have known my physician as a friend before he became my doctor. He was also a work associate before, so I know the type of doctor he is to other people, and I know for a fact he is good and cares about his patinets.
-1	While I don't currently have a primary care physician, in the past I have had pretty good doctors. For the most part, I trust them. However, I take some of what they prescribe or suggest with a little grain of salt. Doctors don't take all of the body's systems into account or preventative care when diagnosing or prescribing. They are taught medicine; not nutrition or other tural ways to heal.
1	most doctors that I've had has had the patients best interest in mind. Sometimes they may not seem too warm or attentive but most of the time they are in my experience. They make sure to go over everything thoroughly so they don't miss any symptoms I might be having and that I understand fully the information that they need to tell me.
-1	Some doctors don't listen to my needs and concerns.  Many doctors act as if they are impervious to my pain.  Doctors have a tendency not to explain enough about the diagnosis or why they picked the prescription drug they prescribed.
-1	While my doctor can sometimes seem a bit rushed and hurried to get out of the room I do trust him.  Even though he goes through the options a bit fast he does let me know all the options I have.  I know he has my best interest in mind. 
1	She works with me on a care plan whereas most physicians that I've ever seen in the past just assume they know whats best for you and you don't get a say in the matter.
-1	I trust him because he's been our family's primary care physician for a long time now. He is very helpful and courteous
1	My doctor is known for having excellent bedside manner. She explains medications thoroughly and answers every question fully.
-1	I believe most doctors a trustworthy and are in that profession because they truly want to help patients which equates to them being trustworthy.
1	I trust my doctor because he is the family doctor. My parents go to see him and he takes excellent care of them. Just with things ive seen him for, he has earned my trust.
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician. Doctors are very educated about health and they know much more than i do about whats going on inside of me, so if i am told by my doctor that  i need to take certain meds or do a certain thing to fix a problem i am having, i will absolutely do it.
-1	According to their knowledge and experience doctors will give you advice that is safer for one's health.
-1	Doctors are rushed, constrained by my insurance (or lack thereof) and are only human so I have a hard time trusting physicians. I usually put my trust in them though because I don't trust myself either. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is our family doctor and she always explain my condition to me and refer me to a specialty when I need one,she take good care of me and my whole family.  
1	Well if anyone knows me better than myself it would be my doctor hopefully so I yeah I have trust in my doctor
-1	Doctors in general do a great job. I have run into some that haven't and it makes me realize that I need to be careful with the doctor I visit. Most doctors are very considerate and will provide info, but some are more interested in seeing as many patients as possible.
1	They have always explained why they are going to use a certain kind of treatment and why it's best for me. I've never gotten the impression that they were out for their own gain. I have always been taken care of and wouldn't look to switch any time soon.
-1	Sometimes doctors assume I don't do or don't know (fill in blank) or they think of me in terms of a stereotypical type of person who is my age and gender. I like to know just about all the details and even the recent research done on whatever is bothering me, so it's lucky I don't have a condition. I trust myself more than a doctor, in general. They can't know more about me than I do.   
1	My primary care physician is a really responsible and nice person. Actually, the doctors I saw in general are responsible and nice. Based on how they treated me every time, very professiol and knowledgeable; how they spent time explaining things to me, answering my questions with great patience, even stupid questions sometimes. If I have problems with meds or my symptoms, I can call their offices and get quick responses. I will get a phone call reminding me about my upcoming treatments and appointments. I feel that I can completely trust them to take care of my health.
-1	I regularly trust doctors but i recognize that they sometimes might be biased towards recommending certain medicaments. I don't really pay attention to that though.
-1	I've never really had a reason not to trust my physician. They have always given me what I've needed to feel better and have always been thorough and clear. They make things convenient for me.
-1	i trust my doctor knowing that he/she had medical training and education and i don't 
-1	One thing for instance, I just started seeing a new PCP due to insurance changing over,  I have not been impressed by my first visit, hoping it gets better, but like receiving a blood test in the mail stated all was negative and clearly a level of Vitamin D was very low, the test was highlighted in Bold, and labeled Low, but it was stamp signed stating all normal.,  
1	He has given me prescriptions that have alleviated my depression and anxiety issues. He seems to really care because he wants to see me every month and examine how the medications exactly affects me and make changes. When I tell him I have worries about my heart he always checks and listens to my heart for a minute. I have no reason to doubt his honesty.
1	My Dr. is very good, caring, and is one of the better ones the local Free Clinic in my community has.  My first confidence in her was also boosted a little when after a first medical appointment I also had needed to get a perscription refilled for anxiety/depression and found that the psychiatric nurse I see at a Human Development Center my community has not only knew her but said that she felt that I was in good hands having been put in the physician's hands then proceeded to tell me a little about her background, experience, etc.  She also had suspected pre-diabetes in me, we did the blood test which proved right and I started following her reccomendations and feel much better.  She is also very humble- I went to thank her after an appointment using the title Dr., and her last me.  She immediately corrected me, thanked me for thinking that and said that she was only a P.A. and would prefer use of her first me.
-1	I think most doctors have good intentions but they are very overworked . . .  to the point where it's very difficult for them to do their jobs well.
1	Most doctors are businessmen first and doctors second, meaning that medical practice has transitioned from a profession to a crass, me-first money making operation. Most of the docs I know care about caring, and serving the best interests of their patients; but I have to acknowledge that for more than a few docs, money matters a lot.
-1	My doctor has a certain style which inspires confidence.  I think this comes mostly from his actions resulting from many years of experience.  There's never a sense that he's following a mechanical flow chart, or reading from a textbook. 
-1	I don't trust any doctors.  I have had many problems in the past with many different doctors. They do not know have of what they think they know.
1	I have a relatively young doctor, who is usually very thorough, and very plain-spoken. I respect and appreciate these qualities, and he's never given me reason to doubt him.
1	I feel that although most physicians have a high degree of integrity, I would contend that one is ultimately responsible for one's own well being. That said, not all heath care professiols are beyond scrutiny. I myself have experienced one such doctor who was self serving and egregious in the care of his patients. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician, because she remember all my health history, and she is very good. 
-1	This would be doctors in general. While I had a few doctors I trusted completely (in another state), I currently don't have that trust established here. I don't like to fight what is the right type of birth control pill to take (one phase or several phases) and then getting a prescription for the wrong type anyway and having another battle.  That was only one instance and one doctor (who is no longer my doctor). I had other issues where I had to take a stand to make sure that my preferred treatment was even considered.  I am not talking about altertive remedies, but established treatments.
-1	If I didn't trust the doctor and did not believe in his or her abilities and commitment to patients, I wouldn't be seeing this doctor. The standard of care for pretty much any injury or illness is established by governing medical bodies based on scientific evidence. With some small variation pretty much every doctor will prescribe the same treatment under the same medical circumstances. If I trust modern medicine there is no grounds for distrusting the care my doctor suggests. Which doctor I go to is mainly a matter of my convenience and my persol perceptions.
-1	"I feel like everyone is in a hurry and the perception / feelings is no one really cares. Myself and everyone else is just a number out of billions. I feel like I am just a process and not a person. Dr's tend to see all of their patience day to day, hour to hour, week to week for the purpose of the paycheck and the fincial gains. It has nothing to do with health care or the needs and wants of a persons healthcare, it is all about money and big money at that. Healthcare and everyone involved in the healthcare industry is all about the ""Market"" of making money. "
-1	I have never been treated wrong by him.
-1	It's hard to trust a doctor these days with the amount of money that is involved it's more about money than people I'm afraid.   
-1	He comes into the room, asks me a couple of generic questions, and tries to get out of there in a hurry because he has other patients to deal with. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a means to his golf course membership. 
-1	I do not trust my doctor, because it feels like my doctor doesn't trust me when I'm explaining what is wrong with me. It feels like he rushes our appointment instead of taking the time to hear me out.
1	I totally trust my physician because she spends time and talks to me on various subjects and tells me what are all the pros and cons of various disorders. She is straightforward so I guess I am lucky. Whatever I expect from my doctor I am getting from her, be it anything even if I am hesitant she makes sure I am taken care of and I am in good hands
1	He is the most well known and highly recommended doctor in my area. He is always extremely thorough and compassiote
-1	I trust those medical people that I'm close to. They believe that their approach is correct, and I respect this. However, I sometimes have my own views,.. often, in fact. However, as stated, my trust is generally high.
-1	I trust my physician because I believe they have no reason to lie to me about my health. They are paid professiols and they get paid to inform me about my health.
1	My doctor always takes his time to explain to me what is going on with my health. He is very caring and listens to my concerns.
1	I really trust my doctor because I have been with her for a long time and she has been with us for many health situations. I have a lot of friends who go to her as well, and they have nothing but good thigns to say. I feel like she really listens to us and knows her stuff.
-1	I wouldn't say that I have complete trust. They do what they can do. For anything that is beyond their scope of expertise, they send you to a specialist.
1	My doctor is very persoble and understanding when I am having problems struggling with depression and anxiety. When I have needed extra help, she has recommended other helpful resources for me to take advantage of, and when I've needed medication changes, she has helped me set up appointments with a psychiatrist.
-1	I was feeling a lot of pain and other symptoms. I went to my primary doctor and she accused me of exaggerating. She also said that she is not some clinic to get pain pills from because she said I always complain about body pains and it is unlikely someone under 30 can be in so much pain. She still took my blood for sampling and as usual, it showed I had a high white blood cell count. She said I haven't been eating right and she gave me antibiotics. I went for a second opinion and was diagnosed with 2 autoimmune diseases that apparently would have been easy to spot if the other doctor listened closely to everything I kept telling her every time I went in so she could have gotten the proper tests.
1	My doctor actually takes the time to listen and ask questions and not just talk over me or assume 
-1	"What I would say is I trust science and how it develops information, which can inform decisions. Through persol experience in seeing how doctors have misdiagnosed my family members and in hearing numerous stories of similar situations from family and friends, I would say doctors often don't care about good outcomes for their patients as much as they should. They can seem uninterested, cold, and have little involvement in the actual ""caring"" part of health care. That being said, I know there are many good doctors who do care, though many may be overworked and somewhat desensitized. "
-1	I trust my primary doctor because she attentively listen to what I have to say, and is willing to provide me with the latest treatments and how she arrived at her decision about any treatment that she feels will benefit me. I like that we engage in a dialogue that is therapeutic from both perspective. I feel that my doctor is being honest with me based on her abilities as a doctor
1	My doctor is up-to-date on newest medical treatments and experimental data. She is forthright in talking with me, asks me a lot of questions, and explains everything so I can understand what she is saying. She has a sense of humor. She is thorough in her record keeping, follow-up with me, and treats me as an individual, not a number. She's young, bright, and persoble.
1	I've been going to him since I was fourteen, and he's seen everyone in my family for years. He asks about how we're doing, he makes sure we know exactly what's going on, and he is one of our friends. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he really cares about my health and well being. He is very patient, and informative. 
-1	i trust my physician because they Treating me with care and concernâ and âTaking your problems seriously.
-1	I trust my doctor a greater deal. She has always provided with a ton information for all treatments. When I call with questions she is always very happy to help or research information for me.
-1	I'm the kind of person that likes to verify everything myself. It turns out my doctor has been right most of the time. A couple of times he's been wrong. But hey, nobody's perfect, which is why it's important to verify.
-1	I have been going to the same office for around sixteen years. I have been seeing my current doctor now for seven years.  Being overweight he has always told me smaller steps to start losing weight. He always listens and looks into whatever i bring to his attention. He will even demonstrate small exercises if need be. Overall he is a kind doctor who looks out for his patients. If its something that beyond him and his office he is quick to refer you to a doctor that meats his standards which are high
1	First of all I am generally healthy and go to the doctor twice a year for check ups and blood work evaluations. My doctor is very observant of my physical condition and the medication I take. He is approachable, invites questions, gives you good suggestions for improving your health. I trust my doctor as he has referred me to specialists when he is in doubt. these specialists have always been excellent. I am so fortute to have a great doctor who is also a people person and is not going to treat you for something in a field where he is not an expert.
-1	I do not trust doctors in general. However, since I am not an expert in the field of medicine, there are times when I feel really sick and have to consult a doctor. In such situations, I try my best to ask all possible questions that I have about my illness and the course of action suggested by the doctor. Only if I am completely satisfied with the answers will I follow the advise given by the doctor. If I feel that the doctor is being dishonest, then I will either seek a second opinion (if I am very sick) or treat myself with home remedies.
-1	For myself, I go to Planned Parenthood for all my medical needs, so the person who sees me for my medical needs always changes; I never know who I will get. Some practitioners seem quite trusting, while other can't wait to end their day. I think most give good advice, but I always like to double check when it's something very, very important.
-1	I usually feel like the doctor is busy and has a lot of things going on at once. Sometimes I get the impression they don't really listen. All in all I say I have to trust their advice but sometimes I feel they can be real impersol.
1	I've gone to my PCP since I was a child, we have a really good relationship. 
-1	I believe his heart is in the right place, but he makes sp judgements regarding care. Sometimes he says one thing then does something else, or doesn't do what he said he would do. Medical science is often wrong regarding treatments and doctors in general are too busy to keep up with the latest changes.
1	My doctors is very qualified and professiol.  I am highly aware that my doctor knows far more than I do.  My doctor has educatiol experience in many areas that I do not. I trust my doctor's knowledge, experience and expertise in all medical situations concerning my health.
1	From the past experiences I have had with my doctor, the care/medicines he has prescribed me has always helped. Also my doctor makes sure & give me the option to choose the medication instead of forcing it on me.
-1	I have seen many doctors that seem rushed when doing their jobs.
-1	Sometimes I suspect if the doctor is looking for his own benefit rather than the patient's benefit, as it happens a lot. for example, advising for a surgery while it is not necessary or a very little benefit will result out of it.
-1	My doctor almost always explains everything she says in great detail, something which I very much appreciate. If she cannot do that, she will show me on the computer or from a book what she is talking about. So, any lack of trust I have is just myself being paranoid.
1	He seems direct about my choices. He has good eye contact and is calm, not holding back information. 
-1	He doesn't have a deep understanding of some issues, like mental health, but has some standard medications and advice that he shares. Even though there's some areas he could be better in, he's not one of those stubborn primary care doctors that have it in their heads that they know everything.
-1	Because we think they are knowledgeable and we believe in them and put our trust in them and expect them to provide us with proper guidece
1	I just my doctor due to the fact that any concerns I have had she would always look into it with all her testing to get to the source of the problems even if it took a second opinion from a specialist she would take it a step up. Also because once my doctor has results the treatment that would be given would actually help with whatever was my concern so that's why I trust because I see good outcomes. 
1	I'm very knowledgeable about health, but I also don't have md behind my me.  I find that being able to colloborate with a doctor works better for me and my health goals.  I have more faith and trust in a doctor who I mesh very well with and can have dialogue with.
-1	ive know my doctor for years, have had him for maybe 8 years if my life, he has always given me advice and the best of care.
1	I trust my primary care physician as she takes the time to listen to all my concerns and gave me the proper advise which so far has been positive. She will tell me the pros and cons of the medication before prescribing it. 
-1	this is true most of the time that doctors care more about what is convenient to them so we should not completely trust them but not all doctors are same so my view is neutral.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I find him to be credible, well educated, and trustworthy.  He provides attention and familiarity with the issues that have faced me in the past, and face me currently.  Additiolly, he is well reputed in the medical community and has to my knowledge provided sound treatment and service to me. 
1	I trust my doctor because, she always seems to have my best interest at heart when every i go to see my doctor for something she always go in to deep questioning into what is the problems i am having, and when she prescribe a diagnosis and or medication she always take the time explain everything i needs to know she never rushes with her patients. 
-1	She  has always been  great .. answers any question I may have and askes question s I have never thought of.
-1	I believe that my doctor can be a bit hasty sometimes when its a busy day but I still trust his knowledge.  Consultations seem a bit short, but all in all I am typically out the door with a prescription that will  help me feel better and they always do.  I think when and if there is something of greater concern than a common cold,  he'll be more likely to spend more time to explain the condition and treatment.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to him for a long time. He always explains things to me in detail. He doesn't rush, or ignore my questions.
1	I generally trust my doctor because they have always led me in the right direction and provided me with the best information or options in respect to my situation. I still like to do my own research as to things they say or recommend to me, but I generally trust their initial assessments. I think most doctors do really care about their patients needs instead of what is just convenient for them.
-1	He is an expert.  He has practical experience.  He seems like a good person.
-1	I do trust my primary care physician because he is really care about his patients with heart, perhaps he has aged with a happy family. I never seen any patients is not satisfied with his services. He also has a lot of nice staffs at his clinic office. He always clearly explains and give the hard copy of your heath notes if you have any concerns.  
-1	I distrust physician because I am completely dependent on them to do the right thing or properly inform my about available or possible options
-1	I generally trust them, and believe they would consciously act in my best interest but at the same I acknowledge they may be overworked, see many cases a day, and may overlook details. 
-1	The do not listen. My issues are important and they do not take them serious. It is annoying.
-1	The major issues I've experienced with my health are things that are not easily diagnosed and sometimes doctors still don't think it even exists. So I'm brushed off quite a bit and that makes me wary of trusting a doctor.
1	I trust my doctor a lot.  Like me, she is a woman, so I know that she has gone through some of the same things as I have.  She spends a lot of time with me and really explains everything.
1	I trust my doctor because thus far i have not been given a reason not to trust her and her expertise. 
-1	I usually ask what I already know so there is nothing much to discuss.
1	I trust my doctor because he shows genuine care for me. He goes above and beyond and he gives me all options to consider when i have to choose
1	My PCP has always been nice and caring.  I don't have a reason to not trust him or doubt him.  Everything has always worked out well.
-1	i have been with him for the longest time and i have never have any issues that i might have to second gues. if i did i usually ask him right then and there 
1	My doctor is trustful. My doctor does what is best for his patients.
-1	My doctor takes the time to explain things fully and answer any questions I have. He is receptive to what I think and asks many questions to get a full gauge of what is going on with me every time I see him.
-1	I trust that they understand what they're talking about. However, I sometimes wonder if the prescriptions and procedures are given out to make them the most money
-1	I think they sometimes can make mistakes as any person and it's not good to rely on just one person.
1	I have to trust the person I am trusting my life and future with. I cannot doubt their abilities. If for some reason I find I don't trust my doctor I find a new doctor. I have done it. I don't want to have to be concerned that my doctor does not have my best interest in mind.
-1	I trust my doctor because they know better than me, also i would know or feel if the doctor is not being honest with me. I have my wife to help me too or guide me. My primary care physician has been my doctor for years and he has helped me a lot on different things so I have built a trust for him.
-1	My regular doctor is great. She is not always available however, and then I question the replacements. 
-1	I think my doctor cares more about making a profit than my well-being. He will talk about my condition and answer questions, but anything that doesn't involve pharmaceutical drugs, he shuts down as bogus. I don't believe that. I don't feel he is very thorough and I really only go to the doctor if absolutely necessary. 
-1	"I do not have ""complete trust"" in any human being as any person can make a mistake. I tend to trust my Physician because based upon experience this person has proven to be trustworthy and knowledgeable. Ultimately my health decisions are mine to make guided by the professional knowledge of a trusted Physician."
1	I feel that doctors are generally trustworthy as if they're not, then what is the point of them chosing their profession if they just want to scam people?
1	The reason I trust my doctor it is because I have known him for a long time and is a very professional and caring person. He loves what he does.
-1	My doctor is a confident and intelligent person whom I respect. He is willing to here my thought s and opinions on my own health and but as I have cultivated a reputation of years with the man, I know that I can trust in his expertise. 
-1	I feel like I can mostly trust my physician. I have been seeing them for a while and I feel like he answers my questions efficiently and makes sure to go over what he prescribes for me
1	I really think that he tries to make the best decisions for my care. I generally place a good deal of trust in him. If I didn't trust him, I would look for another physician.
1	My doctor has always been open to questions and replies with swift honest answers.He is highly trained, caring and gives no reason for me to doubt him. he has also been my family doctor since 1998.
-1	My visits often feels hurried and like there's not enough time for a thorough consideration of my health issues. She seems completely competent, but I don't think enough time is given for her to really be very thorough.
-1	Doctors in general are trustworthy because they have a career to uphold. If they were to mess around with you, they could lose their license, or be subject to a huge lawsuit. It's important that doctors uphold the hippocratic oath, or else they won't be around long. You have to trust that you wouldn't be an unlucky few who are are exposed to a terrible doctor. 
1	I've been going to my primary physician for years, he's always tried to help me to the best of his ability.
1	I think he is competent and knows what he is doing. He will be honest with me and let me know what the situation is. If something is out of his realm then he will refer me to a proper specialist.
-1	I trust my Dr. but I also research my options on my own. I believe the Dr. acts in my best interest but still may not know what is best for me. Is is always better to be informed.
1	I trust physicians because they obviously don't want to make mistakes, since malpractice is so costly. They have an incentive to do the best they  can, although no one is perfect.
-1	"I disagree with a lot of what is taught in ""conventional"" medicine and I do not believe doctors are taught everything they should be taught and are left ""ignorant"" in regard to a lot of important information. Most doctors are trained to be ""pill dispensers"" and are not trained to discover the root cause of most illness. I don't blame doctors as much as I blame the ""establishment"" for the way they teach medicine and put so much emphasis on getting as many patients in and out as possible and maximizing profit."
-1	I think that they listen to me and try to understand me. But sometimes I question the treatment they suggest. I don't know if it is the only one, best one or the most convenient for the medical practice one. I want to trust them, but I do have to watch out for myself too.
-1	Sometimes I feel like doctors are so pressed for time they are just trying to get out of the room. Also, I worry about their relationships to insurance and drug companies that might influence their course of treatment. I don't think they wish to do harm, they are just conflicted.
1	I trust doctors because they're well-trained and well-intentioned. However, like in many professions, skill level varies with experience and with the doctor in general. Also, there are always more and more cutting edge treatments and statistical evidence being released that often changes things significantly. On top of this, the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and doctors does cause some concern. So a patient should always do due diligence when it comes to any serious procedure, condition, or medication. That being said, the doctor is almost always going to improve your situation and make you aware of what your health circumstances are.
-1	I don't have complete trust in my doctor. He is smart and he cares, but he's been wrong too many times and I've had to look elsewhere for answers. I've figured out things on my own that he couldn't after several visits.
-1	I don't currently have a PCP, but in general I trust doctors a little but not totally. I think that to some degree big pharma makes it hard for them to be totally unbiased in their decisions. So I think that have my interest in mind, but I also like to do my own research to back up what I am told.
1	I trust my PCP because she takes the time to listen to me. She gives me all the options needed for different treatments and health remedies. She asks me before doing things instead of just telling me they are what I need to do
-1	The practice is very busy and he is late all the time. He shuffles a lot of things off to nurses. He seems to know his stuff, but he rushes through it often. It can also take a long time to get an appt or a refill.
-1	Doctors and arrogant and a high percentage of them are sociopaths. They represent the pharmaceutical industry and they will deny their rx drug prescriptions caused anyone any harm. Doctors are unethical and dangerous as they put their ego and money ahead of the public's best interest. I stay away from them and hate most I have ever had the misfortune to come in contact with.  The only times I have gotten better from anything is when i have avoided or stopped going to allopathic doctors. 
1	They have more knowledge and experience than I do so I do trust what they have to say. They took an oath to protect their patients and I believe that most try to follow trough on that oath. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because they always treat me with respect and care. When I get that type of respect from someone they earn my trust with their professional opinions.
1	I have been seeing him for many years he treats my children and spouse as well so we have discuses many things over the years and I am comfortable with him.
1	I explained this in the other answer. They really answer my questions in detail. I also research my questions and have access to my medical records online. I also get printed information on my conditions and steps to take when I leave the doctor.
1	He is a smart guy. Been around for many years. 
1	My doctor appears to spend the time necessary to understand my conditions/concerns and address them. She is willing to admit when she does not know something and refers me to a specialist that can help. It probably helps that I am friends with one of her nurses (friends before I started seeing the doctor).
1	my doctor has always given me proper information and prescriptions to make me feel better and each time his remedies have worked for me
-1	I recently had a doctor inject me with a different medication than what I normally take, without ever informing me of this or obtaining my consent. It was a generic form of the medication, which I understand is apparently legal to do. I however find it extremely and highly unethical. I have switched doctors as of today. 
1	I have had the same doctor for 9 years and he has been nothing but a profession al and friend. He always diagnoses my correctly and prescribes the correct medicine. 
-1	They are human just like the rest of us. My doctor has his own best interests at heart when it comes right down to it. I'm sure that he tries his best to help me, but if my needs conflicted with his I'm sure he would take care of himself first. Nothing against him in particular; I just feel that is how everyone would act. 
-1	They don't really seem interested in what I had to say about my body and the side effects of the drugs i'm often prescribed. They sound like a shill trying to get me on many different medications
-1	Wrote this in the other section but fits here better. They write down possible conditions and never tell me so I have to read it on my medical records to understand why they are asking me something.
-1	I don't see a doctor regularly. In fact, I haven't been to the doctor in 8 years. The reason for this is because the doctor seemed overly concerned with herself, made me feel horrible about myself, recommended a method of birth control that caused damage, didn't give adequate information about the medicine and was overall in a bad mood the whole time. After that visit I had a reduction in funds so I was not able to find a better doctor. Without health insurance, that is difficult. So I just never went back.
-1	I only get 10-15 minutes with my physician. She's overworked, I don't think doctors have the time to fully explain everything to each patient.
1	I trust my primary care physician because they are very friendly, understanding, caring and helpful. They always make me feel comfortable asking questions and such. They also always keep my best interest in mind, and making sure I am comfortable with everything before proceeding.
1	He's been my doctor for years I know him outside of his work. I trust what he says but sometimes I don't want to follow his advice.
1	I trust that he is doing things for a good reason.  I believe that he takes his practice seriously.
1	These people have gone to years and years of schooling to get into their position. They just want o do what's best for the patient and don't want to risk their job for anything.
-1	I'm with tricare. The doctors there aren't paid to push any specific brand of drugs. They have a lot of expertise in their field and see a lot of patients on a daily basis so their opinion carries a lot of weight. They aren't restricted by budget so much as other practices so they're more likely to recommend tests that other practices may have avoided.
-1	While I do trust my doctor, I still seek out additional information when I feel it necessary.  My doctor has never violated my trust.  I still feel like you can't be too careful, because everyone has bad days and could miss something.
1	My primary care physician takes his time trying to find out what is wrong with me. He doesn't jump to a conclusion or pass me off as a customer. There have been a couple of situations that, I could see, kind of stumped him in diagnosing the cause. That made me feel more at ease then him coming to a decision/conclusion quickly. 
1	I have never had any problems with her since I have been seeing her. She always answers any questions I have and always makes sure I don't have any unanswered questions before leaving the office. She always checks everything to make sure she has diagnoised me correctly. 
1	My doctor has never gave me a reason not to trust her. She is kind and caring and upfront and honest. 
-1	"my doctor does not mention/discuss any real ""natural"" ways to help any kind of  medical issue I might have so I do my own research because I cannot trust that the dr. will give me any such information, instead just wanting to prescribe medications when it may possibly not be needed."
-1	I don't trust medical professionals because sometimes they may be sponsored by a drug manufacturer, and they just perform medical services to promote their sponsors. Really don't trust doctors.
-1	since I'm the only one on this planet that knows me the best, I make sure to research every possible item no matter how trustworthy, skilled or experience the health professional is. people are not perfect and they do make mistakes. 
-1	I do trust my doctor but you can never be too careful because at the end of the day with all the good intentions in the world if something goes wrong I'm the one it'll effect, I have to live with it. So I do trust my doctor but at the end of the day I'm responsible for taking care of myself. I think doctors in general are well intentioned and do the best they can in general.
1	He makes me help safe when I talk to him. I trust in this ability to give me anwsers when every I feel hopeless.
1	I just have always liked them and felt right with them. They are always good to me
1	My doctor is through and never makes us feel rushed. We feel like we are the only one there. They watch our medications to warn us of a conflict. They tell us all of the side effects.
1	i trust my doctor because they know i'm a nurse and we are able to communicate in the same medical terms.
1	I trust my primary car physician because he has been my doctor since I was born. 
1	I have been with my doctor since I was 18 years old. He has never done unneeded testing, is quick to personally call me when I have questions instead of having a nurse do it. I had a medical scare in November, and he actually came to my house when my blood pressure sky rocketed to wait with me while my husband drove home. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he's young like myself and I think that he has my best interest at heart. He gets the times that we live in and he knows that many times you don't need a doctor you just need to trust yourself and body and exercise good judgement to ensure that I live as long as I possibly can. With the help of God of course.
-1	If he can help me get better 
1	I have had bad doctors in the past, I like the relationship i have with this doctor now, I totally trust him, not everyone graduates is good at their job but mine is, at least with me
-1	I don't see a reason not to trust them.
-1	sometimes i feel like my doctor prescribes medicine unnecessarily just to pacify me. but he does ask a lot of questions and try to be as thorough as possible and refers me to a specialist when he's unsure of my condition.
-1	It makes me very uncomfortable that doctors can receive 'kickback' payments from drug manufacturers to recommend their products.
-1	One, as a physician I have seen many physicians make mistakes.  I have trained myself to be objective and results oriented (preferring clinical studies to opinion)..  I have also been privy to compassionate and caring physicians and those who are less so.
-1	The doctor will give you a treatment option that they are familiar with and usually that is not all the options that are available. Insurance companies also influence doctors and the type of treatments they cover. Research the subject on your own, in my opinion.
-1	I distrust doctors based on experience of them misdiagnosing me and telling me my issues are imagined. If they dont know about a rare disease they tend to often want to dismiss you. 
1	I have the most amazing doctor who is friendly and open to anything you have to say. He is very willing to listen when you are talking. He has great values and will give you his honest opinion. I love how good his bed side manner is. He makes you feel comfortable as soon as he walks in the room.
-1	"I trust him because he seems genuine in what he says and seems like he truly cares about my wellbeing. However, I can't say that I trust him ""completely"" because I have a bit of distrust in medical professionals and the healthcare industry in general."
-1	I feel that doctors sometimes have motivation to pursue a certain treatment plan without narrowly tailoring it to my needs.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she's been there for me for the last decade. I've gone to her whenever I had issues, major or minor. I've built a relationship with her. That always helps. If I go to a new doctor, I don't think I will have that same feeling.
-1	I trust my doctor because my whole family has been going to her for years. I've known her since I was a little kid and now i'm 35. She knows everything about me and she knows how to talk to me.
1	I have been going to the same doctor since I was born and now my children go to the same one. She has always explained things clearly and given options and tried to do her best for us. 
-1	I trust him because he doesn't try to upsell me on anything and takes a very relaxed and practical approach to things.  For example, I need to lose about 30 pounds, instead of being hysterical, he suggested I aim for 1 pound a month.
1	My doctor takes her time with me and I never feel rushed. She will ask about me and give me a chance to ask questions. She engages in real life examples and will put things in plain terms.
-1	I do not trust them because they will just prescribe you with over the counter drugs that will end up killing the human body one day.
-1	I feel like I have trust in my primary care physician. I feel like they have my best interests in mind and they try to solve any problem that I come to them for. They are really good at what they do.
-1	I feel that my medical care providers are very well educated and i can tell, I think they have every motivation to to open and fair and honest with me because they have years of experience and they would not be in the position if they were not adequately helping patients
-1	Doctors now a days seem pre-occupied and kind just go through the motions of their job.   I am not sure my best interest is their main concern
-1	Most of the time, when I go visit my doctor, she is so busy that she spends a maximum of five minutes with me, looking at her clipboard, asking generic questions and then rushes out. I feel like I am not allowed to ask her questions in the off chance that I am inconveniencing her and her busy day. Makes me not really trust doctors and someimtes i feel like I am prescribed something for the sake of pharma companies tryign to seel patients drugs when we actually don't need them. I honestly dont like to be highly medicated but at times, it looks like docs are looking out for their own salaries and compensations at times. like this. 
1	I work with my doctor and I really like him. He is very good at listening and let me be apart of my treatment plan. 
1	I've been with my doctor a long time and he never sugarcoats anything he tells me. He is always honest about whatever aspect of my life is going to kill me. He's good.
-1	I trust him, but the things I'll take a neutral position on are things like pharmaceutical drugs. I don't like taking them and I'll always do my own research to see if there are other things I can do before trying them. If there isn't, I'll grudgingly take them.
1	I don't have any complex medical conditions so anything the doctor tells me I have no real reason to doubt. I don't see any ill effects from whatever I have been told by my primary doctor.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because it is their job and they are supposed to be knowledgeable on the subject. They have tons of training and education and should be prepared. 
-1	I do not trust doctors because I have no reason to trust them. They are doctors because they went to school and got a degree. I trust myself much more.
-1	I've been seeing him for +10 years. He's extremely thorough. I could complain about a slight ache and he'd order a whole x-ray just to be sure nothing else is going on. He's very competent and has listened to me in the past and talked to me
1	My doctor has little reason to lie to me, so I can trust in them to provide me with the proper care. I do question medications when I can, as I know that doctors receive kickbacks and things like that from companies. I try to make sure to use holistic methods when I can. Medications can be dangerous and harmful if you become addicted to them. I prefer to use natural methods when I can, so that I can avoid anything unnecessary.
-1	I think my doctor is quick with my visits and so I've started to limit my engagement with him. He's often brushed off concerns in the past as well.
-1	The few times I have seen her, she seems to hyper-focus on ONE issue, and almost overdoes it. She tries to quickly get me out of her office after dealing with that ONE issue only, even if I ave 2 or 3 medical issues that need to be dealt with. To get the appropriate care, I would need to go to separate visits for all my individual issues and needs.
-1	My urologist is a little young, so it was kind of scary trusting him with my goods. But he showed confidence in himself and it made me feel confident in him. 
1	I have noticed when I am more open and honest with them then in turn it allows them to understand my situation better and they will be more honest and willing to help me because I am not trying to hide anything as well as the relationship I develop with them I can sense they want to help me. 
-1	he is an okay physician. i dont visit him much but when i do, he does his job and asks me questions. he gives me prescriptions
1	I trust my doctor to be completely honest with me. They took an oath in medical school to help people and be truthful.  
1	I trust them because they have a lot more knowledge about medical issues than I do. I think most if not all got into the profession to help people, and I dont think they would risk their reputations to harm me. 
1	I have developed a strong relationship with my primary care doctor. I have seen him for many years now and he has been successful at helping me through various illnesses with success. 
-1	I've had so many doctors that simply do not care about their patients, do not explain risks in procedures or medications. The latest doctor I had gave me extremely powerful drugs without explaining their side effects and effectively crippled me (ruined the tendons in my legs).
-1	I am pretty neutral in general to how a doctor acts or any motivations I am not seeing. Mostly, I just go when I need to. Get seen and checked on. Told what they think is wrong and then get the medication. If it works great. If it does not then back I go to see what could be the issue. 
-1	Some doctors seem more interested in selling extra products that I really don't need..Seems they just want the extra income.
-1	I have had this doctor for a long time.  She always takes time with me.  She wants what will be the best option for me.  I never feel rushed when I have an appointment.
1	I trust my doctor.  He has never lied to me, or seemed to push me in any direction.  He gives me the information that i need, and his opinion, and leaves the decisions up to me.
1	I think that he holds himself to high standards and has always showed me respect and understands me and is compassionate. He has never gave me any reason for me to not trust him. He is always honest and straight forward with me, and that is how I prefer it.
1	My doctor has never been wrong. She has always been honest with me, and she knows when I am not taking my medications like I should. She gets me the results of my blood test back in short order, and changes my prescriptions if I feel they are not working.
1	I have been with this group for some time now and I feel like they have alway took good care of me so I think I can trust what they are saying and doing for me and I have no reserves
-1	I generally trust them to do what is right and make me feel better in the end, although sometimes they only give me one option for moving forward, when I often feel like there are probably many options I have, but they just aren't telling me about it.  I think they only tell me the one that they think is right or best.
1	My primary care doctor has been helpful to me throughout my life and has always made a point to make sure that I am getting better. 
-1	Because he can attend all the patient it would be very good and nice of it.Great so we can trust physician and it will be very good
1	My primary care physician listens to my questions and concerns, explains her thought process about diagnosis, and works with me to resolve any lingering health issues (fortunately, I'm relatively healthy). She also has evening and weekend hours, so I appreciate her willingness to work around patients' schedules.
-1	I have to trust that my doctor is going to say and do what is in my best interests. I want to know exactly what can be and needs to be done in order to get or stay healthy. I want to be confident that my doctor is going to do the things that they have sworn to do as a medical professional, and thinking that they may not be doing so is too upsetting to even consider. 
-1	My doctor takes the time to get to know me and my life. He will allow my to voice and problems or questions I have about my health. I would like to think that my doctor actually cares about me, because that is the impression I get. 
-1	The most obvious things that have changed the perception of medicine over these last forty years include high profile cases of physician fraud, drug abuse, drug pushing, malfeasance, gross malpractice, even murder.   What in the past was often hushed up, or discounted as highly unusual, have now become grist for the media mill.  To say that physiciansâ images have been tarnished by these instances would be an understatement.
-1	Although I have only been seeing my current doctor for 6 months, she caught a health issue that made a difference in my life. I trust her to be thorough and give me the care i need. I feel that I need to be with her longer to fully form my opinion, but so far I trust her and believe she is honest. 
-1	I've been going to the same doctor my whole life, and when I was younger it seemed like he knew what he was doing. Now that he's older, it seems like he just wants to get patients out of his office as quickly and as possible. Prescribe some medicine and you're good to go. I like not spending a lot of time in the doctor's office, but it does make me wonder if he actually knows what he's doing.
-1	They're not bad. They haven't given me a reason to distrust them and have been okay so far as far as I can tell.
-1	I have a new doctor. I am still learning about him. He is older and I trust him but I also pay attention. 
1	I feel that my doctor has my trust because she is always willing to provide me with information as well as make sure I understand everything before I leave, she takes the time to show compassion for me.
-1	I would prefer that all the information relative to my body be listed and discussed and added to the procedure of what we're going to do with my body.
-1	My doctor is open with me and generally is able to answer all of my questions.  Though I feel like the doctor is always in a rush and doesn't explain things as fully as possible.
-1	I trust him to an extent, but not fully.  I believe he presents the options that are available to me honestly, but I would not trust him to make medical decisions on my behalf - in an important situation or when facing a problem I would want a second opinion, would want to do some research myself, would want to talk to other people about the situation, etc.  I also think my doctor, like many, is often more rushed for time and more concerned with getting to the next patient than I would like him to be.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has done nothing to lose that trust. He always explains why he recommends things
-1	I trust my doctor because this is his job and his expertise. He has a background and knowledge of the subject, so I am really in no place to second guess him. I can ask questions for further explaination or instruction
-1	I am a very careful person and consider myself to be well read. I ask questions and do research on my conditions and medications. 
-1	You  choose your doctor and put your faith in them.  If your relationship does not have trust, it will never last. That does not exclude, however, sometimes questioning your doctors decisions.  For that reason, it is important to have a place where you can always get a second opinion. 
-1	I currently don't have a primary care doctor so it's hard for me to answer this question. When I do have a problem I will go to an expres clinic and I've had good and bad experiences. More good than bad. I try to put my trust in doctors but sometimes they are worried about getting people in and out of the room like cattle. 
-1	It can be hard to trust physician due to financial incentives they may or may not have. I often wonder if physicians have to do so many procedures, write so many prescriptions, etc. just to stay a float. 
-1	Well I'm more so neutral because I have new physician due to living in a college town while attending.  I've only had to go to her so far for a health check up for insurance purposes.  I had nothing wrong with me so there wasn't any real medical needs present at that time.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have never been led astray before by him. Every time that I went to my primary care physician, it has been a pleasant experience. I have gotten good medication and health advise. 
-1	For the most part I trust my primary care physician. When other doctors had turned down sending me to a specialist for a condition that I had for several years that still had not been addressed, my primary care doctor sent me to a specialist to get it checked out. Furthermore, some small issues that I had been having over the years she took the time to look into to give me a full and proper diagnosis. 
-1	I trust doctors for the most part because they have dedicated their lives to helping others. Because of this, I assume that they have my best interests in mind, especially when it comes to my personal health. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have always gotten a working solution for my problems. She asks many detailed questions to make sure she can understand what I am trying to describe and is able to come up with a valid diagnosis. She also provides me with all the information I need to know about my different diagnosis.
-1	I trust my primary care physician as she seems dedicated to providing good care and she is well educated. She does however rush through patient visits and many times downplays my concerns or refers me to other people for the answers I need such as nurses or the pharmacy.    
-1	My old doctor I trust because he would be very open and straightforward with me and he would always make sure I am feeling ok. I am not sure about other doctors but hope they would be as good as him. 
1	I love my Doctor and have been seeing him for over 5 years. He is brutally honest with me about everything and is very blunt, which I love. I like to know everything about any diagnosis and he always tells me both the good and bad possibilities. It makes me feel confident in him because he isn't hiding anything.
-1	I have been seeing the same family care physician since I was born so I have come to trust him. However, I do feel that every doctor has their own way of thinking that might be different from my way of thinking. 
1	My doctor helped cure the problems I had with my neck and shoulder for over a year and listened to everything I said and was very helpful in getting everything done. It was better than seeing other doctors I had seen before.
1	In general, I trust doctors to be highly skilled and highly knowledgeable in their practice. I do believe they genuinely care about helping others and want to look out for the best interests of their patients.
1	I feel that you can trust a doctor fairly well because the last thing they want is to cause you harm. For one they most likely would feel bad and morally wrong for hurting a patient. Also they do not want any law suits on their record or in their life at all.
1	my pcp seems to be very knowledge and takes her time whenever I visit with her. she does not push unnecessary tests and always takes the time to explain answers to any questions I may have. she gives me all the options for certain treatments and gives me her opinion on which is best but always leaves the final option up to be. I feel I can trust her and I have not been disappointed in the past
-1	I know that healthcare is a business and doctors are humans with the same outside stress as everyone else. I know they are sometimes in a rush and don't always make the right decisions.
1	She has always explained things to my satisfaction, both medically and with regard to insurance.  She has helped me and noticed other issues that I didn't really pay attention to, which I really appreciate.  She works hard to help me in any way.
1	I generally trust doctors in telling me what's wrong with me based on my symptoms.  My trust wavers however when it comes to being prescribed medications.  I feel sometimes doctors prescribe stuff that isn't needed in order to make money off that prescription.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician because I believe that they are generally caring about me and their other patients. Times where I have had issues with my health my primary care physician has been able to effectively diagnose and treat my illnesses and return me to the state that I should be in. I don't necessarily find any reason to distrust my doctor as she has given me no reason to. 
-1	I mostly trust the physician. But some physicians are work for the salary period. This may be lead to patient's uncomfortable. Physicians has the high responsible for their patient. But some Physicians are not take care about the patient. Their only focus is to improve their financial stability.
-1	Most doctors, including my PCP, make judgments about me based on how I look, not about my self or health in general. I frequently feel like my concerns are dismissed by doctors, or they treat me as if I am uneducated.
-1	I trust my primary care physician due to his professional background and the number of testimonies I've heard from others regarding his experience and their visits with him. He made it a point to build up such a reputation, and one should admire that.
1	I have no reason to distrust. He has answered every question I have had about myself and family members without sugar coating anything. He is very upfront and honest.
-1	I've had my primary care physician for a long time. I like him and he's never done me wrong in the past. We have a good relationship and I trust that if something were to go wrong he'd give me the best options and treatment. 
-1	It seems to be really easy to trust a physician.  I believe this way mainly because a person who has obtained that level of job and status has dedicated their entire life to getting to that point, and why would they want to be untrustworthy and not provide the best care possible if it were to put their job at risk that they have literally dedicated their entire life too.  However, many physicians may abuse their power or even be untrustworthy because they want to take advantage of you and make as much money as possible. 
1	i would trust most doctors. i only go to the gynecologist and optometrist, but they are both great. the only time i wouldnt listen to them is in regards to nutrition. 
-1	I was on a medication for 7 years that I really did not need. I did some of my own research and asked my doctor about it, and she took me off of it. Ever since, I have had trouble trusting her. 
1	I trust her because she has been my doctor for a couple of years now, and has had enough talks with me and has given me enough tests to where I have developed that trust over the years.
1	Thus, far I have had mostly positive experiences with my primary care doctor. Everything I have been prescribed has usually worked well enough.
-1	I haven't been going to them for long so the trust isn't completely there yet. I imagine with more time and continued good treatment I will trust them a lot more.
-1	My neurologist prescribed me an anti-seizure medication -- I had not had any seizures while I have been taking the medicine. I trust a doctor until I have reason not to.
1	My primary care physician guided me through the hardest point in my life health wise when I had to be hospitalized for a colon condition. His advice was spot on through the entire ordeal and it was possible to make a fast recovery due to him. His guidance is what makes me trust him really no matter what.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough when I see her for visits. She allows me to ask as many questions as I like, and she really listens.
-1	I have a medical problem right now that my doctor doesn't seem interested in figuring out. I think they dont really care
-1	I have had the same PCP for many years and we have an honest relationship.  I trust him to a certain extent only because he knows me and for the most part my habits and can best prescribe something for me if needed.
1	i have had nothing but good experiences with my doctor and he has given me no reason whatsoever to mistrust him. He has taken the time to address any and all concerns that I have had.
-1	I trust my doctors in that they have education and experience in their fields whereas I do not.  However, I am a strong believer in advocating for yourself and getting second opinions and asking questions to be able to make the best choices for myself.
1	I've had the same doctor for the last three years. He seems pretty thorough and accomplishes everything that needs to be done during my visits. He's brought up tests I could do if I wanted to but doesn't push them on me.
-1	I don't think doctors get to where they are by being selfish and always looking out for themselves. Also, I believe people have an inherent good in them. So even if a doctor is having a bad day or something to that extent, I still think they will do their best to be helpful, answer questions, and get their patients back to normal health or to where they want to be health wise.
-1	I think it depends on the type of doctor, but on the whole, I trust doctors to prescribe medications and diagnose, but I also trust my own feelings about my body and what I need. So I usually pit the two against each other. 
1	I do trust my doctor because she is extremely honest with me and patient with me. She is still new to me since I have had her for 6 months but I already trust her 
-1	I often feel rushed and that my treatment is according to protocol, not individual needs.  I often have to remind my doctor about other medication, side effects, etc.
-1	I've had a couple I have trusted and a couple I have not. My last physician in Hawaii I trusted a lot. I went in with severe pain in my intestines. The nurse wanted me to immediately go to the hospital for a colonoscopy. The doctor asked me some questions, looked at my medical history, and came to the conclusion that I had a non serious condition that could be treated with antibiotics. He gave me the choice of accepting his recommendation or going to the hospital. He explained the pros and cons of each. He gave me reasons for his recommendation and I went with it. He was correct in the end.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I really think he acts in my best interests.  He is trained and more knowledgeable than I am in these areas and so I put my trust in him. 
-1	"I don't feel as though a personal relationship of any sort has been established over time and his ""bedside manner"" is curt and distant. I sometimes feel as though I am just another task of the day to get over with as quickly as possible. I do think I need special attention, but become discouraged with I feel that our time is rushed or treated as entirely insignificant. "
-1	I do not have a primacy care physician, but I do feel that not all humans are perfect. As such, not all doctors are going to be perfect either and can either make mistakes, or purposefully mislead a patient for personal reasons.
1	I think my doctor takes enough time to address my physical and mental health concerns. She takes the time to explain things to me and helps me to explore options if we do not have a solid answer for anything I am dealing with.
1	I trust my doctor because who else can I trust.  It leaves me no choice but to trust my doctor.  I can always decide later whether I believe it's a good advice or not.  
1	My doctor always explains things thoroughly and answers all of my questions. He explains the side effects of medications before prescribing them to me, and allows me to decide on what I believe would be the best treatment for myself
1	Being a nurse has helped me see doctors in a different way. There are some doctors that have proved to me that I can trust them and there have also been some doctors that have been deceitful to their patients. If a doctor is honest with me and spends time talking to me then I can trust them. If I have a doctor that comes in the room and doesn't engage with me or sends his/her nurse in to talk to me, then I have less trust. 
1	I trust my doctor's ideas and decisions, but I also allow for the possibility of human error or the fact that she might not know everything about what I'm feeling to give the exact solution I need. Whether that be because I left out something important or because she or I forgot to ask certain questions. My doctor is great, experienced, and well meaning so I don't doubt her but I don't take her word as a complete final decision either.
-1	I like to think that most doctors know what they are doing and try to help patients and do what is right for them in their lives.
-1	sometimes things go well and other times things dont go well it just happens to be that this is how things have been lately
1	I really trust my doctor because I have been with him for over 15 years and nothing he has stated so far has been false. He has the best in mind for me and will be honest when I am not doing something correctly.
-1	For the most part, I trust my doctor.  He is the expert and knows what's best for me.  However, I know that doctor's are overworked and stretched thin.  I am sometimes wary that they do things that are quicker or easier.  
-1	i don't really go to the doctor that often as i am very healthy generally.  I don't feel any mistrust in my doctor but have little interaction at this time.  I would go if I needed help.
-1	I do not trust my primary care doctor because he tells me that I can only present one problem I am having during a visit. I have chronic issues, and I only go into see the doctor once a year, because he doesn't order tests, or seem to take me seriously when I present a problem. So, in turn, I don't trust that my primary care doctor really cares about me, or my chronic problems, and I don't bother going in to take care of anything because he won't do anything to help me feel better. Wish I had better insurance, so I could find a doctor that was interested in helping me feel better.
-1	Recently discovered an enlarged thyroid.  My PCP ordered thyroid ultrasound but, did not order TSH level.  I had to call office and suggest this be ordered.  
-1	I am close with my doctor.  They are always in a great mood and able to talk to me in a calm manner and I can trust what they are saying and doing is in my best interest.  I think that all doctors are in the job for the right reasons.
-1	To an extent I trust my physician but it seems as if she is always rushed and just trying to get people in and out as quick as possible. Somethings that seem worrisome to me are just dismissed and not thoroughly explained.
1	My primary care doctor has been working many, many decades. He's very straight forward. My husbands sister also use to work for him, and she's called him an asshole but completely trusts him and his judgement. I feel the same way.
-1	I think that in general doctors have little incentive to be dishonest to patients. However, it is easy for people to have biases that influence them and effect trustworthiness, even if they meant to be honest.
-1	I have a hard time trusting doctors sometimes because some of them only seem to in it for the money and dont really have a personal care for helping people be healthy. 
-1	I trust my doctor because they have extensive training in their profession and the government makes sure they know their stuff.
-1	I donât have a close relationship with them, so I donât know them personally cannot trust them completely. What if theyâre told to prescribe a certain drug? I never know if thatâs occuring. 
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, so I'd have to say the reason I don't trust doctors in general is because they always seem too busy to really listen to me, and are careful only to avoid malpractice suits.
-1	I want to trust my doctor but perhaps it's TV or just my lack of health care growing up. I have an issue with trust. I mean it seems sometime they herd you like cattle. They see you for 2 minutes then it's time to pay and leave. They offer no personal connection. I feel like maybe doctors out in the country where things go at a slower pace and people care about each other more I could trust my doctor but here in the city I don't 
1	My doctor is well-trained and has plenty of knowledge and experience. I have never felt like I was being rushed out the door. They always talk to me with respect, and for as long as I need.
-1	I mostly trust my doctors to tell me what is wrong and how to fix it; they don't always agree with me or me them when diagnosing something or trying to get me to take pills or treatments I don't want to take or do. I believe they are genuinely trying to help me, but we don't always agree.
1	I've been with the same group of primary care physicians for over 20 years. While the doctors/PAs change, they are always knowledgeable, current, honest, have a good bedside manor and answer any and all questions I have about any conditions, treatment options or costs. 
-1	I have seen my doctor make mistakes before treating me. However, he is brilliant and helped keep my children healthy growing up so I give him credit. I feel as though he did overprescribe antibiotics for me, though, as I did end up with C-Diff in the hospital two years ago from prescriptions he wrote on my behalf.
-1	It's obvious that my primary care physician, and all the other doctors in that office in general, is ridiculous overworked and overwhelmed.  When I do go see her, I can expect to regularly wait 2 hours past my scheduled appointment time to even see the doctor, only to have her rush through our meeting in 5 minutes and rush me out.  The waiting room for my primary care physician's office is always filled to the brim with waiting people, many of which sick and coughing.  My doctor means well but she is clearly overworked and unable to give me her best.
-1	I have been seeing my doctor for several years and she knows me.  She knows how my body reacts to certain drugs and other stimuli.  She believes what I tell her.  
1	I have seen a few doctors at this point in my life and have had various different experiences with different ones.  I feel confident in the intelligence, concern, and care this doctor exhibits.  He is willing to take time with me and answers any and all questions I have.
-1	"I trust my doctor because she shows genuine concern and often discusses options with me in regards to my treatment. I am only neutral on some issues because I feel that she is very busy, and often is trying to get through things quickly, or discredits certain things I report as ""just my anxiety"" since I have a medical history with it."
-1	I do trust my doctor, but I also realize how busy he is.  I have never experienced my doctor making a direct mistake relating to my health, but there have been instances when he was rushing a little.  When I am prescribed something, I always take the time to research the drug and its results/side effects before taking it myself.  I do have faith in his abilities, but will still take the time to do my own research.
1	My primary care doctor is a family friend. He has also been my doctor for over 20 years and that I am aware of he has never lead me in the wrong direction. He might tell me something and then I will look it up and it will be what he says so therefore I tend to believe him. If I do the things he tells me to do I usually feel better.
1	i trust doctors because they know more than i do. i do not know what is wrong with me, just that something is not right. they have gone to school and received training to be able to help me, so i try to trust that they will not lead me astray. I have had mostly good experiences with doctors in the past, so i cant complain
-1	In all honesty, I do not currently have a primary care physician as I do not have health insurance. In general, I do trust the health profession however
-1	I just think that most doctors just want to get done with one paitent and then move on to the next. I also don't think that they listen very attentatively when you tell them something that doesn't agree with their preconceptions of the person they think the patient is.
1	My doctor has taken the Hippocratic oath, and I have no doubt that he is looking out for my best interests at all times.  If I had a negro doctor, I might feel differently, but I have always found the orientals to be trustworthy
1	I trust my primary care condition because it feels like she really cares about my health. She asks a lot of questions about any problems I have and doesn't rush to meet her next patient. She's very thorough.
-1	I have never been very close with any of my physicians, and I have had several miserable experiences with medical bureaucracy/billing, so I am more apt to view my exchange with a physician as a business exchange. 
1	I have been with my family Dr. for almost 20 years now. I know that he has my best interest at heart. 
-1	I do trust that our primary care physician is capable of making proper decisions involving health care if they were to take the time to do so. Often, issues are misdiagnosed or overlooked because they are in a rush. The same goes for the doctors support system, such as office staff. Many times they are so busy that they overlook completing there tasks such as calling in prescriptions or referrals.
-1	My doctor does not half ass his way just to get a job done. He actually talks to me and makes sure that I understand what is going on and what I need to do. Most physicians will look out for their patients because they are under their care and their reputation is on the line. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel like that I can tell them what I need to tell them. I trust in what ever I need to say to the doc.
-1	I believe they are trying to do a good job but the problem is they are always over booked so you have to be your own advocate and try to understand your condition.  You should also ask questions you have in mind.  After all it is your own body and your own health.  
1	She seems intelligent and puts a lot of thought into treatment. She researched my case before I see her and so I know that she cares and does what she can to give me the best advice.
-1	I have confidence and trust in my PCM, but I also have to weigh his recommendations against my own philosophy of life, and compare his diagnosis to what I research online form other experts in the field.
-1	My primary care physician is more interested in prescribing medication rather than preventative care. I feel like all he ever wants to do is give me some drug other than give me better life habit talks.
1	In the past several years, I have visited and communicated with my PCP for several times. I am satisfied with the experience of each visit. There is no way to complaint at all. I also communicate with other patients and they share the same opinion with me.
-1	Overall I trust the doctors I have see.  However, the last time I made a Dr's appt. the office scheduled me with  a PA, I did not like this because no one told me I wasn't seeing an MD,  therefore at this practice I they were not being truthful or honest with me, and will not be using this practice again. This did cause me to distrust them.
1	I feel that even though doctors are busy and rushed, and can't always possibly have enough time in the day, or in general, to give you the individualized attention you seek, they still know you depend on them. They value the importance you place on them and what they can provide, and they have a moral code that they abide by to make sure they give the best care possible. I know that doctors are also capable of making mistakes, and some doctors are better than others, but it would be an impossible task oftentimes to be able to find a doctor that would be able to give you the best individualized care and information possible in a manageable timeframe. It often feels like it's not necessary, either, as in most cases, with most people's problems, most doctors will suffice.
-1	Sometimes doctors lie for their own benefit, it is bad but it is definitely true. I do not fully trust them
-1	I changed to a new doctor last year. I have only seen him once. He seems professional and capable. On the whole, doctors have treated me effectively. But I still feel I need to ask lots of questions to make sure I understand what they are doing.
-1	I visit military clinics to see my primary care managers.  This means that they have no reason to mislead me.  However, they can sometimes be in a hurry to try and get to all their scheduled appointments on time.
1	My husband and I are currently going through fertility treatment so my primary care physician is a reproductive endocrinologist. She has an amazing track record of helping people get pregnant. She genuinely cares about us and celebrates victories and mourns losses with us. This makes me trust her and her opinions so much more.
1	He has been my primary care physician for my entire life. He has never let me down in the past so I have no reason to expect him to in the future. He is a reliable person overall.
1	I trust my primary care physician because when I told him about my coughing and inability to breathe, he actually took me seriously, unlike the previous three. Now I have two inhalers (maintenance steroid and emergency albuterol) that help me breathe better. That's all I want from a doctor: mutual respect enough to take me seriously when I say something is a problem. (And he doesn't pathologize my sexuality, which also helps.)
-1	I have had a longstanding relationship with my primary physician. He is knowable, experienced, intelligent and open. I feel comfortable discussing my health with my doctor as he is patient, kind and wise. I do, on occasion disagree with my physician and in most cases feel comfortable letting him know of and why I might disagree with him. Some times I may not speak up, and I guess that goes somewhat under the category of distrust but all in all I do trust my doctor. As far as other doctors are concerned, my trust level is on a case to case basis.
-1	The reasons why i trust my physician is because i have known him for a while. He has always been honest with me and my care. For that reason he is my daughters doctor as well.
-1	I haven't seen my doctor very often since I've been going to him for 2 years so it's hard for me to trust him. I have seen him 4 times in the 2 years. I don't know him very well, but from past experience, doctors in general don't know it all and are humans and make mistakes. 
-1	"I generally trust my doctor to prescribe what's best for me, but not to the fullest. I have sometimes felt like I was being rushed out the door instead of them hearing me out all the way. I have an anxiety issue that comes with very frightening chest pains occasionally. I was seen for this problem and had all my labs done and my heart checked out which ruled out anything ""serious."" I was put on medication for anxiety and not really followed up with. I stopped and just did the research for myself on what's wrong with me since my doctor couldn't seem to figure out what it was beyond anxiety."
-1	Well most of the doctors I've gone to in the last 20 years work at production mills. Get the patients in, give them some drugs, get them out. Treat as many people as possible in the given time.
-1	I have a medical condition with my back that no doctor has yet been able to help with. The last doctor I saw about this had me as a patient for two years. I followed his advice, consented to treatments, and did everything as he wished it and got 0 results. At the end he decided that he didnt know what was wrong with me exactly and I stopped seeing him. It only took thousands of dollars in treatments for him to figure out that the cash cow was dry. 
1	It's not a business that has a lot of corruption or under-the-table payments, so doctors have little reason to lie or sway you in a direction that's not beneficial to you.
1	I trust my doctor to know what is right for me because she generally chooses the option that she knows will be covered with insurance and tries to get me the best treatment while also considering my financial situation.
-1	Doctors are stuck within a system over which they have limited control. They have to consider the patient, the budget, and themselves.
1	My primary care physician has always been there for more over the years. I have been seeing him for almost 10 years now. He always cares about my well being and does everything he can to make sure I am in good physical and mental health.
-1	They spend so little time with patients that it's very tough to get to know a person's individual lifestyle and complete health profile. There is a lot of pressure to see many patients in a day which burdens doctors and leads them to rushed decisions.
-1	I have had concerns dismissed before without a good explanation, which is why I don't have 100% trust in my doctors, however, most of the time my doctor is willing to listen to me and provide the information that I need.
-1	"i trust most doctors, it depends on how they 'deal"" with me. As long as theyre willing to answer questions and not rush you out."
-1	I just started going to a new primary care physician this summer.  I was very impressed.  She took 15-20 minutes to just sit down and get to know me and my health history.  She seemed very knowledgeable and was very easy to talk to.
1	I have the best doctor. Recently had the flu, saw the doc and got medication. After four days my doctor called me at eight at night to see how I was doing. He treats me like family and I admire him so much.
-1	I feel that my doctor has my best intentions in mind. He helps me to feel better every day and prevents me from getting sick. I have full trust in  him.
1	My doctor has on multiple occasions spent more time with me than she had to to make sure I'm content or that she figures out what proper course of action is. If she doesn't know something she tells me and then seeks out other sources of information to help her make an informed decision.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician because she has been with my family for many years. She took over a practice from another older physician that helped my mother and needed to retire. 
1	I trust my doctor since they have the ability to know and they have the perspective to know whats going on
1	I have been working with her for a while so we've built up some level of trust. She seems very involved and concerned in my well being every time I meet with her. We go over all aspects of my care each time we meet, and she truly tries to help me solve the issues at hand. 
1	I trust our primary care physician but prefer to deal with her exclusively and not her Physician Assistants. The PA's that work at her medical office aren't quite as knowledgeable and don't provide the same level of thorough analysis required for our day to day health needs.
-1	It's just one person, and a single person can be wrong despite having good intentions. I would much rather know the opinion of multiple doctors or people with experience.
-1	I trust them to use the knowledge they have or to refer me to another who is more specilized. I would distrust if they felt they could handle all troubles.
-1	They know what's best for me. Even if they aren't totally honest about the best course of action, they still more about these things than I do.
-1	I have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I have been with this same doctor since I was a child and he has been very courteous and helpful with my medical needs. My doctor is located in a small facility so there are not that many patients he sees in a day. The care is very personal and positive. He has a way of talking to people that is very relaxing and comforting to everyone he sees. There has never been a time that I have doubted the advice or treatment he has given me.
-1	She is open to new studies and information. She listens to me. She stays on top of new information as much as she can herself. She will consult with others. 
-1	My doctor seems like a sincere individual who would not do anything to intentionally harm me.  He also seems to enjoy his job and be highly qualified.  He does not get frustrated when you ask him questions, and always has an answer ready.  Nonetheless, if i had a serious medical issue, i would of course get a second or third opinion.  This isnt because i distrust my doctor, it is just because i feel it would be the smart thing to do.
-1	I recently switched to a new primary care physician and am working on building trust after a previously bad experience with my former doctor. I also have intense anxiety and distrust in general.
-1	I donât really trust my doctors completely. They tend to never give me options and just go with what they want me to do. I went in for back pain and I asked to be sent to chiropractor, but she was a firm believer in physical therapy, so denied my request and sent me to physical therapy which didnât help and she still refuses to do what I think is right for my health. 
1	My doctor has always taken the time to sit and talk with me about any concerns I have regardless of the time crunch on her part.  She will walk me through different steps to take and even calls days later to check in to see how we are doing.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has always been open and honest with me. She listens to me carefully and is gentle and kind and patient with me. She's fairly young as well, which I like. She's not judgmental of me
-1	"I mainly distrust my primary care physician because about a year ago I was told I ""needed"" to get the HPV vaccine, which I declined after reading the side effects and there is no need for me to get it, I was left in the hospital room for 1 hour with ""reading materials"" on it and I had to go get my doctor so I could leave."
-1	I trust him because he talks to me like he really cares. He does everything with a computer so he is always looking at the screen to compare how I am at his visit and how I was at last visit. He keeps tabs on anything that has changed, he has warmed up personality wise over the years which is nice.
-1	There have been a few times I have seen my doctor with issues that seemed bad and felt unable to communicate to her how bad I felt. I often feel like she isn't really listening to me. Only to go on to another specialist type and find out she should have known how to help me with this problem. 
-1	I think that pharmaceutical companies have an unethical amount of control over doctors prescriptions and treatment methods for patients and most people are not inclined to bite the hand that feeds.
-1	I do not feel the doctors are very careful in doing exams. Sometimes they did not make the right dignosis.
1	As I mentioned earlier, I always wanted to be a doctor growing up and I even went as far as to enroll premed for 4 full time college years before I changed my mind.  I did not do this for money.  I did this because being a doctor always appealed to me.  I like to solve problems and the human body and what it is capable of astonishes me.  I like to think that most if not all doctors got into medicine for the same reasons.  They want to build that trust with their patients.  Without patients, they have no practice so I have to believe that they are to be trusted or else they would not have gone into medicine.
1	I have had a relationship with my primary care physician for many years.  Throughout those years I have never had a reason to question his care.  He is a straight shooter and tell you what you need to hear whether you want to hear it or not.
-1	I am woman who has given birth twice, i know what it is like to have a doctor want to induce labor because he will be on vacation on your due date. I have had nurses deny me crutches because they didn't believe my pain level. everyone is human, just because you work in the medical industry does not make you infallible.
-1	I think my doctor is well educated and has patients best interests at heart however I also think at time her own prejudices get in the way of effective treatment.
1	I've known for this doctor for years, and for the most part he has been quite helpful. Thereby, when he outlines a plan for me to follow, I generally follow it. There have mostly positive results. Thereby, increasing my trust in him. 
1	I have had the same primary care physician for quite some time. He is thorough, makes me feel comfortable, and is overall a great person. There's not a time when I'm at his office where I do not feel safe and at ease. He has never steered me in the wrong direction either. 
1	I generally trust my primary care physician because he is a friend of my family, and also my in laws. He asks how family is doing.  He is knowledgeable about any issues brought up, and is open to discussing all options available.  He is friendly and kind.  I don't feel that he is ever in a rush to get out of the appointment, and move on to other patients.
-1	I don't really trust them and find myself changing and getting second and third opinions all the time. I feel like the doctors don't really pay attention to what I am saying or use their head to think of outside the box ideas. Basically I tell them how I feel and they agree, they don't ask or think of ways or things my pain could be from. I could say that I feel like a horse and they would give me horse pulls.
-1	My issue is less a trust of the doctor themselves, and more of an institutionalization of thought. There are other ways to heal/treat people than what is typically catered to in a hospital, although a Doctor may not always be aware of them.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because we went to the same school and he seems like an honest and reasonable guy that I feel that i can relate to. He understands that i have a good knowledge of my health
1	I trust my doctor. I have my reasons for this. I trust my doctor because he will listen to me when I have questions that I need to ask. He is very generous and makes me feel like I'm important. I've been seeing my doctor for years now and never have I felt that I could not talk to him. I've been quite worried about a lot of things in the past and he has assured me that I was going to be alright.
1	My doctor has never given me conflicting or incorrect advice from what I can tell. He always spends a long time with me making sure that I have all concerns addressed. He is professional and courteous and I appreciate his work and attention.
-1	I trust my doctor in that I trust him or her to not harm me in any way. But in a world of referrals, its often easier to ship me off to a specialist and still charge me, then to actually do things that will help me. Sometimes a specialist can be the right call, and sometimes its just convenient for the doctor.     
1	 My primary care physician at this time is very patient and open to explaining things to me in ways I can understand.   She takes the time I need to make sure I am comprehending what she's explaining.   I feel safe asking her anything. 
-1	Doctors go through so many years of schooling and training and they are so knowledgeable you have to trust them.
1	My experience with my primary care doctor has been positive. She has not tried to push unwanted medications on me and she tells me exactly what she is thinking.
-1	I am assigned a dr through the military and dont really have a choice. I advocate for myself and only see them when sick.
-1	I've had several physicians over the years.  Most of them have always been trustworthy.  For example, I was taking ambien for many years for insomnia, and because my doctor truly had my best interest, she stopped filling my script and we opted for a different drug that was less addictive.  I have developed a lot of trust with her.
-1	He has made errors before because I have a specific chronic illness and see a separate specialist who treats it. My GP has increased medications to a level that is harmful due to my illness, or prescribed meds or treatments that contradict or react with my other meds. He also put me on three medications to lower my blood pressure at once, which caused my bp to drop so low so quickly that I had seizures.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that we can have made a connection over the past five years. He always tells me how it is with my physical condition and any issues that may be occurring in my life when I visit him. He is thorough with explaining all of my vitals, my lab results, my physical activity, and my history. In addition, he lets me know when I should start doing something different in my eating habits such as eating less fatty and sugary food items. I also think he cares about me when he gives me a serious look and starts critiquing my lifestyle.  
-1	I do not currently have a primary care physician.  Doctors that I have visited in the past seem to get stuck on one particular notion and don't listen well to what I feel.  Additionally, they are not interested in whether or not I can afford the test they are prescribing.
-1	I do not see my primary care doctor very often. I feel like my once a year checkin is not enough for me to build a relationship. 
1	I have a very high level of trust for my primary care physician. I have been seeing him off and on for over a decade now, and he has never been anything but polite, helpful, and understanding. Every time I have an appointment with him he makes sure all of my needs are met and that all of my questions are answered right there. I am very satisfied.
1	I have to trust my doctor because who else would I turn to when I have a medical  problem. If I don't trust my doctor, I would never check if I have a terrible disease and I could possibly die because of that. Basically, I trust my doctor because of necessity. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician. I have been for years with this physician. Through his appointments, there is no real reason for anyone to have to distrust my primary care physician at any point in time.
1	I do not have a primary care physician, but I have been to the doctor a few times in the past couple of years. Every time I have gone, I have been treated with respect, and the doctor has been honest with me every single time. I have no reason to distrust doctors in general, based on past experiences I have had with doctors. I have always gotten better when following a doctor's advice.
1	My doctors saved my life and I don't believe that 99.99% of doctors would give their patients anything but their best advice and information.
-1	My primary care physician is very busy.  I know that he has many patients.   I think he is thorough and careful but sometimes he may miss something due to being busy.   There is always other patients waiting whenever I visit him.  I always feel a bit rushed.   
1	I trust my doctor because I feel like he has my best interest and wants the best for me long term in my health.
-1	I tend not to trust doctors in general to a great degree. I have list family members to negligent care from doctors. I myself have a rare cardiovascular condition that most local doctors don't know a great deal about and, more importantly, don't try to learn. I feel very afraid overall and cannot be reassured by local doctors because of that reason. I have already had one major heart attack with cardiac arrest so one would think they would pay attention. 
1	I trust my doctor because she always lets me know the truth. Even though she tries to make me feel comfortable, she gives me the negative effects and tells me the truth about what can happen to me if I don't take care of myself.
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for 7 years and still to this day have never seen him I have only seen the physician assistant.  She does a great job but I think its funny I have never seen him
1	My doctor is very thorough at explaining my different treatment options and also understands her limitations. After working with her for sometime to find treatment for my migraines she referred me to a specialist who was able to help.
1	I have a military doctor, and I always think that being in the military, you can't always mess up things and you always think about the servicemember, and not your own self or convenience.
1	I trust my healthcare provider because I have been going to him for the past twenty plus some years. My doctors has always done what is best for me and never put his interest before my own health.
1	My primary care physician is the primary care physician for my grandparents, parents, aunt and uncle, brother, and cousins, and my cousin's wife was a nurse in my physician's office for several years. I've known him for more than twenty years, and my parents have known him for longer. He's always done his best with all of us, and he's always been kind and funny. I have no reason not to trust him.
-1	Doctors in far to big of a hurry. If you get ten minutes with the doctor I think you did very well. I feel they just push through to get to the next person so they can make that money.
1	My doctor has been in the area for a very long time.  My husband and I both go to him.  He has actually helped find the right diagnoses for something that has been overlooked for many many years.  He is thorough and takes his time talking to me about what I am there for.  He is well respected in the area.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he always listens to me and my concerns.  They have always been good at diagnosing and treating my illnesses.  They also make sure my prescriptions are always available for refills if necessary.
-1	Because we've known each other for a long time now and all of the treatments I've done from him have had no issues up to this point.  I trust my doctor to make the best recommendations for me and keep me healthy.
-1	Although currently I do not have a primary care provider, I have had many MANY throughout my 22 years of existence and there were so many that didn't know what the heck they were talking about. When I can go online and find medical documents from the actual US government along with WHO and the CDC to name a few, showing contradictory information to what I am told by a doctor, it starts to shake your faith in em. Then we also have to get into the deeper part of, do we trust the government? Do we trust WHO or the CDC? And if we do, should be believe them over our own doctors? Should we trust our doctors medical training was equal to or superior to the training of those that work for the government? Can we trust those workers even have credentials and how easily can that be faked or covered up? As you can see the reasons run very very deep and is much more than I care to type here.
1	We selected our primary care physician based on a recommendation from our daughter after we moved. We have been completely satisfied with the family practice (my wife and I have different doctors in the practice). From day one, I got along well with my physician. We bonded, I think, partly because I was teaching at his alma mater (after retiring from my full-time position elsewhere). He will lay out various treatment options in a fair and unbiased way and leave the decision to me. Have never ever felt rushed. He takes the time that is necessary and we also toss in a discussion of sports, which is fun and makes me feel very comfortable (especially compared to some snooty specialists I have met over the years).
-1	Doctors some times are required to focus on the bottom line and cost cutting rather than the well-being of patients. They do not necessarily want to do this, but in order to make a profit, they may have to. For instance, they may prescribe prescription drugs that are not necessary in order to bring in more of a profit. They may also give unnecessary tests in order to bill insurance companies. 
-1	I generally trust my doctor but sometimes I think he just does what is easy and convenient rather than what is necessarily best for me. I feel pretty good overall about trusting my doctor.
1	My doctor is very sincere and always go to the point.  She was very helpful with a health problem I was having for months, do all the tests and then recommended all the procedures available and what she thinks was the best for me.  It was my decision base on the information she gave me about all the procedures, secondary effects and results.  
1	Ive seen my doctor for a long time, since I was a child, so I feel very comfortable in their choices and opinions. They have never let me down before so I dont see why they would now. They've always taken good care of me in guiding on the right path and being very transparent.
-1	I trust the doctors to do what is best for me and to provide access to the right treatments, but I wish that everything is laid out and simplified.  I would like to just be told of the long term survival rates instead of having to wonder.  I hold myself back from that because i don't want to know.
-1	"i dont have a close relationship with my dr because im relatively healthy. So i only see her once a year. I dont even think she really remembers me. I think she just does a cursory job at my physical. I have had one health problem recently (gall bladder) she just said ""have it out"" she didnt discuss any other options she just referred me to a surgeon."
-1	I don't put too much trust in doctors because I know they get kickbacks from certain medications and don't always look out for their patients. I know they mean well, but sometimes they don't do what's best and I don't want to put myself in that risk over something small that I can treat.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I can talk to them and they will be honest. However, they are still busy and will push me off if I let her.
-1	"I trust my primary care physician because she is thorough. There is no ""t"" uncrossed or ""I"" undotted. She asks all of the necessary questions and has a great bed-side manner. So, by being thorough and caring I completely trust her."
-1	I do not have a primary care provider. i normally go to urgent care if I am sick or if I have an issue that needs to be addressed.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough and has helped me with a few medical problems that I've had. She is patient and kind.
-1	I just don't feel there is enough time. My MD books a lot of patients and is cognizant of the time and need to be quick. I don't often get a chance to sak all my questions.
1	They are my doctor and I do not believe that they would intentionally cause any harm. My doctor has a family and he seems to really care about people. I have no reason to not trust my doctor. 
1	I see my nurse practitioner instead of my doctor as my primary care provider.  I trust health care providers that are intelligent and kind and I prefer to understand all aspects before engaging in care.
1	She is quick but thorough, makes sure to explain anything if I need her to, doesnât if I donât, tells me what I should/shouldnât do not what I have to do/not do.
-1	I have been to many different doctors and a lot of them have told me that there have been things wrong with me that there were proven to not be. I was diagnosed with something then I went to a specialist that completely disproved the other doctors diagnosis. In my belief the doctor who originally diagnosed me was just trying to get more money from me and have me pay for treatment for a problem that I didnt even have.
-1	I don't really have a primary care physician but I did see an orthopedist last year.  I kind of felt that his wish to go through with the surgery made it more difficult for me to get him to talk about what my prognosis would be if I didn't have the surgery.
-1	Sometimes i feel doctors are so jaded by patients that they dont really take the time to listen and respond.
-1	I feel that the doctor has too many uncertain opinions at times. They run a practice and go by what you tell them and form opinions. However, some things they do know and i give them credit for.
-1	I havent been seeing my primary care physician for too long so it is very hard to gauge my level of trust in her. She is competent but, she lacks warmth. Im not sure I will continue seeing her
1	because mt dr tells me every detail and leaves nothing out. he is straight forward yet compassionate and carindg, and listens to all i say to hm
1	My current primary care doctor is the first to take my concerns seriously. He is doing everything he can for me so that we can find answers for the symptoms I have been experiencing. 
-1	I feel that doctors only want to run a lot of tests to make money or over fear of being sued. Doctors are normally very busy and rushed and do not give patients the time and care that they should. I am distrusting of doctors.
1	I trust my primary care physician because of how long i've known him. he's always welcoming and calming and i've he's always been honest with me and answered all of my questions.
-1	In terms of situations that aren't serious sometimes it would seem as though doctors may give a patient the runaround in order to make more money or help out other doctors or institutions.
-1	I don't trust my doctors decisions because he is always in a rush when he is visiting patients. He doesn't take the time to explain all my treatment options. When I tell him about symptoms that I have been feeling he doesn't do any tests or anything until months later. 
1	Of course I trust my doctor. What am I supposed to do otherwise? He or she has the education and experience to be able to best help me.
-1	I don't put total trust in any man, but for the most part I have a good relationship with my doctor and have been open with her.  We discuss treatments together and i can bring to her new treatments to discuss and together we decide. 
-1	The main reasons I trust my primary care physician is because they have been trained to deal with health issues and give helpful advice. I would only distrust advice about medication with side effects.
-1	I trust somewhat because they are trying.  However, I think they are sometimes rushed and it is difficult to get appointments on time.  I think they try but sometimes are short staffed as well.
-1	Overall I think my primary care doctor is thoughtful and knowledgeable and wants what's best for me. I do think it could be possible that she might miss something that could be wrong and I also don't know that she has the time to stay up on all of the latest treatment options. 
-1	I have trust in my primary care physician because is always straight forward and makes an effort to guide me to make good decisions and helps me weigh all different options that I have.
-1	I trust doctors to a point, i feel as if some doctors could use a bit more training and i do not always trust them.  All in all i do trust most doctors it just really depends on teh situation 
1	I trust my primary care physician because they always listed, answer my questions, and never seem to rush thru the appointment. If something is wrong, they always make a follow up phone call.
1	I'm not an expert as to what is okay for my body. If I thought I was dying, I would certainly think about their opinions of possible diagnosis or treatment that was available to me.
1	I've seen my doctor for over a decade now, and we get along great.  She's been a good help to me, and as far as I know has not ever guided me wrong.  I have no reason to doubt her. 
1	I trust my doctor at the VA because he is very thorough and if I don't ask enough or the right questions about things, he will start asking me relevant questions about what is going on with me. Things that I have complained about in the past, he will also cover with me to be sure that those issues have been addressed as well. Any test that is needed he will order and follow through to be sure that everything is up to date as needed.
-1	I trust her, though sometimes I think she rushes me through because I am very healthy.  However, on the whole, if I had a serious problem, I would absolutely trust her to give me the all the options and detail risks and concerns.
1	I trust my physician because they were the one able to get certain medical conditions under control while previous doctors have not. I have gotten better while under their care.
-1	I think that a doctor can make mistakes and sometimes it is easier to hide it from the patient. I have family members that work in a hospital and I already heard many stories that makes me worried about it.
1	I have seen my primary care physician for over 15 years and he always treats me with kindness and respect.  He will take the time to explain things to me in detail and help me decide the best route to take in my care.  He never rushes the visit and this makes me feel I can trust that he has my best interest at heart.
1	Mostly thinking of my pediatrician, but she has proven herself as knowledgable and deeply caring about our situation even though she is overwhelmed by other patients at the time.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he knows what he is doing, afterall, he did go to medical school. He has never given me a reason not to trust his judgement.
-1	My physician sometimes waffles or backtracks, which causes me to suspect her judgment on occasion. She has more than once recommended a certain treatment and then at a follow-up exam, has made statements about the treatment which caused me to wonder whether she actually believed in it or not. I do realize that doctors are just people, and sometimes not even terribly intelligent or competent, so I've trained myself to expect not quite so much from them as others may. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because we have had a successful patient-doctor relationship for about 5 years now. She has been open and honest about my condition and whatever treatment plans we may pursue for specific conditions. She tells me about the benefits, the side-effects, and what she thinks may be best for me. She also welcomes my input and will change our treatment plan based on what I tell her. I feel that I can tell her anything.
-1	The primary care physicians I have dealt with are overworked and unable to completely focus on one case at a time. That is the nature of health care today for all but the very rich. This is just the way it is. I feel responsible for knowing and researching as much as I can for my own good. 
-1	I trust all the doctors because they graduated because of something, although there are some that do not give me good impression
-1	I think doctors treat all bodies like if they are the same. Just because you have heartburn doesn't mean all patients should get the same pill. Doctors should look deeper into what lifestyle changes they can make and maybe certain prescriptions work well for some but not all.
-1	SHE DOES NOT LISTEN TO ME. WANTS ME OUT THE DOOR AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. RELYS ON BLOOD WORK AND NOTHING ELSE IT SEEMS. I ASK HER QUESTIONS AND SHE WILL ANSWER A COUPLE, BUT THEN GET SIDE TRACKED EASY OR GET ME SIDE TRACKED SO THAT I DONT ASK THE QUESTIONS AGAIN.
-1	Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I never put full trust in doctor's because they are human. They don't know everything and I always question.
-1	For a majority of my checkups they have constantly been meager issues that normally do not require a giant leap of faith. They are there and paid to help people I do not see how there's any opportunity to be malicious of any sort considering they're paid well, receive salary and must have some sort of love for their career path. Not to mention every single time I've ever gone to visit my primary care physician they have always assisted me no matter what and been effective each time.
1	I think my doctor does an excellent job of listening to me and following up.  I went in describing symptoms that I did not think added up to anything. She immediately ordered bloodwork for me and we learned that I have hypothyroidism. My doctor appears to really pay attention and I trust that she is working toward my best interests.
1	"I use a NP as my primary physician. She is awesome. She spends more time with me than other Doc's do and I never feel ""rushed"" through an appointment. She gives me as much time as I need when I see her. "
-1	I know most doctors are in this career for themselves and they'll prescribe high paying medications to profit. There are plenty of times when a doctor tries to rush the patient so they can go from one to the next without a proper diagnosis.
-1	For the first few years I had full confidence in my primary care doctor. In the past year or two she has taken on many more new patients, and as a result she is harder to contact and schedule appointments with. She spends less time with me during my appointments and the conversation can sometimes be rushed. I feel like due to time constraints, she often forgets to tell me something, such as a treatment option or type of medication that could be helpful to me. Because of this, I have lost some confidence in her ability as a health care provider.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has the experience to heal me whenever I am sick. I am not as informed and train as him, so I trust him tremendously. Also, he can examine me through scans and prescribe medicines.
-1	I do believe doctors want to help people. The issue I have is hospitals are driven by profit and people can be driven by rewards. So I may have high blood pressure but instead of trying to give me a diet to follow they go right for the medication. They do that because its a pay back to them. If I have pain in my knee the first thing I dont want is an opiod but thats the go to becasue there is so much money in it. So in all I trust them to help but I dont trust them to do it the cheapest or more reasonable way.
-1	I wouldn't completely trust my primary care physician or any doctor for that matter. While I have respect for their level of knowledge and expertise doctors are still just people and capable of making mistakes. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I know him very well. He is more than just my physician, he is my friend. The decisions he makes are in my best interest. 
1	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind at all times. I don't feel that I have ever experienced health care that had other intentions at heart. 
1	My primary care physician takes great care of me. She is attentive and remembers details and LISTENS to me. I have seen many other doctors whether walk-in or specialists who do not listen to what I say. If they do not listen to me, they can't possibly diagnose me correctly. If a doctor is dismissive or rude, I won't trust a word out of their mouth.I find a new doctor as soon as possible. Last year, I had a piece of my jaw come loose and fall out of my mouth (it was as horrible as it sounds), in the beginning it just hurt a lot, and I could see my bone through my gums. The male doctor I saw at the walk-in told me there was no way it was my jaw and I probably had a cankersore. I asked him to look and he glanced into my mouth without a flashlight. Yeah, I spat out a piece of my jaw a few weeks later after several appointments with an oral surgeon. 
1	I trust my doctor because I have known him for years, and he has cared for me the to the best of his ability.
-1	My PCP is thorough and detail-oriented, but I also feel like he dismisses what he sees as minor issues too easily. He's also quick to send me elsewhere to a specialist if anything even remotely complex comes up.
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because I have been with him for years, and we have developed a very realistic relationship. He has always been very honest with me in regards to my health, even if he knows it's not something I want to hear, and he portrays how much he cares during our visits. 
-1	I think he's okay; my main thing with him is he always wants to send me to a specialist. I know myself, I am not going to make 14 different appointments to get a PAP, a colonoscopy, a mammogram...it's just too much hassle. I would rather have all my health checkups done at one place. He does listen, but doesn't delve into things, like I take wellbutrin and I'm not sure that is the solution but he doesn't ask me about or recommend anything else. He's a nice guy, I'm just not overly enamored of him but it's too much work to find another Doctor. 
-1	"My current primary care physician worked in an ER. He still has the ""treat and street"" mentality. He will only go over any concern specific to what the appointment was originally scheduled for, and will not allow time to go over any new issues or concerns that I have. "
-1	They do not seem to listen to me often about what is wrong. Or think that family history of something is anything more than me being stupid and an huh strung
-1	Doctors I like in general, because I feel they honestly want to help others but they have to rely on what they are taught. What they're taught generally doesn't align with my health goals however. I generally expect doctors to prescribe medication of some sort for whatever the ailment might be. I can't trust any decisions that involve me taking medication. If doctors prescribed particular foods and natural things that could remedy the ailment, I may feel differently about trusting their decisions.
1	He has always been honest with me and tried to help me or sent me to someone who could help. He asks if I have questions and answers them. 
1	I trust my doctor because she goes the extra mile and has ordered tests be done just to be sure of something she thought. She has passion for what she does and has my health and well being as her top priority. 
-1	I lost trust in past doctor's because it became completely obvious that they had taken on too many patients and their time and attention lacked because of it. They started to care more about the money than anything else. I left that doctor and moved on to the one I am with now. I feel like she cares more about what I have to say, but she also kind of rushes through things. She just opened her practice so i'm afraid with time, she will get worse and not care as much anymore. Sometimes it seems like it really is all about the money with doctors. They are a few that really do care though. My kids' pediatrician is a great doctor and I wouldn't want them going anywhere else. I've met more doctors that didn't seem to care than doctors that really do seem to care. 
-1	i've visited my doctor a couple of times and I do feel like they really care about me as a person and want me to be healthy. I've not had any negative experiences with them and plan on continuing to go visit them annually or more often.
-1	I believe that my primary physician is completely capable and competent to execute his duties well. I do not doubt my doctor's conclusions.
-1	In general, doctors do not spend enough time with patients to get the WHOLE story, and sometimes a little tidbit of information that the patient might not seem to think is pertinent can make a diagnosis or a more appropriate treatment.
-1	I trust him to an extent, I mean i do go to him because he knows more about my body and what could be wrong with it, however he is pretty fresh out of school so he still lacks experience.
-1	I always trust my doctor. He has helped me deal with some very important health issues and always been so easy to recover. He is over all very very polite and very careful at my disorders.
-1	I have never really had a regular doctor, so I've never really gotten to know one very well. The doctor I have currently I like a great deal. I trust her decisions and she is very kind and explains things very well. I have only seen her a handful of times though.
-1	I generally trust that my doctor is trustworthy however during my pregnancy I did feel that I wasn't always presented with all the information or options due to her preconceived notions about my twin pregnancy and age. 
-1	I like and generally trust my PCP as a person, because he seems honest and he really does know a lot.  However, looking at him as a physician, I can't honestly say that I trust any doctor completely.  This is mainly because of the constraints put on them by insurance and ideology as well as the influence of Big Pharma, but it also has to do with their patient load and how exhausted they might be.  I know I don't think well when I'm exhausted, and neither will any doctor.  
-1	she is more than willing to answer any questions, and seems like she knows her stuff, thought I feel like she could care more for me, spending more time when I visit.
-1	Well i think i have to trust him because he knows what he is doing. I think I'm kind of safe trusting him and his methods. 
-1	They make their choices baswd on their best knowledge. Sometimes they can be wrong. I only put complete trust in God.
-1	In general, I see doctors as people doing a job. A PCP does not usually have deep knowledge about whatever specific problem you're having, but they are able to refer you to a specialist who can possibly help you if you need it. PCPs are basically drug dealers for the pharmaceutical companies.
1	I trust his expertise when it comes to health and what he has to say to me. Normally doctors have a great degree of training and experience. Now and then they may mess up but it is rare. My particular doctor i trust very much and he would always be honest with me.
-1	I trust my doctor enough to be able to accociate basic common symptoms and figure out the a good approach to taking care of those symptoms. I do believe the pharmacist have a much better understanding the scripts that they write out.
1	I trust my doctor because I feel he knows much more about medical care than I.  If he doesn't have an answer to a medical problem he will send me to another doctor that can help me.
1	I trust my primary care physician because if I didn't, then who else would I go to. In general, to me, it is very important to trust in the people who take of you, especially doctors who have done their job for a very long time. I trust mine because I know she has the best interest of my health and in helping me out when I need it.
-1	I have no reason to mot trust him. He has been p[en gentle kind and sesitive to my conditions. I have no doubts about my trust in him
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for 15 years.  Over this time I have built trust in his diagnosis and treatment options.
-1	I trust the doctor will help me make the best decision for my health. However, they are human and have feelings sometimes that influence their opinion. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he's never given me a reason to distrust him.  I don't believe he values me above all else, and certainly he cuts corners/time/doesn't explain EVERY possible option every time, but he always tells me the relevant information I need.
-1	I had a couple of negative experiences with doctors, but overall my experiences have been very positive. My doctor is very thorough, takes time to answer questions and discuss concerns, and never made me feel like I was being rushed, or like a number.
-1	I don't trust my current psychiatrist. I changed to him for the convenience of his location to my home as opposed to the 1/2 hour I spent trying to get to my other psychiatrist's office. So I changed doctor's for medication management. The doctor called my pharmacy, found out the medications I was currently on, and prescribed those to me. He does not ask me how I feel when I see him or anything really about my life like my last psychiatrist. I don't feel like I am anything other than an insurance payment to him. 
1	I trust my doctor completely because he has always been honest with me and always helped with any medical problems that come up. Also because you can call him at any time and he will come to the office to help any patient that needs it.
1	I don't have a primary care physician but generally trust doctors. Most doctors, I believe, go into their profession because they are interested in helping people. Still I am sure to research treatments outside of my time at the doctor's office. Even when doctors are perceived as trustworthy, I think it's important to be informed and proactive in your treatment.
-1	I trust my primary physician to do her best but no one is perfect and everyone has flaws, so I don't completely trust her because she can make a mistake due to human error.
-1	they don't really know much more than i do and they treat us all like commodities if they see one condition in one person and the same condition in another person they treat it like the same thing but it is not they are just humans.
-1	I trust my doctor because I see him every day at work, and we have a friendship outside of work. If you can't trust someone at happy hour, then where can you trust him? Especially when it comes to doctors. 
-1	Doctors only know what they are taught and rarely, in my experiences, actually do more research.  As a result, I dont have much trust in drs.
1	He has always been correct in the past.  He treats me with respect.  He does not order unnecessary tests, but does order those that cannot or should not be avoided.
-1	I trust my doctor because she genuinely seems like a good person, based on my past interactions with her. Though, between you and me, I wish she'd check my man parts during physicals like my old male doctor did.
-1	Well in general I do not trust people. But overall I trust what he is saying. I will get a prescription if I must on his recommendation. I will go see him from time to time to check up. But I don't believe everything sometimes I take my own advice as well.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that she takes her position seriously and tries her best to make thoughtful and accurate diagnosis's. 
-1	I generally don't trust people, but my primary care doctor seems pretty trustworthy. She tells it straight up and that's important to me.
-1	Most doctors have a patients best interest at heart but many have become nothing but car sales man that deal out drugs because of kickbacks and free samples
-1	"Other than those who wish others did not think I do not know what trust is.  I have severe problems with medical professionals as with all fields and would never trust anyone in any ""position"".  The idea itself upsets me."
1	She is very kind.  She is able and willing to answer any questions that I might have about my care.  She has never hesitated to tell me the truth about what is going on, and does it in a way that makes me feel as comfortable as possible.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough. She runs extensive tests when needed and rules out the worst possible scenario first. She takes time to talk with me, explain things and answer questions.
-1	I trust him because he is qualified. HIs advices in the past have been good for me. I have benefitted from listening to his advices.
1	I expect most doctors, especially ones I have carefully chosen to see, to be an expert in their field, to know what they are talking about. Most people go into situations thinking this about doctors. I am generally trusting of the doctors that I see, unless they give me reasons to not think this.
-1	I don't have a PCP. I  have no insurance so I have to visit clinics and see different nurses, almost never a doctor. I can't think of a time I've seen a doctor. I generally trust the nurses because the conditions I've had are fairly simple to treat. I went in knowing I needed some kind of antibiotic so it was easy to trust the diagnosis. 
-1	I generally trust what the doctor says.  Sometimes I have doubts because I spend so little time actually talking to them I feel like they dont have a complete picture of me and my problem.
1	My doctor has my best interest at heart. Why wouldn't she? If she did something that would cause me harm, she would get in trouble and potentially sued. She is a doctor because she cares about people and wants to help them.
-1	EVERY altercation I have had with a doctor, I have felt like they aren't really listening to me. They will look at their clip board and nod their head and stuff, but not actually hear what I'm saying. If they ask me a question and I don't answer it the way they think, they will say I'm lying. I dislike Doctors so much because they ALL just do the bare minimum and don't treat people like humans, but as another task before lunch break. 
-1	They are highly educated so I trust them, however, anyone can have a bad day where they don't do their jobs well.  Doctors are no exception to these rules.  They some times are going to make bad calls and so I can't 100% trust any doctor.
-1	sometimes he seems like he does not listen to me, he is kind of quirky and i call him spaceman. i tell him something and he goes on to the next subject like he did not hear what i said.
-1	I distrust my primary care physician because I have gone to them before about an issue and they could not give me any answers, years later I went to a specialist and they were able to tell me what it was immediately. I kind of think my doctor is incompetent and doesn't care for me much. I also think a lot of doctors are just there to make money and only recommend medications that sponsor them. 
-1	I feel like doctors don't treat you as a person, they treat you by how they judge you when you first come in. They already have you figured out and they won't listen to you no matter what they say. 
-1	Its not so much a matter of Trust or Mistrust.  It's not black and white like that.  Its about enhancing and verifying information.  Just because I verify a doctors findings through my own research doesn't mean I do not trust them.  I'm um....Intuitive.
-1	They're out for themselves. Whatever brings in the money to pay off their student loans is what matters, especially the kickbacks from pharmaceuticals . The American people are just cattle strolling into their butcher shop.
-1	I dont always trust doctors because I feel like sometimes they just want to give us medicine without being sure what's really wrong.  They also rarely give ideas to help before giving the medicine.
1	I trust my primary physician because I've seen him ever since I was an early teenager. He knows me very well and a lot of my habits both good and bad. He was critical in getting through high school and college with all the necessary vaccines and STD prevention tools, and has always been very open and engaging. It's almost like talking to an old friend where you feel like you can be yourself and open. This really helps in getting across to each other better, and allows him to more easily attune his prescriptions and medical diagnosis' to my situations. I think a lot of people tend to see their doctor as just a means to get medication when they need it, but I think a lot of people fail to realize just how beneficial it can be to have a doctor you trust and is willing to go that extra mile to help you.
1	I trust my PCP a lot. He has been my PCP since I was a teenager. My family have always used him and we kind of feel like his is a friend of the family. He isn't, but it feels that way. He hasn't ever led us wrong and even prevented my father from losing his foot at one point.
1	I've had the same doctor for 16 years, and so far he hasn't given me any reason not to trust him. I have been extremely healthy for all of those years too though so he hasn't had much of a chance to be wrong. Overall I'm comfortable with him, and feel like he does a good job.
1	I trust my primary care physician for 100%. We have a relationship for 3 years now where I have been through some health problems. She has always helped me on a basis of honesty and telling me openly what the options wheree. She also gave me a great deal of input in the decisions that had to be made.. 
-1	I'm a skeptic by nature, and I know that human beings are prone to making mistakes. However, I trust that my primary physician's medical knowledge is much better than my own, so I respect his judgement and analysis. As with anything, I like evidence and data-based reasons to believe and trust things. As long as he can provide that to me, I'm likely to trust more. Otherwise, I remain skeptical by nature. Even so, I am likely to take his advice even if I disagree with it, if it may end up benefiting me, and the risk is low. If it's a matter of life and death and I don't like his judgement, I may try to find a second or third opinion.
1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEY HAVE MORE ACKNOWLEDGES AND MORE EXPERIENCES. I THINK THEY WILL DO THEIR BEST TO HELP ME GET BETTER HEALTH.
-1	I typically trust my doctor but there are times that the prescribed treatment seems inadequate. It's good to find a doctor that you like and trust. It takes a while but a doctor that is willing to put time in with you could be a lifesaver.
-1	When talking to others about their experiences with their primary care physician, I know mine is better. My doctor takes what I say seriously and examines them. She makes sure that I take all the necessary tests and she scolds me when she feels that I am not taking my health seriously. I told her that I was having chest pains but that it is probably anxiety or heartburn. She made me that an EKG and based on those results, an ultrasound.
1	I have had no problems in the past with my doctor. He has always been straight forward with me and laid out the different options I have for dealing with medical issues.
1	I feel like most doctors have the patients best interests in mind.  I know some doctors are only here for the pay and try to make money any way possible but, I tend to have a lot of faith in people and trust doctors unless they give me a reason not to.
1	I have been seeing my GP for nearly twenty years, and I feel like we have a good rapport with each other. I can ask questions and offer theories and she gives them serious consideration because she knows that I am self-aware, and that I'm not not dramatic or prone to exaggeration.
1	I get a strong sense from my physician that he truly listens to me, wants to engage my thoughts, and has my best interests in mind. Moreover, my questions are welcome and his explanations are clear. This is why I trust my physician. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable about my conditions.  She's also a great listener and asks me thorough questions to get to the bottom of things.  I've never had a problem with her, nor have I been given any reason  not to trust her.  She gets my input before all procedures.
-1	I feel that since the practice I go to has switched/been bought by or covered by a certain medical group, the quality of care has greatly declined, and I've noticed several subtle and some not so subtle changes for the worse. I have gone in so many times trying to figure out what is causing my body some negative problems (pain, easily fatigued, etc) and I just keep getting the run around, it seems. I am considering finding a medical practice that hasn't yet been bought out or taken over by the specific umbrella medical group, which has been difficult. I don't believe that prescription drugs that just bandaid a situation are the answer. I don't like to take a bunch of Rx, and would appreciate some direction from my physicians, but haven't gotten much help in that dept.
-1	Doctor are human. As human beings, they have their own personalities and agendas that are not entirely conducive to another persons needs or health. Therefore, their actions and advice require some consideration in the larger picture. One must take responsibility for one's health regardless of another person's opinion of your health. I guess we should all be doctors for our own sake...whether we like it or not.
1	I have a general positive trust for my doctor. I don't think she'd ever intentionally give me misinformation or mislead me. I've never had a concern with this and feel like she's always helpful and informative.
1	I trust my doctor because he is not too quick to prescribe drugs.  If there is a natural approach to fix the problem he will give safe suggestions to try before encouraging a drug fix to the problem.  And what he has suggested has worked for the most part.
-1	I really dont trust them because they never give natural remedies. They always go straight to medicine which is not good for your body. 
-1	I don't en general trust very many doctors, too often they are misdiagnosing or diagnosing based on getting paid from drug companies. I don't want unnecessary treatments or drugs. 
-1	A few years ago, my mother's former cardiologist recommended that she have open heart surgery based on faulty results of an echo cardiogram. He was also not truthful about the surgical options available either. We confirmed this first through internet research, then with a leading heart surgeon at a highly-rated cardiac hospital. The end result was that my mother did not need heart surgery at all and after twice-yearly echo cardiograms with a different cardiologist, still does not require it. I have less drastic but similar experiences in the past with doctors. Unfortunately this has given me a healthy amount of distrust for what I'm initially told. I will always research topics myself, ask many questions and seek 2nd opinions.
-1	I have experienced hospital and doctor errors so I am now far more careful.  Those errors were significant -- such as not doing a screen of the chest of my husband when he had head/neck cancer, a failure that impacted the treatment given him.
1	My doctor has never shown me a reason to distrust her. When I visit her, she never makes me wait long, she is timely and responsible to any issues I have. If I call her office for a refill, I never have to make a second call like at some doctor's offices. Her staff are professional and responsive. I am quite happy with my primate care physician.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been going to her for almost ten years. She usually takes the time to explain things to me and make sure I am comfortable with the decisions that we make.
1	I trust them because I know along with experience and schooling they have the know how to take care of me. I have not had a negative experience yet with my doctor so no reason to distrust them.
1	I think there are so many laws now that the doctors and my doctor are very thorough and honest. It also helps he is very kind and respectable. 
-1	Doctors are people too, typically I believe they are trustworthy and what they say is knowledgeable but they can still have areas where they do not know much about, like nutrition. Also, doctors are heavily lobbied by pharmacy reps to peddle their product.
1	My primary care provider is always careful in prescribing medication, since I take so many of them (20+ prescription meds). She listens to my concerns, is always thorough in her examination of me, and never makes me feel like I'm just another line item on her checklist. While I've been treated by everyone at the practice, I like her the best.
-1	i suspect that doctors in general are influenced by financial interests when recommending treatment options and prescribing medication. i also suspect that many doctors make assumptions without thorough examination sometimes because of heavy workloads or personal bias.
1	I trust my doctor because he seems very knowledgeable whenever I need to consult him.  He has been the doctor of my mother and grandparents for a number of years and has always done right by them.  I find that when I communicate clearly with him he is easy to understand and is easily able to diagnose my issue.
1	My doctor has always shown care and concern for me. She has never once brushed aside my feelings or acted as if I was stupid. She has always taken time to answer my questions. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because i have known them my entire life. I can understand some people not trusting doctors in general because it seems a lot more of them these days are just trying to make every dollar they can off of their patients. 
-1	I don't have a whole of interaction with my primary doc (barely a checkup a year), and not many problems (yet), so there's nothing really controversial I wouldn't trust about her diagnoses and prescriptions. Sometimes she does miss items in my history and wanted to prescribe something that wouldn't be a good idea, but I point this out.
-1	I canât say that I have complete trust in my doctor. I know my doctor cares to talk me through my concerns and issues but there have been times that I have felt that my doctor was not as talkative or seemed to be in a hurry more than other times. My doctor has at times discussed different things to try for me and told me the good and bad about the treatments and Iâve never felt that she tried to push anything on me just explaining the benefits and so forth and let me take it from there.
1	he is always friendly, upfront about anything I ask him. He always gives me an honest opinion about medications and leaves it up to me if I should take them or not.
1	I do trust my primary care physician. Mainly because she takes the time to listen to what I have to say. And responds to me as if I'm a friend and not a medical record number.
1	I have seen my primary care physician for a few years now, and have only seen my health improve during this time. I have had no reason to distrust her or feel that her opinions of me are biased in any way. She has always been open to any questions I have, and has been willing to look at a variety of options for medical issues that I have had, and adjust things based on how I feel. She'll check in to make sure that I've followed up with other appointments as necessary, and I just generally tend to feel that she really cares about her patients. I don't feel like I'm in a rush, and she always treats me like a person, not just part of her job, which I appreciate. I've also looked online and she's had good ratings from other people, as well as working with a highly rated medical group that other members of my family have gone to as well. I feel like she has the resources available to help with any treatment I may need, and has utilized them in the past when she thought some other specialist may be of more help than she is. Prior to this, I didn't have good experiences with doctors. They tended not to listen to my problems, and were quick to make assumptions. In one case, a doctor refused to listen to the fact that I believed I was allergic to a medication I was taking, and I actually ended up in the ER. This current doctor is the first one that I feel listens and is actually willing to help with any issues that I have come up.
-1	There is a hidden agenda in the medical practice in which medications are pushed for revenue, this is not necessarily a bad thing but it does make one accept most pill-based medications with a grain of salt.
-1	I always find that I have to do more research about different treatments for any ailments I might have.  I don't find that my doctor spends enough time talking to me about choices of medications or options for treatments.  I always feel rushed and that my doctor is not confident enough to recommend any treatments or anything to me regarding my health.
1	"Hard to comment on doctors in general, since I believe a lot of them don't do a lot of research on drugs and were not trained in preventative care outside of ""take this pill."" I try to seek out physicians who are also trained in natural care and prevention. My primary care doctor is Chinese with both a Chinese and US medical degree, but very unconventional. I trust what he says because my overall heath and well being has actually improved. I am 71 with very little degenerative arthritis, normal blood sugar/cholesterol and plaque-free carotid arteries. So I do trust him and the other health specialists that I see"
-1	I know that my primary care physician is qualified to do his job, as he has gone through the necessary schooling and training to gain the expertise for his position. However, I also realize that medicinal knowledge is vast, and that doctors only see me for a few minutes and therefore do not have the deep analytical insight that would make me fully trust them.
-1	I have repeatedly had issues (not serious) that were not helped by my doctor. I ended up figuring out what would help me, and I got better using alternative or holistic things that completely cleared the issue. I have also been repeatedly prescribed medicine that had severe side effects or addictive qualities, and was not told about it. Because I read - a LOT - I declined to take the meds because of this.
1	My doctor is very willing to spend extra time with me discussing things that I am unclear on or need extra help with. I am able to ask about alternative treatments or additional ideas on how to get better when I am sick or injured. He listens without judgement and shows that he cares.
-1	I trust my primary care physician but sometimes they are so quick in seeing me that I worry about not getting all the care I actually need.
1	I have known him for a long time now. He has often been honest to me about my weight and that I should try harder to manage it.
-1	"It seems like doctors are more interested in seeing as many patients as they can in a day than taking time to really think about what a patient is telling them. It's been a long time since I've seen a doctor who didn't seem rushed and eager to hurry up and go on to the next patient. I think because of this they are quick to farm us out to specialists for things that primary care doctors used to be able to take care of in their own offices, and to make snap judgements about a person's condition rather than take the time to think about what else could be wrong. More and more of them will even tell you whatever is wrong is ""stress"" or that they can't find anything wrong with you, but later if you see another doctor they DO find something legitimately wrong."
-1	I dont feel like my doctor wants to talk for too long. Just that they think everything is ok or not. They do provide options for allergies though.
1	I trust my doctors because  they know more than I do about the situation, and if I express concern they explain the thinking process and differentials that they are concerned about allowing them to reach the conclusions that they do. 
-1	In my experywith him he never made any decision or recommended any medical decision that was not for my best
-1	I only see my primary care doctor briefly, once per year for a physical. I feel she is polite and knowledgeable, but that she is often dismissive of my concerns. I trust medical professionals who I see on a more regular basis, such as my chiropractor, because they are exposed to me more frequently. I also recently went to urgent care for a matter that my doctor dismissed and received more effective treatment from urgent care. 
1	"I trust my doctor because she gives me answers without ""sugar coating"" anything, she tells me how good or bad things really are. She gives me options as far as what kind of medicines I should take, like how I want to only take medicine in the evening and not any in the morning. If something is not right for me she is very willing to have me try something else. She is not one of those doctors that always has to be right, with rigid opinions. She is flexible and willing to work with me."
1	I have had the same doctor for awhile now so i just know her really well and feel comfortable enough with her to trust her
-1	I trust him generally because he does help me a lot. but at the end of the day it is a profession and he needs to make money so sometimes i feel he is in a rush to get to the next patient. that could just be me though also he seems to quick to prescribe meds
-1	One primary reason I have lost trust in my PCP is the fact that I have had surgery for the same reason twice now within three years and really need it again.  I went to an emergency room and the physician there asked me why I had to have the same surgery so close together and I couldn't tell him.  He mentioned that it was unusual for that type of surgery.  This made me contemplate a new option when I go back for the same reason.
1	My primary care doctor has always put my best interest first. He listens to my concerns and all my symptoms makes sure I have all the appropriate test ran in a timely matter and fully explains everything to me.
-1	My primary physician is fine.  But after my health catastrophe experience, where I had one of the TOP DOCs in the country and refused to do what he recommended, to my everlasting satisfaction, while my wife stood beside and cried, begging me to do what he told me to, I don't trust doctors further than I can throw them.
-1	I know that he is very busy with a lot of patients, so maybe he just jumps to a treatment that  he thinks might work. For instance, I used to have a lot of digestive issues and such, and I don't think he asked once what my diet was like. Instead, he put me on pills for depression. Don't get me wrong, I needed those as well, but looking back, I think diet had a lot to do with it as well.
-1	In general I have a great deal of faith in doctors, but I know they are very busy and there is an intense amount of knowledge they would need to synthesize in order to truly be able to find the best course of action for everyone. I believe they try very hard, but from personal experience I know that often several courses of treatment need to be tried before the right one is found. I don't think badly of doctors for this, nor do I think it is from neglect or mal-intent. I think it is just a result of the complicated workings of the body and the fast amoutn of medical knowledge that exists.
-1	I have been with them through multiple appointments and issues. He looks out for what is the best for me, and I trust him and his diagnosis. He has soothed my worries and worked to make sure I am helahty. I have complete trust
1	She spends the time necessary to make sure I understand everything we talk about and about treatment options.  She herself always calls me with test results and asks if I have any questions.  She never makes me feel rushed. 
-1	In general, I trust the profession but physicians are people - they can make mistakes and they may not always interpret symptoms correctly.   The more you interact, the higher the trust level can become.
1	I trust this doctor completely.  She makes sure we get to the bottom of any problems that I am having.  She also like to rule out possibilities when faced with certain symptoms.  She is very caring, kind and listens to what I have to say.  She doesn't talk to me like I'm a child.  She explains everything. 
1	My doctor is honest and open with me. He seems to provide all options regarding care and doesn't refrain from telling me things that may be difficult for me to hear. 
1	My doctor has been my primary care physician for over 20 years. Sometimes, she does seem to rush, but not often. She's been there for me through illnesses and injuries and always taken care of me.
-1	I don't have a primary car physician.  I haven't had one in over a decade.  My doctor left the practice and I was switched to someone else without my knowledge or opinion and then they moved to a different location and 'lost' me as a patient and wasn't accepting new patients.  I've always left appointments feeling like I'd been let down in my interactions with doctors.  
-1	I trust my doctor to an extent because she has her own motives as well. Sometimes nothing is wrong  but she is addresses it because she wants the additional money, something she admitted to my husband who works in her office. So, I feel that all doctors probably think the same way. So, I could be worrying about an issue because my doctor, who already gets paid very well, wanted more money.
-1	I really try and put faith into what they are telling me.  I have been known to challenge them somewhat if the diagnoses does not make any sense to me.
-1	One of the reasons is because the physician seeks to find ways or things that are beneficial. Sometimes certain information is held back for the sake of not telling everything in order to gain more power that gives the physician the upper hand. That is my speculation based on a lot of things that are taking place today. 
-1	I distrust my doctor because he may only be doing it for money or trying to finish up his work so he can move on to the next patient.
1	She is very thorough in her exams and tests for everything. I would rather someone be too thorough and have nothing come up than slack off and miss something. She is very knowledgeable and has not given me a reason to distrust her. She reviews side effects of medications thoroughly and even goes over medications that have been prescribed to me by other doctors. 
-1	There have been mistakes made with my care that have resulted in a need for more medical services.  I am somewhat jaded with respect to receiving medical care.  
1	I trust my doctor because he has always steered me right and will do his best to avoid putting me through a procedure that I don't actually need. While he could make more money doing so, he will be honest with me in telling me whether or not I need something done or not. 
-1	Well I trust them because I expect them to be professionals and know what they're talking about. But at the same time I have gotten second opinions and wouldn't hesitate to do so again in the future because it's always better to be safe than sorry in my opinion.
1	I just generally trust the profession.  I believe that almost all doctors are primarily concerned with the well being and proper treatment of their patients.  There may be exceptions to that general rule but there would have to be irrefutable evidence to that effect to make me doubt the sincerity if not the competence of any physician.
-1	I have been under this doctor's care for over 10 years.  He inherited me as a patient from my previous physician, who retired. I was one of his first patients and we have become friends.  I have learned to trust him, and have never found his diagnostic instincts to be in error.  He knows when to treat me for a problem, and when to leave me alone.  He is a kind human being and a good physician.
1	I trust my primary care doctors because he has always been straight with me. He listens to me and answers all of my questions. If he doesn't know he finds out and tells me later.
-1	I trust my physician to a degree.  However, she tends to send me out to specialists a lot...which makes me wonder how much she is really able to treat.  If I have a cough, sniffle or fever, she's fine.  If it goes beyond that....hmmmmm.
-1	Like I stated in the earlier essay question, in my experience with health care professionals (doctor's moreso than nurses), they tend to either ignore or downplay my questions and concerns. This angers me because I'm intelligent and I am great at researching, so I believe that my questions and concerns are well-founded and based on facts.
-1	"I often feel like doctors care more about their time and money that the patient. It can be difficult to talk in depth about medical problems because my doctor is looking for a ""quick fix"" rather than a long term solution."
1	I trust my doctor. He tells me whats going on in a straight forward manner. He explains anything I do not understand and answers any other questions that I may have.
-1	I distrust my PCP because doctor's today have to think first about appeasing insurance providers and covered procedures in a health insurance policy as opposed to what is best for the patient. As a result of this I don't think my Doctor's word can be trusted.
-1	I have a doctor that will really listen to me and will sit an evaluate my situation and symptoms with me while explaining everything.  She is great at making me feel like she really cares and tries so hard to do what's best for me and figure out the best treatment plan for me. 
-1	I do have complete trust in my primary care physician. I believe that they are the most capable person to diagnose and treat my medical conditions and that they have my best interests in mind.
1	I trust my primary care physicians because we have a mutual trust of respect and friendliness. I find that if I empathize with them and ask then questions in a friendly manner, they are always eager to listen and advise me best on how to proceed.
-1	There have been times where I don't think he payed full attention to what I explained to him, then had me do tests that were incomplete only to redo them again the next time when they failed to find anything. This ties in with my belief that he is rushed and therefore I feel rushed as well.
-1	My doctor is very thorough and I am pretty confident in her abilities as a doctor. I have gone to her for many different ailments I have had and she has always prescribed or ordered the right tests for me.
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part but they aren't the most open minded when it comes to alternative therapies.
1	I trust my doctor because I believe he cares.   He seems down to earth and he showed concern when he saw I had too high amounts of cholesterol in my blood.   Also he seems to provide good advice that has helped me in the past. 
-1	I don't know my primary care physician very well, so have developed complete trust in her. She's new to me, as my previous physician left for a job in another community and no longer is in my insurance network. Therefore, I am back to rebuilding trust in a physician.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because would have built a relationship over many years. I have come to trust them and their decisions regarding my healthcare. I always consult them in health related matters. 
1	I have been to the doctor many times in the past and there has never really ben any issues.  I have been provided good information and treated the way I would want to be treated.  There has been no reason to not trust him in the past so I will continue to trust until proven otherwise.
-1	I feel doctors are too drug orientated and therefore I tend to distrust their judgement if it does not include alternative or natural treatments. As I have experienced a lot of success in treating my own health issues naturally without drugs I tend to refuse any advice from a doctor that relies heavily on drugs.
-1	I feel like sometimes he's in a rush and just wants to move on to the next patient.  He addresses issues but I don't feel like he's being thorough and thinking through his answers.
-1	I prefer to trust my PCP because they can come up with the diagnosis of what's wrong with me and can prescribe me the right medication or other additional help that I need. They have more experience in their field and should be good at what they do. 
-1	I have advanced lung disease and I often feel that the doctor has not taken the time to really look over my files and/or learn about my condition.   For example, he recommended the Shingles vaccine for me and I had to inform him that because I am on steroids I cannot have the vaccine.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician anymore so I will just go with my neurologist.When I started going to her I was on all the wrong medicines all of my Drs before her were just throwing pills at me hoping for the best, I was even on a medication that was so outdated they only prescribed for cases where nothing else would work. She changed all of that in just one visit by putting me on all new medication. She even took care of my constant headaches and other little issues that I thought where just there for life.
-1	My doctor is very thorough, when he makes a diagnosis he will tell you why and why not it is or isnt and what treatment he thinks will work,  He is very open about his opinions and ideas, and if something doesnt work he will quickly try a different treatment or diagnosis. Wether its something I want to hear or not, he will tell me, and provide his best opinion on how to cope with it.
1	My doctor has made efforts to connect with other doctors treating me for various issues, and she spends as much time as necessary with me during appointments.
1	Before she retired, I had a good relationship with my former primary care.  She was very open with me and worked with me to better my help.  I really trusted her.  Now she is gone and I'm back at square one with no one I trust.
-1	I think in general most physicians have their patients' best interest in mind.  They are dedicated to providing quality care.  However, some doctors may be more concerned with profits and payments from drug industries so it is important to ask questions.  
-1	"I have gone to see my doctor about trouble i am having that had nothing to do with my weight, however he will always tell me something about ""loosing weight will make you feel better"" or connect everything to my weight. I already know loosing weight will make me feel better, i have lost 81 pounds and feel alot better, but can you please just help me with the problem i actually came in for! Speaking of loosing weight, he has tried several times to convince me that i should change my diet from eating moderate protein and high fat, to something that includes more vegetables. Meanwhile when i was a vegetarian i was still pre diabetic and overweight, but now that i only eat meat i am no longer a risk for getting diabetes, as a doctor i would think he would be convinced by that proof, but he still tries to convince me i am wrig and tries to get me to take meds i don't think i need."
-1	Doctors are nothing more than amateur golfers who are also sales reps for pharmaceutical companies. They could care less about patient care and well being. They are only interested in getting you on prescription medications and having you come in to their office as often as possible while doing nothing beyond billing you and your insurance companies.
-1	My primary care physician shows a genuine interest in me. She shows that she cares about health, calories, weight and healthy food. I trust her.
-1	I've been seeing a D O instead of an MD for over 8 years. He use to just come in and make a few notes, get up, leave and then come back with prescriptions. Unless, I had a cold or rash or the kidney stone that one time. He believed in pushing pills. I have degenerative disk disease and have had several fusions. Since the government crackdown, he got himself (IMO) some trouble. I went to him last time and he could not believe that nobody had done an image on my lower back (no surgeries there). My point is, he's the doctor. Why should I be the one to order an image? Now, with the government crackdown, he's actually got to do his job!! I'm highly considering changing because I don't believe he is that good. 
-1	I canât get a straight answer from my doctor.  I feel that he is vague and afraid to commit to an answer. It makes it hard to trust doctors in general.
-1	I think that doctors are humans...they make mistakes. While my dr may have the best intentions, he can make mistakes too. I therefore, trust myself and how I am currently feeling and what I think is best for my body over his opinion of everyday issues that may come up. 
1	My doctor always has my best interest at heart. He will listen to my concerns and do what we both feel necessary to help the situation. My doctor will explain the pros and cons with me and together help me decide my best option.
1	I have no reason to distrust doctors and I'm fairly confident that if my doctor did not have my best interests, and the best interests of all his patients in mind, he would not have chosen to be a doctor.
-1	My primary physician seems hurried to prescribe antibiotics over anything, and she does not like writing referrals to specialists or running tests, like the flu.  In the past Ive had to insist on seeing a specialist.
-1	I trust my Doctor because whenever I felt anxious or had doubts about my medical condition she was always available. She always gave me reassurance when I needed it.
-1	All in all, I feel doctors have good intentions and generally want to help you. I don't have a primary care physician, so I can't tell you anything about that sort of relationship.
1	My doctor has always fully explained things to me in a nice way. He's never belittled me or made me feel unintelligent. He's fun, thorough and thoughtful. I would recommend him to anyone. 
1	I trust my doctor's decisions because my doctors are trained professionals and they know what they are doing. My doctor is super nice and kind and takes time with me when I don't understand something about my health or my wellbeing. My doctor is irreplaceable to me.
-1	My primary care physician does not know me well as a person or patient. I believe I am more of a number than a patient. My doctor is quick to prescribe medication.
-1	My doctor understands my pain an what I need she talks to me for hours an dose her job right I believe in are 100%
1	My good health is a reflection upon my provider, if I'm doing well, then so are they. They have never given me a reason to doubt that they have my best interest at heart.
1	My doctor is amazing. We have a great relationship and I fully trust her to tell me the truth and to go over everything with me.
-1	I have not had a negative experience thus far. They seem to be concerned with giving me the necessary information, however, there have been occasions where they seem rushed.
1	My doctor always gives it to me straight. He doesn't dance around or mince words.  I trust him for that. He's always open and gives options and opinions about the options. O respect him for that. 
-1	Everyone makes mistakes and often there are multiple treatment options for a given condition.  So, while I do feel that I can trust my Doctor I don't rely on them completely without understanding the full situation.  I like to ask them what they would do, or if their loved one had the same issue what would be the top two treatments they would recommend.
-1	I don't have a regular primary care physician but in general towards doctors I do not have complete faith in them. The few times that I have had to take either myself or my child to an emergency room, the doctor completely missed something that was extremely important. Most think that you are drug seeking and ignore what could be going on. There are times I trust their judgement but I will speak up if I believe that they are wrong or not being as thorough as I think they should be. 
-1	You never really know when to trust doctors... There's the whole profit motive thing these days. A lot of them are basically drug pushers for big pharma.
1	I trust my PCP because I work with them and for them on a daily basis and i know that thehy care about each and everyone of their patietnts. I trust them to give me the right options and recommendations about my care.
-1	I trust my doctor but they are human and can sometimes get things wrong. I know they are well educated and are looking out for my best interest. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I have no one else I can trust. I live a lonely life. I know that he is one of the only people that I interact with daily who does not wish to inflict some sort of harm (bodily or otherwise) on me. Doctor client privilege also makes me feel very safe with the medical staff that assist me at the hospital, so I know that anything i say can be documented in complete confidence. 
-1	"i believed all doctors Truth is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or standard.[1] Truth may also often be used in modern contexts to refer to an idea of ""truth to self,"" or authenticity. Truth is usually held to be opposite to falsehood, which, correspondingly, can also take on a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy, art, and religion"
1	My doctor is very nice but also tells me exactly like it is. She does not go over board on testing, but provides what is necessary and I don't have to second guess what she is telling me. She allows me to ask questions and voice any concerns I may have and also thinks about how costly things would be for me.
1	All doctors to me should be trusted until they've done something wrong. They wouldn't be in their position if they weren't given trust to start. I'm not saying ALL should be trusted, but all should be given a fair chance!
-1	I trust my Primary Care Dr because I have been his patient for 25+ years and he knows me well. While I have never had to disagree with procedures or meds that he prescribes, I believe that if I were to be diagnosed with cancer, he and I may not agree on a treatment. Overall I do not trust most Drs. because of the government involvement and influence on things like prescrition drugs, chemo and their motives for prescribing many things.
-1	It really does seem like my doctor does care about me at times and it is really nice knowing that. Everytime i go in he askes how am i feeling.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because i have been dealing with them for a while and they showed and prove to me that if i just eat differently and exercise a little more i can lose weight and become healthy and i did.
1	He's very blunt, like house level blunt. he may not be polite or kind or caring, but he knows the healthcare field and medicine. He has no problem saying it how it is and doesn't fancy foot around it.
-1	Overall I don't feel alot of trust of doctors in general. The reason why I feel this way is because I feel most doctor's are in it for the money and they don't necessarily want people to be healed. They give you medicine for almost everything and that is not a good thing. So overall I don't trust in doctors and don't go to the doctors unless I have no other choice.
-1	I feel like most mainstream doctors are in trained to only treat symptoms and not cure and heal the body as a whole. Big Pharma is a huge business and many of those doctors get incentives for keeping people coming in. Holistic doctors would be concerned with treating and curing ( and maybe  few doctors).
1	I trust my ankle surgeon because he actually screwed up a surgery.  It was not something he did as much as my body reacted poorly to the procedure.  He went step by step with me as to how to fix the problem and what lingering issues I would have.  He is always up front and direct but polite with me. 
1	I have gone to him for several years.  He tells it like it is, and doesn't sugar coat it.  When I have concerns I bring them to his attention and he discusses it with me.  I'm an overall healthy person, and see him twice per.  If I am in there outside of the every six months, he knows something is really wrong.
1	I've had the same doctor for many years and I can fully say this man does truly care about his patients. He has a very good memory and understanding of what his patient's need. That is why I put a lot of trust in him.
-1	My doctor over the years I have lost trust in him he used to be throughout and take his time with me and discuss issues but now when I go I have to wait an hour and a half for him to be in the room for not even 2 minutes which really upsets me because I have to drive 75 miles each way to get to my appointment.
-1	The pay cash to see my doctor.  I honestly believe he is running the clinic he has for the money.  I do believe he understands the way I feel about my condition because he's experienced the same problems I have, yet I still think he is more worried about money than he is the actual welfare of his patients and their recoveries.
1	I generally trust the doctors that I see because I respect their knowledge and experience. This is particularly true when I see specialists about a particular condition. I have faith when seeing a specialist that they have seen many patients with my condition and that they will be able to quickly find a cure or method to manage the condition. I also try to use this opportunity to ask general questions about the condition to them, which I believe is more informative than if I searched online on my own.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I my family and I have been going to the same one for many years.  She has helped me manage many things including my blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Also she is very up to date on my medications in which I need to order.
1	I trust him because I have a lot of experience with doctors due to a heart problem I had several years ago. I know he is conscientious and thorough and he presents all the alternatives to me.
-1	She's a professional, she seems to be pretty knowledgeable and she seems really caring.  I just kind of assume that most doctors know what they are doing, so I do not see why my doctor would be any different.
1	I trust that he has my best interests in mind, he usually presents me with options for any concerns/issues I have and encourages me to do my own research into those options to ensure I can make a fully informed decision. He takes his time during our visits to explain to me what I need to know, and almost always request that I follow up with him in a timely manner to ensure I am on a recommended path towards meeting any goals/treatments that have been selected.
-1	I trust that they care about the patients. They seem to want what is best for us and provide all the options. There are more effective doctors out there though I'm sure. They can still be wrong, or overlook something, especially if they are overworked.
-1	I think that people are often motivated by money and that sometimes doctors will not tell people the best way to take care of themselves but they will tell them what is most convenient and beneficial to themselves instead. 
1	My doctor has been my PCP for years and I trust him. I don't get sick often, but when I do he hits the nail on the head with the diagnosis. He listens and I feel he truly cares about my well being
-1	I trust my primary physician to an extent. I feel that my physician is too busy to really give me a thorough exam and is super quick to keep moving. I feel that there is no way there can always be a right diagnosis
1	I do not feel that my doctor has ever lied to or withheld information from me so I have no reason to distrust her. She answers all of the questions that I do remember to ask her and her answers always sound reasonable.
-1	Unfortunately, medical care in America is a business first.  I never know if the decisions my doctor is making are in my best interest or the best interest for his bottom line.
1	In my experience, with all the conditions I have gone through in my life and went to the doctor, all the information they have given me had proof that I had found out prior to visiting.
1	I trust him because he listens to what is going on and if he can't figure something out, he will direct me to someone who will and will provide a referral with no problem.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she explains everything in detail. She gives me time to process and makes sure that I understand the severity of a health issue. She also gives me time to ask any questions that I might have and is patient with me as she answers my questions. She is comforting and a great person. All these qualities make me trust her and feel comfortable when being seen by her. When I have questions outside of the doctors office I am able to call her during her work time and she will answer my questions. She is the definition of a great and caring doctor.
1	My doctor knows that I will seek outside information about any conditions that he may be treating to make sure that I am informed. Therefore, he is thorough in his explanations and makes sure that I have the pros and cons before I make a decision.
-1	I think most doctors do what they think is right and its not always up to date. I live in a rural community so they don't always stay current.
1	He is thorough and talks to me at length about my conditions.  He is focused on my health.  He works me in whenever I need to talk to him and we can have an appointment that is long if I feel I need it.  And he has done great things for my health and is very intelligent.
-1	I feel that my doctor knows  enough to trsut him but sometimes its okay to get a second opionon to be srure
1	From my overall history with doctors, I trust my current doctor almost completely. She is young and I haven't had her for long (about 2 years), which is why she doen't have my complete trust yet. She does care about me and my health and is very thorough in her assessments. I am very pleased to have her.
-1	My physician is not perfect, but nobody is. Despite this limitation, I can trust him to competently assess my situation and recommend appropriate actions. My doctor respects my intellect and will discuss the medical situation with me so that I understand and buy into treatment options. Although he is trained in standard care protocols, which are short-sighted remedy-based approaches, I can evaluate the alternative options myself and competently discuss them with my physician. 
-1	I mostly trust my doctors because they know way more about the medical field than me.  However, doctors can definitely be wrong, which is why I didn't rate the statements above as 5.  Also, there can be some doctors that don't always want what is best for their patient, especially if it would cause too much of an inconvenience to themselves.
1	I feel that I can completely trust my doctor.  SHe listens to me when I talk and she helps me to feel at ease.  I believe that she has my best interest in mind.  SHe genuinely cares about me.
-1	I've had the same doctor for approximately 10 years, he's always helpful and knowledgeable. Provides me with answers and comforts my concerns but every visit feels more and more rushed like they are squeezing in more patients than time. It's like you are leading the visit by talking non-stop so he doesn't run away to the next.
1	I answered in regard to my doctor of 30+ years who recently retired. I absolutely trusted him with my children, whom he delivered, and myself. He always turned out to be right, always listened and explained things, gave me options. I have not seen a different doctor yet because I lost my job and do not have any health insurance.
1	I have been knowing him for a long time.  I know how he works.  He has good online reviews.  He is a good listener.
1	My doctor is a caring person. My my doctor is very good at getting to the bottom of what is going on. I trust my doctor.
1	My doctor is caring and shows genuine concern for my well being.  She is thorough and answers any questions that I may have.  She takes her time and is very good at what she does. 
-1	Some medical decisions are not 100% safe. And I prefer to do all natural remedies first before having to pump toxins in my body that can cause more harm than good. They have some good options but half the time without tests, they are guessing. 
1	I have had my primary care dr for many years. I know he is a very good man who does his best to help me. He knows a lot about different things. He knows my history. He spends the time to listen to me. I still make my own decisions about things, but I really do trust him a lot. 
1	I completely trust my doctor as I have known her for a long time, and she is also a friend of the family. She is highly regarded by her peers and the medical community in general. She is very professional, honest, and kind.
1	My doctor always makes sure to involve me in the decisions of my care. He always makes sure to ask if I have any questions. He spends an appropriate amount of time discussing my health with me and the reasons he is making the decisions he is. He always provides information about medications possible side effects.
1	I think sometimes doctors focus too much on pharmaceutical prescriptions to mask problems when it would be wiser to get to the underlying problem. In general, though, their solutions to help and can help someone who is getting or is sick.
1	I trust doctors because they seem very open to discuss questions and concerns. Even to the point of not wanting to take prescribed medicine they will refer to other alternatives. 
1	My primary physician is a friend who I have known since he was in medical school. He researches constantly and was top of his class for good reason. He knows my health history and respects my personal wants regarding medical care. He also takes time to listen to patients, not just myself, and is always willing to do extra work if need be. 
-1	I believe most doctors can be trusted in giving you the best advise available to you. The problem with doctors in the US, is they do not have enough time to spend with patients. They are usually in a rush to get you out of the office, so they can see the next patient. 
1	i had a few good doc in my life they were was honest about my diansoses.helped in any way they could.understood my phobias oh i forgot to menction i have anemia too.
-1	i currently have a great pa but often see neurologists and i know i need aggressive doctors and for the most part have been satisfied. i am an odd example of ms and have needed unusual treatment. 
-1	"For one, I don't have insurance and live well below the poverty level, so I don't have a PCP. Medical care is in an emergency only. But, when I did have a PCP and insurance, my doctors were in the room for 5 minutes or less and just gave a dx as whatever was the fastest and most convenient thing at the time. Also, I have a mental health history, so anything they couldn't explain or dx, they just attributed to me being ""mentally unstable""."
-1	I've been through many doctors and can understand that some are to be trusted less since they may diagnose you with something that nets them alot of money if you dont understand your own issue. Sometimes you may be a test subject for a new disease that makes alot of money for them and you have to go through a lot of bullshit just because you dont know whats wrong. I trust my primary care physician quite a bit since its more of a help me help you situation, but generally they're still a second opinion.
1	I trust my medical staff to tell me what is wrong or right. They take the time to explain the information to me and ask me if I have any questions.
-1	I trust my PCP because they are good at explaining situations with my health and laying out options. I am skeptical whether ALL possibilities are considered, but I am confident that the most likely scenarios are addressed first. 
-1	I don't think my doctor has 'bad intentions' towards me or any of the other patients in general, but I do think that It's just a job to him. In a hurry to get to lunch, and in a hurry to get on with his day like anyone else when they work that much.
1	My doctor listens to my concerns without trying to push certain medications or treatment when do not benefit me in the long run.
-1	My primary care doctor seems to take care in doing all the necessary testing for illness and other conditions which might be present is a person of my age, gender and lifestyle.
1	I trust my doctor but I realize that sometimes a problem needs a different viewpoint. I think that my doctor does the best she can but sometimes a problem needs an expert in a different field. I trust my doctor to admit this and move me on to see that person. I think that my doctor has my best interest in mind when she makes decisions related to my health. 
-1	i have to trust them becuace they are looking out for my welfare. when dont follow instructions they why would i go see them.sometimes i think they dont understand the problem i have and i might second guess thier reasoning behind what they say
-1	I do not really fully trust any doctor that much since sometimes whatever is affecting me cannot be solved by my doctors. 
1	Physicians spend years and years honing their craft, learning their skills, and making rational decisions about what to do in any given medical scenario. I don't feel that it's my place to question their advice, so generally they know what the best course of action is. I have full trust in what my care provider tells me I should do.
-1	I believe that she is kind and caring and will use her best judgement in my treatment. Obvious she does not know everything about me but she tries to get to know me as best she can. 
-1	I think doctors are packing too many patients into a day. It leaves them without the time or inclination to look too deeply into patients' medical issues. 
-1	I trust my primary physician because I know my physician for more than a decade and he has demonstrated competency and a caring about my medical needs.  
-1	I sometimes dont trust medical professionals because like most other people they are just trying to do the bare minimum in their jobs to get by. Sometimes they don't care for the patients as much as they do the money they are making. 
1	I have known my physician for a very long time. He was my family doctor for my entire life. He has always had good solutions to all of my problems. He has never failed my family in any aspect. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because everything he has told me has improved my quality of life. I have yet to experience anything bad and his knowledge is evident at first glance.
1	My doctor has never steered me wrong before when I've come in with any issues, and he has always seemed very genuine, understanding, and honest. He always makes sure I understand everything and makes sure I know I can always follow up with him about anything if ever necessary. 
1	About 12 years ago I had major heart surgery due to life threatening conditions.  I have had chronic conditions since, and my care requires ongoing monitoring and treatment.  My doctor saved my life then, and my care has continued to be thorough and effective.  I have never been dissatisfied in the least with any outcomes from my doctor or provider.
-1	I do not trust many doctors in general which is why I don't go to the doctor very often. I believe that many doctors are just sellers of drugs and make way too much money in royalties for talking people in to taking certain drugs.
-1	I feel like doctors are usually in a rush to see as many patients as possible and just throw out the most broad diagnosis and treatment that they can hoping it will solve the problem. I feel like if something is more complicated to diagnose, it will take a long process of narrowing down if they ever even get it right
1	He listens to what I say and asks questions to clarify. He remembers from visit to visit small details about my health issues. He does additional research when needed.
1	I have known him a long time, He also helped look after my parents and he was always honest with me. Most of the time I think to honest, But that was ok I needed something to be put bluntly  for me to digest everything that was happenings. My Dr understood that, he took the time to understand that being blunt was what I needed.
-1	I do trust my doctor but to a sense. Sometimes I feel like he just wants to hurry me out of the room to go on to the next patient. When I try to explain something that might be wrong he kind of dismisses it. But I do know that he will try to help out for issues that are already present.
-1	I trust the doctor because that is his job.  I have never been given any indication that he was unable to perform his duties.  I would hope that I would be given the same courtesy.
-1	It is natural for people to try and get as much money as possible. This applies to doctors because certain procedures that might be unnecessary are sometimes ordered so that the doctor can bill you or your insurance more than he typically could. I have good insurance so I do not mind having extra tests performed because it is not costing me anything and i am getting thorough examinations 
-1	I definitely depend on my primary care doctor but I do know enough when to seek out a specialist.  I'm very fond of my doctor but I always question medical decisions.
-1	Trust my primary care doctor because they have my best intentions at heart and they are highly esteemed in their profession. They get good results and give thorough advice and council.
-1	I occasionally feel rushed when interacting with doctors. Although I know they make an effort to be efficient with their time, I sometimes feel as if they are sacrificing quality for efficiency.
-1	I distrust physicians in general. I believe that they are strongly misinformed and guided by big pharma. They are told to prescribe things and they don't do their own research.They just take what the pharma representative says as fact. 
1	I trust my physician because she takes the time to explain potential problems and my own research has given me no reason to distrust her information.
-1	I feel like my doctor is quick to recommend pharmaceutical drugs for everything I have and go through. I don't like this approach, I like to do things naturally so when he suggests things, I lose a little trust. I also feel like this is generally all doctors. I think they get kickbacks for the medications they prescribe, so it makes me much less trusting of their motives.
1	My doctor has seen me for several years. I trust them a lot because of the rapport we have built. My doctor has always given me great advice about my health, and has inquired about my life and goals. I think my doctor always tries his best with me. 
1	I have had good reviews from other patients who are my friends, and longtime patients of my doctor. He has never made me felt rushed and answered all my questions to my satisfaction.
-1	My last Primary care physician was a confident man that could answer my questions and was very receptive to any suggestions or bringing up other forms of care. 
-1	I trust my doctors in general because they have much more experience than I do and would imagine that would lead them to make or suggest the right options for me in regards to my health.
-1	I think in medicine, having some room for reservations is good, and second opinions are good as well. I think after taking classes with some of the next generations med students...makes me question them as well. They are people just like me. 
-1	I trust my doctors to a point. I do not trust them completely and feel they sometimes choice the easier way than the way that might be more beneficial to me. 
1	I've had my primary care physician for a very long time and they always give me good recommendations based off of the life that they know I want to live. For example, I'm not really into taking medications if I can help it so if something can be aided naturally by eating healthier or exercising more, they nudge me in that path. Obviously if I have a severe cold or infection, I take their prescription that they recommend but they are aware that if I have to work a little harder to set a goal to get back on track, I'll take that path. And I really appreciate that from them!
1	I've had my doctor for 10 years now.  He was my fathers doctor for over 20 years and he also treats my sister.  He's kind, very smart and has a lot of experience.  He's always willing work me into his schedule even if it means skipping his lunch or staying late.  So yeah, I trust him completely.
1	The particular doctor I currently have takes her time during visits. She asks questions about my life, my family, and the current condition I'm experiencing. I've told my wife I believe my doctor sees me as a project, her goal is to keep me heathy and strong. 
1	I trust my primary care physician. Because he went to school to gain knowledge to help people and I truly believe he trys to do what he thinks is the best to help me and learn what will be the best to help other people as well sometimes doctors have to try different approaches to get the best outcome that will help each individual overall. 
-1	Physicians in this day and age are governed by insurance companies and regulations more than medicine and science.  They don't always willingly do these things, but nonetheless they have to bow down to these entities in order to get paid by using less effective treatments first, or substitute treatments for others due to money.  Also, a lot more time is spent on documentation than actually giving the patient good eye contact and favorable bed side manner along with taking as much time as is needed with patients.
-1	I don't distrust the doctor. I merely feel like so many tests and procedures are unnecessary and sometimes harmful. I don't go to the doctor unless I feel like something is wrong.
-1	My doctor is very sweet and kind to me, I don't see why she would purposefully be dishonest with me about anything. Sometime's I'm confused by what she tells me, but that isn't her fault.
-1	I do not have complete trust in my physician because sometimes they are just out for money and do not tell you everything.  They try to push medications and not everything requires prescription medicine.
-1	The doctor that I have now is pretty good. He seems honest and decent. So I do trust him a good bit. Don't feel this way about all doctors but this one is pretty good.
-1	My primary care physician has known me for a couple years now and I have grown to trust in him lot. He is good at explaining things to me for the most part and is very easy going. He is also very thorough in explaining things to me and trying to see what I think about certain health issues. He has not let me down yet and has not given me a reason to distrust him.
-1	I trust my doctor because I've been seeing them for almost 10 years and they're familiar with my health and what works best for my body.  Up to this point, they've always given me accurate information and helped me improve my health in a safe way.
-1	My doctor has become my friend over the years, not a close friend but a friend of a sort. I can trust him to be concerned when I'm not doing well and to think carefully about what the best course of action would be for me. I feel confident about his decision making.
1	I trust my doctor wholeheartedly.  He is very concerned about my well being and has been very thorough in helping me solve my problems. He isn't afraid to deal with my insurance company head on to get me the best care.  He hasn't let me down in the past and won't do it in the future.  
-1	I go to my university health center currently, where I feel the credentials to be a medical professional are slightly more lax compared to a pediatrician you may go to as an adolescent or child. In my opinion the structured, budget friendly operation of a university health center is caked with many professionals screening and treating students the same for the most part. While I can rely on them for blood work, sexually transmitted disease screening, general prescriptions, and counseling services I would not go to them for diagnosis or anything major. I personally would prefer a resident at a hospital to the nurses I usually see. At some colleges it is worse than mine, some only have nurses and no licensed doctors. As such I don't really trust my doctor, but it's not awful.
-1	I have been working with him for over 10 years so I feel like he knows me extremely well.  He understands the health conditions I have and how the impact me.
1	I feel I can trust my primary care physician because he has shown me that the decisions he helps me make about my health are the ones that are best for me. My doctor is also very clear about the decisions he makes.
1	I completely trust my doctor. She takes a lot of time to listen to my concerns and answer any questions I may have. She never makes me feel rushed like a lot of other doctors. She works on a gameplan to treat something with what I am most comfortable with. Most importantly, she was able to quickly diagnose a foot pain I had been experiencing for months which gave me a lot of confidence in her abilities.
1	I have none my doctor for more than 10 years. He has treated me since I was a teenager. He has always putting my needs first. There has never been a time when I've questioned his decision.
-1	I don't have a doctor, or see one regularly, I only go when I have a problem. So I'm just not going to trust some random doctor I've never met before, especially when my money is on the line.
-1	I believe that my primary care physician has outdated information on certain things. It's not like they go back to school every couple of months to get updated information on certain conditions. I also believe that they kept bonuses for pushing pills on to people.
-1	The last time I went to the doctor they ran a lot of tests on me that resulted in a $700 bill, later when I saw my gyno he said that the tests were unnecessary. I don't have a need to go to the doctor right now but I would look for another place to go. 
1	My primary care physician was extremely amiable. Even if we were not dealing with something that was quite within the realm of his expertise (such as my anxiety) he would recommend literature I could read on the subject.  He would never fail to ask follow-up questions about things I'd experienced in a previous appointment with him. 
1	I feel like the doctor-patient relationship is built entirely on trust and so my basic foundation is totally trusting him. He's never given me any reason to doubt him.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with her for a long time. She remembers my name and is always very polite and seems generally concerned for me when I show up. Any questions that I asked are answered whole-heartedly and it feels she cares about me instead of just trying to get a bunch of my money through unneeded things.
1	I trust my OBGYN, I just think he is a little c-section happy.  Two high risk pregnancies and two c-sections for someone who wanted a natural birth is a little disappointing, but everyone is healthy and alive so can't complain with the results.
-1	I try to avoid going to my doctor unless it's absolutely necessary.  I don't trust them because I have anxiety and depression and it makes trust almost impossible for me.  I realize that this is all on me but I just find it not possible for me.  I would like very much to do it.  I know they're not going to lie to me but I still find that I just don't trust any of them.
-1	I have trust in my physician because he has always been correct regarding any health issue I have had in the past. I have no reason to distrust him as I have never left an appointment feeling anything has been overlooked when it comes to my health
-1	She takes time to really listen to me. If I am doubting something, or questioning why about things she will explain it. I don't feel like I cannot bring things up to her. For example when I mentioned my anxiety she really took time to get me on meds that made me feel better. It made all the difference in the world to me. 
1	She takes the time to listen to me and is very thorough in her explanations. Asks about my feelings etc.
1	My doctor has always been kind to me. She answers all my questions and listens to my concerns. She gives me different options and helps me decide which is best for me.
1	I trust my primary care physician fully because he is a very good doctor. I have been seeing him since I was a child and he has always given me the best care and been right about his diagnosis on the first try. He is nice and good at communication and making sure I fully understand everything and am comfortable
-1	I have been going to the same Doctor since I was a child, they care but they also don't make any money off me if I'm dead
-1	I am a very critical person. So I am always looking for more information than what is given. It has nothing to do with my doctor being a bad doctor, and more with my inquisitive disposition. 
-1	Sometimes it seems that they're too quick to recommend invasive treatments like drugs with bad side effects or surgery rather than trying to get the body to heal itself, which seems much safer (and less expensive) to me.
-1	I don't care for my doctor much. I hadn't been to a doctor in 10 years. Before that I had a bad experience with my doctor. Recently I've also had a bad experience. Just more medical bills for them to prescribe me crap. Basically a 100 version of a drug that I could get for $1 over the counter,.
-1	"I don't have a primary care physician. I don't go to doctors much and have had mixed results. Different doctors have told me that strep is nothing to worry about and others have been ""upset"" that I didn't come in sooner. "
1	My primary care physician has demonstrated competency in his profession to me. That is the primary reason I have for trusting him. The medical problems I've had over the years have been solvable, and my primary care physician has always assisted me in that regard. He also trusts my judgement on my own health issues and will issue necessary prescriptions by phone if he's convinced that I need them.
-1	They have tried to push me away from solutions that don't involve taking drugs when those options are just as viable.
1	I trust my primary care physician.  When I went to him and told him I was depressed he immediately referred me to a social worker/therapist.  He did not just prescribe me medicine on his own.  He is careful and conservative but effective.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is very polite, respectful, and reputable. He is more than willing to assist me in my health needs as well as my decisions regarding choices that are more optional than necessary such as vitamin capsule intake. Overall, he's very helpful and a great source of health knowledge. 
-1	My doctor is very open when discussing medical issues and concerns with me.  There is no issue discussing alternatives, side effects, etc.  The doctor never makes me feel uncomfortable and has always provided me with accurate information.
-1	Because I have a lot of experience in care physicians giving me the wrong treatment, tests, and medications.  I have suffered a lot of negative side effects because of doctors not believing me. Doctors in my are do not have the knowledge to help me how I need to be helped. They are not willing to individualize their treatments according to individuality and differences. This made me skeptical over a lot of doctors.
-1	"I have only seen my primary care doctor a couple of times, but she is someone my family regards highly and who has been very good to them. As a result of their good experiences, I am generally inclined to think positively of my doctor and trust her judgement. I do, however, feel I need more time to develop any feeling akin to ""complete trust."""
1	I do not really have much distrust in the my primary care physician. I feel like he does a great job in being honest and transparent.
1	I have had my PC for 15 years now. We have a relationship that is based on trust and friendship and he is always there to discuss any problems I have. He is an excellent doctor and has a great manner with patients.
1	My doctor is completely honest with me whenever I had an appointment. He tells me exactly what is wrong and the possibles outcomes of it, as well as the aproaches I can take.
-1	I have a lot of trust in my primary car physician. They treat me like an individual and show me a lot of care. They ask me about my concerns and really try to get to know me. They are very good at diagnosing problems that I have.
-1	He's very down to earth and tells me what is protocol but also what is necessary. He's a big proponent of preventative care and has always backed up his suggestions with research.
-1	I trust Doctors because they are in their position for a reason, but just like any other Profession they don't get to make the rules, are worried about getting sued, or don't trust their patients to tell them the truth and often go with their own assumptions, which can be both good and bad.
-1	I don't completely trust any doctor. I feel like sometimes they are just guessing what a problem or solution is. I take the information the doctor gives and make my own choices on what I believe and what my next steps will be. 
-1	If I have taken the steps to be in the presence of a healthcare professional, I have exhausted my own body of knowledge and MUST trust them to investigate further and explain the options for treatment as they may be. Their schooling and Hippocratic oath make them the only option at that point, hence one has no option but to trust someone, why not a trained and certified medical professional. 
-1	We tend to put doctors on a pedestal and to me this is so absurd.  They are human and subject to human error.  There is so much medical negligence.  You read about it just about every day.  My doctor does not hesitation to write out a prescription.  He is aware that I am totally against taking prescribed drugs. He only cares about a quick fix.   I also feel that it's a money game.  
-1	i trust my doctot because he always goes to great lengths to get to the bottom of my health issues and ive known my doctor since i was young an ive never had any issues with him all the time ive went to him
1	I trust him because he seems to really know what he is doing, and was able to treat my infection correctly. He is also very kind and caring and seems to really care about the patients.
1	I have been going to the same dr for years. I have never had a bad experience.  She has always steered me in the right direction.  She seems knowledgeable and is always open to listen to what I have to say .
-1	I feel they do not care to put in the time to really figure out and discuss health complaints and often rush patients in and out. I do not fully trust them for fixing health issues.
-1	Honestly I think its more about money than care of the patient. There is never a sense of urgency with doctors. 
-1	They have given me wrong diagnosis before- leading to wrong medication and side effects and addition to the HUGE bills!!!
-1	I have Type 2 diabetes and I know that my condition is not as serious as everybody else since every time I'm eating a healthy diet, my numbers stay stable and I would feel great. My doctor keeps trying to push insulin to me even though, I know I don't need it. She even mentioned that they are normally told by their providers to try to offer insulin more towards patients. They try to restrict my refills for a diabetic medicine that I normally need just so that they could make me come in and so that they can charge my insurance company. They won't give me refills until I check-in with them, which for something standard like Diabetes, I don't think I need.
-1	I trust my physician for the most part. There are times though that I have questioned her. It is because medical degree or not we all have preferences and she is going to only offer me her preferences and I may not know about other options 
1	For the most part I trust my doctor. They have always been honest with me and see to take the time to explain the problems that I have. There have been times where I asked a million questions and they are more than happy to answer. My daughters doctor is a little different. They always seem to be in a rush. 
1	"My primary care physician is a very thoughtful doctor.  He listens closely to what I have to say, and thinks about his responses.  He has a lot of experience, and he seems to have a ""conservative"" approach, in that he doesn't immediately jump to an aggressive treatment."
1	I have been going to the same doctor for 14 years and have only had good experiences.  She listens and does not always push medications.
-1	My doctor will sit down and listen to me and my concerns and she will also talk to me in terms that I understand  she will not leave until I fully understand her and what she is saying
-1	Based on anecdotes and past experiences, doctors cannot be trusted many times. Sadly, there are a lot of doctors who will play with your lives for the money. That is not to say all doctors are like that, but you have to be careful.
-1	I think that nowadays, most doctors are about the money that they want to make and they will give you the treatment that cost the most even if a cheaper alternative is available.
1	My primary care physician is also my mother's primary care physician and has been since I was 7. He became mine when I was 18 and before that point would ask my mother about how I was doing. He is also a rheumatologist and I have rheumatoid arthritis and have since I was 11. He remembers extremely minor details and things about me and my health without having to look through my file every time I visit. He is extremely busy but always takes time to follow up and is very thorough. He is willing to recommend I take a treatment that he cannot provide and is genuinely interested in keeping me in the best health possible.
1	I have seen my current doctor for several years now. he has always listened to my concerns and has worked with me in finding the best treatment that iI need.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, but overall I think doctors will do what they can to help you. Unfortunately I think sometimes circumstances force them to treat patients in more of a hurry which may make them seem like they don't care. But overall I think most doctors genuinely want to help people and have no interest other than to help you get well.
1	Doctors take an oath of not doing harm and with the risk of malpractice they would not do what is convenient but what is right.
-1	I have not really found a good primary care physician yet. I had a good one, but he retired. The new one I have found so far has not impressed me. He is ok, but I don't feel as comfortable talking to him and sometimes feel like he jumps to conclusions about me or my condition without fully evaluating the information I have provided.
-1	I think that doctors have lots of time constraints so they tend to limit the appropriate amount of time necessary for their patients 
-1	I feel that the majority of doctors have taken a general approach to caring for patients. I think they are forced to see so many patients an hour that if you complain about a typical set of things then they prescribe or recommend x based solely off that.
-1	Doctord I see are more interested to get clients moving through their offices. The focus on the number of clients rather than quality service.
-1	Alot of my anxiety of fully trusting doctors boils down to when my grandfather was sick.  The doctors were not able to identify the source of his fever until I mentioned that after googling his symptoms that lymphoma has all the same symptoms.  Only then, they finally tested and were able to diagnose him 24 hours before he passed away.
1	I really trust and respect my doctor.  He takes a lot of time with me at each appointment and always asks me a bunch of questions.  He is kind and seems like he really cares about me.
-1	I trust my doctor to the extent that he does not want me to die.  But I am not 100% confident that he has presented me with all the available remedies for my situation as there are new drugs and theories being discovered yearly.
-1	Sometimes when I visit my doctor, I feel extremely rush and unimportant. Other days, I feel like my doctor actually listens to my problems and needs 
-1	It is not that I trust or distrust my primary care physician. Instead, it is simply wanting to question things in order to protect myself regardless. This method works for my best interest.
1	I trust my doctor because he has yet to steer me wrong. Whenever I am having a problem or I need a question answered he is there to listen and give me a thorough diagnosis. He also looks out for me by recommending me the best products with the lowest price. If my problem can be fixed easily with a drugstore product then my doctor has no problem bringing up that product first. Even if I feel as though my problem was major and my doctor diagnoses it as something simple like a stomach ache, he will still treat the situation as important and reassures me in showing that it wasn't a waste of time to come.
1	I guess if I had to think about it, I would have a hard time coming up with a reason not to trust my primary care physician. I have been seeing him since I stopped seeing my pediatric doctor when I was a teen. He has never led me wrong or given me trouble about my prescriptions when I needed to get them filled. I also see a psychiatrist for anxiety and he provides me with the medicine needed to treat my panic disorder. I have been seeing him for over a decade and by now I only need to see him for a quick appointment once every three months because he knows me so well.
-1	There have been many times over the past several years that I've gone to doctors with medical complaints, probably all coming from the same source, and left their care with no real effective plan of treatment, and limited insight about what precisely is going wrong with my health, and this applies to primary care physicians, and specialists, and ER doctors. It seems pretty clear that either they can't treat whatever is wrong with me, or just don't care.
-1	I have family in the health care business and would trust them whole heartedly. I think that it is important to have trust in your doctors. They go through a lot of training and pledge an oath to provide to their patients as well as they can.
1	I generally trust my primary care physician because she consistently treats me with respect and listens to my needs. She's also willing to say when she's unsure about something and when I need to seek additional resources or opinions, rather than pretending to know everything about everything. 
-1	I did quite a bit of research before I finally selected my doctor.  She has very good reviews from other parents, and works for a very reputable institution, Johns Hopkins.  Most of my interactions with her have been extremely positive and she has given me no reason not to trust her judgment.  My one concern is that she seems to be extremely busy, and probably feels pressure not to spend much more than 15 minutes with any of her patients.
1	I have never had any reason not to trust her. All care I have received has been prompt and efficient and addressed any concerns/issues I had.
-1	I would have faith and hope that as a trained physician they are both skilled and have the knowledge and upkeep in the medical field. They do this as a living, doctors/nurses and physicians, so I should put at least some trust into their job that they are evaluating me and my health properly.
1	My PA is extremely intelligent.  He listens to me, and he gives me credit for knowing something is wrong with my body.  He involves me in treatment planning.
-1	I think i can trust my primary care physician i feel that most doctors are honest people.some doctor my not be trustworthy but i have had no reason not to trust my doctor. if i thought my doctor could not be trusted i would look for another primary care physician.
-1	My physician does not rush me out of her office. She sits and talks with me and makes me feel like a person rather than just another face in her daily routine. She tells me about her past experiences as she is less than ten years older than me and has gone through a lot of the same things I have. She tells me what things she thinks are optional (flu shots, etc...) and what I really need to get done to stay healthy. 
1	Firstly, I tends to trust people. For doctors who are well-educated and respected, I trust most of them. As I experienced, most doctors are very nice and professional.
-1	I have no reason to not trust him. I don't believe that he would knowingly do anything to harm me and he has no reason to lie to me. Also I've grown to trust him after seeing him for some time. 
-1	I trust my primary physician because they would have no reason to lie to me or falsify any information. They would not benefit at all from lying to me so it would not be worth doing that at all. 
1	I trust the care of my primary care physician because I have been a patient with him for years and also because I am a LPN, he trusts my knowledge as well and we can always come to a decision together regarding my care.
1	I actually have a new PPC so I don't have a lot of experience with her.  From what I do know, I trust her and her judgement.
-1	I trust my doctor. He has been caring for me and my family for years and we have been in good health. he has always provided the correct recommendations and we have trust in him
-1	Most doctors are greedy. The money is more important than our health. They perform unnecessary treatments to earn more money
1	If a doctor has great bedside manner it makes it easy to trust them. Most of the doctors I have ever been to have had a great bedside manner which makes it feel like they are there for me and not just to do what is convenient for him/her. A doctor that is rude makes it hard to believe
1	My doctor always gives me several options for and would be treatment I may need be it medicine, further testing and even sending me for second opinions.
1	He is very, very thorough. He is older than me, so he uses alot of old fashioned methods. But that is good, because he takes his time and listens.
-1	I trust the doctors i see because of the training and education they receive. I do think there is a bit of opinion difference between different doctors but i think overall that is marginal in diagnosis. I do believe that in general almost all doctors and nurses are out for the patients best interest.
-1	I have been with my GP for almost 20 years.  Over those years, he and I have built a sort of rapport that I have come to trust.  Unfortunately, in the last year or so, something has changed.  He is less tolerant with questions and does not give  you much time to discuss your concerns.  He is more concerned with getting you out of his office and moving on to the next patient.  I am currently looking for a different  GP. 
1	I have been going to my Primary Care doctor for a few years.  Any concerns I have brought up she has addressed honestly, but in a caring and comforting way.  I am not talked down to and I am often presented with information and options. 
-1	i respect them because they help me alot concerning my health.they  do tell me reality whenever i visit them and they give me advices about coping with life experiences. through them,i have a sense of belonging even when i tend to feel that my life is meaningless
-1	I've been going to my primary physician for years and she has earned my trust. Also my mom who works in the medical field says nothing but praises for my primary physician.My primary physican gives me good advice and tries to maintain my health in the right area.
1	I had trouble for a long time finding a good doctor. I had stomach issues and other weird problems for a decade. Then I switched to my current doctor, she tested my thyroid and Iâve felt so much better since. Sheâs been pretty spot on since Iâve started seeing her. My whole family see her we trust her so much. 
-1	My primary care physician sometimes did not respond to my request about different treatment options. She swayed me into a specific option without asking my opinion. My friends got a certain treatment option but she did not even let me ask for that,
-1	I trust my doctor because he is a smart, competent person who is not in a rush and cares about providing my good advice and counsel.  But I also realize that there are limits to his experience and knowledge and he rarely runs tests to understand the problems.  So yes, I trust that he isn't lying but I don't always believe that he is correct.
-1	Pharmaceutical companies have alot of doctors and hospitals by the boot straps so if its not something that is paying their bills they are least likely to admit it. Example going hollistically versus a medication to help a small yet consistent pain is not going to come out their mouth much less approve you doing so already yourself
1	I mostly trust my doctor. He seems like a nice and caring guy and very thorough. I haven't been seeing him long, but I think he does a good job and is very attentive. 
-1	I don't trust my doctor. They just write things and don't say anything. They want to hurry up and get out of there. They always call me a liar. 
1	I have a strong trust in my provider. She has spent extra time with me when I needed it and followed up after stressful visits to make sure I fon't have more questions and to just check in with me.
1	She is thorough and she actually listens to me. She wants what is best for me, but doesnt put me through unnecessary testing.  She is kind and follows up. She is quick to answer questions when I ask
-1	I beelive that he knows what is best for me. He has taken care of his education, and has been training in his life in order to make sure he knows what he's doing. That is something that lets me think he is a professional,
-1	I believe that doctors are trained to be trustworthy and have taken an oath to put their patient's interest above all. Of course, there are some doctors who fail at patient interaction in any number of ways, but I believe them to be the minority.
1	I trust what my doctor says about a medical condition. I have found that what I read about a given condition was in agreement with what the doctor said about the condition. I trust what my doctor says about a specialist to see. For example, if my doctor recommends a specialist doctor, I know it will be someone who is excellent. I have checked the patient reviews for a recommended specialist and found out that the reviews were consistent with what my doctor had said about the specialist.
-1	I do not either trust or distrust my doctor. I feel they are they to evaluate my physical condition and to make recommendations to maintain or improve my health. They are a valuable resource which I can then use to make a decision of how to proceed given the options which have been discussed.
-1	I do not trust doctors in general. I believe that it all about the money so to speak. Medicine has caused more issues than the ailments it is said to assist with. If one medicine helps with one ailment for example, then it more than likely has at least ten side effects. Not to mention the costs of medicine. If someone is healthy, they make no money. 
-1	I have had a lot of changes with my primary care physician so I cannot always trust that the doctor I saw the last time will be the same doctor I see the next time, but the doctor that I have currently been seeing I have much trust in. 
-1	I do trust my doctor for most things but I do believe that doctors do not take people serious unless they can see actual signs themselves. Seems like most doctors send patients back home for a month to see if the symptoms go away or get worse. When most patients come in they have actually already been suffering from the problem for a long time but just waited to see the doctor. I do understand that some patients are lying to the doctor just to get medications or other things. It just seems like the patients really have to convinince the doctor that they really have these problems. I know it has to be hard for the doctors as well because they have to make sure they do not mistreat a patient even if that is what the patient wants. Of course, we have all heard about the few dirty doctors that have lied to patients about have cancer or other illnesses just to profit off the insurance money. We can't forgot about the many drug seeking patients that only want pain pills. That makes it hard on the people who are actually in pain or have cronic pain and really do need pain pills daily. 
-1	I have not been to a doctor in over 15 years, so I do not fully trust doctors, but that's not why I haven't been, I just know that unless its something very strange or a broken bone, most things go away with just taking care of yourself, good nutrition and staying hydrated works for me. I havent even used over the counter medicine at all in over 10 years. 
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. Since seeing my current doctor, he has on one occasion spent almost an hour with me explaining why my cholesterol is the way it is. The fact that he invested that much time with me instead of leaving in 10-15 minutes told me that he cares about what I need to know and is willing to take the time to make sure I understand why things happen like they do.
1	I trust my Dr because he takes his time while I am there for my visit.  He leaves no stone unturned.  He always does blood work before the visits.  He orders appropriate test just in case.  He encourages me to continue on a healthy path.  He helps in dieting and what to eat and what not to eat.  I also trust my Dr because he is sought after by lots of patients.  He is always booked up.  He has been in the business for quite a few years.  
-1	She never remembers me.  I go in for one problem and she ignores it and instead complains about my weight.  I once went to her to acquire a sedative for a very stressful upcoming doctor appointment and she screamed at me saying if I take 4 Valium pills I will turn into an addict.  She also gets my age wrong every time.  I only go to her for referrals.  She is at an age where I think she needs to retire and every time I have been there I never see any patients in the waiting room.  Her online reviews are also terrible. 
1	My doctor takes a great deal of time with his patients.  My last wellness visit lasted 1 1/2 hours.  I met with his assistant, his student doctor and him.  They took a full medical and social history.  Because he is a teaching doctor and has a 3rd year medical student working with him, he uses the questions I ask as an opportunity to educate both me and his student.  He runs all the tests he feels are needed to make sure I am in good physical shape.  He also counsels me on nutrition. 
1	I trust my doctor because of his track record over the years with patients who aren't me and the fact that doctors can easily get in trouble for not doing the right thing.  
1	All in all over the years going to the doctor has been a pleasant experience. The doctors I have visited have been kind and helpful. One reason I think I have such a positive opinion of doctors is because I rarely use them. 
1	I do trust doctors for the most part, they have the education and experiences above my own. I think that the trust I put in my doctors, as well as the research I can do on my own, makes a good team in my healthcare.
-1	I've been seeing my current PCP for 9 years but he often forgets (even with my records in front of him) the nature of my chronic conditions. He is disorganized, abrupt, and has a tendency to dismiss my concerns
1	My primary care physician was my pediatrician. I reconnected with him after 20 years. He is a good listener, and not fond of medications. Likes me to work out problems every other way before trying meds.
-1	I do understand that some doctors try to generalize symptoms for pharmaceutical practices here in America. This sometimes causes doctors to prescribe certain drugs or procedures that may be common to their field. However, I think healthcare has allowed more transfers from physicians to the specialist. Helping things become more focused and thorough.
1	My primary care physician has never given me a reason to distrust him. He is always willing to listen to what is bothering me, give his professional opinion of the cause, and let me choose from the treatment options available. Over time, he has earned my complete trust.
1	I mean he's my primary doctor. If i can't trust him i would go find a new one. It's very important to have a doctor you trust in because if not you won't be able to get the treatment you deserve.
-1	"I don't have a current one, but my last one accused me of drinking a ""starbucks milkshake"" before my blood test when I repeatedly answered that I had not consumed anything that morning for the blood test. He also fought with me about my premie status as a baby and whether or not the scar sites were for a heart surgery I had to fix a murmur. I've seen my own bill for my birth, I had the surgery. He then tried to forcefully sign me up for Jenny Craig before I left, which would not be covered by my insurance, and insisted on offering me the flu shot after I declined several times because I already had the shot. "
1	My primary care doctor is somebody who I have known for quite some time. I trust that he has my best interests at heart and will always make sure that his decisions reflect where I want to be with the treatment. 
1	My physician likes to push different new medications on me instead of worrying about the side effects that I would have in taking these medications. I do get a great deal from my physician in the way of ordering test and sharing about my disease. I wish that my physician cared about my daily issues and not so much about the different medications they want me to try. My doctor comes off as a drug pusher at times. I also feel as if my doctor is always in a rush and that makes me lose my concentration.
-1	When my doctor is not rushed and has time he always answers my questions and does not rush me.  When he is very busy I feel as though he ignores me and does not take what I say into consideration.  I trust him when he explains his decisions to me but I do not trust rushed and unexplained decisions.  
-1	I feel like not trusting a doctor is foolish. It takes an incredible amount of dedication, smarts, and experience to become a doctor. I trust experts in most places where it makes sense, unless something seems off about them. I might be less inclined to trust a doctor where I was not as sure of his credentials, like maybe in a third world country. I do not have a primary care physician to think to but I would like to think If i Did, I would place a great deal of trust in them to give me accurate advice. If I did no trust the doctor, I would pretty quickly find a new one.
-1	I believe that my doctor has my back because that is his job.  He is competent and pragmatical, and he would undoubtedly explore treatment options with me.
1	"I don't have a primary care physician, I pretty much just go to whoever I'm sent to.  To put it simply, I haven't run into any doctors who did NOT give me any reason to trust them.  All of them have been professional.  True, one of them didn't have a good ""bedside manner"", but that was it.  He still got the job done.  "
-1	My PCP is not somebody that I see very often. I have not gone to my PCP regularly for about 5 years now. I only go if there is something seriously wrong, which has only been like 2 times in the past 5 years.
-1	I had a doctor for years who was incredibly thorough and I did completely trust always. Unfortunately that doctor is no longer in practice. I have had experiences with other doctors that have led me to question whether they truly are thorough at all, and I don't have the level of trust with any of my current providers that I had with my former PCP. 
1	She shows me that she cares. She refers me to specialists when she's unsure, she follows up with me quickly, and she seems very knowledgeable.
-1	I somewhat distrust doctors in general to take the time to explain all treatment options because they are in such a hurry and want to get to the next patient to make more money. I don't think they want to waste time to followup when patients need additional explanation, help, or guidance with their situation.
-1	I believe doctors had some participatory stake in the prescription opiate mess.  While most doctors didn't have inside information on the pharmaceutical industry's practices  with respect to testing and marketing, I believe there have been relatively few doctors who have actually expressed a lot of remorse about the whole affair. That being said, doctors can't be held entirely accountable for living in a culture that is, in some sense, addictive in its makeup. My attitude toward doctors is governed by the principle that I do not expect mistake-free behavior on the part of anyone. All I ask is that doctors or other medical professionals who work with me give their best effort and use the best information available to them.
-1	I don't feel I have a reason to doubt the sincerity of my primary care physician, as I feel that when I've gone to see him, he performs a thorough exam and blood work, etc., and has not recommended any courses of treatment that seemed suspect to me. Fortunately I have been very healthy and so have not really had many visits with him other than my yearly checkups, so I suppose I don't know if I can fully trust his decisions on treatment options, but I really don't have a reason to doubt him.
1	I trust my primary care physician completely. He is wise, sensible, practical. He always has time for questions or discussion on issues important to me. He has never steered me wrong.
1	I have seen my primary physician for a number of years. He has always been thorough in hearing out my problems and then giving multiple options as how to treat the problems. All the times ive had to go see him the diagnosis and treatments he has recommended have been spot on
1	I trust my physician because I have known him for years. We used to work side by side in the hospital. I know without a doubt that he will tell me things honestly even if it goes against what his normal protocols are. I am fortunate to have this relationship with him.
-1	Really they are just humans like everyone else. They chose a career path, went to university for many years and got a job in the industry. How much they actually consolidated from their education is questionable. Often times it seems they're doing a lot of common sense work or things that a layman could figure out himself if he had access to the equipment and the internet. You also have to question if they have ulterior motives or reason to push medication that may not be the most advantageous. Their education is very very narrow as well, they don't often know much about natural medicine or even things like paleo diets or aspects/principles of primal living. I have to question what kind of person these doctors are and whether they even value their lives themselves because stepping back it looks like they slaved away at school just to become a doctor and deal with sick people all the time. A life like that would be miserable to me, so I wonder if some doctors even care about anything they are doing or if they are following a path for money or to impress others. 
1	I have always had trust in my primary physician.  He has a great bed-side manner and is very personable and explains things very well.  My father was a physician and I am able to relate to him because of this.  I also know that he his telling me the truth that I need to hear as this is the same things that I heard from my father.  I respect his years of service in the industry as well as he has practiced his trade for over 20 years.  I also trust the people that recommended this physician to me.
-1	"i haven't been to my primary in years because when i had a medical problem and i came to them they said they wouldn't do test because it wasn't their ""area"". they are general practitioners. everything is their area they could have taken blood and run labs and then refereed me but they didn't do anything  "
-1	I have been misdiagnosed so many times by doctors that I do not trust them to be able to help me in any capacity. They seem to have their own motives in mind and do not care about the actual problem I'm experiencing or finding a solution. I feel like the reason they are in their profession is solely to make as much money as they can.
-1	For the most part I trust him but there are times when he seems to give me contradictory information from visit to visit and that makes me nervous. For example, one time my cholesterol will be borderline high and he'll mention it as something I need to work on then next time it will be extremely high and he won't say anything.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor for the most part because I develop an relationship with this person for a couple of years now. I know when I need something urgently, they will always be there when I go for help for me and my family.
-1	my doctor is only telling me whats best for me. He has my best interest in mind when I have an appointment with him. He is only trying to get me to stay healthy or get me back to that point.
-1	I do a LOT of research on my own, because I suffer from chronic conditions. When I see a doctor, they don't always mention all of the options available. The docs are double and triple booked in 15 minute time slots, so they don't have a lot of time with each patient. They hardly have the time to fully discuss EVERYTHING that's going on and maybe connect some dots that could be connected. 
-1	Again working in the medical field I see things that worry me and make me more cautious.  Such as, a Dr that delivers too many c sections because he has plans for the weekend and doesn't want to get called in. Or a doctor that doesnt explain appropriately to the patient, or even worse doesn't even see the patient and provides service thru only looking at a chart. 
1	although trust has inherent as well as instrumental value for patients, clinicians, and healthcare institutions, trust can be misplaced, and distrust can be unjustified. Thus, if a physician reveals truthfully to a patient how s/he is paid, trust in the physician may diminish as a result of this trustworthy behavior.
1	The only real reason that I would not trust my PCP is that she is not an expert in a specific medical field. However, I trust her recommendations for specialists implicitly.
-1	"I don't trust my primary care physician because she didn't listen to me when I told her the things which were bothering the most. Instead she arranged expensive tests simply because I'm of an age where I need them and should have them first to rule out things before moving on to the things I am most concerned about. I understand that logic, but when a person is in pain and can pinpoint exactly where that pain is, this information shouldn't be ""put off"" in lieu of routine procedures, no matter if you are due for them or not. "
-1	I trust a physician to truly want wha tis best, but I do not trust that they will pick the best solution instead of prescirbing the easiest pharmaceutical drug or highest paying one.
-1	My primary care physician is okay for routine care, but I have never been so sick that I needed extra attention. If something big were to go wrong with my physician, I'm not sure I would trust her completely without a second opinion. She has been fine so far, but I'm generally healthy.
-1	Usually, when I have several questions about something that is going ion when my health, my doctor usually has all the answers to whatever my questions are to put my mind at ease. Sometimes, I have my doubts about the answers and then just google search more about when we talked about or on my visit I will ask more questions and he will answer them once again to put my mind at ease.
-1	It's their job and usually their calling, so I trust them inasmuch as it makes sense. They're still fallible human beings and I don't mind seeking second opinions. 
1	I trust him very much because when I needed help with something he referred me in the right direction. That next experience was a healthy and good experience for me that has made me healthier.
1	I have a great relationship with my doctor.  He's one of the few good ones left that takes the time to get to know you and talk to you.  I feel like he's a close friend when I'm there.
-1	I haven't been to the doctors in awhile, however, as alluded to in my previous answer, I don't believe dermatology doctor is through. I have had the same issues I presented to him over a year ago and he simple just keeps suggesting new types of medication instead of fixing the root cause.
-1	I've been with my primary doctor for years and he's already proven himself to me. He was able to dispose sinus problems I have work recommending Claritin D and Flonase daily. Others kept referring me to ENTs who have me no real answers to my constant sinus infections.
-1	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE THEY GIVE THEM THEIR BEST TO  HELP  IN OUR WAYS TO STAY HEALTHY AND GOOD . THEY ALWAYS SUGGEST GOOD THINGS .
1	All of the doctors that I have interacted with over the past few years have been understanding and compassionate about my current situations. Sometimes I feel like they haven't been completely helpful in finding solutions to some of our health problems, but I've never felt like they haven't been doing their best job to communicate and give me options. 
1	I think my doctor is often busy but is very concerned about my care. He does listen and tries to take time.  He cares more about what is good for me and will schedule more tests and or refer me to another doctor he knows and truest.  Overall he's very good but I always like to check on things myself so I do have to questions what he tells me or get a second opinion and he encourages this.  So far my primary care physician has been very accurate and has offered good advice or treatment.
1	I have been seeing the same primary care physician for 30 years and have established a long-standing and mutually respectful relationship.  While I trust her judgment completely, she also value my input and abides by my wishes if I prefer one plan of action over another.  when I need a referral to a specialist, she acts quickly.
-1	I trust my personal primary care physician because they seem competent and know what they are talking about. I am iffy with doctors because some of them may seem like they are out of touch with society. 
1	Whenever I went to see the doctor he was always completely honest with me. He would tell me what was wrong or if he wasn't completely sure he would work to figure it out and recommend me to another doctor if he couldn't. When i would go in for check ups he would also give me advise on better ways to improve my health. 
1	The general care practitioner I go to is really good. They do the basics really well and I don't ever really require anything besides some antibiotics every 7-10 years anyway.
-1	Most doctors enter into their profession to help people.  Extensive training is required to become a doctor, so they should know what they are doing.
1	I've being going to my doctor for over 35 years.  I trust him explicitly.  He has always been there for me and my family.
1	My family and I have been with the practice for a long time. The experience is always comfortable and open and honest.
-1	I like my primary physician but she often seems rushed. I'm sure she is honest but not always sure she's thinking very much about what I tell her.
-1	I have had several doctors over my lifetime and I don't trust quite a few of them. If they don't listen or believe what I report about my own health then I can't really trust them to make accurate diagnoses or appropriate treatments
1	I have used my doctor for almost 30 years as I had my son when I was 18. He was just started out in his practice. I have used him since then for my other two deliveries and as my primary physician for my yearly checkups. He goes above and beyond with his bedside manner and thoroughness. He took care of me throughout major complications with all of my pregnancies and I have three healthy children.
1	My doctor has given me pretty good advice at my annual physicals without being overly pushy or forward about it. He's personable and laid back and seems to have my best interests at heart.
1	My doctor changes about every year or two, but my most recent doctor has been very honest with me from day 1.
-1	I trust my personal care provider most of the time. She errs on the side of caution. Some doctors at hospital are terrible at listening to complaints and refuse to consider the underlying pain when they hear the word cancer.
-1	I really think that this person may have an asian fetish and think of me as a geisha.  It really makes me feel uncomfortable.
1	I have never had a reason to distrust them. I have had a somewhat wrong diagnosis in the past, but this wasn't a major issue and they directed me to someone who could provide me with a more accurate diagnosis and method of treatment. 
-1	I think she is very intelligent and is definitely capable of taking care of my needs. She also makes a point to pay attention to my input about things. 
-1	In general I have a distrust for my primary care physician and doctors in general. I feel this way because whenever I have had a medical issue it is rare that I get any kind of resolution or any real help. I feel that doctors are so quick to medicate and not find out what the underlying issue is creating the problem. Because any doctors are of any real help I try to avoid going to them even when I need it. It seems like no matter how many blood tests or other kinds of medical tests one gets there is never any resolution to the problem only a cover up of the problem. I feel like doctors just cover the surface and never really dig deep to understand the problem. I do believe there are rare doctors that will dig deep and get the medical problem and try to solve it, but these doctors are extremely rare. In addition I feel like doctors do not take time with their patients anymore. There is no caring. It feels like they try to see as many patients as possible and never really take the time to get to know someone and their needs. In all I can't trust doctors anymore. At one time I trusted them more but I have seen the medical profession really decline in quality of care. 
-1	When i trust my doctor, it helps to create a better relationship between the two of us. Those who distrust the doctor may end up being combative, and that is not conducive to good health. Of course, trusting your doctor starts when you have a good doctor that is professional
-1	I trust what is said, but sometimes I feel like I am not a person to my doctor, and he could misread my symptoms.
1	My primary care physician has already proven her abilities to me. Three years ago I almost died from an acute COPD flareup that just would not get better. My Dr. took care of me, made sure I understood what was going on and how much danger I was in, hospitalized me and treated me. she then changed my whole maintenance med routine to improve my overall health. At this time she was the ER Dr on duty not my primary care Dr. After that hospitalization I changed her to my primary care Dr. I knew I would never find a Dr more dedicated to my health and I trust her 100%
1	I have a complete trust  my primary care physician.They dont lie about my health reports and provide me actual information about my health.They even help me understood if anything is hard know about my health conditions.
-1	I just had my first appointment with my new provider so I don't know him well, but he was very thorough and organized, however when I told him my L4 dermatome below my knee was numb he googled it with me and as he was doing so said he didn't think that was the L4 dermatome. It was. Then he googled a few conditions in front of me and suggested I might have diabetes. I live a pretty healthy active lifestyle and have no other symptoms, and diabetes numbness usually starts in hands and feet and is tingly or painful. I am on a soccer team of physical therapists and they all checked me out and said it was likely a contusion or compression. My sister checked me out and said the same thing. I asked about diabetes and they all thought that was ridiculous. Why was he googling so many things in our appointment? Just say you're not sure, I don't expect you to know everything, but making things up, reaching, or googling diagnoses (which I already did more effectively, not webmd nonsense) doesn't instill confidence. But he seemed like he genuinely wanted me to leave feeling taken care of, and that's more than a lot of doctors.
-1	I mostly trust her, but I feel that she is very rushed and asks few questions. I feel like she does not ask enough questions. This is compared to previous doctors I've had in the past.
-1	I trust my doctor to an extent. They seem very passionate and wonderful whenever I am a patient, but it's hard to get in touch with them. They don't always have great follow through and they always seem rushed. 
1	My doctor always takes an extended amount of time to discuss all of my issues with me and make sure that I understand them. He is willing to do whatever I would like to make me feel comfortable and taken care of. He is bluntly honest and makes sure I know all of the side effects of my medications and whether or not I should be concerned about them. He has been right in every diagnosis he has given me so far. 
-1	I think generally I do trust my doctor, however, I think that ultimately after listening to my doctor any decisions about my health are basically mine and I don't always agree with my doctor. I had doctors who would tell me I needed procedures, that I don't think would have been right for me, so I I would seek another doctor. I also feel like some doctors are only interested in money and aren't interested in your well being.I have had doctors bill me for things I didn't get or charge me for cancelling an appointment.
-1	In most doctor I don't have a whole lot of trust. This is based on my experiences in life. I have had some good experiences as well. Not all doctors are bad.
-1	I have been seeing my PCP for almost 8 years, so we have developed a pretty good relationship, and I do trust her. I trust her so much that my children also see her. There are some areas that I feel she isn't expert on, but that is why she refers us to specialists.
-1	My primary care physician is really good. She is hired by my company and not her own doctor's office, so she really cares about taking the time to listen and explain things to me. 
-1	I am not currently on pain medication, but if I were I would be extremely wary of having only one doctor's opinion due to the prescription opiate addiction epidemic that is sweeping the United States. 
-1	I trust him because he has taken care of the sickness I have had and my family has had.  I do sometimes have trouble understanding what the nurses call me back about for diagnosis
-1	"I believe that doctors see a lot of people and give a lot of ""canned"" answers that are probably good advice but aren't tailored to each person individually."
1	They treat me as a friend. Being a medical professional they done use word to dum down what is being discussed. I much rather they tell me using the medical term vs trying to avoid miscommuication
1	I've been going to the same doctor since I was an infant.  He's well known in town and well liked.  He spends as much time as you need NEVER giving you the feeling that he's rushed.  Never.  He sits and listens quietly and intently to what you have to say.  Which also makes the patients outside waiting impatient and complain until they get in the room and he shows them the same patient listening to their symptoms, issues.  That's why I wait patiently when I'm waiting because I know what he's doing.  
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has been treating me ever since I was little. My mother was taking me to a different doctor when I was younger and he was repeatedly misdiagnosing my illness. My mother got frustrated and switched doctors, the one of which is still my current primary care physician.
-1	Its been a mixed bag for me some doctors are really good at what they do and others not so much, its been 5050 for me so far. its rather difficult and finding a good doctor has been inconsistent 
1	I have had my doctor for a long time. He seems my entire family and children. He is kind and patient. Makes sure you understand everything and does not rush with you.
-1	I feel I can trust my primary care doctor within reason.  I do feel some of the newer drugs he tries to put me on are because he gets some sort of kick back.  I question if these drugs are really in my best interest or in his.  I also feel that sometimes he doesn't listen to what I am saying and just goes by the book.  
1	My primary care physician belongs to a practice which both myself, my wife and several of our friends have been patients in for many years. They have great reputations in the community. Additionally, my physician has excellent bedside manners, is very easy to talk to and always asks if there is anything that they can do better during the course of my visits. My primary care physician makes me feel comfortable and secure in knowing that they are giving the best attention possible.
-1	I know doctors just want to push pills most of the time. I have been fortunate to find a doctor who would rather treat me with something natural first before going to extreme measures. I have had doctors int he past who just want to prescribe something and want you to stick to it no matter what.
-1	I fully believe she is doing her best, The current health care system piles workloads on top of the short supply of doctors. Due to the high workload and the short amount of time available for each patient they are not nearly as thorough as one would like. Also due to time constraints and information sharing problems they are almost never up to date on your files and past Labs, ext. They put out health fires but do little to promote general good health and long term goals. I also feel there is a long gap between current medical research and what is being practiced at the physician level, i believe in the worst cases there are old doctors practicing the medicine they learned in college, when 30 years of new science is being ignored. 
-1	I trust doctors because they are extremely knowledgeable but they can make mistakes because they work in a fast pace high stress environment
1	I trust her because she is extremely personable, takes her time to really understand ALL my symptoms. She discussed different options and different ways of handling everything and gives me a set of difference choices based on my needs. She even seeks out sheaper medications due to my low income
1	I'VE BEEN SEEING THE SAME DOCTOR FOR OVER 15 YEARS AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND FORTHCOMING WITH ME. THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE TIME I CAN THINK OF WHERE I QUESTIONED WHAT I WAS TOLD REGARDING MY HEALTH
-1	I like my doctor to take their time and sometimes that doesn't happen.  But, she does what she can.  She answers questions and perscribes what is needed.  
-1	I neither trust nor distrust my primary care physician. I believe in looking at the relevant information around you in a skeptical, but pragmatic way. You must neither let your suspicions about doctors fool you into not taking their advice all the time nor should you overly trust everything they tell you. It is, after all, completely up to you in the end to come upon the best course of action concerning your health.
-1	Doctors are human.  Yes, they are highly trained and can have lots of experience, but mistakes still happen.  Sometimes it's a simple fault, and sometimes it's due to complacency.  In any case, I bear the responsibility for my health, not them.  They can make suggestions and offer advice, but it is ultimately up to me what happens to maintain my health.
-1	I have issues with my primary care physician.  I scheduled sick visits (reluctantly, because it is so expensive) only to come out of the office with more questions than I started with.  Recently I went in for issues with my hands and I knew the diagnosis the doctor gave me was completely off the mark.  He spent very little time examining me.
1	The doctors I have had throughout my life have always been good to me.  I have never had any problems with them.  I am very confident in them no matter what the situation is.
1	I trust my dr because he is always up front and honest with me and tells me all. He always listens to my concerns and is always listening and helping me out. He is a caring dr. Not one that just gets you in and out to make money.
-1	It is really hard for me to trust anybody. Also, a lot of doctors are only out for themselves. However, I have had about 8 surgeries and all of my surgeons were awesome and I trust the surgeons! 
-1	 I generally have trust in my doctor's motives. I have bad reactions to some prescribed medications but, the doctor was not careless or incorrect in prescribing them for me.  The two bad experiences I had were; a doctor who wanted to do a surgical procedure in office with local anesthesia that, as I found out when I had it done in hospital, would have likely killed me if I had allowed him to proceed, and a doctor who took a phone call while suturing me and allowed a poorly trained nurse to finish the job. Big scar! I have had many more doctors who went the extra mile and saved my life or health through being extra thorough with my diagnosis.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing her for over five years and she has never given me information I have found to be false.  She discusses health issues with me and takes my concerns into consideration
-1	I went through few primary doctors. Some are trustable more than other. Over all i trust them because i don't know any better than them. Of course, i make sure i understand what they are saying and what they mean. What are the advantage and disadvantage of particular medicine or treatment before i make my decision? If i  have a certain condition and if i don't trust them then that not good for my health. If i am doubtful then i will take the second opinion. But i will not ignore completely what my doctor is saying.
1	My doctor has my best interests at heart and u believe this to be true because he shows genuine interest in my well being and my day to day life decisions that may affect my health and self worth
-1	I think doctors sometimes have people's best interest but not always. Sometimes they are too busy or in it for the money they can milk depends
-1	I trust my family doctor because I have had health issues come up or things that have bothered me for awhile and other family doctor's couldn't seem to help fix or get the right medication for the problem but this doctor has helped me every time, so I feel she knows what she is doing and I trust her.
-1	I sometimes feel doctors are overbooked and a result hurry too much with each patient. I also feel that sometimes they are a bit too confident in what they think and dont explore other options well enough just to be safe.
1	He has taken the time out to really make sure I understood concepts by drawing pictures, which I haven't experienced with other doctors. He is against the use of certain medications that are addictive, but the most helpful in situations. I needed an anti anxiety medicine that would help and he preferred to prescribe medicine that did not really help rather than giving me medicine that absolutely would. 
1	I have had my doctors for several years now. We've built a relationship and I do trust them to share information with me freely and that we will choose the best course of action together. 
1	My primary caregiver has been honest and straight forward since my first visit years ago. I visited for a large splinter that had become infected in my leg. Instead of recommending a costly incision to remove it, he first recommended antibiotics to help the swelling go down with hopes to remove it naturally. I appreciate someone who goes down every possible path to ensure you get the care you need, not the most expensive.
-1	Many times they simply do not listen to concerns especially in relation to medications. They tend to trust too much in medications that can cause serious side effects and don't realize how much they can negatively impact your life. Specifically I was given medication that was not working well for me but the doctor kept telling me to give it time. I listened and regretted it. I lost most of my hair and gained about 40 pounds by the time I gave up and stopped taking the medication. The doctor was not empathetic or concerned about the effects but the experience had a very negative and lasting affect on my life. I've had more than my share of negative outcomes due to poor medical advice. My son also went through years of unnecessary treatment due to a misdiagnosis. So I can't say that I fully trust any doctor's medical advice.
-1	Doctors are human. Most of them are careful and want to help their patients. Some are better at keeping up-to-date with the newest best practices than others. So, depending on how many doctors are in your area and how good your insurance is, most people who can afford medical care can find a decent doctor who keeps their best interests in mind.
-1	"Because many doctors are either a) trying to get through patients as quickly as possible; b) trying the safest (and not always most effective) solutions that minimize their own liability; c) have a ""band aid"" approach to medicine that treats symptoms rather than the underlying cause, and d) depend on medications and writing prescriptions. Furthermore, most doctors are not interested in preventative care and have very little good advice on nutrition. "
1	My doctor seems to be very personable and has my best interest in mind.  She is very down to earth and is someone I can talk to easily.  I think she is doing what is best for my current health, and I know she is educated to make those decisions.  Doctors in general I have dealt with I usually trust.  There have been a few exceptions, but if I don't have a good fit I seek a 2nd opinion.
-1	I feel like they see so many patients in a given day, that they do not remember you on a personal level, therefore they do not really have a clue what you're really going through.  I trust what they think based on ME having to point out every single little symptom I experience.  
-1	I feel like doctors often dismiss what a patient is saying- and roll with their accumulated knowledge of what is actually happening with a patient's medical issue. You can almost see them smirk at times when you describe something.
-1	Personally, I distrust my primary care doctor because she is always in a hurry and rarely takes the time out of to fully listen to me. She is always leaving the room and doing multiple things at once not being fully immersed in my care. 
1	I had the chance to review other physicians before choosing the actual one. I have also learned from a close family ember about my doctor's qualities. He indeed proved to be very professional and also close to his patients.
1	I feel like my doctor has always taken the time to listen to my concerns and address them. He doesn't blow off what I say even if it takes us a little while to figure out what is going on.
-1	in the past she has misdiagnosed me when i was having pain problems, but most of the time she has been very thorough and good
-1	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind but at times they have to many patients and to many things going on and they make quick decisions that may not always be the right one even if they think it was at the time  
-1	its happen couple times when i went to my primary care physician she was wrong about my illness then i had to ask her about it and then she used to prescribe other medicine. i dont trust now days to doctors. most of them look in google for clues.   
1	I have been with my PCP for over 20 years and we have pretty much grown up together (HA).  She is very careful and complete in her care for me.  She has usually been right is her recommendations for any treatment I have needed.  However, I always will retain my right to make my own healthcare decisions if I disagree with her recommendation.
-1	"Normally and previously I have had total confidence in her. However recently my medical needs have started to conflict with what is ""popular"" to do because of certain topics in the media. Though no one has told me that is the reason. I have been given NO reason why I'm being denied effective treatment. "
-1	I trust because he has valued me in a correct way and I consider him to be a capable person since he has experience and many patients have been valued by him and I feel satisfied with this
-1	My primary care doctor is new to me, so Iâll answer about doctors in general. I have a lot of experience with doctors, and for the most part I think they are honest and trustworthy. But I know that in a busy clinic that has a lot very ill patients, there is  a lot of shuffling of priorities. One day you may have the doctorâs full attention, other days you may not. Also, Iâve had enough errors in my treatment over the years (none fatal) to know that doctors and nurses are not infallible. They prescribe the wrong dosage, or donât fully investigate drug interactions, etc.
1	I know him personally as a friend and have worked with him in the past, before he was a doctor. So I also know him professionally.
-1	Because there decision is made off of generals. They are not specialist. If I tell my PCP that I am not overweight but I eat well(veggies, all organic) they will at the end tell me to eat better. 
1	I have a holistic doctor, who is a trained MD and oriental medicine practitioner. I trust her guidance and follow her instructions, but I don't ignore my own intuition if it conflicts with what she says.
1	My primary care doctor is caring and seems very wise. She has been a doctor for many years and always has good answers to my questions. I've verified many things she's told me on websites such as Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins and she is always correct.
-1	I like that the dr takes the time to listen and make sure to understand what is going on and to make me feel like a person that can get better and do well.
1	I have a big trust in my doctor because he has chosen his profession because he wants to help people achieve good health and good life.  I feel that my doctor has no reason to give me something that would jeopardize my health and my life.
-1	I have never had problems with them.  They always listen to me, as they know I have some medical background, and then we discuss options.  I always leave appointments knowing that it was the right decision.
1	The doctor I have now asks about the family and seems to remember things about them. Seems to care about me taking care of myself. That comes across in his tone and approach to the visits.
1	I trust my physician because they never rush me. I trust my physician because they always take time to explain complicated diagnoses or procedures to me. I trust my physician because they always smile whenever we interact. I trust my physician because they are great with going the extra mile to make sure I confident in my healthcare decisions by making sure I fully understand and risks associated.
-1	I feel like doctors today are too busy.  They aren't thorough on examinations and do not make sure you understand what they are telling you.  Their practice earns money in volume so they move people in and out as fast as possible.
-1	I distrust the medical profession because it is one solely funded by and has become the face of big pharma, who pushes its poisonous pills via sales bonuses to doctors who write a certain number of scripts. The medical profession as it stands is a front for the biggest drug cartel that is responsible for more deaths than any other, the fda and big pharma  
-1	I some what trust but sometimes I feel like I am not being heard and the doctor is always in such a rush that he doesn't listen to me
-1	It is not that I do not trust my doctor as much as I am aware that he is human, has a lot on his plate and is therefore subject to error.  I do believe in getting a second option when I don't believe that a concern is been met.
1	My doctor has shown to be really caring and trustworthy over the years that I have known him. He has never led me wrong and always seems to know what he's talking about involving my health.
1	I find my self without any reason whatsoever as to why I should not trust my doctor. I have always followed his transcriptions and every time I get cured. I therefore have gained a lot of confidence and trust in him. 
-1	Like I stated before, sometimes I feel as if physicians are so overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people they are seeing that they do not conscientiously take the time they should to sit and explain, question, discuss with their patients. My parents have both been on the bad end of their primary care physician not doing what he was supposed to do. One time he even made a very bad prescription for my mother that could have been very deadly if the pharmacist had not caught the mistake and called him on it. Physicians are trying to see too many and utilizing the factory model that the United States has fit to everything from labor to schools to prisons.
-1	I researched my condition and I was given a treatment plan that included medication and one that included a natural change in my diet. This was the same research that I did prior to consulting with my doctor. Thus, no medication or plan is being forced upon me. Also, I was able to express my discomfort with the medication that I was using and I was switched to a different medication. 
-1	So far Iâve only had minor medical issues and in all cases the doctors have been very willing to explain everything and answer all my questions.
1	I trust my primary physician because she knows me really well. She has been my doctor since I was 4 years old so she knows the ins and outs of all my health issues better than any other doctor. On a personal level, she has been there for me in times of need and has gone above and beyond her call of duty.
-1	In general I trust my primary care physician as they have demonstrated their honesty in the past. Additionally, I trust most doctors in general. Furthermore, it takes a certain type of personality to be a primary care physician. They are stereotypically honest, trustworthy, and caring.
1	I think that my primary care physician sometimes doesn't take my interests into account. That makes me feel like my doctor isn't completely trustworthy. I have told them about how I've tried solutions that they suggest, but I am not receiving alternative solutions after saying so.
1	I like my primary care physician, he treats me fairly and gives me good advice. He also lets me know when he feels I need to do something to improve my health.
1	I like my COP because he seems to care. He doesn't rush me. If he's unable to give me an answer, he has no issue Googling it to figure out a good solution instead of insisting it's not true or he knows better. His humour doesn't hurt either. 
-1	My doctor has found and been able to diagnoses what other doctors just left untreated..I completely trust my Doctor and his team of staff.I would recommend anybody and everybody to my doctor.
1	I trust my doctor to some extent where she is trying to give me medicine and helping me stay healthy but at the same time my total belief is in God.
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I feel like she dismisses a lot of what I say except for what she wants to hear and treat. For example, I suffer from depression and anxiety and all she does is prescribe medication that doesn't work. Sometimes my anxiety is out of control and I get very little sleep. I have a medication that is not working for me and she just keeps adjusting the dosage and it still doesn't help. This has been going on for over a year. She takes my high blood pressure and cholesterol very serious but doesn't give me much help other than a diet and exercise and medicine. The practice has also become much more busy than it used to be and I feel like sometimes her mind is someplace else because of that.
-1	I do have a primary care physician. She and I have known each other for many decades. We frequently disagree with each other, though I'm confident that she has my best interests in heart...but her business office, my insurance, other third parties, et al. that are mostly concerned with their bottom-line can and do interfere.
-1	Sometimes doctors recommend certain medications because they get a percentage of the revenue and I dont like it because they could probably recommend something cheaper to you but they just want to make money
-1	I trust my primary care physician as she is very thorough and wants to help get down to why something is bothering you.  I don't always trust that she is 100% present as she is very busy, only works two days a week, and has a packed schedule. I frequently have to wait a very long time while at the appointment before I see her, and I wonder how focused she is.  I feel like I'm inconvniencing her with my issues.
-1	I mostly trust my PCP. Of all the doctors I've seen in my life, he's better than most when it comes to listening to my problems and trusting that medical issues I bring up need to be addressed; a lot of doctors I've seen will try to explain away symptoms or avoid doing more tests. But even he's not perfect, although maybe his medical judgment and my instincts may sometimes be in conflict.
1	My primary care physician has always helped me with my problems or illnesses.  She is conservative and will start with the easiest remedy to see if that works first but is always open to taking the next step.  She listens to and answers my questions and seems to care about me.
1	I have a few doctors I see regularly. They are all very dependable, capable, and intelligent. I don't see any reason not to trust them.
-1	He spends a long time with me and makes sure I have a lot of reading material to take home. He makes sure in depth that everything is okay and makes sure to run regular tests.
-1	I think she is fine. Sometimes rushed or doesnât always listen to what I want or make me feel heard, but does what she can.
-1	I had a LEEP procedure twice last year. I trust my doctor because She is professional and I am not. However, after having first procedure, She recommended me to have another procedure even though my after procedure result was negative. According to her, Just make sure all bad tissue is taken away by taking bigger portion . So, I followed her recommendation because she is very careful person, but on the other hand, I feel having second procedure is really needed or not.
-1	I know that they know what they are talking about but I feel that I get lost in the shuffle of other patients. I feel like they are quick with me to move on to the next person. I really don't know what to believe when it comes to what my doctors are telling me. I believe about half.
-1	I trust doctors because that's the only gap between dying from a cold and living with cancer. I believe doctors are really important and valuable to the world for the sense of security and safety. They are the closest things to magicians due to the miracle they are able to perform.
-1	Do not think they give you a lot to pick from as they get a kick back for the drugs the prescribe. Would get at least 3 different opinions before I would make a decision.
1	My doctor is excellent.  He never makes me feel rushed and he always takes the time to answer questions for me.  He is extremely thorough when I have to see him about something.  He also has a very human quality about him, unlike many doctors I have dealt with in the past.  He also sees my young daughter and is extremely thoughtful and thorough, more so when dealing with a youngster.
-1	When I offer another doctors opinion he immediately tells me they are wrong without explanation. He prescribes medications like they are candy. He gets very angry and impatient with questions or not understanding. He refuses to hear the issues I am there to see him for in full. I am cut off and he starts a physical exam instead of hearing me out. 
1	My doctor I have know for almost 20 years, he is always been friendly and trusting and I have never once had an issue with my care. He always has been honest and helped me through anything I have come across. He always makes me feel like I am a priority.
-1	My husband and I have the same doctor.  She always does and suggests many solutions to any problem we are experiencing.  The always trouble shoots are issues, and suggest tests.  I feel that she genuinely cares about her patients.
-1	I've known and had them my whole life and things they've done for me before have been successful so i have reason to believe they will continue to be
1	I trust my particular primary care physician because she is a friend of mine.  Most importantly, I trust her character.  I know that she cares deeply for people and takes her job very seriously.  I know that she has done a great deal of personal research on many health topics, especially those pertaining to women and children.  She also takes a holistic approach to medicine which I appreciate.  
-1	I mentioned my extreme anxiety and how i just couldn't relax no matter what I tried. She told me that I just needed to walk out in the sun everyday and completely cut out caffeine and I'll be cured. She did blood work for my hypothyroidism and did a cholesterol test with it. The test came back I had high cholesterol and she put me on a medication they just called into the pharmacy and she didn't talk to me about anything. Just told me to take the pill.
-1	For the most part, I trust my current primary care physician because her medical examinations always seem thorough enough, and she has always prescribed medications and treatments that have turned out to be helpful and never harmful. However there are a few issues I've brought up repeatedly that have not particularly been addressed. I assume that she believes those issues are not a big deal; whether they are as harmless as she seems to think, I can't be sure since I'm no medical expert. For now I'd prefer to just go along with her advice. I have been seen by some very poor quality physicians in the past, and my PCP is definitely not one of those. I generally don't put a lot of trust in people, but I trust my PCP more than most.
-1	Sometimes for the same symptoms different specialist give way different, sometimes opposite prognosis, so there are many things they disagree with one another in, that makes me nervous.
-1	I don't totally trust my primary care physician mostly because I don't know him well enough. He took over when my long time primary care physician retired. What I do know of him is that he is nice enough but always in a hurry and I swear he just looks at his computer and checks off what blood tests I need. If he touches me physically at all it is to listen with his stethoscope and to feel my neck. That's it. Not that I want him to examine every part of me every time, but maybe a bit more thoroughness and a human touch? It's a good thing I'm proactive because if I didn't mention and point out specific problems that should be obvious to a trained physician, I don't think he'd notice.
-1	I generally trust him, but I don't completely trust everything they evaluate. He is just a person with his own biases after all. but I generally think of him as credible
1	I have been going to the same physician for many years, and have built a great deal of trust with her.  She understands me and my health history and needs.  
1	My primary care doctor is always willing to take as much time as we need at each appointment to cover all of my medical concerns. She is also always willing to listen to any concerns I have and doesn't brush me off.
-1	My doctor is very straight forward and honest but he's not rude about how he explains things to you. He always explains situations to the best he can so that you understand what needs to be done. 
-1	I've only had one bad doctor in all my experiences with medical professionals. And he was an eye doctor with his own private practice that strung me along, to get me to keep taking many tests. I ended up seeing optometrists at the mall (eye glasses store) and she fixed my problem after one appointment. So now I rather go to a popular and well-known location to see a doctor, if it isn't a clinic or hospital. 
1	"The doctor has a very caring way about him, and he has a long history of success as a doctor, as well as the proper training and eductation. He is very open and honest with me. I chose ""agree"" instead of ""strongly agree"" above though, because I don't completely trust anyone who isn't a dear friend or loved one, and I am not a medical expert."
-1	I haven't seen a doctor in a long time, and my recent visit had me feeling a bit wary about everything. I was worried about the cost of everything, and listening to my doctor talk about going to see some specialist for one thing, and a specialist for another thing made me very alert and unwilling to agree to either one. I just don't believe I have complete trust in the American Healthcare System and its practices, in regards to cost for the patient. I.e. a saline bag being charged at $100, when they are manufactured at perhaps $0.25
-1	I trust my doctor, although sometimes I feel patient care is just a revolving door to them. They see thousands and thousands every year, day an day out. Sometimes it is hard to get them to call you back or even schedule an appointment that has to be months away. I have seen a lot more younger doctors over the years that have more energy and stamina to take on new patients than the doctors that have been around for decades. There needs to be a change in primary care.
-1	I chose neutral because I currently do not have a primary care doctor. My medical needs are usually taken care of at an Immediate Care center due to health insurance.
-1	Well sometimes i feel as if my doctor doesn't take the time to really look at me i know they are in a hurry but they could spend just a little more time
1	My doctor is generally aware of my needs and the needs of my family. I always feel a level of personal care and attention when  I am in her office
1	I've been going to the same doctor my entire life and he's always been a great help in helping diagnose and eliminate the various viruses, infections, and flues that I caught throughout in my life. I've had no reason to not trust him for the entirety of my life. So, ever since I was a child, I've learned to trust my doctor.
-1	I've had a really devastating loss because my doctor suck. Or it's all my fault, and my body is just terrible. I really don't want to think about it, honestly.
1	My PCP has been treating me a long time and has went out of her way to help me with new treatments and with exploring different treatment plans when traditional ones weren't working. She would also visit me during hospitalizations which has given me a lot of reasons to trust her and feel she is looking out for me. 
-1	I trust them to do the right thing because they studied a long time, took an oath to help patients, and should care about people.  I have to trust them.
1	My doctor is completely honest with me no matter what as I allow him to be.  If Iâm over weight heâll tell me, if I have high blood pressure he will tell.  He tells me all these things looking me straight in they eyes and letâs me know all the bad things that can possibly happen if I donât do better. Death, stroke, being paralyzed.  This is why I trust my doctor 
1	I trust my primary care physician because she listens to my concerns and provides clear explanations and suggestions on how to overcome them.
-1	I work in the medical field and I understand the way that pcps interact with their patients. Sometimes admin gets in the way of getting things done and this can impede the patient process, sometimes doctors are burnt out and are sacrificing patient outcomes for their own gains.
-1	I trust my doctor because they do not make me feel dumb about the questions I ask and are always willing to answer more questions I have.
-1	I basically trust my primary care physician because she is extremely experienced and seems caring, and her treatment recommendations seem appropriate.
1	I have full trust in my PCP. I have never in all the years I have been seeing her had one issue. She always makes me feel comfortable and answers all questions and concerns I have. She doesn't always take drastic measures but takes things slow to get to a solution. 
1	They haven't let me down yet. I trust them because every time i went to them with a problem, they always took care of it. They always manage to give me what i need to fix my problem without any negative side effects
-1	It it their job and I like to believe they have moral standards and wouldnt sway me towards something wrong.
-1	For the most part, I do trust my primary care physician.  I believe the physician has my best interest overall.  That being said, I still question my doctor on certain decisions to make sure I agree with the decision.  I am not afraid to question my doctor or do more research about certain decisions my doctor wants me to follow.
-1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years. They spend ample time listening to any symptoms or issues that I have to present before making any form of diagnoses or prescribing medications. They also take the time to fully explain any diagnoses to me at that time. 
-1	My primary care physician is kind and he listens but I feel he is often in a hurry and hears my words but only the ones that he wants to. He wants to order more test on top of more tests and sends me to other doctors that I can not afford even after I express to him that I do not have the finances to go to others. 
-1	i trust him too much because of the years, what he has advice me had never proving to be false. he is so caring and approachable. he tell me what is needed and not what i wants to hear. he is such a wonderful man. also he put patience first before money.
1	I found from my past experiences that my primary care physician treatment opinions are best for my good health. As the result I have full trust in my primary care physician.
-1	In general, I trust my primary care physician. I think she is trying her best to provide good medical care to meet my  needs.  However, I think sometimes she may not listen to my point of view and may instead rely on her own experiences and training too much, as opposed to seeing what may work uniquely for me as an individual.  However, I do feel like she cares and does a thorough job overall.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician. In general, I expect and believe that doctors want to help people and be honest with them about their medical conditions. But, they can be busy or overworked. They might be a bit busy and not focus as much on patients as they would like.
1	I have gone to the same doctor my entire life. He has been my family's doctor for many years. My family and I trust him completely. He has always been very honest and has always taken the time to answer all my questions.
-1	I agree for the most part that doctors are looking out for their patients and can be trusted, but I do think like all human beings sometimes they are working in their own interests.  For example, my regular doctor used to recommend removing moles even if they are not a problem (cancerous or pre-cancerous), but when I mentioned that I am on high deductible insurance and these procedures come out of my pocket, she conceded that this mole removal is not needed.
1	My Primary Care physician is incredible. She's relatable and kind and takes the time to address any concerns I have. I trust her completely.
-1	I trust that most doctors truly have their patient's well being in mind when they recommend courses of action. Most doctors that I have seen have been very open with me about my treatment options and about finding what is affordable for me at the time.
1	I trust my primary care because I have to be able to rely on them to help me make informed medical decisions.  I also need to be able to trust my doctor to explain to me the best course of action.
-1	Generally, i do trust my physician, but I also feel that they see me so rarely, and see so many other patients, that they are not able to provide the best recommendation.
-1	I have had the same doctor for 15 years, and he has never steered me wrong yet.  He always treated my grandma and continuously worked to help her as she had dementia and Alzheimer.
-1	I place trust in my doctor, but have not done so blindly. I take everything with a grain of salt, at least initially. I have been with my PCP for a significant amount of time now, an dI understand and trust their judgement when it comes to matters of my health, though I could not say the same for other doctors with whom I am not a patient. I mainly base my trust on my experience with my PCP, which has been by far one of the best 'professional' relationships I have had in my life.
1	I know him personally, he goes to our church and we have his home phone number.   He is great with our boys, always has a second to talk if we have a concern, is thorough but not overbearing, hasnt been wrong about anything yet and you can tell he genuinely cares about us.
-1	I generally trust my doctor but I feel like with the workload they have that sometimes I need to be responsible in following through or asking the right questions in order to make sure I get the right help.
1	there have been times in the past I thought the doctor was not taking my high cholesterol as serious as they should.  However,  I changed my diet and worked out and brought  my level down without medicine so I am glad I did not rely on the drugs. 
-1	I want to be able to fully trust my doctors but sometimes when I ask for further information about my specific problem, they don't seem to want to go into details which makes me doubt them. I also feel when they try to lump things to past problems I've been dealing with instead of looking at the problem individually I begin to distrust their judgement. 
-1	I never fully trust a doctor because I know they are just human beings. As a lawyer, I understand that there are many people who can go through medical school and come out under-qualified.
-1	I do think doctors have a lot of pressure to get one patient done and move onto the next; hence lapses in high quality service.  My doctor is careful, but could probable be a little more detailed.  Also, I can do research on my own to determine what medication I need and know my medical history well enough to know what medication doesn't work well or causes a reaction.  
-1	I trust my PCP and one other doctor. Following that, I usually trust male docs I donât know if he doesnât jump into the examination and gives me time to feel him out. Talks a bit, etc. I canât trust women doctors. :( (Personal history). To be fair, I donât have a feeling that most are not in it for the right reason, not as a business venue.
-1	My dr and i believe that most dr's are too by the book.  They see a person as a payment or a number rather than an individual. This causing them to just use us as test subjects to kind of see what works rather than really getting to know us and our bodies. 
1	I don't see my PCP often, but when I do he is very straightforward with me. He expresses his concerns if he has any. He then gives a list of options for treatment(s) and allows me to decide which course to follow. If there are any issues I have a variety of ways in which I can reach out to him and he is prompt at responding.
-1	The doctor has a quota of patients that he has to see to make a profit for the day. this leads to the doctor spending less time than is possibly needed to fully aid a patient
-1	I feel like the physician is more oriented towards actions that would bring the hospital more revenues and comfort.  The physician does not seem to truly listen to all that I have to say and makes judgments and diagnoses before fully understanding the problems.
1	I have not had a reason not to  trust him, everything he has recommended thus far has been accurate with no reason to question his decisions.  
-1	I feel I haven't seen my newest Dr. enough to have complete trust in them. They do give me my options and seem knowledgeable in what they are doing. I do however always have some worries as to if sometimes they are just being paid by some drug companies to give certain meds out or prescribe certain treatments.
-1	I feel like my doctor is in a hurry. She is wanting to get through with the exam and move on to the next patient. If I ask a question, she rushes through the answer. I can always tell she is focused on getting to the next person. So I don't necessarily trust her to be thorough or careful.
1	I have never personally had an experience with a doctor that would make me not trust a doctor's advise.  I believe that in general doctors do have their patients best interest in mind. 
-1	I trust my doctor, all in all i have gotten what i needed from him. He's always been right about my health and given me the right medication. The only thing is that he's always in a rush wished he would spend a little more time answering my questions.
1	I do feel at ease with my doctor. I have known her for many years so she knows how my body reacts to things. How I feel about things. I believe in her judgement. 
-1	I trust my primary physician because he is honest with me and tries to help me as much as he can. I also get to freely engage him when i have a problem
1	I trust them for the most part because they know what they're doing and generally want me to get better. The only thing I dont trust about my doctor is the brands of prescription medicine they push because I know some medication gives them bonuses while others don't so I have to research the medications myself to see which is right for me
1	I have seen her for a long time and she's consistently shown a lot of care. She always listens to my questions, even the seemingly silly sounding ones, and answers honestly.
1	I have known this person for a few years now, and I trust his judgement. I have felt that he is interested me as a person, not just a chart. I feel I could talk to this person about anything going on in my body.
-1	My doctor recently left her practice so I will be seeing a new doctor. In addition, I always feel that a doctor is trying to get through as many patients as possible. 
-1	I recently moved and do not have a primary care physician. I think doctors in general have the patient's best interest in mind. I have enjoyed working with most of my doctors, but I have occasionally felt rushed during appointments. Therefore, there has been occasional distrust.
-1	"Almost all primary-care physicians are driven by market forces and social need to see more patients per day than they really should. I think this leads them to make ""snap"" decisions without spending a lot of time considering possible alternatives; the ""easy"" answer isn't always the right one. I sometime distrust my doctor's opinion when I feel he wants to rush through answers or complicated diagnoses without really considering whether they're totally correct or whether I understand them fully. I recognize their dilemma, but will not allow it to stop me from getting all the info I need on my medical condition."
-1	"Sometimes I'll get different feedback from a different provider of mine that makes me question who is right or who is wrong. Or I'll bring up something I read online or heard from others with similar conditions and the physician will say ""Yes, that is an option."" I don't like to have to be the one to bring up other things."
-1	I would definitely trust my health care physician because they are the people I could ask help whenever I feel sick. My health care physician was the reason why i am still standing in this planet. I have a good relationships with her and also to my family since when I was young.
1	I trust my doctor because I have read reviews about him. I also trust him because I myself have checked up on the internet the treatment and procedures that he has suggested or prescribed. 
-1	Doctor has given bad advice a couple of times, such as don't read about side effects. I don't have anything else to say.
-1	"Generally speaking, doctors are a product of their systems and culture. They often see themselves as godlike figures, incapable of being questioned, and the environments where they work, with their constant reverence for doctors, reinforce that mentality. This, combined with their fear of liability often makes them completely averse to anything new or different, even when the literature and research show that there is significant potential benefit. I feel that more doctors are concerned about ""not rocking the boat"" than doing what is best for the patient. There are, of course, stellar exceptions, and I have been fortunate to work with some of them.   "
-1	My Primary Care Physician is an exception to the rule. Nearly all other physicians I've encountered would have received the exact opposite scores. My physician runs a small-town cash-only clinic, removing insurance from the process altogether and creating a much better Doctor-Patient relationship in the process.
1	My doctor talks to me like a friend instead of a patient. If he needs to prescribe a medicine, he talks to me on my level of understanding about the pros and cons and tells me about his success or lack thereof with his other patients. He is very honest and open about what I do and do not need to change in reference to my lifestyle. Most importantly, if he doesn't have an answer, he is not afraid to tell me he doesn't know and needs to refer me to a specialist. That most of all is why I trust him so much - that he is willing to admit he doesn't know something or admit someone else may have a better solution.
1	I've known my primary care physician most of my life, and he has never given me a reason not to trust him. 
1	I moved to this city 13 years ago and have been seeing this doctor for all my health care needs, apart from my dentist and eye doctor. She answers all my questions patiently and never hurries through the appointment.
1	I trusted my former primary care physician, but I didn't put all of my trust in him. God is first in my life and my trust is in Him, but to a certain degree I trusted my former primary care physician, because he always seemed to be honest in telling me about all different treatment options available and the results of my blood tests. 
-1	I pretty much trust my primary care doctor. She is friendly and easy to talk to. Sometimes I do feel like she is a little preoccupied with other things and in a hurry. But over all I think I receive adequate care from her.  
1	I have along history with my doctor and I know now i can trust him on what he says and I am always the one to ask questions and at time confirm what he says by reading more on the subject
-1	I get a new doctor each time so it's hard to build trust. They don't necessarily know my medical history so it's hard to trust them.
1	I trust my doctor because she is very understanding and knows me really well. She is almost like my friend and is really nice to me.
1	I trust my doctor because for the most part he has been on the mark with health problems that I have had. Once he had an intern from a local school take a look at me. She had difficulty diagnosing me so she went to get him. As soon as he walked in to the room, he saw me from a distance and called out what I had - again from a distance. He was dead right. My doctor knows his stuff and also has a sense of humor.
1	I trust my doctor because he tells me exactly what I have, why I have what I have, and how to correct my condition. He does not try to push medications on me but looks for natural solutions if possible. 
-1	I have been seeing my current primary care physician for nearly 4 years. She is very competent, compassionate, and will send me to specialists if I have medical problems that she cannot treat. 
1	I trust her because she actually takes the time out to listen to me when I speak to her about what is going on with me.
-1	my primary caretaker is very awesome! She is always down to earth and gives it to me straight. The only negative thing I have against her is she is not for using medicine as much. If it can be done, she would rather the body heal itself naturally. This is ok sometimes but when I have a dance concert coming up there is just not enough time so I don't want to have to argue about giving me medicine. 
-1	I do not have a primary care physician, therefore I marked all of the above items as neutral. I've personally been friends with several doctors in my life, and the reality is they are people like everyone else, and as a result my trust in them depends on their ethics and character. Some doctors are very caring and insightful, some are full of ego that blinds them truly looking and understanding a case before them. And all degrees in between. Should I ever need to see a doctor, I will to a great deal of research on them before consenting to be their patient.
-1	I trust them to do their jobs. I have confidence in them unless they give me a reason not to. I believe they have their patient's best interesting in mind. 
1	I have complete faith in my doctor's abilities and believe that my well-being is at the top of their interests. I feel there is no reason to mistrust my doctor.
1	I trust my doctor because I do believe he wants to do what's best for me and really help me. I think that they always wanna do the best thing they can for their patients. They are their to help, and that's what they really try to do, in my opinion. 
-1	I don't completely trust my primary care physician because I think he is mostly in it for the money.  He knows that I am very limited financially, yet he insists that I make an appointment to see him for any prescription refills, even if I just saw him two days before.  He routinely prescribes the most expensive drugs, knowing that I can't afford them.  On top of that, his office routinely charges me double what my co-pay is supposed to be.  
1	One of the reasons I distrust a lot of Physicians is because in this day, I fear, mostly they are after money. So more test's, more this, more that, try this try that, I fear its all about the money. I wish it wasn't so. But mostly I feel this way. But not about everyone.
-1	I think in the USA Doctors have to worry too much about the bottom line, that is if people do not have high levels of insurance they will not receive all options available to them since they are unable to pay for them. 
-1	I have been misled at times and questioned my primary care physician's thoroughness and motivation. I still trust them, but would be cautious in not seeking out a second opinion in certain situations.
-1	I distrust my PCP and the conventional medical doctors because they are only trained in drugs and surgery.  It is a big business and no one is allowed to deviate from it even if the results are in the best interest of the patient. You look around and see so many people sick, how can I trust the doctors?  Doctors still think soda is ok to drink!
-1	I generally trust doctors, but I don't believe you should trust anyone 100%, without at least verifying their information with another expert at least once or twice, every so often.
-1	i trust doctors for the most part because i believe many of them are inherently good people who got into the medical field in order to help be of service to others. Occasionally there are doctors who seem to be pretty detached from their work and just see all their patients as a paycheck, and that is truly an awful thing.
1	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because of his personality and willingness to answer any questions I would have. His explanation for his methods or recommendations are pretty reasonable and sound and he never rushes me through an appointment. 
1	I have had my primary physician for 20 plus years. During that time he has always listened to my concerns, shared his concerns and always made the correction decisions to improve my various health issues. He is kind and considerate and truly cares about mew and his other patients
1	My doctor listens to me and spends a good amount of time with me instead of just rushing along the appointment. She always asks me if I have any questions and addresses every one of them if I do. When I call the office for a need, I always get assistance over the phone in a timely manner.
-1	He is constricted by the corporation that employs him. He's clearly under a great deal of pressure, probably dealing with more patients than he can comfortably deal with. 
-1	i see a nurse practitioner which was new for me. i think it's a red state thing. or maybe it's the future. anyway the practitioner was able to refer me to a specialist
-1	It's not my primary care physician in particular that I distrust, It's the fact that doctors are people too and anybody can get lazy and careless at times in their profession or simply be having a bad day. I mildly mistrust all doctors until I have reasonable proof not to do so. There are problems with how the medical field is run in this country and I'm sure there are doctors out there that disgree with things they must comply to on a daily basis which can be disheartening in the longrun. Most doctors have the ability to be great, but I believe it's harder than it has to be. Overall though, I do trust my doctor because I have faith in the decision I made to choose them as my pcp based on my experience with them. 
-1	Often feel rushed or forgotten by my doctor's office. It's packed and I have a hard time getting anyone on the phone or talking to busy staff while I'm there. I ferl like one in hundreds of patients they see in a week. I wait for literal hours for my appointments and spend maybe 30 minutes being seen.
-1	I've worked in healthcare (previously) for over 15 years, and have had first-hand experience with many doctors.  I've seen a side of doctors that patients don't see, and some of these interactions have fostered a lack of trust.  I've had experiences where I've gone to see a new doctor and they've had a prescription written for me before I even spoke to them.  I've seen my husband prescribed contraindicated medications that caused an adverse reaction that even I knew shouldn't be taken together.  But, alternatively, I've had some doctors who treated me well who I've really trusted.  I've known other doctors to go out of their way to cater to their patient's needs/fears/wishes.
1	I had the same doctor for the last 12 years. He has always taken good care of me. I think of him more like a family friend than just my primary care doctor. When I had lower back pain problem and couldn't sleep, he referred me to a really good chiropractor and physical therapist. I put a lot of trust in his diagnostic and advice because he is almost always correct with his assessment.   
-1	I can't say I completely trust my general doctor, I mean, he has given me good attention for a whole year and he treats me well but sometimes I think he cares more about making money than myself as he makes me do many tests in the same hospital where he is. It's kind of suspicious.
1	My primary care person is a local Nurse Practitioner.  She is busy but never seems rushed while visiting with me about my concerns.  She listens and then asks questions to be sure she understands.  She explains the reason she will chose a certain treatment or why she's choosing to wait and see rather than treat right away.  I like that she doesn't talk down to me and treats me as though I am intelligent enough to understand.
-1	My doctor is a great doctor and she truly cares about her patients.  I have developed a good relationship with her and she lets me know that she is always there for her patients
1	I have only had one bad experience with a doctor, and it was because he went against my wishes. Other than that one experience, my normal doctor listens to me completely, and always has insightful advice or resources for me to utilize.
1	I have been seeing my doctor a while, we are around the same age and she is very smart and knowledgeable. 
-1	I trust them as much as I should. What that means is if they are clearly pushing a prescription for something I don't think I need, I distrust them. If they are actively pushing minimal treatment I trust them more because I think that my health is their priority opposed to making money by seeing me over and over again or by prescribing more drugs.
-1	I do feel that if I go to my doctor they will give me the best medical attention as possible but I am also aware of natural way of healing that can also be applied.  The natural way are never mentioned by my doctor.  Because of side effects of medications I will often try a natural way of healing first followed by a medication only if absolutely nessesary. I often feel that side effects are overlooked and not discussed. 
-1	My physician is trustworthy but I do feel she can be pre occupied with what makes her life easier at times
-1	I trust my Doctor because I believe he has been completely honest . He is willing to admit when he doesn't have the answer to all of my health concerns and doesn't hesitate to direct me to other Dr. that can treat my health problems.
-1	I'm not entirely happy with my primary care physician because he doesn't always take the time I would like him to take with me.  It is a busy practice. I am currently looking for a new doctor who will be willing to spend time answering my questions.  A doctor who will listen to me and not just assume I don't know what i'm talking about when it comes to my health.
-1	I don't have complete trust in my doctor - but I would say I trust most of what they say. I am not too big on vaccines anymore, although my daughter does get them as a safety precaution. I don't always trust the meds I am given because sometimes if I suggest something the doctor has said no out of spite. And then a few months later we try the medication I originally suggested and it works great (I am mostly talking about psychiatry there - psychiatry/psychology is a hobby of mine, luckily I have a great psych doctor now!)
-1	I do trust my doctor almost completely, you have to if you are not going to go crazy. But I know in the back of my mind no one has my best interest at heart but me. 
1	I have been going to the same doctor for about ten years. He is very thorough and knows my medical needs. He hasn't failed me yet and has helped me tremendously in all aspects of my health.
1	I love my dr. because she is open to hearing what I have to say and is not interested in bossing me or just telling me something to get me out of her hair.
1	I'm active duty military and see my doctor at the base hospital. I feel as though they honestly care about me and my fellow military members and do what is best for our health and long term care. I have no reasons to doubt this or experienced anything to discredit this opinion and view.
-1	I try to ask questions to get the best information, but am not always sure that I have done so. My primary care physician and doctors in general tend to rush appointments and have subordinates reply to me with answers that are sometimes inadequate. My trust is therefore about 50-50.
1	"I trust my medical professional because from the moment I met her, she engaged me and made me feel comfortable and relaxed.  Throughout my visits with her, I've seen her competency shine through and appreciate her honesty and her ""house tricks"" to treat more common/household illnesses.  While she may prescribe a medication, she'll also talk through other alternatives and recommendations."
-1	I always feel so rushed during consultations that I feel distrustful of his advice.  Can he really be that careful with my care in fifteen minutes?
1	My doctor takes the time to actively listen to me and to address my concerns. I don't feel like a number or like I'm being rushed. He takes the time to explain things to me in a way I understand and is empathetic to what I say.
-1	I utilize different professional medical settings (i.e. urgent care, hospital, offices) and have had multiple bad experiences, both personal and of my friends. It seems as though many doctors rush through without properly analyzing the situation, or push for the more costly of treatments. Medicine has taken quite a plunge in recent years, and the Hippocratic Oath does not mean what it once meant. 
1	My primary care physician has been efficient but thorough the last two years that I've been seeing her. She listens to my concerns, offers treatment options, and describes pros/cons of available options. Her manner is very pleasant and she balances speaking in vernacular terms and medical terms so as to neither come across as confusing or patronizing. 
-1	I don't always trust everything the doctor says and seem to spend more time talking to the nurse asking questions. The doctors seem to think they know everything and don't ask many questions. I't understandable they seem pressed for time as I can understand why that would be true. I do think that is the main reson for a lack of trust though it may not always be true.
1	I trust her because she has been my doctor for Two years and even delivered my son. She has always made sure I was in good hands and made me feel comfortable to talk about my health to
1	It took me a while to get to a point where I felt okay with this doctor; my previous doctor died and I switched to the current doctor, who was in the same practice, and we clashed at first. But now we understand each other better. Also, I got treated for my trypanophobia (fear of medical needles) and since then I am better able to trust doctors in general.
1	She has always listened to what problems I am having.  She runs the tests necessary to diagnose my medical conditions and my general health.  She changes medications when needed to better treat my issues.  She seems to genuinely care about my health and well being.
-1	My current physician is relatively new to me, so these questions are a bit difficult to answer. Overall, I feel my doctor has been very sympathetic and has taken my concerns seriously. She has ordered appropriate diagnostics and I feel that she has spent an appropriate amount of time asking follow-up questions. In my experience over the past decade, I have noticed many doctors spending less time with patients. I think the doctor/patient relationship, in general, suffers due to insurance regulations and company policies.
-1	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. she is very attentive, always listens. So far all of her recommendations were spot on.
-1	I'm very frank and open with her and she is with me, which is what I would expect and this makes me feel safe.  She asks tough questions and doesn't beat around the bush, gets to the point, and is very directive in what she believes is best for me.  I like this about her and am totally open with her.
-1	I have had a lot of bad experiences with doctors. I currently have a nurse practitioner that I like and trust. My experience began young when I had a doctor tell me on several occasions that I couldn't have whatever disorder I came to see him for. Such as telling me a thirteen year old can't have ulcers (I did). Once I had a doctor put me out of work for seven days for whooping cough as an adult, and when j explained to her I needed one more day to not get in trouble at work so I'd be on sick leave she denied it. There are other instances where I felt my voice wasn't heard. 
-1	I trust my Physician's because he's the one that take care of me health-wise, and make sure that I am on the right path and and in good health.
1	He's been a osteopathic physician for many years and takes the time to listen to my concerns and suggest options for treatment.  He's open-minded and not the least bit dismissive.  His judgment is sound and his demeanor is caring. 
1	I think that my doctor takes the time to listen to me . She does a good job going over each problem and giving me options . She will explain each one and recommend what she thinks I should do . She is good with following up . If I feel like there is a problem she doesn't just write me off . She takes the time to explore it and make me feel like it has been addressed . She always gives me as much information as possible . If I am not comfortable with something  she is willing to try another avenue . I feel like all in all she puts me first in my health care . 
1	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a long time and he has always looked out for my well being. I never had any issues with him and I trust his medical advice based on prior experience.
1	I do trust doctors in general but it's hard to find a doctor who truly cares. For example, I used to go to the doctor and I always felt rushed because he had million patients waiting in the waiting area. He is a good doctor but I like when I have enough time to tell about my problems or what I feel or my concerns and he just didn't really have time to listen. I found another doctor who is amazing. He has a small office and not a lot of patience because he really takes his time and really cares. You can call him on his personal phone number and he will answer and will try to help
1	I believe my doctor is qualified to make decisions about my medical care. They are more informed and knowledgable about healthcare than I am.
-1	I have a lack of trust with physicians when they seem to be completely distant from me when I am giving them information or explaining my situation. It boils down to them having a lack of social skills - I often feel like when I am being shooed out of an office to get me out as soon as possible, it feels as though I am not worth their time. Again, this often happens when I am at an urgent care clinic or with doctors that I am seeing for the very first time. Also, a lack of professionalism shows me that they could potentially be wrong about a prescription. 
-1	I trust her because she is a licensed doctor and looking out for what is best for me. If my physician wasn't trustworthy, i'm sure they would've stripped her of license to practice medicine.
-1	I lived next to my primary physician for a few years and we always got along very well, having that personal relationship was one of the reasons we chose him, and him being a younger person knowing he would be around for awhile also helped.
1	I have always had a good experience with her and she seems willing to answer questions and explain things. For the most part I trust her. She seems very intelligent and like she thinks before she speaks.
-1	I have been going to him for years. He has always given me good advice. I trust him completely to make good recommendations.
1	He seems to know what he is doing and knows the technical terminology when we discuss my problems. He seems to have empathy as well.
1	My Dr. has always though about my good health, sometimes more than me. He declined to do a procedure because I just had it done lass the a month before and he was afraid it might cause me more discomfort.
-1	Like i previously stated i feel that physicians dont listen or care about me but only the masses and fixing a large number of people and not specifically me. So personally i feel alone and afraid because i am the only one interested in my health and well being.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, but I've seen several doctors during the last year.  Two of them prescribed treatment which I agreed to.  One doctor did not tell until after the treatment that I would need to have surgery to have the problem corrected completely.  I would say most doctors can be trusted, but some cannot.
-1	I trust my doctor because she takes time with me. She spends more than one minute in the room with me when I go. She takes the time to not only see to my health but to ask about my personal life. She remembers me and asks me always about different things I have shared with her such as work or my personal life. 
-1	I don't trust my primary care physician because she is barely available and doesn't spend much time with me. She doesn't fully listen to what I have to say. Her assistants do most of the intake, if not all of it. She often seems stressed, and she probably is. Even so, I need someone to sit down and listen to me for more than three minutes. Every meeting and exam seems to only cover the bare minimum of a patient's needs.
1	I trust her because she genuinely seems likes she wants to help and she has the knowledge to do so.  She is very kind but stern, and does talk about a lot of options I may have.  She also is quick to refer me if she knows I would be better suited with a specialist.  My only distrust would be that she is fairly young, so she does not have the experience of the more established physicians.
1	I trust my doctor because he takes a lot time with every patient to figure out how you are and what is going on.  Willing to give all the tests needed to figure out any issues.
-1	There have been times when my Dr. has overlooked things, but there have also been times when my Dr. has been very thorough. 
1	I do have complete trust in my primary care physician, because I have been a patient of his for a long time. He is a fairly young doctor and is intelligent and knows about new technology and medications. I have always been able to get same day appointments, if needed. He has never steered me wrong on the topic of health or taking care of myself.
-1	They get in to mush of a hurry, it feels rushed. They will come in and start discussing what needs to be done and while I'm there I feel like I don't even talk the same language sometimes. I almost always look everything I can remember on line. It helps me figure out what is really going on. 
-1	I feel like my doctor listens to me and will do everything they can to find out what is going on with my health when I need them to. They have always listened to me. 
-1	For the most part I trust my doctor to monitor my health and if a problem presents help me find a reasonable solution. But I also people in human mistake and that sometimes you have to be your own health advocate.  Doctors don't always have the right answers and sometimes you have to be persistent if you feel something is not right. 
-1	I have had bad experiences with doctors and have been misdiagnosed. I have unfortunately had doctors with God complexes who believed they were right and would not listen to me as their patient and it turned out I was right all along.
1	 I trust my primary care physician for several reasons. I know he has a strong educational background and has been in practice for many years. I have researched online and read reviews on my physician and they are very good reviews. My physician has always listened to me, given me good advice and treatment and I have never not benefited from his care.He has certainly earned my trust.
-1	I feel like no matter what Dr. I go to, no matter what the reviews are lie they are always just about the money. it really sucks and I feel really awkward. I always feel like the doctors dont care about there patients. I have yet to find one that actually cares.
-1	Overall, I may put trust into doctors generally since they are professionals within the field, but I suppose I have a bit of skepticism toward some doctors and their thoroughness. Also, it seems that some treatments in the past haven't been the most adequate in treating various concerns, which influences my perception.
-1	I will go to the doctor if something is wrong and so far have never been sent wrong or given wrong advice or information
1	My primary care physician is a young man who takes his time talking with me and actually listens to what I have to say. He then asks relevant questions and discusses which course of action would be best for me and which he feels would best address my concerns. He is always available through his patient portal and responds in a timely manner. His staff is also very kind and caring and I get a sense that they actually quite enjoy working for him, which to me is very telling.
1	I do not trust all doctors completely. They are human and can make mistakes, and may not always have all of the answers, and may not know the entire situation. 
-1	I feel Doctor's no longer spend time engaging with their patients. It's in and out. I feel most of what's said is ignored and simply one problem is quickly looked at and guessed with what the popular treatment is at the moment.
-1	Well I dont feel like he uses enough wholistic techniques only knows medication. He isnt thorough enough. I feel like he looks at physical appearance and then does basic tests.
1	I have been with my same doctor for years. During this time, from my impression, my doctor has always been honest and forthright with me. My doctor's actions and behavior has never given me any reason to distrust him. Therefore, until I am given a reason, I have no reason not to trust my doctor.
-1	I have never had any experience to make me not trust my doctor. Most of the time I think he is trying to do what is best to treat whatever is the wrong in the most effective way.
-1	I dont completely trust my medical physician because often I feel like instead of doing what's the right thing for me they are likely doing what can get them paid the most. 
-1	I trust my physician because I did a lot of research and got some recommendations from people I trust. I made the best choice for my needs and situation. My physicians has my best interest at heart. 
-1	all doctors care about one thing, money. they don't care about you. to them, you are a bank and they want to drain you, even if you die.
-1	I have known my doctor for ten years. He has always been honest and patient with me. He was my doctor through my pregnancies also.
-1	Sometimes I feel like the doctor does not listen and treats every case or condition the same. If they have seen something like it before, or have experienced something similar before, they tend to forget that every person is an individual and may react differently to the same condition as someone else
1	My primary care physician is thoughtful and absolutely does his best to give good advice.  At the end of the day, though, medical decisions are my decision, and  I need to do my own thinking and research about serious conditions.
-1	I find most doctors I have dealt with to be very rushed. If I explain something poorly, they get the wrong idea and prescribe the wrong treatment. They don't have enough time to do good diagnosis. So I think the doctors are good people. I also think they don't have enough time to do their jobs well. Likely, they may not be as up-to-date as they need to be with medical science.
-1	I have some trust in my primary care physician but would hesitate to have full trust unless I have gone through many more health issues to see her response/care to them. I do tend to do independent research on the health issues so that i have some comparison to her response & care of the problem. So, mostly, i feel like she has been truthful and has provided adequate care. 
-1	I trust my doctor to am extent. I know he has my best interests at heart. But no doctor can keep up on all the newest medical research. So I try to supplement with my own research
1	My PCP takes time with me and asks me lots of questions.  She looks me in the eye and treats me as a person who is intelligent and capable of understanding health information and decisions.  
1	I do not go to my PCP often because they are far away but when I do go I do trust their option because they have not seared me wrong yet. It is important to be able to trust your doctor. 
-1	Doctors in my life have shown an air of superiority when I have been discussing issues. To the point that I have to argue why I don't want a certain treatment or medication. They can act with blinders and not even recognize it.  
-1	The physicians ive had generally rush through the procedures, and care little for my thoughts. I have never had a severe condition but it would worry me if i ever did
-1	i don't see my primary care physician too often. he's a decent guy, but i think he's more interested in sending me off for tests than anything else. he doesn't seem to know that much himself, it's always more tests.
-1	Since it's the doctor's job, and they are more knowledgeable in the field of health, I have to trust them, even if I think if their decision is a little questionable. I can ask them questions on why they recommend something, but they have more expertise in the field than me.
-1	Sometimes I feel the doctors are only going to do as much as they need to cover the basics. For instance, if a patient only have medicaid or medicare the doctors will not suggest better treatment options that are available because the health care doesn't cover it. This practice is done without regard to the patient being able to fund the treatment in another capacity. This same treatment is the opposite for those with private healthcare. 
-1	I do get the impression that the doctor is trying to get through his visit with me as fast as possible. I understand that they need to do this to make a living, and I know the realities of insurance reimbursement and the way they are paid. Still, it means that I am suspicious of my doctor's motives and I don't really fully trust them. I know they are looking out for their interests before they are necessarily looking out for mine.
-1	I trust my doctor because I feel he has no reason to deceive me. I give them good money to be told the truth and guided in the right direction regarding my health.
1	My doctor is very trustable because he takes his time with me and cares about me getting better when im ill. I have no reason to distrust him with all he does for me. Hes the best at what he does.
1	"I trust my primary physician because to say the least he is a realist. He keeps things honest and it's not just about saying what he feel's is required to be said, he gives me relatable examples and tells me personally things about his life and hose around him as well and it gives me a much more relaxing feeling and the ability to trust his word. He doesn't always come with the ""Dr. Talk"" that people whom are not in that field doesn't understand. he gives me advice medically and personally."
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is extremely careful and honest telling me about all the different treatment options all the time.
1	My Primary care physician works with a team. I feel confident that he can handle any medical situation I might have, he also consults with the team if necessary.
-1	I think that the amount of patients doctors are forced to see to be paid reasonably means they spend small periods of time with large numbers of patients. I am sure that given more time with each patient, along with adequate time to review medical tests and records, more nuances of medical conditions may be noticeable and it would be easier for doctors to prep for each appt with adequate resource material to provide the patient.
-1	I guess it is I trust my doctor to make decisions and help find answers. It is the unexplained sickness or pain that seems like all doctors avoid. You always have to see several doctors instead of just a few and that's when it seems like your being pushed through the system. If someone finds something, or another test is run.. I want to know why.. and what the findings are. Some don't let you know anything after tests are done.
1	It is a rare quality these days since I have seen at least 15 different family doctors throughout my life, and the family doctor I have now actually listens, he hugs me when I walk in, he looks for any side effects for my current medications if he has to put me on something temporarily, e.g. antibiotic, and he spends quality time with me. Even after months of telling him something, he remembers it like we just chatted about it moments ago. His memory, attention to detail, and time with the patient is extraordinary!
1	Usually my primary care physician had more experience and knowledge than me, and they know better what they give to everyone
1	My family has been going to the same physician for over 50 years, starting with my grandfather. Our doctor has been reliable and up front for all that time. I have no reason not to trust his judgement.
-1	At the end of the day it is their job and duty to ensure that i get the help i pay for so i am generally rather trusting of them and their judgement
-1	I feel doctors do not generally look at all options and want to do what is best for their schedule, not what is best for the patients needs
1	He has been in the healthcare profession for quite some time and is very knowledgeable. He is well respected in the community
-1	My insurance isn't great and I have to go to a very low cost doctor whom I don't have a lot of trust in, to be frank. She has often told me things that I outright knew were wrong (e.g.: continuing to tell me to take St. John's Wort after being prescribed Prozac, rinsing out a dog bite with hydrogen peroxide). It makes me wonder if the things she tells me that I DON'T know are wrong are correct.
1	Good references from other people concerning his technical ability, thoroughness, genuine interest in patients.  He's also embedded in a system with lots of other support services, and uses them thoughtfully.
1	Physicians have generally given me plenty of information and different options for care. They explain things when asked. I have rarely encountered physicians that are not attentive to my needs as a patient.
-1	Most of the time, doctors do what is easy, or less expensive. Not caring about how miserable I may be. I have met very few doctors that understand that I have lived in my body my whole life, not them.
1	I've been to doctors in the past that I've questioned some of their decisions, but I'm very happy with the current doctor I see.  She is knowledgeable, well-educated and respects me as a patient.  She listens to my concerns and responds in an appropriate way.
1	I guess I could say that I trust my primary doctor because he hasn't given me a reason not to trust him.  He is upfront, tells me about options, explains procedures, and is good natured.  I believe he is looking out for my best interests and until he does otherwise, I will have trust in him.
-1	I do not believe that doctors know much about a lot of problems that have not been discovered and wrongly diagnose people very often with something based on very little research or facts. I also believe they are sales men for pharma company more then they are doctors who want to help people.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, but in general, doctors are open about a patient's health. Even when they are stern, it is because they want the patient to have the best outcome. There are few doctors who would deliberately mislead a patient. 
-1	One of the main reasons I trust my doctor is that he actually listens to me unlike some doctors.  He takes what I say in to consideration and knows that I am familiar with my body and that I usually am on par with what he is thinking.
-1	I trust my doctor. He has never done anything to make me think he should not be trusted or that he is not honest. He has always been candid about my health concerns, and explains everything. He happily answers questions I might have and has even given me his email to contact him if I have any further questions.
-1	I don't feel that my doctor actually takes the time to always understand what I am experiencing.  I feel that he thinks that since I meet the general criteria then I am in a category that I am not necessarily in.  My first experience with him I was a little overweight and had high blood pressure.  He said that if I don't loose weight by my next visit we need to discuss weight loss surgery.  Crazy.
-1	I feel like my doctor seems me as a number and not as a patient. He never allows me to fully discuss all of my issues and just rushes me out. He comes off cold and i do not have trust in him but will be looking for a new doctor.
-1	I don't feel like they take the time to get to know me. And what I would want or offer me all options or ask questions. 
-1	It is not so much that I distrust doctors. I just do not blindly trust them. I take what they have to say and go from there. I may have a differing opinion on what the best option is going forward. I also may agree with what they have to say and we are both on the same page. I think I ere on the side of caution. 
-1	I don't trust my doctor completely because she sort of rushes the appointment.  She doesn't really do whats best for me because she should be testing my thyroid on a regular basis.
-1	I think all in all doctors are worthy to put your trust in their care. I just think there aren't enough doctors to go around. They are so frazzled and tired trying to keep up.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is always willing to take the time to answer questions I have about medications and treatment plans and he works with me to make sure I get the medications that my insurance will cover and he checks to see if there is one that they cover more of the cost. He also explains why he makes medical decisions, like prescribing medications or doing certain tests for me before he does it to make sure I understand completely what the reasons for doing it are and the benefits and risks of it.
-1	I trust my doctor because I do not really have a better option. If I am sick I have to go and visit him hoping that he can figure it out how to get better. But on the other hand health care system is lead by money so it all comes to the end where it is about our pocket. If everyone would be healthy then hospitals, health care providers, doctors etc. would be in a big trouble. No customer means no paycheck. So till a certain extent they must have patients. Health care system does not create cure. It creates consumers.
-1	I think it all comes down to certain situations on how much you get out of your doctor, if it's right before they're leaving they're going to rush and just say what's convenient even if it's not 100% accurate. If they've had a good weekend and i'm the first person than there's a good chance i'm going to receive everything I should get on any time.
1	I usually trust my primary care physician as I am taking treatment with her for a long time and she is a good friend of me and she used to give a good treatment and guide me in good manner.
1	Well my doctor has been seeing me for a while now so he has understanding where i am health wise. I trust his judgement due to his experience and so far its been good.
-1	I don't think my doctor takes enough time with me, or patients in general, to really know what is best. I think that my doctor relies on drugs too quickly and too often as the solution to the problem.
1	"I trust my physician because she is always very personable with me. She always gives me both the ups and downs to new medications and doesn't push me to take anything that ""she wouldn't take"". "
-1	I don't think she is that great of a doctor. I wouldn't mind changing to another one if I could find one that's better.
-1	Most doctors care about their patients. Unfortunately, the system is set up so they probably cannot spend as much time with each patient as they would like. I think they do the best they can given the circumstances but I also believe in taking responsibility for my own health. I take everything with a grain of salt and often wonder if health professionals are not telling me everything for their own financial gain (i.e. pharma companies supplying incentives for pushing certain medications/treatments).
-1	"i have a difficult time in general trusting only one person with something serious, so i don't have ""complete"" trust in the doctors i see. i value their opinions and typically do what they think is best unless there's a good reason not to, but i wouldn't call it complete trust"
-1	I have migraines. My former pain management doctor gave me botox injections. I also got occipital nerve blocks for a different headache. My new doctor (moved to a new state) told me nobody is trained to do that. He didn't offer any type of option. He doesn't care. I don't trust him with my care for that reason.
-1	I generally trust doctors in general. However, they get caught in a huge bureaucracy and regulations and fear of law suits when it comes to healthcare in general, it limits their options.
1	He will actually open up studies and show me where the information is coming from. He does not beat around the bushes. He gives me pros and cons for everything when it comes to symptoms or medications
1	I trust my doctor because he is a professional. He always treats me with care and respect. I never feel like I'm getting bogus or insufficient information. He's also pretty good at remembering things I've told him in the past--personally, I mean. 
1	I don't go to doctors a lot but I'm surrounded by them,  I don't trust just any doctor in general but the few doctors I do go to, are very trusted by me.  I have seen by the times I went there that they are very intelligent and reliable.
-1	My PCP does his best, I think. But he is often rushed and is getting older. I trust him less than I used to. That said, I have absolute trust in the NP in his office.
-1	I trust my doctors in general, however sometimes it seems like it would be easy for them to just prescribe medications to treat ailments rather than getting down to the root cause of the problem.
1	I trust my PCP because he always explains in depth why he prescribes a drug or treatment. He takes the time to listen to my symptoms and does a thorough exam.
-1	Generally, I tend to trust my doctors' treat and their recommendations.  Since I have not been in severe health condition in the past, I didn't think seriously about doctors' advice because I mostly respect their treatment and recommendation.  I think most doctors should be reliable and trustworthy in giving best treatment and recommendation for their patients.
-1	"I believe that many doctors rush through exams in order to get to their next patient and end their day and go home. this is not true of ALL doctors of course, but a great many I am sure it's true. I trust my doctor to see the glaring issues that are wrong and to suggest treatment for those, however, I would greatly push for more testing or ask more questions if I feel they don't ""get"" what I'm there for or if they seem to brush it off. Bottom line is that you need to be an advocate for yourself because these doctors see so many patients, they do not care on a personal level. You have to force them to see you as human and not a number in an office."
-1	I generally trust my doctor, but I feel like I see them only occasionally and not for that long, so although I trust their diagnoses and treatment recommendations, I also think I would seek out further information about it so that I could consider how much I think it is good.
-1	I believe that my primary care doctor is mostly interested in the money and as such is not completely honest when prescribing medications or diagnosing problems. sometimes I feel as though he is too busyt to explain in detail and gets frustrated if I ask questions. I pretty much think this is true of the medical profession as a whole and as such I am reluctant to trust any doctor. 
1	I guess I have only had one issue that involved a pap smear test going to the wrong lab and me being charged way too much (like $10 vs $500). Considering that was just human error, I have no real reason to distrust my doctor. But mistakes can happen, so I don't fully trust anything. 
1	I trust my primary care doctor because I've had many doctors before him that I did not trust, so it's easy to see that my doctor is trustworthy in comparison. I can tell that my primary care doctor is caring and kind, and that he explains all my options. I trust him because he goes over everything in detail and will go over lab results with me line by line and ask if I have any questions. Before I leave for my visit he asks if I have any other questions or concerns I wanted to address, this shows me that he cares and is trustworthy. 
-1	I've only seen this doctor twice in the past couple of years.  Once for my general physical and he was very careful and checked out when I needed my next tests, etc. I have now not had any blood test for over 2 years, and he just keeps refilling my Rx.  I went in for a skin problem and saw him for 1 minute after waiting 2 hours - I was upset of course.
-1	I believe my doctor is fallible, just like any other humans. All doctors have difficult and stressful jobs, and will sometimes take the easy route of simply prescribing unnecessary medications with both short-term and long-term side effects instead of providing other options.
-1	The reason I trust or distrust doctors is because I believe they have a protocol to follow. They might order an xray when it could of been more beneficial to order an MRI. I understand they also have to perform what is approved if the patient has limited insurance.  
-1	He doesn't even remember my name or say hello to me if I walk by in the halls.  Like he's emotionally detached from everything and is just there to do his job, nothing more.  I can't trust someone who share little care for their patients.
-1	as a person that knows a fair amount about medicine and practices i know that at times there are doctors that look out for themselves or the drug companies over your well being
-1	I generally try to trust doctors, unless I feel like I am being rushed through or not listened to.  I feel most doctors have keeping me healthy as their top priority.
1	I have been going to my PCP for over 20 years now exactly for the reasons above. He takes his time with me, asks questions, and is honest about how he feels. That's why I still go to him.
1	I have always had no issues or concerns with my doctor and believe that they have my best interest in mind and are honest with me.
-1	Doctors have received the proper training and certification to perform their job to the best of their abilities. I trust these qualifications enough to trust doctors, but just like every other professions there will be problems. I do not expect everything at a hospital to go right for doctors, but I expect them to treat patients with care.
1	I don't believe a poor doctor would remain in business for very long.  I regularly check reviews on doctors before I use them.
-1	"In my most recent visit, he dressed me down for not having had a mammogram or Pap smear in a few years...he was right. Time just slipped away from me. I was irritated that he wanted a blood test for my estrogen levels, but he gave me a good reason: he wanted to know whether I was getting the right dosage in my estradiol pills (prescribed by a different doctor). All in all, he seemed pretty straight forward and not into ""woo""."
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I've known him since I was a child. He's been my doctor for my whole life and I trust him. He's made great decisions for me and has almost always been right in regard to my medical issues. We are very close and he is very intelligent and has a wonderful bed side manner.
1	Initially I have complete trust in my doctors.  Some have lost trust.  Some have gained a lot.  I tend to trust the doctors with the most education.  Trust is very important to accurately give all the personal information required.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for serveral years and he explains any problems I have to me in detail.  He describes and goes over every decision made and we decide on treatment option together.  
-1	I don't have any reason not to trust my doctor. I will continue to trust her until she does something to earn my distrust. I would apply the same standard to any doctor.
-1	A couple of times she had misdiagnose my illness. I went to a specialist after talking to my Primary care practician
-1	I trust my primary care doctor to an extent; he is fallible just like anyone else. I will do my own research after visiting with him, and if I don't agree with something, e.g., a medicine he recommends or a treatment protocol, I will tell him what I have found, why I don't want to take it, and let's try something else. Ultimately, I know my body best and I do my utmost to take care of myself.
1	our doctor is well known in my community and he is our family doctor. my mom trust him, so i trust him too. but talking to other doctors, i test them first by asking a lot of questions before i can trust them
-1	I have pcos and I feel like the doctor is always trying to give me false hope with something new that I haven't tried that will help me have another baby. Sometimes I feel like they look at me as a money person who will pay. 
-1	I do not have a PCP but I do see a dermatologist. I also used to work with this person so I have seen him give numerous patients medical advice including myself. I feel that after years of practice he is very knowledgeable about what he is doing and I trust the way he treats myself and others. I feel that the longer you are in practice the more knowledgeable you become. 
-1	I trust doctors mainly because I don't really have a reason not to. I have never been mislead by a doctor or have received any bad medical advice in the past. 
1	My doctor is open and willing to have conversation about my concerns. She listens and then refers me for further study or specialist if she is not certain of the status or route to take.
-1	He is the new young doctor at the clinic I go to. Straight out of residency. A few times he has had to consult with the other doctor there. I take this as a good sign. I know he will never give a bad diagnosis or advice
1	I trust my doctor because he's been with me for quite a while and he's never brushed off any of my concerns.  While he talks to me like I'm a friend, when he needs to be, he's serious and blunt and makes sure that I understand what's going to happen.  The one time I needed surgery, his recommendation was wonderful.  He regularly checked up on me and made sure I was recovering nicely which definitely made me feel more like a friend rather than just a patient.  Considering that and the way he thoroughly explains things to me, I have complete trust in him.
1	Because i have been going to him for over 5 years and he has always been good to me he listen to me and he would never put me on anything that he wouldn't put his family on
1	He is trained to do his job and to do it well. He took an oath and doctors are supposed to keep up with the latest research and developments in health care. If he makes a mistake he risks his job and reputation not to mention his ability to practice medicine. I have no reason to doubt he would do everything he can to help me as my doctor.
-1	My doctor wants what is best for me and will prescribe the best course of action. He has a lot of experience doing what he does, so I trust his decision and authority over anything that I might think.
1	Because if they lie to me they would be in big trouble. Doctors should always be truthful to their patients at all times no matter what.
1	I have no reason not to trust my primary care physician.  She has always been straight forward with me.  She listens, investigates the problems, provides a solution, and if the solution is not working, then we work together to find another solution.  I wouldn't say i have complete faith in her, but i trust her and her ability very much.
1	I trust him because I never feel rushed or pressured when I go in for a visit. The nurses seem to also care a lot and help where and when they can. My doctor also tries to make himself available outside of the office, which is really nice.
-1	"I think that doctors do care about their patients, but I think that the degree of sympathy strongly correlates to what time you show up in their day. I have found that many doctors don't like to seem wrong, so they will always go to the quickest solution first, and don't tend to really even consider other conditions unless you pry them with questions about relevant symptoms. My problem is mostly with treatment options. Doctors offices are often sponsored by various name brand drugs and that often sways the decision on which drugs to give as treatment. I also don't agree with the trend to do different screening procedures for different insurance plans. It seems that the better your insurance is, the more expensive and more prevalent the testing that is ""required"" becomes. "
-1	I think my doctor has my best interests at heart, even if she is very busy.  She always has a lot of patients but she has shown genuine care for me.  She takes the time to give me all the options for treatment and explains them.
1	She is always helpful and straightforward with me. She seeks to empathize with issues I've been having and understand better what's going on with me. For example, she asked me about my vegetarianism when I told her that was something I was doing.
-1	I think it is probably inefficient for a doctor to be thorough, especially if the best course of action for me might be unconventional. 
1	My doctor is an excellent communicator, a good listener and expresses his opinions with confidence.  He is well-trained, experienced and view him as a trusted friend. I trust him and confide in him.
-1	I think that overall I trust my doctor, but will verify for myself if there is anything that she says that I am suspicious of.
1	Had my doc for ten years now.  In a small town with limited healthcare I was nervous, but first time I met the guy, I knew he was ok. Has all the latest do dads to measure the blood pressure and all.  Always knows whats best.
-1	I trust that most doctors have the patient's best interest in mind. I don't have a general distrust for doctors, but I also don't blindly accept their opinion. I always research.
-1	I never completely trust anyone.  I think that all doctors are purely in it for the money first and patient well being a distant second.  
1	My doctor is very open and honest. She just not speak down to me or just give me orders. She communicates with me in a dialogue, listening to my concerns and opinions. She shows real interest, offers advice, and listens. She does not lecture but works with me as a teammate to take care of my health.
-1	"I know that my doctor is at the mercy of insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. He doesn't have time to invest in talking to me, he has to electronically chart my case in detail to kickstart the billing process, and he often does that in front of me. His waiting room has pens, clocks, and other knickknacks branded to pharmaceuticals, and his exam room has branded ""informational"" posters, all of which are badges of bias. "
1	Though I think my doctor may make some choices that are easier for him, I know he is a well respected and good doctor. He is published many times so I generally trust what he has to say and am confident in his choices and actions.
1	My primary care physician really listens to what I say. She remembers things about me from appointment to appointment. I really feel she wants me to be healthy and happy. 
1	My primary physician has always taken good care of me. There has never been a moment where I even questioned him because he does his job diligently. I always leave his presence feeling better whether its because I've got medicine or a greater state of mind about my current situation. He has never given me a chance to doubt his capabilities. 
-1	Many doctors seem to rush through appointments and take the easy solutions when a more thorough visit might be appropriate along with discussion of all treatment options.
-1	The reasons why I do not trust my primary care physician is that I have the impression that they mostly care about safeguarding their liability instead of being concerned about the patient's medical needs
1	We have a family doctor that I started going to at an early age and now this doctor sees my daughter. Myself and my family members have been seeing this doctor for many of years. There has been a lot of trust built between us We do believe he has our best interests in mind..
1	I trust my primary care because he hasn't ever done anything wrong. He gives me the utmost care and isn't ever in a rush. But to say I completely trust him would say I don't trust my own hunches. I know when something is wrong with my body so I can't put all trust in him. He's great at what he does but he can only do so much.
-1	My primary care doctor is a psychiatrist, and she does a good job of talking about both medical and non-medical treatments. She's good about explaining side effects and talking about realistic outcomes of treatment, and she knows it's important for me to feel like I'm not being pushed into making decisions.
-1	I suffered from migraines for years, my doctors always said to just stay away from my triggers. They never worked with me to reduce or relieve them. 
1	As I mentioned earlier, my father was admitted a week ago to my hometown hospital with kidney failure and pneumonia so I'm drawing on my past week. I haven't been to a doctor in a long time or had any medical issues. My interactions with his primary care physician, cardiologist, renal specialist and all his supporting staff have been professional, transparent, caring and seem to be of the highest quality. He's in rehab today after flat-lining and a close brush with death and I have nothing but respect for every medical professional  I've dealt with.
-1	My PCP is open and I believe honest. She also takes time to listen carefully to me, and I believe she respects my input. I feel we work together as a team, and her words and actions reinforce my belief.
1	When I go see my primary physician it seem that he is always looking out for me . When I ask question he effectively answers them and provides many solutions to the problem I go in for.  
1	She addresses all my questions in a thoughtful and caring manor. She never seems like she's trying to rush me out of the exam room. Also, I've been seeing her for a few years and have never had a bad interaction or diagnosis that was wrong.
-1	Anymore, I think time is a limiting factor in how effective a provider is. If given more time to spend with patients, I would be much more willing to have total trust. 
-1	I trust my doctor and his decisions about what is right for me, but overall I am know what is best for me and I do not trust many medications.
-1	In general, I trust my doctor. Sometimes I get disappointed. That happens when I cannot get an appointment when I need it, I do not get phone calls from doctor's office informing me about a problem when I have to wait for a refill of medications.
-1	I generally think that doctors are good people who go into medicine to try to help people. I also believe that like any profession, there are nuances that average people do not understand or care to, and I can not completely trust an individual who has personal incentive to provide you care that is not necessarily ideal for you. As long as pharmaceuticals are as big of an industry as they are I cannot completely trust doctors. 
1	I have a really good relationship with my primary care physician.  I've been seeing the same primary care physician for over 7 years now.  He's helped me through issues that I knew I had (anxiety/depression) and also issues I didn't know I had (possible melanoma).  I have gotten to know some about his background as well, and given what I know, I trust him implicitly. 
1	I just had my doctor leave the practice I go to and I've started seeing a new PA.  She is very nice, but we are still getting to know each other and figure out communication.  My PA was very nice and straight forward the last night I met with her and listens to my questions.
-1	Sometimes I feel like doctors thinks they know more about what I'm feeling than I do. It sometimes makes it difficult for them to take me seriously and leads to them downplaying my symptoms or ignoring some of them and telling me it's nothing or I'm worrying too much.
1	I have seen the same doctor for years who I have an extremely close relationship with.  He has been honest with me whether it has been a negative or positive thing that we are speaking about.  After him giving me extra time and going out of his way for me on separate occasions, he has more than proved himself as genuine.
-1	For the most part I can trust my primary care physician, but I also like to do my own research just to be on the safe side. I trust him because he has helped me when I was sick in the past. 
1	I trust  my primary care physician because I have seen her for years and she is actively involved while I'm at my appointments. If I have a question she takes her time to find out the answer if its not something she can immediately answer and gets back to me about it. She also spent more time training for her profession than me. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician sometimes. This is because I have been seeing him for awhile and he has prescribed me my birth control, iron pills for having low white blood cell counts, and has given me different types of medicine for my anxienty. The only thing is that I have complained about both axienty medicine pills making me extremely sleepy and my doctor has not done anything about it. I took it upon myself to stop taking the pills because I hated being sleepy all day long. Doctors should also not be giving patients all of these opioids and other pills like xanax where people can get extremely addicted. That is why I do not trust doctors.
1	I trust my primary care physician. I believe that he cares about his patients and gets them the help they need. He is competent and if he can't help with a specific problem he can recommend a doctor that can.
-1	I have trust in doctors because i feel that are trained very well and see things everyday and know about them.  I feel my doctor is paid accordingly and should trust my doctor as she would know best and whats best for me regarding my health. My doctor is usually a no nonsense kind of doctor and is very direct which is what i prefer so i know exactly where i stand.  
1	I trust my primary care doctor because they seem fairly personable.  They care about me as a person, and I have known them for almost 20 years. 
1	I have gone to the same physician for all of my adult life now; my mom is his nurse, so I'm always able to get in and out quickly, and believe that he strives to offer me the best care possible.
1	I trust my doctor because she takes her time in explaining things to me and giving me advice. She is NEVER in a rush, even though there are probably other patients waiting for her. She never hesitates to tell me to call her or her office -- or through the patient portal -- with any questions or concerns that I might have. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never done anything which has lost my trust. There have been several instances where he knew is capabilities and referred me to a different doctor who have the knowledge and skill necessary to help me in my time of need. When I visit with him his head isn't in a pad or notebook so I do not feel like I am just another checklist in his big book of clients. He is very personal and takes the time to actually talk to me and get to know my family which is nice. I have also been going to him for some time so I have built a good report with him.
-1	once again i know how to trust the doctors because when I was young my mom and dad taught me everything I need to know about how to talk to my doctor and stuff.
1	he always answers all of my questions, explaining things in a way that i as a non-medical person, can comprehend.
-1	I generally feel mistrustful because I don't think doctors really care that much about people, since they see so many patients and have so little time to spend with each of them. I also don't trust that they know what is best for me half the time, since I know my situation and body better than I can communicate with them or they have time to learn about. I also feel suspicious that they are being paid off, for example, by drug companies to push for certain medications , regardless of the patient. 
-1	My primary care physician is not very thorough. He also doesn't take my concerns that serious. It also seems as though he is always rushed when I go in for an appointment. 
-1	I suppose there are numerous reasons why I don't trust doctors, but the biggest reason for me is that I feel most get into the profession because they want to make a lot of money. The concern for them isn't treating sickness out of the good of their heart, they simply desire to make a lot of money, even if they sacrifice their time/well being for it. It's about them being well off, not me. For me, this is an icky feeling and I have trouble getting over it. I have met doctors whom I have come to trust, but that takes time and they have to prove exceptional to get over that greed-hurdle I've imposed on them.
1	For me, the default is to trust doctors, and my PCP has given me no reason to distrust him. In addition, he has always been sympathetic and responsive to any problems I bring up. He also does some community events. I believe he cares about and values all of his patients, including me.
-1	Before my doctor's office was so busy it was hard to get an appointment and it was never the same doctor. I have a new doctor now and he seems more detailed but I felt rushed again. 
1	My doctor has treated me well. My only complaint is that he is sometimes in a rush and I can sense he doesn't have more than a few minutes to speak with me.
1	I have had the same primary doctor for at least a decade. He is a primary care physician, and he has never done me wrong. He is flexible enough to let me try new drugs when they are helpful in being productive in my life.
-1	I just moved to a new city and have only met with one doctor. She doesn't have the personality to work with me. I'm very educated about my disease and she pretty much brushed me off instead of working with me. I wish doctors would listen to their patients instead of putting them on a 5 minute time clock. 
-1	I distrust my because we would rather save money and resources. rather than try and help my illness and or bodily dysfunction.
1	I have an excellent PA who has consistently steered me in the right direction with the treatment of my health and I believe he listens and understands my concerns.
-1	I trust my primary care physician for the most part because he treats my whole family, but I personally don't get along with his personality that much. I feel like he jokes around and doesn't get to the point fast enough. I trust that he knows of A way to treat something, but he feels very confined in his treatments and doesn't feel comfortable exploring other options outside his comfort zone.
-1	I distrust my doctor because of medical advice that he gave me, that turned out to be completely false. This makes me have little trust in doctors in general.
-1	My primary care physician tends to present options to me and suggest one of the options based on what he knows about me, such as waiting to have surgery performed for something that is not life threatening but may cause more issues in the future than what it does now. He also listens to my concerns and addresses them in an understanding way.
1	In my family we have the habit of always seeing the same doctor and socializing with him, because of that, the trust we have for him and, apart from that, he has proven to be a reliable person over the years.
-1	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE I HAVE GONE TO HIM FOR MANY YEARS.  I CAN ASK QUESTIONS AND HE ALWAYS EXPLAINS THING ADN TAKES GOOD CARE OF ME.
-1	I think they have a good knowledge of medical things. Sometimes they might do what is safer than more effective
-1	I usually trust doctors to provide the best care possible for me or my family.  As long as frequent checkups and follow-ups occur, doctors can closely monitor a patient's health and provide the appropriate treatments for any conditions they may have.  As long as a doctor keeps a good relationship with me and makes me feel comfortable I trust in them to have good intentions for my health.
1	I trust my doctor because we have built up a solid report, where she listens to and respects my feelings and does not trivialize them.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician as I rarely need a doctor and if I do, it is for something specialized (kidneys). In general cases, I trust doctors and believe they give me credible, appropriate information but I'm not willing to completely believe everything.
-1	In general, I trust what she tells me.  However, she is a general practitioner and I've learned that when I consult with specialists I often get more options and more information.  Therefore, I don't always think what my GP tells me is all I need to know.
-1	In general, I will trust what my doctor has to say 90% of the time, and may do more research on my own about their suggested treatments. They have the experience to know the different treatments, surely more than I know doing research. If I ever feel like my doctor doesn't really have my best interest in heart, I will get a second opinion.  The more I've seen one doctor in particular, the more likely I am in trusting what they have to say to me. 
-1	I have an equal amount of trust as I do distrust with my doctor, given that I know him and my mother talk, and that I distrust her entirely with my health causes an issue. I believe that what I say to him can impact my home life, because it gets back to my mother. In general, i suppose I trust doctors, as long as they're not corrupt or anything. When I will be tasked with finding my own doctor, I will look long and hard for someone I believe to be trustworthy
-1	Sometimes I feel that my physician has a lot going on and not a lot of attention going toward me. I understand that they are overworked but I do feel that I will need to take charge of my own health if I feel that they do not completely understand me. I will take what they say strongly into consideration but if it does not seem to fit me, I believe that I know myself better than they do.
-1	It's not more of a trust or distrust, it is more of a time thing. I feel like doctors, including my own, need to be able to spend more than 3-5 minutes with a patient. Yes, I know I have a cough and sneezing, so my asthma is acting up. Don't just throw a new inhaler on me. Give me some options and other things I can do at home. I want to know the options I have for medications too. So I feel that adds a little mistrust, but I still feel like he is a good physician. I hope that makes sense. 
1	I think that most doctors try their best to give me the best treatment and offer good advice on what i need to do or what needs to be done.
-1	"I had an experience where I thought all possible testing was done on an annual basis, and that I had requested and approved.  I later found that that was not the case and I was positive for something that they don't test for ""unless you have symptoms"", even though it was consistently marked as something I wanted to be tested for annually.  Since then I have had no issues, but that was a serious misstep in communication."
-1	I trust my doctor because they have never given me a reason not to. I have been seeing the same primary care physician for about six years now and they always address all the questions I have and spend a fair amount of time with me. I have always felt well taken care of.
-1	I feel doctors are trustworthy in the fact that too many people are sue happy. So if the doctor does something that people can sue and get easy money they will. So in my opinion doctors need to be careful and be trusting all at the same time
-1	I trust  my doctor in their opinion Until I donât recently were sent to separate specialist with a special said what are you doing here and they couldnât understand why the doctors on is there because there wasnât a problem and that cost $600 over heâs help me and a lot of other ways but thatâs a lot though
-1	my previous experience with my primary care physician gave me the impression that he was more interested in me as a cash cow than as a patient.
-1	I do have a lot of trust in my physician as he has always been there for me, he tries very hard to get me n to see him in case of an emergency, and he has even called me at home to check on me, after I have seen him.
-1	He would rather talk about himself and laugh at his jokes than pay attention to my needs.  I can get whatever prescription I would like, just by asking. He doesn't remember from one visit to the next anything about me.  When he is not laughing and not paying attention, he has his nose in that stupid computer of it.   
-1	Although I tend to trust my doctor, I am also a little bit skeptical.  Having worked with many different doctors I know there are many that think they know everything or are influenced by pharmaceutical companies and won't listen to the patient's ideas or won't take the patient seriously because they're the doctor and know better.  
-1	"It seems in the last 2 years that my primary doctors practice has quadrupled in the size of patients, what use to be a 20 min wait is now sometimes 1.5HOURS, they seem to put 6 people in 1 time slot - this makes your time with the doctor feel rushed, and then you forget to tell them some of your symptoms which are important. This makes for mistakes in every angle - diagnoses, blood work etc, it is not that I fully dont trust my actual doctor, its the craziness of the practice and the feeling you are on a ""food line"" and they are not really totally focused on 1 patient - so every one loses in the long run - I have had nurses so confused that they were trying to give me a flu shot 2x because of the amount of people in the waiting room and at the nurses lab."
-1	I do not completely trust my doctor because it seems as though he really doesn't care anymore. He is close to retiring and just seems as though he wants to get in and get out of the room as quickly as possible. 
-1	I feel that my primary doctor is very trustworthy but is quick in the amount of time he allots to my visits. I would like a doctor to spend all necessary amount of time with me to explain everything and answer all of my questions.
-1	My physician is very nice and relaxed, he's open to talk and laugh. He is very thorough, even to the point that he wants to schedule so many tests that I'm the one who says no. My only problem is there is only limited time with him, instead there are 4 other assistants or nurses who come before and after him for different purposes and they all come and go quickly
-1	I distrust all the doctors because I do not see that they try to help, they just thinking how to sell expensive medicine or expensive treatment. They offered my son a new medicine for treating his allergy for $100 out of pocket, this medicine is extremely new and doesn't tested enough, knowing that allergy problems start from the gut I can't except the doctor who sell skin creme and doesn't think about the gut. This doctor drives Tesla is that possible, no. That is why I am extremely careful I try not to argue but can't accept to work who are thinking about their profit instead of helping patients
1	I trust my primary care doctor very much. I have only had need to see her twice, but she was a good listener and very thorough both times. I can contrast this with doctors past with whom I had trouble getting my needs addressed. 
1	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been going to her for years. She is a very caring and understanding physician. She listens to your needs and helps you find a solution to your problems that makes you comfortable. She doesnât make you feel pressured nor incompetent when you donât understand the health terminology. She breaks things down so you can understand and she makes sure she available if you have any questions or concerns. My physician takes pride in what she does and itâs transmitted through her having our best interest at heart.
1	I trust my primary care physician, because he is careful with me and medication (I'm very sensitive to medications).  He understands when I do not want to continue on a certain medication (because of the side effects I have read about or have been told about by other medical professionals).  He spends time with me discussing my health issues and immediately responds when I send him a message via my health portal.  He remembers my health record and seems to know my past history even though he has hundreds of patients.
1	I trust my physician because they always ask whether I am doing okay or whether a certain medication is working for me. They want to make sure that I am in good health every time that I go to the doctors office for a visit. 
-1	I distrust doctors. I have vertigo that is bothering me a lot, so I went to my primary care doctor who did not help me much other than giving me pills to see if they were effective. It was not effective at all. Therefore, He referred me to another specialist doctor in ears, throat and nose. That doctor did not do anything to help me other than trying to deceive me into buying one of the non-prescription medicines which I could get at a lower price at a local Walgreen. I feel so hopeless. All I wanted was to heal my vertigo. I still have it now, but I don't trust any doctors anymore.
1	I have complete trust in my doctor because I have been his patient since I was 19 years old.This doctor has delivered all 3 of my kids and I know if I tell him something that conversation stays between him and myself. He's very professional and he cares about his patients.
-1	I trust most doctors because I do not believe they have ulterior motives. I know a lot of people think that the medical field is a sham, and doctors are only interesting in making a buck off sick people, but I genuinely believe that most doctors are good, honest, hard working people. If we did not have trustworthy doctors, there would be a lot more issues in the world than there currently are. There are also a lot of things in place to keep doctors ethical. It is a huge part of the profession. I doubt people who spend years of their life competing to be the best have any desire to be untrustworthy or scam people. 
1	he is very knowledgeable and always provides different options and talks about possible side effects and is a great listener,not in a rush to get to the next patient.
-1	"I do trust medical professional to do the right thing or at least provide the correct treatment to their patients, however, I feel that it is very easy in this day and age for a doctor to overlook things (or not want to look into issues further because they are ""sure"" that's not what it is) I also think that doctors tend to over diagnose and test for things they don't necessarily need to in order to receive more money from the insurance companies."
-1	The short reason why I will not blindly trust a doctor is that they aren't infallible, and I've been on the receiving end of a bad doctors misdiagnoses and paid the price for it. So yah, not gonna trust anything blindly. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because they do give me all the information I need to maintain good health and that all depends on me doing my due diligence and ask all the questions I should be asking about my health.  She's never late when I arrive wait times are no longer than 15 minutes and she does listen. My only blip is when they couldn't tell why I suffered the emergency, but it's not like she doesn't want me to know...right now they just don't have the answer.   
1	I trust them because they are supposed to be the experts.  If i go to a doctor and i feel like their diagnosis isn't right, I will go get another opinion.  I trust them until they give me a reason not to.
-1	The last time I want to my doctor he seemed rushed and had other things to do do. He said he was going to do a tetnas shot that day. He never marked it in his notes so the nurse never gave it. 
1	My Doctor has not given me a reason not to trust them. When I go into the office I feel like I am always well cared for and that my doctor genuinely cares about my health. 
-1	He is more interested in turnover than quality care. He wants to get you in and out. He presumed you're an idiot.
-1	"I feel that they always say ""no, that symptom is not because of _____"" or just send me away with some blow-off treatment for my symptom. I am very aware of changes in my body and sensitive to them. He might know medicine way better than I do, but I know my body way better than he does. "
1	My doctor is a great doctor, but she has so many patients (1800) that it is just hard to trust her 100%. She is a doctor at a VA hospital and they are always so busy that they may sometimes overlook or not notice something. 
1	I have a NP who is under the license of a PCP. I love her! She is more thorough and caring than any other physician I have seen (other than my best friend, who is a nephrologist) in many, many years. The thing I like most about her is she really listens to my, my needs and wants, and I can trust her with anything.
1	They seem very educated and experienced. They have also worked with a variety of patients who have had complications, so they are qualified to make decisions. If I ask them a question regarding something I am hesitant about, they will give an educated response as to why they are doing what they're doing.
-1	It's great to have a personal doctor and it was could be the way u can save your life.An they care about u more
1	I trust doctors to help patients make the decisions. I believe that most doctors care about the well being of their patients. I believe that very few doctors are in the profession for themselves. 
1	My doctor takes her time, appears to listen, and seems compassionate. She provides her advise and encourages me to consider additional options that could help me be healthier. 
1	My doctor is amazing.  When I have had a medical condition, everything was done to get me to the correct specialists to make sure it was taken care of.  My doctor even called me after the appointments to follow up.
-1	She is thorough and informative, and won't give you unnecessary drugs. She actually tries to get to the root cause of ailments instead of treating the symptoms 
-1	I don't see the PCP too often and when I do its for a limited time. I don't think the PCP totally knows whats going on with my case because they have to work and think quickly and each patient in unique and treatment should be individualized. I feel like I'm just another patient. Plus I find it hard to believe the PCP knows everything about every case they see. They could be missing something vital. 
-1	Most of my more recent physicians have told me about treatments that they preferred, and completely neglected to tell me about other types of treatments that would be better, cheaper, and used newer techniques. They were an older doctor, and worked for a free clinic so I suspect they weren't keeping up with newer techniques (in their defense, they do come out at a blistering pace) and instead defaulted to an older, less effective series of treatments. This has happened a fair amount to me, and has led me to doing my own research and getting a second opinion.
1	She has been truthful the whole time I have been seeing her. I don't see her being untruthful now. She is a great person who is concerned about my well being.
-1	I distrust my primary care physician because I have family members who works at hospitals and I can see that the doctor only cares about how many patients they can see and donât care to find out the background of a personâs daily life and see what is affecting the person and trying to solve the problem slowly. They would rather prescribe instant medication to stop the problem from spreading but does nothing to get rid of the problem or be proactive about the problem next time. We basically have to solve our own problems then go to doctors to get the drugs. 
1	I think I could trust my primary care physician to give me the care I need. I don't have one currently but I should probably find one. I would prefer a female doctor so I can talk honestly about my needs and concerns without feeling like I am being treated like it's 'all in my head'.
1	Well they are there to help you, no reason to lie or trick people unless they have a horrible agenda under their belt to hurt some one. but I trust them very much because they have helped me. Now I wont go to a doctor the doesn't seem to care how I feel or treat me with respect.
1	I trust doctors because they have the training and education and I do not. They understand what is happening to body and know what the best treatment will be. 
-1	My doctor has been working for many years. I trust his experience, but sometimes I doubt his knowledge of up to date medical procedures/medications/causes.
1	I have no reason not to trust my doctor.  So far, she has always been thorough and helpful with any problem I am experiencing.
1	I've been to a lot of other Dr's who seem to ignore the issues I'm having and just focus on my weight. My current Dr does not do that, although we are working on getting my weight down it's not her solo focus.
1	Every time I have had a problem and my doctor has given me a solution, the solution has been beneficial to me personally and my health. I have been seeing my doctor for over five years now and have not yet had any experience that would lead me to believe anything different. He will tell me what I can do to improve myself more  such as losing weight or referring me to see a dermatologist if I am having skin problems. He will not tell me something about my health if he is not 100% certain and I appreciate that. 
1	In general, I trust my doctor to take into consideration my wellbeing when and guide me in the right direction but at the same time I have reservations about whether they are giving me ALL the possible options.
-1	I don't trust or not trust my doctor, I just feel like they always point my symptoms at something that it's not. And I also worked in a doctor's office, so it made me not trust doctors as much as I would like to.
1	I trust my primary physician because I take the time to ask them questions and gauge their answer.  If they do not seem to speak as if they have my needs in their consideration, I switch physicians.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because the few times I have been when I had a problem they were able to diagnose me correctly and do the right thing to get me better again.  
-1	In general regards to doctors as a whole, I feel that they are very rushed and dishonest. They do not take the time to answer all my questions and make sure I feel comfortable or am fully informed about any decisions being made.
-1	I don't have one primary care doctor, and the doctors at the Army hospital are more interested in keeping the patient flow moving than they are in effectively treating their patients, whom they will most likely never see again.
1	Same MD I've been seeing for 20 years, I feel she's very open & honest about everything.  She always offers a few different treatment options, and tells me why or why not she would recommend something.
-1	My primary care physician over prescribes, he's given me so many steroidal medications for simple viral infection, just because I have very mild asthma. He also gives antivirals, orders chest xrays even when I have no noise in my chest. It's too much and too often. He also isn't informed about mental health, I tried to ask for counseling and he couldn't find a list, then when he found it half the numbers on it were no longer in service or the providers didn't take my insurance.
-1	I feel like it's a treadmill these days. The doctor listens to you the customer about your problems and try to give you a quick bandaid fix to your problems and most of the time, just tell you to wait a few days for your immune system to take care of it. I trust their authority most of the time, but feel like there's some hidden information not given as well.
-1	As explained before, my doctor doesn't always have the time or the commitment to explain every single little detail. Perhaps they feel it's unnecessary, and that I should trust their judgment. This is somewhat worrisome for me, as I do not know what potential issues might be going on even if the doctor does. This isn't really to degrade the work that they do, and how they treat me, since I don't believe it is done on purpose. Nevertheless, it reduces my confidence in my treatment, or any medication provided. 
-1	I take everything with a grain of salt. In most situations, I will follow the recommendations of my primary care physician as they typically know what is best, however I also do my own research. Occasionally, if I don't feel my questions have been answered satisfactorily then I will seek a second opinion. 
-1	I have a good amount of trust in my doctor- he seems to have my best interests at heart. He doesnât rush when he sees or examines me and takes copious notes that are added to my electronic file. He has his staff do follow- ups if he canât do them himself. 
1	I have been seeing my primary doctor for seven years.  She is through, and takes the time to listen to all of my concerns.  Although I have many health conditions, they are all controlled by twenty prescriptions.  I feel my main concern is RLS, which I research at RLS.ORG.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have family members the use the same one and have had good experiences. He follows up on my health with phone calls and long conversations.
-1	I generally distrust doctors because they seem prone to prescribing drugs to put a Band-Aid on a problem rather than fix the problem itself.  I would be far more trusting if I found a doctor that was willing to help me fix the issue.
1	Because I've been seeing him for years now and he's a very honest doctor who treats you more like a friend he truly cares about rather than just another patient. He sincerely cares about me, my health and my needs and does all he can to help make me feel calm and safe and also optimistic about whatever health issue I'm facing. I've had zero issues with him over the years and despite being terrified of going to the doctor and hopsitals, I still have trust in him because he's never done me wrong. He looks out for my best interests and is one of the best, in my opinion. 
1	I trust my doctor, but I'm also interested in doing my own research, asking questions, and ensuring that I understand the reasoning behind the choices made.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is kind and caring.  He gives me options about my treatment, tells be about research that has been done, and lets me choose what I think is the best option.
1	I trust my doctor because I have no reason not to and she is competent. Again, I have had only routine visits, nothing serious, so I don't have a lot to base it on.
-1	I feel good about my primary care doctor because I've been seeing her for a while and she's helped me several times when sick or feeling depressed, etc. but I don't have the same good feelings about most doctors in general. 
-1	My doctor always tells it like it is and is completely trustworthy and down to earth. She knows that money is an issue and tries to make things as easy on me as possible
-1	I actually recently switched physicians to a PA. The town doctor the PA works for I do not trust at all because he is an jerk but on my form I have the PA as my primary and I trust him completely. He is a friend of the family and has been working in my town for decades. He is dedicated to what he does and very kind. Prior to my recent switch I had a pediatrician who was wonderful growing up and always steered me and my parents in the right direction. I wish I could have stayed with him but unfortunately pediatricians obviously only work with kids.  
1	They can get into a lot of trouble if they lie to someone. I also haven't been mislead by a doctor yet in my life. A lot of medical information is easily verifiable on the internet nowadays too, so if your doctor is lying to you it is easy to find out.
1	I have known my primary care physician for years. Every time I go there, I walk away positive and confident about my sickness and know that she will do what she can to help me get better. She is very thorough and has a lot of information to give and is patient with me. 
-1	I don't actually believe the doctor is actively trying to mislead, but are they getting an incentive to prescribe one drug over another????  and it is almost impossible to keep up on all the different medical studies.  How up to date are they???  are there other options they don't know about. 
1	The practice of doctors is efficient.  They listen to my concerns, address them immediately, and strive to anticipate normal concerns and cover them.  They take an active interest in my overall health, not just in the complaint presented at appointments.  They are holistic in their care, and every doctor in the practice is comfortable with my chart and my needs.  They are all capable of helping and caring.
1	It's just the feeling that I get. With doctors it is all about trust. If I didn't trust a doctor I would shop around until I found one that I did trust. And again it would just be the feeling I got off of them that decided.
-1	Most of my interactions with my primary care physician are straight forward. I mainly interact with him for general check ups so as long as nothing is wrong most of what I hear from him is that everything is good.
1	My doctor is around the same age as me. She is very aware that weight loss is important but it's not as simple as just losing some pounds. She has never pushed any shots or drugs on me if I'm not interested.
-1	My husband is in the Air Force so I have to see the military doctor on base.  Sometimes I feel rushed when I come in for an appointment and don't really get my needs met.  Sometimes I have a couple of problems but them only want to talk about one and that can be frustrating because I can't keep taking time off work to come in for everything.  There have been a few times where I've come in for a problem, one time in particular for an ear ache, and the treatment my doctor prescribed didn't work at all.  Instead of just referring me to a specialist they made me come in for another visit.  In the end, I'm still dealing with this ear problem that comes and goes.
1	I trust primary care physicians because in general, they have extensive training and tend to see many patients over the course of a short time span. They are typically knowledge and willing to refer me to specialist if a condition is out of their scope of expertise. I would not trust a primary care physician who is overworked or tired because I would think their judgement would be affected. 
1	I simply trust my doctor, because every time I needed to go to him, he was very clear and helpful about what ever the situation is. My doctor has been in his practice for over 20 years and he is very knowledgeable about his practice. 
-1	I have found that a lot of them will prescribe something because they benefit from the pharmaceutical representatives. I usually do more research on medicines to find out which is best for me. Some doctors know more or just care more than others. 
-1	I don't have a PCP, so I'm just going based on random visits I have. Doctors seem rushed and unwilling to challenge anything other than their first assessment. 
-1	I distrust him because he just wants to hand out pills instead of getting to the root cause of the problem. He has been treating me for migraines for years and years and it turns out it wasn't even migraines. It was tension headaches. So he just wanted to switch me to a different medication instead of offering massage with the physical therapist (which is covered by the insurance).  I had to make a huge scene to get him to let me go to physical therapy over just trying to medicate the pain away. He's so focused on getting through his appointments in his allotted 15 minute slots that it keeps him from giving an honest look into the best solution for each patient individually. Some patients may be perfectly content with popping pills, but I'm not. He should have said here are the options available, which do you prefer?  But that doesn't happen with this doctor at all. 
-1	I feel like doctors are fallible.  Doctors are just people with extensive training and the body is such a difficult and complex machine.  I don't blame my doctors for not being accurate 100% of the time, but I think that it helps to keep an open mind and trust what my body is telling me. 
-1	I have some trust in my primary care doctor, but don't have 100% faith in him when dealing with other than really basic care issues. On the other hand, he is more than happy to refer his patients to specialists. It is almost like he is aware of his own limitations.
-1	I don't know where the doctor is coming from or what motivates the doctor. I am young so the doctor would probably overlook serious issues and may misdiagnose me
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a medical doctor. He once brought a medical condition to me that I had ignored for a long time and he persistently asked me if I had certain issues that I was in denial of. He recommended getting some blood work done and I am so glad I did because it turned out I was actually pretty sick on the inside. Once I started a treatment for this medical condition I improved so much. I trust him for reasons like this. 
1	I have used the same PCP for  the last 5 years. In that time ihave got to trust his decisions on my health care.
-1	I trust my doctor because they have gone to school for a very long time to study medicine. I feel they would not have been given a license if they were not competent enough to provide medical services. I believe most doctors generally want to help people. Even though some doctors are just in their field to make a lot of money. I trust my doctors if they have been practicing for a very long time because this would mean that they have experience. I also go by my gut feelings or intuition about people's character and trustworthiness in general.
1	My doctor is very transparent with me, I am only 20 years old so he warns me all the time about certain diseases people my age tend to catch. He is also very interested in our lives like our studies and sports, and that makes me feel more welcomed by him.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician, but base my answers on the experiences I have had with various medical professionals. I have had some negative experiences with medical professionals where I feel they did not give me any valuable advice or services, but I was stuck with a large bill. One example was an experience where I went to a doctor for a birth control prescription. I was told I could not be prescribed the medicine without having my blood drawn, something I have never heard before. A nurse attempted to draw my blood unsuccessfully before asking that I visit a phlebotomist. I got stuck with a bill for an unsuccessful appointment, which generally is covered under my insurance as preventative care. Instead of going to the phlebotomist, I went to another doctor and got what I needed, all included by my insurance.
1	I believe they are legally required to tell the truth, based on the information they are given. If I truly didn't trust the doctor on something I would go to another doctor and see if they have the same conclusion.
-1	I don't see a primary care doctor because I have had trouble finding one that really listens to me and works with me to solve my medical problems. It seems to me that they are too busy most of the time and want to solve the immediate need that I have come in for, rather than working towards long term health. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I believe in their expertise, years of training, and experience in the field. I do not consider myself a medical expert so believe it is in my best interest to defer recommendations to a professional who can offer informed guidance. 
1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR HE HAS BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR US FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS ALWAYS LED US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH THOROUGH AND EXCELLENT MEDICAL CARE
-1	I trust my doctor because of the relationship I have built over the years. Also my doctor has a stable client base and they have never misdiagnosed or prescribed anything I would refer to as unecessary.
-1	My doctors tend to rely more on pharmaceuticals to treat common problems, even when other options are available. I'm not sure if she's playing it safe or if it's just easier.  I believe all options should be made available to the client/patient and then allow the client/patient to decide the best course of treatment for them. 
-1	My Doctor is first off human and fallible. Second, he has repeatedly failed to listen to me and my symptoms when I have described conditions, only to discover that I indeed had the condition which I claimed. He also has a tendency to talk over me and has no real regard for my health, only placating my symptoms and referring me to specialists.
1	Same doctor for 7 years so good rapport. Doctor keeps up on the latest studies and medications for my health concerns
-1	I trust that they have more knowledge about medical issues than I have. That being said, I don't very often put 100% faith in anybody's opinion. I'll do my own research even if it's minimal, and if I'm really uncertain a second opinion is always nice.
1	Well, These doctors have been to school for this. I like to walk into a clinic thinking that I will be in good hands and that the doctors know what they are doing.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician and I do not trust regular doctors in general. Honestly, it depends on the person. If I have a gut instinct that the doctor doesn't really care then I will not trust them and if my gut tells me that the doctor is compassionate and really cares about the job I will trust them. 
-1	I do not hesitate to ask questions and make sure they know what i want and what i expect. i do my homework so i am familiar with my options ahead of time. i make sure i let them know what options i am interest in and give them the opportunity to discuss those options with me.
1	She is straight forward with me and lets me know about the options that I have. She doesn't sugar coat things and doesn't pressure me in to decisions that are unnecessary. I feel that she actually cares about my health. 
-1	I have a long-standing relationship with her and she has been right about diagnosis and treatment the vast majority of the time. During times where I've had complications, she's made herself available to me and has been flexible.
1	Doctors are highly trained professionals. They know what the best course of action for your conditions are better than you do. I think you should just trust and be honest with them if they have not given you a reason to do otherwise.
1	I have found them to be educated, compassionate, trluly concerned, and have my best interests at heart. They take the time to answer my questions and allay my concerns.
-1	I do trust my physician with my medical treatment. I do feel as if he rushes me through my appointments and doesn't necessarily treat my issues with the severity I feel they may be. I have found that any issues with mental health are taken more seriously though.
1	I mainly trust him because he is a smart person who is detail oriented and when he explains something to me it makes sense to me. I have had doctors who tried to shoot me a line of bull to manipulate me which may seem good to them but if it does not make sense I can't believe anything they say.
-1	I mean, overall I have trust.  That doesn't mean I wouldn't look for a second opinion on something life changing.  I always felt that most all Dr's know more then I do about these things.  I don't like it when they seem more interested in pushing a particular pill my way to mask rather then to look for ways to fix any certain condition.
-1	he is under a lot of pressure to see a lot of patients. he is always in a hurry and the medical record he refers to doesn't always seem complete for me, like what was covered in the last appointment. 
-1	"I sometimes feel doctors prescribe way too much medication - pushing the latest drug of choice, which may or may not be a good choice for me.  I prefer to research drugs before using them and would prefer a doctor that would respect when I say ""No that isn't suitable for me - find something else"".  but too many doctors prefer the ""take this pill"" solution."
1	My primary care person is an advanced practice nurse practitioner. She has demonstrated a high level of active care for me, and is extremely thorough in her work when examining me. She is an exceptional listener, and has even detected health issues of which I was not aware. She communicates very well, and takes all the time I need to address my health concerns.
-1	I dont feel like I trust my primary care physician because she seems to force me to take shots that I dont really need and forces unnecessary tests onto me just to make a few couple bucks. But she seems knowledgeable and thats the only reason i am sticking with her for now.
-1	I HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A DISTRUST IN DOCTORS.  HAVING CARED FOR AGING PARENTS AND A DAUGHTER WITH HEALTH ISSUES I FOUND MANY TIMES DOCTORS WERE NOT THOROUGH ENOUGH AND AT TIMES I FELT WERE GUESSING AT BEST.  DOCTORS ARE NOW TECHNICIANS AND NO LONGER HEALERS.
1	primary care physicians are there to help us, people may have different outlooks on treatment but none of them have a medical degree to back up there beliefs. We have doctors for a reason, they are trying to help us get well. Even a physical can make an error in treatment, I recently has a visit do the dermatologist and he prescribed me medication that did not help.There was no reason of me to be concerned, I called him back and got a different drug that helped. The amount of knowledge and understanding of science that the MD have is incredible. I'm very grateful for there service. Trusting your physician is important part of anybodies life, they will not harm you or judge you , they are there to help.
-1	My PCP is part of a group.  They need to see as many patients as possible.  They rarely have time to deliver quality health care and be able to think through all options.
1	I have never been given a reason to not trust my doctor and he always seems to take precautions even when he believes everything is ok.  This makes me feel better because he is not just going off of book knowledge and things he's seen in other cases.
1	Because he is a good guy and I have known him a while now.  He often tells it like it is and doesnt sugarcoat things, but he is always honest.  He has often told me things that other doctors would tell me one way and he would say that was just a waste of money and it was.
-1	because she tells me nothing. she invites other doctors in that also say things like it doesn't look good but when you ask them what it is they say i can't tell you here is a referral to another doctor who then says the same things and prescribes drugs without an explanation at all of what it is and what its for
1	I trust my doctor completely because he has saved my life in the past and helped me to better myself.
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician. Over the years she has been correct many times, when it comes to my health. She has given me the best healthcare service. She has tried to improve my health time after time.
1	I trust my primary care physician cause they always lay it down straight forward in front of me about my conditions and the treatment options I have.
1	My pcp is thorough and listens to my opinions about my medical issues. She frequently informs me of my options and lets me decide what I think is best for myself, since I know more about my problems than her.
-1	I feel they are under tremendous pressure to move quickly from patient to patient as well as keep costs low and use certain prescription vendors.
-1	I have a rare disease called Achalasia. I was so sick I lost over 170 lbs in less than a year, doctors kept telling me there was nothing wrong with me for a year. Doctors kept insisting I had bulimia and it was all in my head, this was not the case at all. If that was the case I would have been binge eating then forcing myself to vomit, instead I would take a few bites of something and regurgitate it afterwards. After seeing over 4 specialists I finally found a doctor who listened to me and understood what was going on and it wasn't in my head. The majority of doctors I saw didn't care about my symptoms and just wanted me out of their offices. This experience made it difficult for me to trust doctors in general. 
-1	I don't have a primary care. In the past all they have done is make my problem worse, not better. American medicine for the most part is just another way to make money.
1	I trust my doctors because I truly think they are looking out for me. I have friends who are nurses and they have all told me they've never seen anything to have them question a physician's judgement.
1	My current primary care physician is incredibly thorough in her evaluation of my health issues and in her explanation of the options available. Whenever she makes a recommendation she goes into a lot of detail about her logic behind the recommendation and explains why others might have a different opinion. I usually do some research after my appointments with all physicians in order to make sure that I understand all aspects of my illness or treatment and have never found the information my current doctor gives me to be lacking in any way.
-1	I feel that my primary care doctor often does not have nor take the time to listen to me thoroughly or allow me to ask in-depth questions.  Therefore, I cannot trust that the decisions that he makes for me is thoroughly informed. 
-1	I somewhat trust my primary care physician because I do not believe he shares with me all the possible solutions to my ailments. Many of the times he prescribes drugs for something that can be healed with more natural substances. I would like to know the full range of my options, from natural to prescribed medications when making a medical decision.
-1	My doctor has consistently demonstrated a high level of knowledge and empathy to me when i talk with them about any health conditions. I dont feel like they judge me or take prejudice with me 
1	I trust my primary care physician because they're very helpful. They always answer any questions I may have, no matter how silly they might seem
1	We have built a relationship over the years. He knows my conditions and understands my thoughts and concerns about them. He wants me to be happy and healthy 
-1	My physician is condescending. Usually when I have questions they're met with a 'duh' attitude or as if it's something I don't need to know. I struggle with making regular visits because I end up feeling angry and marginalized. 
1	I go to the doctor when I am not feeling well and when they give me recommendations it is usually something that helps.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to examine and talk to me.  My physician cares to know me as a person and takes a lot of time to ask me questions and gives me time to ask questions to make sure I understand everything.  
-1	Once you reach 60 and all the doctors are 30, you lose a lot of trust.  Then many doctors are treating statistically, instead of treating personally.  I take what I can get.  It could be a lot better.
-1	My primary physician has been a physician in my family for a long time. I completely trust that the reason he has been was because my family trusts him. 
-1	I have one medical condition that is rare and doctors have no effective treatment. They generally pretend to have some awareness of the condition and offer me treatment I know if not effective.  Once in a while I will get a doctor who is honest and their lack of expertise with my disease.
-1	I generally trust most doctors, while I don't have a primary care physician if I ever need professional medical help or advice I usually just go to the urgent care center and they have always been able to help me with my problems. So my trust level for them is average I would say, I don't necessarily believe everything a doctor says, but I also don't think everything is a lie they are telling me either. 
1	I trust most doctors simply on the fact that I know nothing about it and they are train and educated to know about it. Also, some doctors just seem more genuine in the bedside manner than others.
1	I trust my physician because I have checked his credentials before I have signed up with him. Also I have learned to trust him even more because my brother who is a doctor too in another country agrees to everything that my primary doctor says.
1	My primary care doctor goes over all of my options and I have asked about options that she has not presented and she will explain why she thinks that option would not fit my lifestyle.  She also genuinely listens to my concerns and answers my questions.  
1	He is courteous and attentive. He is very informative and talks about every option available to me in regards to my health. I always feel as if he is treating me like I am his only patient, as he devotes all his time and attention to me in that moment.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician that I see regularly so it is hard to say. I based my answers on the times that I have seen doctors in the past. In general I think that doctors are trustworthy and do have the best interests of their patients at heart.
1	I have been going to him for a long time.  He listens to me and knows me and my history.  He values my input, as he says no one knows my body better than me.  When I had some financial problems, he understood and started with the most conservative course of action, while still giving me good care.
-1	I trust my doctor to give me the best advice that they are aware of. I do not think of doctors as gods or in fallible, because of which I do not trust them without question. I also do my own research and seek second opinions when I feel I should. I do know that my doctors want to give the best care they can provide, that just might not be the actual best care availible
1	I have been with my doctor for such a long time now that I trust them. They have never done me wrong and always help me out when I have a problem. 
1	I facebook stalked my current doctor. I was in search of a black female doctor who was not overly religious to be my primary physician. I truly trust her and know that she has my best interests in mind because she is like me. I don't get the same feeling of controlled condescension that other doctors have and none of the fanaticism some black women are wont to have. It 's just pleasant, and I feel like big pharma cant buy her either. 
1	The took an oath that I respect.  They would have no reason to not have my best interests in mind.  I do have an obligation to myself to double check their recommendations.
-1	I use a Patient First and although they are my primary care, I do not have one physician that I see.  I often see a Physician's Assistant or a different doctor every time.  It is hard to trust this situation.
-1	I have never been in one place long enough to establish a primary care physician. I think it depends on how connected I feel to them, if I feel rushed and that they don't care then I am less willing to talk to them honestly or feel confidence in their opinion.
-1	I feel like my doctor is very capable and knows what he is doing.  However, I think he tries to schedule too many patients in one day, leaving very little time to tend to each patient.  Each time I go in, I feel like he hasn't even read my chart and I have to explain my situation to him each time like I am a new patient.
1	I trust my doctor because I know of their certifications and background. I have known them for a long time as well with no issues. Every time they helped me their advice has worked well.
-1	I mostly trust but I also know that doctors do not know everything and they make mistakes too. I also have heard many stories of people having doctors who push their own agendas or make decisions based on what is easiest and safest for them and I worry about that happening to me. 
-1	I just think that sometimes doctors do what is easier and convenient and time-effective rather than giving me the time and attention I may need.
-1	I know my doctor knows more about me than I know about myself health wise. Some things I really dont feel comfortable speaking about with anyone. This is usually the case with the doctor, as I do trust what he/she will tell me but comfort isnt always there. Sometimes I get angry with my doctor as well when I hear things I dont want to hear. Especially when telling me to change certain habits I have had for years. I do also use the internet to self diagnose myself and certain sicknesses I get. Sometimes its really just a tossup on if I want to ask or not about something. 
1	My doctor is honest and takes what I say into consideration instead of having God complex like a lot of doctors seem too.
1	I trust him the most because since I started going to his office my life has changed for the better. I feel great about myself and I think that is all thanks to him.
-1	I mostly trust my primary care physician. However, there have been a few times where I go to this person over something and the doctor gave me bad/unhelpful advice.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. He always address my problems. At times I feel I have to remind him of something and than he agree to look at the problem.But always addresses my issues and look further to be sure things are OK&gt;
-1	Just started going somewhere new and haven't really been that impressed.  They seem to rush through and don't explain things in as much detail as i would prefer. 
1	She seems to have my best care in mind. Also she has taken care of all my questions with care.  Andshe consults with the other professionals in her network. So she has earned my trust and I hope to continue in her care.
-1	He has made mistakes and has misdiagnosed both my wife and I. He can be very arrogant and moody too. At times, he can be downright dismissive. He got fired from MedExpress. At other times he is helpful and more thorough thinking outside of the box to find the source of an ailment.
1	I trust my doctor for the most part because he has never given me any reason not to. Everytime i do go to my doctor, he usually is very helpful in figuring out whats wrong and solving it. He also never tries to get me to take any medications  that will have bad side effects, and is really compromising in all aspects. 
-1	I mostly trust doctors, but complete trust has to be built up over time.  And doctors are people too and make mistakes.  I believe they try to do their best, but sometimes they are working with limited information - I don't always remember to tell them everything.
-1	She acts as if she cares more about her world than mine. Sometimes she seems closed which discourages me in wanting to contact her about my issues 
1	Doctors train for a huge part of their life. They are incredibly knowledgeable and determined to provide the best care for their patients. I have no reason not to trust my doctor.
-1	I have developed a great deal of trust in him over the many years I have been seeing him. My father recommended my doctor and because my father is a physician , that made me trust him right away. 
1	I have known my primary care physician for awhile and he is a family friend. I believe that he does everything he can to make sure I am getting the best treatment possible.  Not only for me, but for my whole family since he is all of their doctors.  He seems to take his time and is always available for questions.
1	I've thankfully had good experiences with doctors. I don't need to see doctors often, but when I do I have received care that I had been satisfied with. I feel that the doctors I have seen care about me, they care about making sure I understand my issues and they explain to me the importance of my options and the results of any decisions I make. I have not felt at all that doctors don't care for me or that I am wasting their time.
1	I have never felt any reason to not trust my doctor. I feel as if they try and do their best to figure out what my issues are. Until then, I will trust them.
-1	I've started to distrust her as of late. She seems more interested in just refilling my prescriptions and getting me out the door than actually helping me solve my problems. 
1	"My new doctor is quite friendly in every interaction I've had with them be it in person, over the phone, or through online messaging. He makes eye contact and generally has a smile on his face. You can just ""feel"" that he genuinely cares about his job and helping his patients. He actively listens to everything I have to say, and I get the impression he hears my hesitation or what I don't say just as much as my words. I don't just feel like a patient with him, but a member of a team. We work together to come up with the best plan of action in treating my health needs."
1	I completely trust my primary care physician. She is a kind, considerate and thorough doctor who shows genuine concern for her patients.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he has helped me find treatment for things when I have gone to me and given me advise on how to treat things in a helpful way.
1	I trust my doctor because I am able to discuss about my health and receive appropriate care.  My doctor appointments have been good and I am able to understand and learn about my health during my check-ups.  I am able to ask questions regarding my physical and mental health and receive a professional answer from my doctor.  I trust my doctor and the services being offered at clinics, health centers, and hospitals.  During my visits to clinics, health centers, and hospitals, I was cared for, treated, and given appropriate care from staff.  I love the work that nurses and doctors do and will continue to check-up on my health.  
1	my primary doctor has been working with me for a few years and he is one of the best doctors i've ever had.  he is soft spoken, tells the truth but in a polite way, is an excellent listener, and has a pleasant attitude.  i have no reason not to distrust him; he hasn't lead me in the wrong direction yet.
-1	I do not trust all doctor's . My perception is based on a negative response I had with a doctor some years ago. . I did not like her results and when I went with another opinion with another doctor it turned out that  I did the right thing by doing so, Because my primary doctor was way off on her prognosis.
1	I have a personal connection with my doctor. It is just something that occurs, chemistry, that I feel about some people. Once that connection is made it is just easy to trust what he is telling me. I can think of no reason why he would tell me things that weren't true and would not be in my interest.
-1	My doctor has only ever been helpful and kind when I've visited her. So far, her recommendations have been positive and yielded good results.
-1	I trust my doctor because they have more knowledge in that field of study and in the pains i may be having but i don't trust them to make the best recommendation for me when deciding between home remedy and hooking me on meds for profit; and benefiting from my insurance company. 
-1	I often feel like the doctors are overworked and they have to rush between patients, so they only spend a few minutes with you. This isn't really enough time to be thorough and careful despite how good their intentions might be. I don't have a problem with communicating to the nurses, but I sometimes wonder if all of the information is actually being conveyed to the doctor or not.
-1	I've met many rude doctors in my short life. It seems like there are may people that become doctors for the wrong reasons. When I find a competent and compassionate doctor it almost seems like finding a rare gem. I think most of them are competent of course, but few have what it takes to interact with patients appropriately.
-1	In the past when I have had medical issues, my current primary care physician has brushed me off and not listened to my concerns. Through my own research and self advocacy, I was able to get the resources I needed, but definitely not with much assistance from my own physician. 
-1	I completely trust my physician. The main reason why I completely trust my physician is because I have been going to the same physician for ten years now. I feel like my physician knows exactly how to treat my symptoms. 
1	I trust my primary care physicians to do what they believe is best and affordable for me given the knowledge they have. That said, one can not be an expert in every specialty and sub-specialty so I do expect to be referred to a specialist if necessary.
1	I trust my Primary care doctor because he respects me and the knowledge I have about my health and body. I have some different health issues and he lets me somewhat control my treatment. He listens well to what I tell him about my body and asks thoughtful questions. He helps me plan my treatment, and defers to my preferences. He's not a pushover, but he is aware that I'm the one living in my body, so i know my body best of anyone. And i really appreciate that!
1	I have certain things in common with my primary care physician. He routinely vacations in an area I am familiar with. My doctor speaks English, and there are no cultural barriers between us. He has a good sense of humor and is, generally speaking, a very nice man. I like him as a person, and I trust his judgment. 
1	I have brain tumors. That diagnosis came totally out of the blue and I was devastated. I ended up with the best doctor, and he saved my life. And he also made me understand that things would be okay. He moved away to teach not long ago, and I've saved his last voicemail to me just because hearing him always makes me feel better about life.
-1	I trust them as much a I distrust them. I  am not a paranoid person but I would like to understand what medical procedures are being done on me and what the effects will be.
-1	The physician i see most often is my pain clinic nurse practitioner. I see two different guys and they contradict each other at least once every two months. It is hard for me to trust what either of them say because neither seems to be interested in healing my problem, only covering up or masking the problem. We have reached a wall and the only other option that could be recommended would be surgery but one physician feels I am too young and not in enough pain. Nothing either of them have done has worked to help my pain so it is hard for me to feel confident in any of their suggestions.
-1	My doctor himself is trustworthy, however, as he works for a for-profit hospital I know sometimes his decisions are based on money and he has to follow certain rules based on how his bosses see to make money. In order to have complete trust in him he would need to work for a non-profit
-1	I just can't trust doctors any more.  I think they are like mechanics and just trying to upsell me on every little thing that they do.  Every stupid appointment is two hundred bucks.  just stupid
-1	"I see no reason why my pcp would not be honest with me.  I go to a practice where I am seen by residents and interns overseen by attending physicians.  There are plenty of ""checks and balances"" in place to ensure I am getting quality care."
-1	I feel that the business side of things makes it really hard for doctor and care give to give the best service as possible. I think they are push to see you longer then they need to and add on service that you really don't need. I think that they are good people but I think that management get to involved in health care.
1	I think my dr takes the time to listen to me and give me good feed back when needed.  He is also good at referring me to the correct ppl.
-1	Overall I feel that doctors are honest and trustworthy. For the most part I believe that doctors want to help their patients and will do what is best.
-1	I haven't had that much medically wrong with me through my life. I had my tonsils and adnoids taken out, we thought I had a hernia when I was in junior high and one bout of skin cancer a few years ago but other than that, it's pretty much been colds, flus and bee stings. I've never had a problem with a doctor. I've never had a doctor lie to me, or at least, I've never found out about it. I generally trust people and that holds true for doctors as well. 
-1	At this current time in my life I do not have a primary care doctor so I would be discussing doctors in general as a whole. I feel the training they received from medical schools is geared towards treating symptoms and prescribing medications and not curing the issue. This would be due to Pharmaceutical industry having such a firm holm on lobbying the medical education system. Doctors need funding and will do what is needed or asked in order to get said funding. It is a business and that means the end user/patient is not always going to be the focus of concern.
-1	She is personable and competent, but like most doctors, she prefers treatment over prevention. She is not always interested in the root cause of something.
1	I think my doctor really cares about his patients, as all should. I've never once even gotten a slight implication that my doctor wasn't doing what was best for me.
1	My primary care physician makes decisions where we both have input in and both discuss what is best for me; he doesn't make a decision for me, we both work together. 
1	"My doctor has spent time during my visits to listen to everything I say. He listens to me like a therapist. He will even call me from his cell phone after business hours to discuss test results as he gets them. He's always been very thorough in explaining medical conditions and terms and treatments. He always ""fixes"" me quickly."
-1	I have been with my doctor for many years, he has done a great job taking care of me. I have no reason to mistrust him or suspect some hidden motives.
-1	I trust my primary care physician for a few reasons. For one he is an excellent listener. I often over think or over worry and he puts up with it. He offers a variety of medical options when issues arise and he is always knowledgeable on these options. This makes me trust the he is making informed choices for my health.
1	I feel like my doctor would never lead me in the wrong direction when it comes to making decisions just based off past experience. Sometimes I don't always agree with his decisions and he knows that but we always do what we both think is best for me.
1	I trust my doctor because he genuinely shows concern for my health. He explains all of my options along with short and long term effects. He is attentive to my concerns and offer effective plans  and he is there when i need him
-1	I trust most doctors I go to I normally go off of their attitudes, I dont like a doctor that doesnt show compassion or caring, thats how I rate a doctor.
-1	I trust my doctor.He has always come through for me.He has never steeredme wrong. He has always helped me with my health and known the right things to do.
1	They have been through extensive training in the subject area and certainly at the very least know more than I do, and have no reason to want to deceive me
-1	I have had the same issues for years the the Doctors never can find anything wrong.  It is extremely frustrating!
-1	I get a general vibe off my instincts on how I feel I should feel about it. There are some doctors that I trust and some I do not on that alone. 
-1	I think that the doctor has my best health and happiness in mind when making decisions. I ultimately think that the doctor makes a lot of money, but that this also motivates him to give me the best available care.
1	I trust my doctor. I trust my doctor because he has a degree and went through a lot of tests to ensure he knows what he is doing and is good at it. He see's a bunch of other patients who also think highly of him which is what in return I trust and believe the same about him. He has a lot of education and does a lot of good things in his profession.
-1	I want to trust my doctor, or any doctor. I sometimes have a hard time doing so though because all-in-all, it is just a profession and if these doctors fixed all sick people and issues happened less and less, doctors jobs would become more and more scarce so some things are not treated properly or correctly so that it can keep people in the healthcare system to make money and keep doctor's jobs.
-1	Doctors in general: They are narcissistic, arrogant snakes who care more about their country club membership payments than patients. I repeatedly have received misdiagnoses and inadequate when it comes to doctors such that I now view them as a means to an end--the end being the laboratory test results and that's about it. Dr. Google has served me far better than any doctor ever has.
-1	My doctor is intelligent and easy to open up to for the most part.  But sometimes I feel rushed.  Sometimes I feel she is a bit condescending or quick to jump to conclusions.  I generally feel she is not as thorough as I would like.  I supplement the visit with a lot of internet research.  I mainly go to her for basic checkups.  It's very hard to find a doctor who you really like, who listens to you, who doesn't rush you, who you trust, who you feel comfortable talking openly with, who is non judgemental, who takes your insurance and continues to take your insurance, who gives you good answers to your medical problems, who has a competent and caring staff.  In the end I think most people settle for someone who meets some of those characteristics.  Or maybe they just stay with a doctor they are unhappy with.  Sometimes you can't always find what you want.  But I do think the medical professionals and the insurance industry should do a lot better.
-1	He/She has a full record of all my medical history at there fingertips.  They can order new tests and/or labs easily which can often be done in the same facility.  I have had one doctor before moving for over ten years which enabled him to get to know me a bit personally which I think helped the overall care.  This facilitated discussion on lifestyle and care out side the clinic. Often, they new colleagues in the same medical plan that would be a good fit for me in other areas of care such as back doctors or physical therapy.
-1	Well, because unfortunately doctoring is a profession, and legal practice if you will. Therefore, there is a certain amount of accountability and responsibility that they must exercise, therefore I may come second to that.
1	She takes time to concentrate on my problems and my needs. She always offers me the best advices and guidelines
-1	I am neutral in trusting my primary care physician due to having a negative experience during my childhood where I was misdiagnosed multiple times and given wrong advice/information regarding my health. It got to the point where it was almost too late for me to survive because my parents were being told that their child only had a cold/fever. Outside of that experience, I normally do not put that much trust in a person regardless of it being their profession because some people only have their own interests in mind.
1	"I mostly trust my primary care physician because he is usually right when deciding what is wrong with me. But I do have doubt's wondering if he is always right when deciding what is wrong with me because he has said in the past, ""Try this medicine to see if it goes away and if it's still the same come back."" It makes me wonder if the physician knows what they are doing and if he will be able to help the next time I am sick and know what is wrong with me."
1	For me, it is because I was his office nurse for 28 years, so I know him very well.  He is a good doctor.  I did not always agree with everything he said, but as a patient or as an employee, we could still work it out.
1	"I am a ""Type 2 Diabetic"". I know that my doctor must get frustrated when my A1C count is high. He does not give up on me for not trying my best to control it. He still gives me advice on how to eat, exercise, and not give up. "
-1	I trust that my doctor can provide basic care and advice but I do not believe they keep up-to-date on new treatments.  I'm also not confident in their knowledge of things outside their specific scope of practice.  As with all professions, some doctors are very good and knowledge an a majority land somewhere in the middle of competence.
-1	Usually my appointments are so quick I feel like they just want to get me in and out of the office as quickly as possible and are annoyed if I ask too many questions
-1	I go to a medical professional for their knowledge and expertise. If I don't feel comfortable with the information or advice, I feel confident in my own ability to seek a second opinion or read up on treatment options.
-1	As to doctors in general, I don't trust them completely because they will often do what is best for them rather than what is best for the patient. For instance, they may not prescribe a patient with chronic pain the right medication because they don't want to prescribe certain drugs.
-1	I trust them most of the time but I tend to not rely too much on their answers when it comes to what medicines to prescribe. I was told by another physician that many doctors have contracts with certain pharmaceutical companies, and because of this they are persuaded to recommend that company's medications, even though they know it won't fix their pain or conditions. Since they have a contract, they are forced to push the company they have a contract with's products over others. 
-1	So the surgery went incredibly well with only one nurse having poor bedside manner. The issue was the follow-up procedures. Radiation was all set up and ready to go before a sudden visit to the oncologist was scheduled. And we were informed that we were a month behind schedule. After that, suddenly radiation had to be pushed back over two months so four sessions of chemo could be forced through. We don't go to the first surgeon/general practitioner anymore. Apparently that's common with most surgeons: once they're done with you, you yourself don't need help anymore, even if you clearly do.
1	I trust my primary care physician implicitly.  If I did not trust her, I would find another doctor.  My doctor is caring and always takes the time to discuss all of my questions about my health.  She is not an alarmist.  She always remains calm and is not upsetting regardless of the health issues that are needed to be dealt with.   
-1	I have neutral trust of my doctor. While I do believe he primarily acts with integrity, he will spend 20 minutes lecturing me on healthcare issues that I'm not there to address, leaving the real needs unattended. Namely, he spends the entire explaining to me that I shouldn't drink at all, ever. In return, I lie and say I don't drink. 
-1	I haven't gone to see my doctor for a while because I haven't had any new, pressing issues, but I do believe that, in general, doctors have an expert opinion that cannot be gained from internet sources such as WebMD. However, with the fairly broken medical system we have in America, I also understand that many doctors may have profit motives outside of simply providing the best care possible, and so I question choices and opinions when possible. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I know a lot of other people who see her too.  Others in the medical field have told me how good she is too. 
-1	the doctor seem to rushed to be totally trusted. He sometimes seems to have made a decision very early in the process and ignores evidence as I present it. he is also under pressure from insurers to provide the low cost options. there I have been times when I have mentioned more modern thinking or treatments and he was unreceptive.
1	I trust my neurologist because she is very knowledgeable and informed regarding all of my medical conditions. I have complete trust in her
-1	"I've been through 3 primaries in the past 4 months, trying to get diagnosed and treated for hypothyroidism. None has been a great experience; the first one was very hard to reach, the second ignored my question about additional tests (I left a message with the receptionist and never got a return call), and the third, while explaining one part about how insurance works that the other two should have done (they all knew I'd been out of the ""system"" for more than 20 years), also ignored a question I left with a receptionist. I'm not sure whether I will stay with her. At this point I feel like there is no such thing as a good PCP."
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for years. I have gone to him for my ongoing health issues. I trust his treatment options and decisions. If I don't agree with something or a medication prescribed, he is open to listening to what I have to say. He does not rush me through an appointment like some of my previous doctors. For this reason, I have complete trust in my primary care physician.
-1	Again, I think that the main reason is my inability to 'self-diagnose' and communicate my concerns with them. There is also something of a mistrust of the system within which they work as there are so many constraints upon doctors due to insurance coding and coverage. It seems to interfere with their ability to offer care.
-1	I do trust my physician, but only when we engage in a discussion and come up with a mutual plan for my treatment. If I do not advocate for myself, I feel like he may not put forth as much effort in my treatment
-1	I do trust my doctor because he/she knows best.  Or shall I say doctors are more knowledgeable than me about medical terms.  If I won't trust the doctor how will I be treated.  I always believe that prevention is better that cure.  Only doctors knows it.
1	She spends lots of time answering my questions and discussing all facets of every situation.  She answers questions thoroughly and never seems like she's in a rush.  
1	I trust my doctor to an extent. I am aware that no one doctor has all of the answers so i try to take her advice with a grain of salt
-1	My primary care physician has seen me a few times and has always thoroughly explained information about my health with me.  These discussions are backed up by data, and the correlations between what I am being told by my physician and the data I am being shown align.
-1	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN MY DOCTOR FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND HE KNOWS MY CHART. 
-1	my doctor is very friendly with me and i relate to him as a person of similar age, race, and gender. we seem to get along almost as friends
-1	I often feel that doctors have their own agenda when it comes to diagnosing patients. After all the medical field is for profit. To that effect, I am cautious about completely trusting doctors. 
1	My doctor has over thirty years of experience practicing medicine. This gives me a lot of confidence in his ability to care for me. He is very caring and through when treating any medical condition that I may have. I trust him greatly.
-1	I belong to a family care practice. I only go once a year for monitoring of my condition. Each time I go there is a new doctor right out of medical school assigned to me. The old doctor has moved on. It is hard to generate trust if the old face has gone somewhere else. 
1	I trust most doctors because they are highly educated and have much more knowledge and experience than I do on the subject.  I do not trust some of those I go to because I am in the military and some are just HMs who have not necessarily been to college let alone medical school and could be lacking in the right information.
1	I trust her because she is a very honest person. I have her cell number and she is always abvailable.
1	I have a lot of trust in my doctors. Case and point was last year when I wanted to change my birth control. I was on the pill and wanted to have the implant in my arm. My doctor came in before and went over all the other types of birth control and all the benefits and side effects to all of them. Once we got through that and I still wanted the implant she proceeded. While she was putting the implant in I asked her why she asked all those questions even though I scheduled the implant. She said she felt people didn't look at all the information that is out there and sometimes people don't know all the different options they have. She wanted me to know and understand all my options before going forward so I made the best decision for myself. 
-1	I have had way too many bad doctors in the past. I literally had a doctor look at my mom when I was 5 and tell her it wasn't if I got cancer due to my family history, it was when (while I was sitting there). After that, I started having anxiety about going to doctors and my health. I was severely overweight and another doctor told me to run and eat less. I wasn't physically capable of running. My knees were damaged. I have never been able to trust a doctor to look out for my health. 
-1	I appreciate everything that physicians do for their patients, although I sometimes feel as though certain doctors are motivated to perform a particular action because of personal financial gain. That, or sometimes certain doctors do not show a great sense of genuine interest towards their patients.
1	My doctor has been with me through all of my children, he has helped deliver them and he knows what i am interested in and what I am not interested in. He finds ways to bring other options on the table when I do not agree with what he or another doctor has said.
-1	I feel like we almost have no choice but to have a general trust in our doctors, right? Otherwise, what else is there? I am not naive enough to believe that there aren't plenty with special interests and motivations beyond doing their jobs well and with care, but a certain trust has to exist.
-1	In general I trust my doctor, that being said I know that s/he has a heavy case load and i may not get all the attention i need. Also I know that insurance, HMO's and pharma influences decision making/medical advice i receive
-1	well, you baited a lot of negative opinions about primary care. Also, I have issue with your question which assumes that primary care is bad. It's not. People like it. It can make you a comfortable living, and can be extremely rewarding just like any other specialty.
1	I have found my primary care physician to be a very good listener who asks pointed and relevant follow up questions. He also takes into account my experiences with various medicines and treatments when prescribing tests and/or new medications. 
-1	I have not been with her long, but certain things have fallen through the cracks, like orders for follow-up tests. She's also not show much curiosity in helping me identify problems.
1	I trust my doctor because she has never been wrong in diagnosing me. She has a caring and concerned bedside manner.
1	I feel like if they have been through so much schooling, I should trust them as long as they keep up with new medical findings.
-1	My doctor and I disagree about pain management.  I would rather live with some pain and not be on pharmaceuticals, and he thinks it makes more sense to take pharmaceuticals to reduce (but not eliminate pain) despite negative side effects.  I think many doctors don't understand what it really means to manage a chronic pain problem.  Taking pills everyday is not everyone's first choice.
-1	I do trust my primary care physician but I also don't feel like I get very personalized service. I feel as though I get a generalized service saying that I have basically the same issue as other people. 
1	I like to give physicians the benefit of the doubt.  I have never been steered wrong yet.  I bet there are a few crooked ones out there but I have not encountered them.  I like to think people are more good than bad.
-1	The way the laws are setup in this country I feel doctors have to tiptoe around certain issues. For example, If I am in severe pain I feel they would try as many remedies as possible before offering me pain medication due to the stigma the FDA puts on doctors who prescribe them. I feel like a criminal just asking for help with severe pain. If this is how they treat me with that one issue, what other issues are they making worse to protect their own license?
-1	i trust my primary care physician because i have been going to him for the longest time and i have not had any reason to believe otherwise
-1	They do have more schooling then I do and they continue to learn about different diseases and treatments. The one's I have seen pretty much put everything straight out there for you, they don't dance around the subjects and the sometimes admit they don't know what's wrong instead of just trying to label you and move you along. 
1	I'm not a big doctor person. If I can solve it, fix it and feel better on my own then I'm going to. I like my primary care physician though because he understands my nerves and does his best to calm me down. He's been practicing for over 30 years so I feel confident that he has expansive knowledge. His office is modern and high tech, so I feel he keeps up with the times and is up to date with the latest procedures, drugs and treatments. He's always available on call and has no issues coming to the hospital to check on his patients all hours of the night. He's a family man and very trusting. I'm 100% happy and secure with my care in his hands.
-1	I have had a past where there have been some missed diagnosis. Because of this I do not always trust they they are taking the time to get the job done well and make sure they are doing the right thing when it comes to my health. 
-1	I do not trust doctors or really any kind of medical professional.  In fact, most of the time they don't even seem that professional at their jobs.  From my personal experience, it seems like doctors are only concerned with getting each patient in and out as quickly as possibly so that they can see more patients which of course lead to the doctors making more money.
-1	I just got a new Doctor and he is very good and explains everything to me very well which makes me feel like he is concerned and wants to make sure I understand.
-1	I trust my doctors because they went to medical school and I did not. So I believe them over myself.
1	I have been seeing my primary physician for over 20 years. He takes care of my physical health as well as mental health. He is always honest about treatment options and I feel he cares deeply about being thorough and careful.
1	I trust my doctor because that is what she went to school for. She has been trained in a way that people that are not doctor arent. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician, because she always takes the time to listen to my concerns and my symptoms.  She's willing to take extra time to make sure she understands what my issues are, and she offers different solutions to the problem.  She ultimately allows me to make the final call on what I want to do.  Once I decide, she explains the treatment in depth and makes sure I have a good understanding prior to me leaving her office.
1	My doctor has always proved to be a trustworthy person.  He's been very helpful to me.  The one time something was very wrong with me, he attended to my needs in a thoughtful and respectful way.
1	I trust my primary care physician in that I believe that he will have my best interests in mind while not trying to rush me out of the door to see the next patient.
1	I feel that my doctor does not have any reason to lie about something. I also know a few things myself and can tell by my doctor's body language. I am able to research the doctor's advice myself and compare it.
-1	I trust my Primary care physician for the most part, however, if he were to put me on a drug of some sort, I'm not sure he would be open to exploring all drugs used to treat a condition, or if he would choose the drug that he is comfortable with, or the drug of the sales rep that brought in lunch that day.  Overall, though, I do think he has my best interests at heart and wouldn't do anything to harm me.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he also has experience in alternative medicine. He takes in consideration that you are a whole person(body,mind,and spirit). He is honest about what your options are when he tells you the symptoms. .  
1	I generally trust my doctor since he doesn't speak condescendingly or brush aside questions/concerns. He answers them patiently and thoroughly. I've been researching and trying different medications and each time I suggest one, he makes sure I know the side effects, the neurotransmitters involved, and its off-label uses before filling the prescription.
1	I trust that my doctors are following the oath they made to do no harm. Additionally, I believe in science and believe that the doctors who have years more training than I do are far more capable than I am in this regard. However, I do think that it's important to tell them when you are experiencing side effects etc. so you can get a treatment that works for you. 
-1	The doctor that I have now pushes the medication option.  My previous doctor did the same.  I know they are doing the basics for me.  But I'm not that good a patient and I don't always follow their orders.
-1	Because as much as they are trained to remove personal opinions it is near impossible for slight bias' not to be within a doctors recommendation. Also what they are more familiar with they will feel more comfortable recommending. For example a surgeon will always be more comfortable with a surgical approach, while an internist with a medicinal approach. All advice in life should always be taken with a grain of salt. 
-1	I do not feel like my doctor is committed to getting me the best treatment. I like my doctor but I don't think that she views me as much else than an insurance claim.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because they know there stuff. They went to school for a long time to know all the stuff. If they mess up they are gonna hear it from me.
1	I feel comfortable talking to my doctor(s), and if I have questions or concerns I don't have a problem asking. Also, if there are side effects I ask about those, or potentially alternative treatments. I have always felt that my doctor was able to explain things in a straightforward way that I understood. 
1	He's a trained professional and has always been open and honest with me and always lays out the options for treatment when I have any issues.  He's polite courteous and very intelligent.  
1	I would rather select slightly agree but that's not an option. I've only been seeng this doctor for over a year. About 4 visits because the doctors sometimes rotate or finish their residency. I have to be my own advocate and never completely trust someone with your life in their hands without doing a little of your own research first.
-1	I do not have a primary physician, but I did have a cardiologist in which I seen somewhat often. For the most part I trusted him with the tests he authorized for me to do to find out what my condition was before coming to a conclusion because he went to rule everything else out before I received my diagnosis. I generally trust him, however I know that doctors do not work for the welfare of the people, but the welfare of deepening their pockets. The old doctor vow was to help people and to recommend dietary changes to promote health and well-being. Now it's about their contracts with Big Pharma and prescribing poisonous and toxic medications to create a lifelong patient and to create more money for themselves. In general, I believe my doctor's intention were in the right place, but I'm fully aware of the scam and can see through it all, so I generally do not trust them.    
1	I tend to trust the professionals who show a passion for the work that they do. If the connection and relationship between the patient and doctor is not present then I find a new primary care physician. There is no room for mistrust in medicine. 
-1	I feel like doctors always rush through appointments. I feel like a lot of times they act like I'm making it up.
1	MY PULMONARY DOCTOR IS THE ONE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF MY LUNG FIBROSIS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER TO KEEP MY GOING SINCE 2008. I HAVE GONE TO MAYO CLINIC WITH HIS SUGGESTION TO GET SECOND OPINIONS TWICE AND MAYO AND MY PULMONARY DOCTOR COME TOGETHER WITH A PLAN TO EFFECTIVELY KEEP ME GOING.
-1	I often feel like They do not full understand that some treatment options although a little safer might cause more of a daily issue for the patient. My physician also shames me on things that I can not control rather than offer help
-1	I honestly don't have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I say that mainly because I haven't had a lot of interaction with him. In addition to that my interactions that I've had with him have not been really positive. I've felt rushed in those interactions and I don't get a sense of him really caring about well being of his patients.
-1	I trust that for the most part my doctor is open and honest about everything, but on the other hand it never hurts to get a second opinion about things involving my health. I trust that my doctor has no reason to lie to me or not give me all the information I need but sometimes things can be overlooked. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he fully listens to me. I never have a problem with my doctor listening to my worries or health concerns.
-1	My primary care doctor is part of a large company. That company has huge turnaround, a huge patient base and relies heavily on billing. My primary care doctor probably wouldn't recognize me on the street.
1	My primary care physician has become a friend and is concerned about my health beyond medical appointments.  She acknowledges when she doesn't know a detail, researches and follows up with an answer.  She's active in her professional community, speaking and writing.  
-1	I distrust my primary care physician because one time when me and my sister both went for a check-up, he prescribed both of us potassium pills. I was living on campus for college at the time and had a completely different diet than my sister back at home. It was strange that all of a sudden, we both had low potassium. I ended up not taking mine because mine were huge pills that were a capsule, and I have a hard time swallowing pills. I just ate a couple bananas for a few days. He never prescribed them to us again.
1	He is always warm and welcoming, very professional but he smiles enough to not make me nervous. The top reason I'm happy with him though, is because he actually treats me when I am ill, before I had him I ended up with shingles, and my current doctor (back then) told me that I'd have to tough it out. I switched to him immediately and he got me the medication I needed, he even had his office call me to see how I was feeling. 
1	I put complete trust in my doctor because he has been my doctor for many many years. He knows all about my health and medical needs. He is straight forward with me. He has never lied to me to benefit himself.
-1	I think that your doctor should be one of the most important people in your life. If you do not trust your doctor or if you do not have that bond with your doctor, then I think that you need to find one with which you can form that bond with. I think trust is the number one thing between doctor and patient. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is thorough, kind and takes ample time to explain everything that I need to know. 
1	I like and trust my PC physcian because we actually discuss my issues, treatments and options, I can bring up ideas she has not brought up and we can discuss them, she is open,  I can make my decision based on my needs and she is supportive.
-1	My doctor told me to stop asking questions about medications and just trust her. I did not think that was a good answer.
-1	I feel like I can trust my primary care physician because I do not sense that he would provide bad advice.  I do sometimes have concerns because while his intentions are good he might not be aware of every condition or treatment option.  Sometimes I feel like seeing a specialist is the best alternative.
1	There are a few people in my life that I have to give complete trust to and my doctor is one of those people. He just comes across to me as being knowledgeable and sincere and I have the real impression that he is doing the best he can with the situation that presents itself. 
-1	I have collaborated professionally with doctors and know that they often do not know how to interpret the results of a drug or the results of a scientific paper. So I am a little hesitant to trust their knowledge as the perfect gospel. I trust doctors that are upfront, direct, and friendly.
1	After numerous doctors that could not diagnose my conditions, I began seeing my current internist 5 years ago. After our first meeting she called me numerous times at home, sometimes in the evening to discuss past medical she found in my records. She always made time for me and what she could not do for me, she referred me to specialists where she monitors my care with each. My life and health are better as a result.
-1	I have had many bad doctors. I use a mouth guard during the day for stress, and doctors have treated me like a mental patient. Many doctors have refused to treat my infections because they have treated me before. My immune system is bad. I have had doctors call the police on me and lie, saying I hear voices and want to die. I never told anyone that. A majority of them have been bad. 
-1	In general I do think that doctors act in the patient's interest and would at least put a good amount of stock in what they tell me.  But at the same time I have my reservations about total trust.  Especially the more serious the medical situation is, the more likely I would want other opinions.  But for routine things, I figure the doctor knows how to handle the situation.
-1	Doctors do what the hiarchy tells them what to do. In this day and age, our health condition is a push-pull battle between our insurance plans, and how much influence the drug companies have over the doctor's profit potentual for prescribing what is best in their best income, not what is best for the patient. For that reason, I really don't trust anyone unless I can verify their recommendations without a shadow of a doubt that they are not selling me out.
1	My primary care doctor has been in the medical profession for many years and is very well-respected in our local community.  He is direct and honest, and open to ideas about my and my family's treatment options. 
1	I trust my primary care physician as they have done a really good job of diagnosing me and getting me the care I need so far. They have helped direct me to people that were able to help me with things that they were not trained to do (specialists) and in a very short amount of time. They have been able to help me with my scoliosis and have always been very positive. 
1	I love my doctor. Any concerns I've ever had, he has listened to me carefully and has given advice when he can as appropriate. He is genuinely concerned about my well being. He likes to laugh and makes jokes when I see him. He seems happy when I come in for my check ups. He has never steered me in the wrong direction. He looks me in the eyes when we are speaking. He can gauge if I'm having not a great day just by the responses I give him. He's a great doctor and I completely trust him!
1	I have been using the same doctor for over 20 years and have experienced a range of issues in which he has guided me well and with great empathy and no judgment. I have had no reason to question his judgment as he has been very wise and when he has insufficient knowledge, has directed me to people who have uniformly been knowledgable. We know each other well and have a great history.
1	I try to have any issues I want to discuss written down and keep to a max of three things, if possible.  He always makes sure I am up to date with any shots I am suppose to have.  He tells me things for my own good health care.
-1	i know that doctors are experts, but they are often wrong about things. sometimes they dont listen to what the patient is really telling them.
-1	I do not trust my primary care physician for many different reasons. First off, I believe he prescribes medication for even the smallest symptoms. This is usually not necessary, and most of the time just gives a financial burden. I also believe that they don't fully check your symptoms to check if it is something more severe, and rather just plays it off like its the flu and that it'll go away after a while. 
-1	In general I almost never just trust one opinion from one physician. Specially if they are older as there is a chance that they are not up to date with the information (speaking from personal experience). I prefer always getting a second opinion and do my own research to learn as much as possible.
1	I trust them as I have had them since I was about 7 years old and know them very very well. They are more like family at this point, for me. .I am grateful for this as they are a good person and very helpful to me. 
1	I moved from Ohio to Florida 4 years ago  and health care in Florida is far inferior. I have never been seen by the doctor where I go because I see the PA because the only reason I go is to get my meds managed.  I like and trust the PA but it will never be completely.  I am still feeling the sting about a situation that occurred a year ago that was extremely critical and the doctor overseeing the PA who is ultimately in charge totally let me down.   It was cold and impersonal and there was no commitment to me as a patient what so ever. Horrible and extremely stressful experience
-1	I do not always have trust in my doctor because they always try to prescribe me medications for every problem that I have. I think that if they took the time to listen to me and understand my symptoms then I would achieve more of my therapeutic goals rather than having to try new medications every few weeks. 
1	My doctor takes a lot of time and effort to explain my conditions to me. He gives guidance for modifying my diet in connection with my medication. He also gives directions to appropriate resource persons. He also provides scientific literature regarding my condition.
1	I've been going to the same GP for over 11 years now, so he knows all of my medical history and suggests what I should do to better improve my health. Usually he knows right away and can diagnose what is wrong with me when we talk and i get treated in a quick office visit.
-1	My doctor is a good and caring doctor, and I do feel he has my best interests at heart. However, I can tell he is busy and overscheduled.
-1	I think most doctors have the best intentions and do truly want to help but I feel like they are put in the position where they are not allowed to give their patients the time they need to in order to do their job thoroughly.
1	I trust my doctor because we have built a solid relationship over the years and there is mutual respect involved. He will tell me the truth whether its easy to hear or not, and he will listen to hear what I need to do better. 
-1	For the most part doctors seem to want to help but they don't all have the time to spend with you to really figure out what is wrong. They usually go with the easiest course of action, which I understand is commonly the correct one. But, I cant tell you how many times people have had to go back multiple times just because the treatment they were given was for something they didn't have.
1	I generally don't have any complex conditions and usually only receive preventative screenings. However, when I was pregnant and seeing a doctor on a regular basis, I do believe she had the depth of experience regarding my condition and trusted that she would provide great care for me. I followed her advice and believe my pregnancy had no issues because of her care.
-1	It's not that I think my primary care physician is particularly untrustworthy. I just think people in general can at times be lazy, malicious, or in some way disincentivezed to help you. And it's not always easy to tell when that's the case. So I take what my doctor tells me as being probably true but potentially not the whole story, as I do with most people. For instance, I happen to know that doctors are under a lot of pressure right now to not prescribe opioids, so if my doctor tells me the best route for me is lots of ibuprofen, I'm going to be skeptical. But what other thinks am I not aware of, that might be relevant to my health? It's just best to get second opinions and take things with a grain of salt. 
1	If I go to a mechanic, i assume he knows more about cars than me.  If i go to a physician I expect the same.  I am in no place to tell the doctor how I should be treated medically.
-1	I feel like they rush through my concerns and questions.  Explanations can be in excess or too little. I havenât found a Dr. I really like in awhile.
-1	Why I trust my my primary care physician is because they are trained to help me feel better from the illnesses that I have. Also the physician would not be in this field if they did not want to help those around them. 
-1	I believe that most doctors want what is best for their patients. But due to fast pace and so many patients they see I don't think that doctors can always fully give everyone the time needed. I also think that there is so much medical information that it can be difficult to get consensus among doctors and you are often give mistaken information. 
-1	There might be lots of factors why a primary care physician make certain decisions. There could be influence from the practice to meet a certain quota when invoicing. Drug companies often have 'agreements' with practices so their products are preferred in the treatment of certain conditions. Sometimes practitioners are under time constraints so may opt to try a treatment for something non-life threatening and recheck later to assess response
1	He is a family doctor. He been In the family for twenty years. He is always right with his diagnosis and treats my family according he feels like a family member .
-1	I don't feel like my doctor understands what I'm trying to communicate sometimes. He wants to do some test instead of actually listening to me, or he ships me off to another doctor who only knows part of the story. I would trust my doctor more if I thought he was actually hearing what I'm saying and if he would not be so dismissive of my insights into my own health.
-1	I generally trust my doctor.  I know he is looking out for my best interest.  I typically try to avoid the need for any medications to take regularly, and I do believe there are problems with certain medications that are pushed on patients.   
-1	I usually go to a clinic, so I never know which doctor or NP I will see. I like some of them, they go over everything with me. Some of them it seems like I only see for a minute, and then they leave the room before I can ask any questions.
-1	I have no reason not to trust these people. I would also expect someone to trust me in my profession just the same.
-1	"At the moment my primary care physician is a nurses assistant, not an actual DR. thanks to my insurance.  She is kind of knowledgeable but at my last visit she had to ""Ask Dr. Google""  to answer one of my questions which not only worries me but is something I could do myself for free."
-1	I do not have a primary care doctor. I rarely see a doctor. In my experience doctors always have bad news so I really don't have much trust in them. When my husband was sick there were a few doctors that were honest and thoughtful but the majority of them seemed disinterested and made the wrong decisions because they did not take the time to get updated on his condition.
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. He's never done anything to upset me. He listens to me and is very patient. I have had to switch my children's doctor one time though. I did not agree with her many times and she hardly seemed to check out my kids, I did not trust her at all. 
-1	My doctor seems pretty neutral. The last time I went in, I had a question regarding this rough itchy spot on my skin. He didn't look at it and asked me if I've tried any over the counter steroid creams on it.
-1	My doctor has been a doc for over 25 years and has always given the best options available for what my ailment has been. I trust her whole heartedly 
-1	A doctor is only one person, and sometimes people make mistakes. It's also impossible for one person to have all the relevant information about an issue. My doctor is competent and I like her, but I always do my own research to verify what she's saying. I like to get multiple opinions, so even if my issues aren't serious enough to seek out a second opinion in person, I'll at least do my research.
-1	I trust him because he has given me good direction with my health. He is a little blunt so at times he has hurt my feelings. However, he is a good doctor and has given me good medical care for years. I just thinj he needs to work on his bedside manners. He has been my family doctor for years. I trust his judgement on medicines and whats best for my overall health. 
-1	She sometimes will not listen to me and its my body. I once had to fix my ear infection because she would not help me. Now she listens to me.
-1	My physician doesn't make a habit out of asking for unnecessary tests or making me pay more than I should for a service or diagnosis. I trust that the doctor is looking out for my best interests.
1	Well, I've only gone to my new PCP once but she really took her time to get to know me and my history.
1	I have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I have been with my primary care physician for almost my entire life, so we have had plenty of time to develop a good rapport and a good relationship. I trust her with my concerns and with explaining things to me so I can understand them
1	My doctor spends a good amount of time in the room with me, 15 to 20 minutes or more, talking with me about any issue that I am having. She listens to what I have to say and does what ever tests are needed with out hesitation. She also felt a lump in my breast that turned out to be breast cancer.
1	I have had nothing but positive experiences with doctors. They are highly trained and knowledgeable in their subject, I have no reason to doubt them.
1	I trust my PCP because she has far more education than I do. She would never intentionally do anything that would cause me harm. I know that if something is wrong with me, she will figure out the best way to treat it.
-1	I am on the fence with doctors because I think to many of them have a god complex and have very little information on how diet can actually affect your health.
-1	I have a rare illness that my Physician had never heard of, so his choices in my care have not always been the right choices. I do see a specialist that I trust a bit more, but overall I am very discouraged with most of my healthcare providers due to their lack of knowledge or willingness to educate themselves on my conditions. 
-1	I donât go to the doctor often. I see doctors as well educated people, and their decisions and diagnoses are more times correct than not. If I have a feeling theyâre wrong, I would let them know. As for prescribing medicine, as far as I know and what I have seen, doctors prefer prescribing the more expensive medicines so they themselves profit off of it. In that regard, although they arenât being dishonest, they arenât disclosing all options either. 
-1	I have a nurse practitioner and trust her and doctors in general. However, I think it's important to educate ourselves on our condition and possible treatments. Doctors and care providers may overlook some possibilities. We have to keep in mind that they are seeing many patients and we have our own health, and maybe our family's, to look after.  
-1	I've been going to my doctor for a few years, she has a good way of explaining things and listening to what I have to say. She answers questions thoroughly. I also checked her on the list of doctors who accept gifts from pharmaceutical companies and she doesn't accept those gifts.
1	I trust my primary care physician because his demeanor is very calm, friendly and because he is a good listener. He tends to be very patient, answers all of my questions and speaks with authority. When he has not been confident, he has sent me to a specialist rather than commit to a potentially inaccurate diagnosis.
-1	In general, the medical profession is run by corporations and pharmacy companies who are as interested in a profit as they are anything else.  Individual doctors and other medical personal may be more interested in a patient's care, but the institutions themselves are a different matter.  A government intervention is doing nothing to make it any better.
-1	I don't trust medical doctors very much. The reason is because I feel that there is constantly contradictory medical advice and I think that many of the practicing doctors were taught information that is now old and they are stuck in their ways. I would much rather have a young doctor than an old one because old doctors are mostly ignorant to advances in science and how to treat illness before it comes on.
-1	For the most part I trust him.  I don't think by any means he would want ill for me but occasionally when nothing seems urgent it feels like his patient overload becomes more important then my concerns.  Also sometimes I wish he would give more thought into different treatment when I may not be comfortable with what he was suggesting. Seems like first idea and his idea is the only idea.
-1	unfortunately I have to say that most physicians I have seen firsthand didnât give me the most trusting feeling, although I can't say I wasn't cared for but I feel a lack on the care system. As mentioned before, most prescriptions are given based on symptoms and 'guesses' and not on facts, or exams. I do give attention and value to what my primarily physician says but I never see situations as a one way street so I do my research. And sincerely get disappointed if I look for help and medical guidance and am told that nothing is wrong without any testing done. 
1	My doctor does not have any hesitation in telling me how it is with my health.  If I balk at doing something he is suggesting he will be very blunt on why it has to be done.  He has never steered me wrong, I trust what he says.
1	I've little choice in the matter really. My trust would have to be in the institutions that educated the idividual(s).
-1	The doctors I have visited seem like they judge me and I feel as they know something is wrong with me but won't tell me and they always have the same pity look they give me. I don't trust any doctors because I know they just want to get rid of me and they think of me as another patient (another number) in the system.
-1	I mostly trust my physician because they are a close family friend. They are usually pretty straightforward and honest with me.
-1	My doctor is a little impersonal so I dont distrust him but I dont trust him fully either, sometimes he very attentive and other times he is apathetic and doesnt give a care about me so its hard to decipher which day he is which.
-1	In general, I think physicians are well trained and probably know what they are talking about.  However, I rarely get a chance to see a physician for more than a few minutes once or twice a year.  There isn't really a chance to build a trusting relationship.  I think the way the health system is set up forces doctors to go for quantity instead of having the opportunity to build real relationships with their patients.  Trust takes time to be earned and I just haven't really had the time to build any with any doctor in years.
1	Generally the doctors I've had give the impression of compassion and empathy, and at the very least, they seem knowledgeable and confident.
1	I trust my primary physician because he is very thorough in what he does and has been my doctor for many years.  Any time I have needed him he has been there and properly diagnosed me.  He is not afraid to involve other doctors when he is unsure or would like a second opinion.  
-1	I feel that my primary care physician is concerned with my best interest.  However, it is difficult to totally trust them knowing the lobbying they receive from pharma companies.  I often wonder if I really need the medicine they prescribe or if they are receiving a kickback for it.  On the other hand, my PCP spends a lot of time answering my questions and explaining treatment options.  I do not feel pushed to take medicine I am uncomfortable with.  All in all, I trust my doctor and am not considering switching. I just wish the healthcare system overall was more transparent!
-1	My doctor seems rushed just to get me out the door so they can move on to the next person. When I need things explained to me they bring in a nurse or someone else to speak with me. When I call with questions it sometimes takes days to get back to me.
1	My primary care physician seems very thorough. I think he pays attention and he knows his stuff - he seems to know what he's talking about.
-1	I think that my doctor is a good and genuinely knowledgeable person, but sometimes thinks he needs to dumb down explanations or ease my worries instead of giving me all the facts.
-1	"I have served in a medical sales capacity for more than 10 years and have seen doctors who recommend and even require certain patient services that will benefit them financially although they may not be the most medically necessary or advantageous service.  Medicine has become a ""business"" more than it used to be and managed care does not always allow the doctor to provide the best care, rather what is allowed."
-1	I have several friends in the medical profession and the horror stories they have told me, as well as the life or death situations some of my less healthy friends have had to suffer because of poor care at a hospital, has tainted my view of the profession. Medical Error. Overwork, Carelessness, Corporate Pressure, Ignorance. It's all a big problem. 
-1	If I don't understand something, I ask my doctor to explain it to me.   Afterwards, I usually follow up and research the issue more.   Rarely is my doctor incorrect in their explanations. In addition, they are able to provide referrals to good doctors (those respected in the community). My doctor also surrounds himself with competent staff.
-1	My doctor seems to be on a timer. I don't feel he wants to spend any extra time because he has so many patients or whatever. The last time I saw him in November 2017, he more or less lectured me that I need to lose weight. My A1C was 7 so he appeared upset. I had a short visit and I'm scheduled to see him again in March of 2018. I may cancel the appointment.
1	My primary care physician seems genuine and thoughtful. She listens to all  my questions and never seems to be in a rush. She seems thorough in her examination and is kind.
1	My doctor took the time to answer all my questions. My doctor followed up with me and sat down with me one on one for as long as it took for every concern. She is very kind and did not make me feel like I was burdening her. She called me and made sure I was okay after a procedure and made sure I did not have any other questions she could help answer. all in all she made me feel very comfortable. Even the nurses were very prompt in returning calls and making me feel like I was the only patient they had. I hope everyone has the same experiences I did during that difficult time. 
-1	I donât think some physicians are open enough to modern medicine or understand the muscles and skeletal systems in the body or how we can hold so much internally. Some are more open minded then others.
-1	I find that they are all about the bottom line. They often either ignore your complaints, don't take into consideration the HUMAN with feelings behind the symptoms, or worse, they go on a great zebra hunt when a horse is staring them in the face, more to cover their asses against malpractice than for the patient's welfare. If you are not attractive and/or young, healthcare declines.  I can figure out what is wrong with me faster on google than I can by going to the doctor and BE RIGHT.
1	I have known my primary care physician for a long time and he has always been honest with me. I have never had an incident where my doctor lead me wrong or caused something negative
1	Physicians are in their career for a reason and a lot of trust is involved when they are helping patients out. There is a relationship that builds
1	After a few problems with doctors ignoring my concerns (I spent years with a vitamin deficiency b/c the doc would order bloodwork and insisted it was all in my head) I found an extremely thorough doctor that listens to me. 
1	She takes her time with me. She listens to what I say and even to my suggestions for treatment  If she does not know something she gets more info for me. She is totally honest with me.
1	My doctor has been very helpful by working in conjunction with me to address any health issues that I have had. She listens to my concerns and understands that I am an involved patient. Because she listens to my input, I trust her to work with me toward responsible health goals.
-1	I trust doctors but only as far as I can throw them. There is still a line of distraction in them, and that they do not exist inside of you. You still need to be informed and ask questions 
1	I trust my primary care physician very much. He is thorough in my yearly check-ups. I have been seeing the same doctor for 17 years. He is very knowledgeable about my medical history so I am confident in asking questions if I have any. 
1	I trust the doctor I have now because he listens to me and is willing to do a large number of tests if necessary to find out what is going on. He doesn't regard my symptoms as something unimportant. If he can't figure out what's going on he refers me to a specialist in that area. In the past my doctors would act as though they didn't need to listen to me because they already knew what was happening. They wouldn't order tests, so it took me much longer to be properly diagnosed. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a very competent and experienced medically trained physician who is familiar with various illnesses and treatment options who seems to care for his patients..
1	I trust my physician because he is generally caring and I see him over do himself daily for his patients. He gives patients his work and personal phone number so he can be reached at anytime day or night. He's also really good about what tests he orders or doesnt order to find out the cause of whatever is going on. He also listens to each and every patient for as long as is needed. He doesn't stick to the every fifteen minute schedule he's set to.
1	I have been with my primary care doctor for more than 8 years. I have also had 2 major medical situations and he has guided me through out the processes. 
-1	"I mostly trust my doctor but sometimes I believe that doctors are only taught one way of thinking and therefore do not consider alternative treatments in all cases but rather use only drugs to ""fix"" issues."
1	I trust my doctor mainly because he has very good listening skills and is attentive to my needs and concerns. He is most easy to talk to and never attempts to talk over my head. Even though he is a young physician, I feel most comfortable with him. I do not usually get stressed out when I go to my physician. I can't say that I really look forward to getting and sick and needing my physician's care, but at the same time, I do not dread having to schedule a visit with him.
-1	"I do not have a primary care physician, however, I did have to go to a doctor recently (possible kidney stones). He was a good doctor who, although busy, took the time to listen to my concerns and symptoms while keeping a ""playful/positive"" attitude. He treated me as though I was perfectly competent in my descriptions/concerns and, while listening to me describe my symptoms, stated what possible things could be causing my symptoms, and finally what he thought it was most likely to be. He was genuinely concerned about my comfort (I was in extreme pain...but I was a champ) and wanted to make sure the pain levels would be decreased before I left the office. He sent me to another doctor for a CT scan and, after I explained I don't have health insurance, made sure that he found the best payment options/route for what I needed done as opposed to just charging me one set rate. I trusted his opinion and appreciated his compassion and humor. In general, this has been my experience with most doctors...busy, but compassionate."
-1	I trust my primary care physician because they have a degree in medicine, and has seen many others like me with similar issues in the past.
1	I trust my primary care physician is because I've been with him a very long time. He is very thorough and honest with me every time I go to see him.Therefore I trust him completely.
1	I guess when a primary care physician attempts to connect with me even though I know it is standard, it makes me feel like I can trust them. 
1	I have had my Doctor as my Primary Care for over 10 years and he is very open an honest with me and  very straight forward, he doesn't pretend just tells me straight and that what I like.
1	"I work for a world-renowned health system with some of the best doctors in the US. I always look to see where they attended school, I have access to their ""heath scores"", and if I have to I'll ask my boss, who is the CEO.  They were able to diagnose that I had an autoimmune disease that usually takes 12 years to diagnose."
1	I trust my doctor because he tells me the whole truth about my health.  there's no sugar coating anything and he gives me all of the best available options for helping to continue to be in great shape.  All of the advice he's given me has worked, so I will continue to trust in his advice and recommendations.    
-1	Mostly I feel like I am just a number to them. They seem to always choose the most expensive procedures and treatments. A lot of medical professionals are arrogant and selfish.
-1	I can never get a straight answer out of him. Every time that i go to the doctor feeling bad he tells me i have a virus or just tells me that he isnt sure what i have, but he will still prescribe steroids or antibiotics. Sometimes i worry that i may have a serious problem that wont get fixed because he doesnt put the proper care into figuring out what is wrong with me.
1	My Primary care doctor has always been there for me when I have questions. I can communicate with her via email and she will see me if I really need to come in with almost no advance notice.  She explains things well and cares if I  am OK.
-1	Some time it feels they dont  believe you what you telling. Or they seems like they so busy  and have not much time for you and spending much time with computer not with the patient. 
1	The methods implemented by my doctor to help me have always worked in the past. I have asked my doctor questions about why they wanted to be a doctor and what kind of education they have. Therefore, I know my doctor is passionate about their profession and wanting to help people. My doctor communicates with me promptly when I have a question or concern about my health. My doctor also has a good bedside manner, is always respectful, and does not make inappropriate comments. I know my doctor will be up front with me when I ask them difficult questions.
-1	When it comes to doctors in general I will trust their ability to identify a problem. What I do not trust is the ability to prescribe a solution to a problem.  Most doctors solution to most problems is by prescribing a drug even when a problem can be resolved with simple diet and exercise. This is the main reason why I will not trust what the doctor prescribes  but will trust his diagnosis.
-1	Are usually trust my doctors about 80% you can truly trust them 100% because some doctors do make mistakes and thatâs why itâs always a good to always ask a lot of questions and if you have any doubts get a second
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician, they genuinely care about my well being. If I have an issue, regardless if it seems minor to me, my doctor always insists for me to make an appointment. My doctor possesses the proper credentials and has board certification.  
1	I trust my primary care physician primarily because he has always taken the time to listen to me when I have had health concerns and discussed treatment options and recommendations with me. He discovered that I had a heart condition when I was 40 that I had all my life, and he sent me to a cardiologist,who was impressed that the doctor say it on my EKG. He has been careful about prescribing drugs unnecessarily, but prescribes medicine as he feels necessary. He even takes time to answer health questions I have when I am with another family member for an appointment. 
1	I trust that my doctor is looking out for my best interest as I could give him a bad review otherwise.
-1	My primary care physician has many many other patients and very little time, is constrained from making definitive statements, and is affected by the pharmaceutical companies they receive benefits from, their insurance, my insurance, and their own social personal and religious biases.
1	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY PCP. HE IS YOUNG, TRUSTWORTHY, FRIENDLY, PROFESSIONAL AND HAS A GREAT BEDSIDE MANNER. I RECOMMEND HIM HIGHLY AND HAVE NEVER HAD A COMPLAINT. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HIM AND WILL NOT CHANGE PCP'S. 
1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for many many years and he is very honest and helpful. He doesn't do unnecessary procedures or tests.
1	My Primary care doctor spends time with me and answers all my questions, tells me if I need to be concerned about something and doesn't waste my time if I don't. I have asked for him on the phone and he answers my calls and emails promptly if I have concerns.
-1	I believe my doctor does the best he can under the time constraints he has because he does see so many patients. He will suggest a treatment that has worked for most of his patients. If that fails to help, he is open to trying other treatment plans. My lack of complete trust is due to my doctor's limited time to spend with each patient. 
1	I generally trust my doctor as they have gone to medical school and see many things that make it so they learn a great deal. At the same time I do like to look into things myself. I'm not one that likes to take medications that have side effects and care a great deal about knowing what I'm dealing with medically.
-1	I don't trust doctors because I think they put a band-aid on the problem instead of solution trying to fix the problem. For example, doctors over-prescribing opioids to relieve pain.  
1	I have rarely had a bad experience with a doctor.  Also, I don't have much choice.  What else would i do?
1	She is very sincere and caring. She is very knowledgeable and sensible. I feel like she does this job because she genuine enjoys taking care of people and she is very good at it
-1	He's just a regular doctor, maybe he's trying to sell me something for all I know. That's what some doctors do a lot.
-1	I am generally trusting of doctors but I do like to do some research on my own as well -- forewarned is forearmed.
-1	Haven't had all that many interactions with primary care doctors but they're usually rushed and seem more about getting through the interaction than anything else. Jaded, too.
-1	I dont really have much of an option to not trust my doctor. If i didn't trust my doctor, then i need to find one that i can. Besides that, i feel that they are the expert in their field just as i am an expert in my field. They should know what they are talking about and if they dont, they should either tell me they dont, or find someone that does.
-1	I haven't seen my primary care doctor all that often and usually when I do it's for pretty straight for things such as a broken arm or a physical. In other words, it's hard for me to quantify my trust in my doctor because I've never been put in a situation where trust can be questioned.
1	My family has used our primary care doctor for many years and he has always done a great job in treating us.  He has never given us any reason to feel like he doesn't have our best care as a priority and for that we have complete faith and trust in him.  He's never done us wrong.
-1	I think that most doctors are very trustworthy and careful about there jobs and recommendations.  There are always people that might not care about their jobs as much in any area of business.
-1	Nobody knows me or my body better than me. No degree or amount of years in school can make anybody the person who knows me better.
-1	i don't trust anyone fully but that doesn't mean i automatically distrust them either..........................
-1	I trust some doctors, but I also think that it's more about making money.                                    
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has good advice and he follows up with me when I take my prescriptions.
1	My doctor has been my doctor for 16 years and he has never told me wrong. I feel as if he cares about me. 
-1	Doctors are in the business of making money like everyone else. Sometimes, you'll get one that is more interested in the bottom line than in actually treating a patient. 
-1	I trust my health care provider to keep me looking and feeling healthy and give me great advice on my body and what I can do to improve 
1	My trust my physician because I just do. They know what they're doing and I've been going to the physician ever since I was a child so there's no distrust with my physican
-1	You can never trust a doctor 100%. Most times they given you medicine you don't need or sometimes they can Ms diagnose you
-1	I trust my primary physician because she has never given me reason not to. She is attentive and always helps me feel better than when I arrived
-1	My relationship with my doctor has really changed over the 15 years I have been going to him.  When I started seeing him he was a family practitioner and I trusted him a lot more.  Now he wants to specialize in geriatric medicine and he doesn't really seem interested in my primary care needs.  I am in the process of finding a new doctor but I haven't found one yet.
-1	They are always looking out for my health and making sure everything is good and I don't have any problems at all
-1	I don't have a primary care physician at the moment, but if/when I get one, I'll judge him based on his expertise, reputation, my own knowledge and judgment and first impressions.
-1	Sometimes it seems like doctors are mechanics, trumping up small issues to make you spend countless money. 
1	I have been treating with my doctor for more than 10 years. Everything he tells me or recommends has helped my overall health.
-1	In trust my physician for the most part, and I say that because although he is a doctor or what not, he does not have all of the answers I may be seeking about a certain condition of how I am feeling.
1	My doctor is from The Republic of Moldova.  She went to medical school in Russia.  Now she is in America and has a Natureopath license.  She restored my hearing in my right ear using lasers and ozonated tea tree oil/olive oil.  Now she is helping me to clear my lymphathic system.
-1	I trust them because they are usually accurate that's why. And they will or will not give you the medical attention you need
1	I trust my doctor because i have been going to him for awhile. He takes the tine to listen to my problems and to answer any questions i may have. 
1	I trust my doctor because I know they aren't going to tell me wrong they have a phd so I know they Aren't going to tell me wrong 
-1	Doctors Care more about getting paid then helping or getting to the next patient most doctors don't do all that they know they can do for you 
1	My primary care physician is very thorough and makes sure to have adequate communication with me, I normally feel confident in what they are saying
1	I trust her because when I feel something is wrong she always advise me to get it checkes out. I really have a good rapport with my doctor.
-1	in general, I prefer to do my own research. Doctors are only humans and can make mistakes and be miseducated just as anybody else could. I wouldn't feel comfortable relying on anybody for anything frankly.
-1	Well, I just started to see this new doctor so right now, I have given her all of my old medical records and she was able to get me back on my medications. 
1	I totally trust my primary care Doctors, When I visit my primary care doctors I ask them questions they reply with open and honest answer, if any other further actions are needed they provide other options 
1	I will always trust her because she helps me manage my diabetes so well and she keeps me from ending up in the emergency room by helping me keep my blood sugars under control
-1	He often has a lot of patients to care for so they overlook things they may be a big deal to us. One time I went to the doctor because I had a runny nose all the time and he gave me one look and told me that it was a sinus infection. I think it was something else 
1	most doctors for the most part tell you up front what your health is like but it is up to the induvial to listen to the doctor and door what is needed to improve there health
1	Well he is a doctor who was trained in those sorts of things. So it's in my nature to trust someone who knows what they are doing. 
-1	I trust the doctors but as any humans , they are imperfect. As a result i took his advice with some degree of caution and sometimes ask a second opinion with another doctor
-1	First of all my doctor now I worked it worked with her at another facility Abely should be honest with me and telling me the truth regarding what the results are I feel that I can trust her whole heart
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is on top of my physical well being. Appointments test, and check ups are regularly scheduled on a ongoing basis.
-1	I trust that my primary care physician is providing me with all of the information that I need in order to get proper care for my health condition. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is open honest by telling me both the good and the bad in all thongs we discuss about my health. 
-1	I distrust in in part because I feel that he is looking out for the facility rather than for the patient. It takes longer to get the real test that you need, because they want the doctors to try other things first.
-1	I am not the type of person that ever completely trust someone. Doctors are humans as well. They view things with the common eye and have to give prognosis. There are a lot of conditions that exist so I will always second guess what I'm being told.
1	I trust my primary care physician because because she is imformative when it comes to my over all health,because i can tell she cares about her patients and she makes sure i follow up on everthing i have to do to stay healthy, she explains in full details about my meds, easy to talk to thats why i trust her as my primary care physician
1	I trust my Doctor because he take the time to break down all the things I need to do to maintain my health fairly well considering all my illnesses. 
1	My doctor has been in the  family for over ten years we have a good relationship and i trust him and all his associates
-1	I don't have much to say. Doctors get the job done. Insurance should be free. Healthcare shouldn't be a privilege. 
-1	i think i trust them because they know alot about me and they are they to keep me safe.Without we wouldnt know what is wrong with us and how to keep up with our body
-1	I have a longtime relationship with my physician, she is caring, answers all my questions, spend a good amount of time addressing my concerns, although very busy she is thorough.
-1	McCoy costs classic dO didn't call drops Church's a shift discuss does Alex flex for Eric Alex emits ask us will mark hasn't DJs Emma anonymous donor I am so happy to hear that you are 3
-1	I trust my doctor but then I don't because I don't feel like they are giving me all the help I need at times but then again they do help at least keep me going in life with all my medical problems that I have right now but I feel like there is more they could do to help me so that's why I don't kinda trust them it's like they are just rushing through  patients at time to get over work and not actually looking to really help
1	I trust my primary care physician because they only can give you test results and treat you for the problem, and if you don't trust them you can get a second opinion,
-1	I have trust in my primary physician to a degree because no doctor deserves total trust. You know your body and sometimes you have to go with your own gut feeling.
1	I have been with my doctor for 14 years. We have develop a relationship of honesty and trust on both sides. I 100%, totally trust my doctor.
-1	I trust them because I've been going to them for years and no everything about me that I have been struggling
-1	i trust him because i depend on him to tell me all the right things and to diagnosed me right so i can get the proper treatment
1	My Physician is very open and forth coming.  He tells you everything and explains things to me. I have never had any reason not to trust him
1	To me no matter what position a person holds it be wise to weigh the trust and distrust. It depends on if I've known my doctor for more than a year to genuinely trust her.
1	MY DOCTOR IS ALL OF THE ABOVE. I HAVE A NICE RE PORE WITH MY DOCTOR AND THE STAFF, WHERE HIS OFFICE IS LOCATED!!
1	She always listens to my questions and concerns without making me sound totally ignorant or a bother to her
-1	in most cases my doctor has my best interest in mind, but there are times I think she group  all of her patient all together instead of going indept
1	Doctor hasn't done anything or given me a reason not to trust him. He is genuinely concerned about my health. He makes sure I know every aspect of what is going on and how to make things better if need be. 
-1	I have a new doctor. So I have to see how I can work well with them. I need to communicate with her carefully to get the information and help that I am in need of.
-1	I find in hard to trust doctors because a lot of people become doctors for the wrong reason instead of becoming one to help people they become doctors because it's a high paying job.
-1	I'm very middle of the road on this because of my own personal experiences. Ive never been mislead by a doctor but I do know people who believe they have, including close family members. So as with anything involving humans I don't completely put my faith in it.
-1	I have been prescribed medication for an incorrect diagnosis that I must take the rest of my life.  Recently prescribed medication for a wrong diagnosis based on the advice of a doctor misreading the result of a test.  
-1	I kinda don't trust my eye care professional doctor that much. He never told me the side effects of my medicine or even my condition to what was wrong with my eye. He seems to only care if he gets paid. He sometimes seems rude also. Having me wait when he is doing absolutely nothing and conversing with nurses about nonsense when everyone besides him has a schedule.
-1	I have been with her for years she allows me to feel comfortable discussing my problems and tries to give solutions by referring me to specialists 
-1	My doctor has sent me home with prescriptions for a cold when I was bent over in stomach pain. I went to the ER and the prescriptions she sent me could have made my stomach (gastritis) even worse. She even referred me to a surgeon who has been responsible for the death of a patient, so no I don't trust her one bit and I will never go back to her
1	I trust my doctor, since I've been seeing her for over a decade but I am always aware that certain medications are pushed on patients with incentives to the doctor and their office. I trust her bust only after researching side effects and alternatives on my own.

-1	i would not say i trust her because sometimes for correct diagnosis of the problem a series of examinations are involved eg.scanning and some may not be correct
1	I havery had my primary care physician for a very long time , and each time I consuled him I always feel great.  Also, his reputation and experience so far speaks well for him.

-1	I trust that my physician because I feel like they have my best interest at heart and would guide me in the best direction for my health
-1	I plan on changing my doctor. He is very arrogant and uncaring. He never listens to me and when he does it's with an nonchalant attitude. For these reasons I do not trust his diagnosis or treatments unless I receive a second opinion.
-1	I trust my doctor because i make her career. If she is carless and overlooks something it could destroy her. Without me she wouldnt have a career. I would she spend so musch time and money on a career that she didnt care about.
-1	My doctor has always been honest with me and had my best interest at heart.  Se has never recommended anything or any tests that were not necessary
1	I trust my doctor because I feel they are giving me the best medical care they can provide. I feel my doctor is always right.
-1	I do not have a personal opinion on how trustworthy my primary is. I assume if they would like to continue in their profession, then they will obviously be trustworthy. Then again this is America haha
-1	He is very true and I never had a misunderstanding and understand my needs and wants.Always diagnosis me right
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for about 10 years now, I have full and complete trust in him.  He is very proactive with my health and he does not always recommend using medicine.  
-1	I can trust and distrust a doctor depends on the what they say to you when you ask them a question that concern your health in a long run 
-1	Because they know what's best for you . They know the right spot or place for you. They provide the best for you . They care for you .
1	Track record. I've never had an issue with my doctors of the past ten years. They give the best insight too 
1	I trust my doctor because she has years of experience. I also trust her because so far she has been correct and gave me great consul.

1	I trust my doctor because he has taken great care of me in past meetings. My doctor connects with me on a personal/relatable level, which is a great quality to have. 
-1	I don't trust any doctor. Many receive incentives from pharmaceutical companies so they have a vested interest.

-1	I always trust my physician I trust hospital committee they know what fits my needs and take care of me with good customer service 
-1	You  can't  put  trust  in  anybody  to  a certain  point  ,  you  can  weigh  the  many  options  out,  but  you have  to make the  best  choice   for  you
-1	I do not trust physicians in general because I believe that they are mostly out to make money and keep people on drugs. 
-1	Physicians are trustworthy. But you know that it's understandablec on why some people aren't trusting of physicians. 
-1	I feel that doctors in general do what is best for their bottom line rather than what's best for their patients.
-1	I feel they do the best they can.  There is always a standard to what you need to do when looking to speak with a doctor. 
-1	I always trusted my doctor because they always know how my health is at good level when they check it and that's why I always like my doctor.
-1	I think they follow a book of rules and aren't open to new ideas and some only care about the money so they just want to give you more drugs to more side affects
-1	I feel like some doctors are only concerned about getting paid. They don't always look out for their patients' well being. Some doctors also get perks from prescribing certain medicines to their patients. 
-1	The reasons why I trust my primary car physician is based on Previous experiences of this current and previous encounters with the medical field. 
-1	I have many doctors and some I agree some I feel try's real hard some I feel is in it for the money and one I feel knows me for she sees herself in me
-1	My primary care physician is quick to prescribe medication and has often overlooked diagnoses when reviewing my records. She schedules appointments 15 minutes apart and then rushes you during your visit. 
-1	Doctors always try to rush, don't actually make sure you're all the way okay until you come in with a disease, and go to what they tell others when telling you how something happened and dismiss your actual lifestyle.
-1	I dont distrust my doctor i just always keep in the back.of my head that my doctor is only human and can make mistakes
1	He has always been very thorough and attentive as well as honest. He takes his time during my appointments and always follows up with me about my test results.
-1	My doctor actually takes the time to see me and know my history. They ask me questions to better understand my concerns. 
-1	I don't think my doctor really takes the time to know what is going on with me. She just pushes prescriptions
1	I trust my doctor because he is always aware of my health and indicates the appropriate treatment for improvement. I always do what the doctor tells me. If at any moment that I need it, do not attend to me I look for another doctor with similar aptitude of my personal doctor.
-1	I think my doctor schedules more patients than she should which causes appointment times with the doctor to be rushed and short and not enough information is given to me or options discussed
1	I trust my doctor because he has knowledge that I don't have concerning my health issues. I trust my doctor because she went to school to study about health issues that effect us.
1	My doctor is a great physician who cares for me, talks to me and always puts my health as a top priority. He asks questions, let's me talk and dialogues with me about any concern that either he or I have. 
1	they are professional doctor have been to a college and know about the human. theyexpience on a regular basic. bt we know for a fact that god know the human body than we do. men dont have knowledge all knowledge from our creator and our lord jesus christ
-1	I don't distrust doctors I'm an optimist and.like to.loom at the bright side of things . knowing that they are given the knowledge to perform their job
1	My doctor gives me all the correct information. The right diagnosis if needed. The correct medicine. I can ask questions and get the correct information. My doctor can be trusted she is a 5 star rating. My doctor is very good at giving information when needed. My doctor is reliable and friendly. 
-1	My doctor spends a lot of time with each and every one of her patients. She takes time to get to know them and socialize with them and to explain options and treatments 
-1	I generally have a trust but I am suspicious in nature so I research what is told or I ask a second opinion if I feel the wrong information is given. I have only had this doctor for a month so trust is not absolutely at this time.
1	My doctor is trustworthy and has helped me with many issues with my health. I feel very comfortable speaking openly to my doctor when it comes to any new health concerns. 
-1	I trust my doctor because we communicate effectively with each other. If we don't communicate what is going on or on all the different treatments available than I would not have as much trust as I do today.
-1	They just leave me alone for hours then they get mad when you ask questions . They get angry and rush you out.
1	I trust doctors because they are helpful and reliable in helping patient treat thaie ailment and diseases.
1	My PCP is thorough, honest, and caring. She makes sure is accurately and completely explains everything. 
1	I have had the swam PCP for nine years and I always feel like she pays attention to my symptoms if I have any and normally takes what I say seriously. She is very attentive, and caring. My entire family sees her and she is the same way with each one of them. 
-1	I semi-trusted my old doctor, because she is well known. I live in a small town, she is bascally everyone's doctor including my mother. I currently do not have insurance so I haven't used her as my doctor for yrs now, but I would use her again. 
1	I trust my physician because he has a degree and knows better than me what i need to do to be healthy. I trust that the information he gives me is accurate. i trust him also because he answers any questions i have and explains whenever needed.
-1	I don't trust anybody & thats basically it. I have had enough terrible experiences in the past with people on a whole. Everybody is all for themselves nowadays & they will only treat you nice because it is their job & they are getting paid for it. Majority of the time i think thats what it is. I do believe there are a few that actually care though but they are scarce.
1	I would only choose a doctor if I believed in them and what they stood for and whether they were competent enough to take care of me the way I should be taken care of. If I get a hint of a wrong feeling about a physician I will definitely not use them
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because of the way that talk to me and ask me if I understand what I need to do and if I am satisfied about the results of my health. 
-1	I do not really trust or distruct my primary care physician because they can only be in it for the money
1	My doctor talks to me more than he examines me and looks at test results.  He explains absolutely everything; even with pictures when I don't understand.  He insists that any problems I experience are related to my lifestyle.  He keeps  me on a low fat diet, limited alcohol, and a regular sleep schedule.  The only medication he gives me is for my eczema and sleeping pills that I should only take occasionally.  I'm instructed to return to him if I need to take the sleeping pills more than occasionally.  He gave me a nighttime routine that should help me get to sleep.  Long conversations and reviewing my blood pressure history, he discovered that my blood pressure is up only when I don't get enough sleep; so rather than blood pressure medication he wants me to get enough sleep.  
1	Some things i can trust about physicians but mostly not everything is to be believed. Doctors give u things to suppress ilnesses but not get rid of it. Its all about keeping us sick. So no I dont trust doctors. I trust in the Lord Jesus Christ only! God of Abraham, Isaac and Joseph.
-1	I've only been with this doctor a little over a year, she seems pretty good and She had me believing that she knew what she was talking about
-1	I really have no distrust at all. At the end of the day it's still a job. They are helping everybody so you can't care for everybody just find a solution to their problem and on to the next one.
-1	I trust my doctor because she has never made any decision that have harmed me. They have all been for the best. 
-1	I do not have insurance and cannot afford a Primary care physician. I do not trust physcians because they have too many patients to provide me special attention
-1	I trust my primary doctor because he takes the time out to talk to and get to know each patient and ask questions that you can't answer with yes or no
-1	my doctor is the best. he explains everything, I am never afraid to ask questions and he is kind. He listens and explains every detail.
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part because gives complete exam and extra test if needed to make I am not experiencing any other health problems
-1	I don't trust nor distrust my primary care physician because they are simply there to do a job and I'm a customer of their service. Nothing more, nothing less.
-1	I trust my physician because she always looks at me when communicating and she always asks questions about how I'm feeling.  I feel that she gives me a sense of trust and I could tell her anything.  She is a very thorough and caring physician. 
1	I feel like since my doctors have gone to medical school, they're no dummies. I have a good report with my doctors to where they give me the good and the bad. 
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. This is mainly because I have a long history with this doctor. I also go by my gut feeling that he puts the patient first and not himself. He shows his passion in his job and does not mope around the clinic. To me, that means it's not all about the compensation. Anytime I had an ailment, he knew right away what prescriptions and directions to give me, and they all worked. I also trust my doctor because he gives off a calm and reassuring vibe. If I had to choose among doctors, he would always be my pick. 
1	I trust my primary care physician. She takes time to diagnose my health problems and allots enough time to answer my questions.
1	He cares about people he believes in give goid care for people going be on to help people when they dont have health insurance 
1	My primary care physician has been for the most part right on the money in making diagnoses. I trust my doctor with injections and diagnostic tests which have never caused me any harm.
1	My primary physician is extremely thorough. When I go in for office visits I feel like I am the only patient seen that day. The doctor constantly ask if I have any other questions or concerns and takes time to answer me
-1	i feel my dr has my best interest at heart. Everything is always explained to me. I feel as if my dr really cares about my well being.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he explains to me exactly what is going on and gives me his best medical advice 
-1	Although I may respect and trust my doctor's opinion, I also have into account the limited amount of time he has with me, and the fact that I am an individual and not everything will work the same for everyone. While he has the ability to be medically informed, I know my own body and sometimes doctor fail to listen to their patients. I make independent inquiries and do my own research about medications prescribed and won't hesitate to stop taking a medication that is giving me undesirable effects/reactions.
1	I have been going to my primary doctor for almost 20 years. I have been fairly healthy all this time and has been good with recommendations when i have had health issues.
-1	I trust my doctor because he cares about my health and needs hes very patient and understanding he keeps me informed
1	I trust my primary care physician because they have never gave me any false information about my medical issues and health information 
1	The reasons why I trust and distrust them a little because health care for profit can get in the way
-1	doctors are human and make mistakes. they are capable of misdiagnosing conditions, prescribing the wrong medicaions. they use staff that overbook patients so that you don't see a doctor. they over prescribe medications ,they push samples that you don't want to try because big pharma gives them perks for doing this practice whether the medication is right for you or not.
-1	Sometimes doctors aren't always honest with you. Even when something as simple as a cold they can give you medicine that's not necessary. Some doctors do actually have the time to make sure you are fine with what they are giving you to help you heal
-1	Overall I do trust what the medical provider says is true and reflects the best course of treatment needed.  \Than on the other hand I do think that because of insurance cost that some treatment options are delayed or not mentioned at all to cut cost.
-1	Idk you can't always trust somebody anyone could be lying no matter who the person you will never know what they are thinking in their head
1	i really trust my primary care physician because i have been having them for a while and they always let me know everything and keep me updated as well with everythiing that i need to know
1	myself and my doctor have developed a great relationship and I trust him. until he gave me information to believe otherwise i will continue to trust him.
-1	I trust my doctor because he gives me options. He also tells me I don't have to do anything I don't want. So with that being said I really trust my doctor. Alot of doctors just tells you what needs to be done so they can collect the pay and mobe right on to the next patient.  My doctor takes his time and make sure I'm comfortable with the decision that I come up with or he tell me how much time I have to decide on decision. 
1	I trust my doctor because they are well studied in the medical field for treating me and providing prescriptions.They have a lot at risk if they don't provide the right information.
-1	I am more apt to trust a doctor willing to listen and entertain my ideas as well. I don't want a doctor willing to take the first shortcut because that is what suits them.
1	I have been going to my doctor for the last 20 years and I completely trust her, she is reliable and trustworthy 
1	I have been with my primary care doctor for a number of year and he has provided excellent care.  He is not quick to to put me on drugs.  Uses other alternative prior to using drugs to remedy ailments.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with her for years. She always genuinely cares for me.
-1	I feel they can be trusted most of the time, if not I can at least get an insightful opinion on something. Besides not being helpful could cost them their job. 
-1	I understand that doctors go to school and years of experience but sometimes they can still be wrong. So I do not put my trust in doctors but I put my trust in God.
-1	Do you think that money I good pick up your cross an well across the room n npoop onstick help help help help me an fin movie and some underwear and rock a little and an an an MD. Dmdjfked f em fmrdmdo
1	I have been knowing him for awhile. He has a very great understanding of everything medical, and he has a great bedside manner. 
-1	honestly I believe that most doctors are only in it for the money and only in it for their own interests
1	I trust my doctor because he has been in my life since I was a baby. He's been a family doctor to my family for years and we all love him as if he is apart of our family. 
-1	It seems that doctors rarely truly listen. They think they know everything and they should never be second guessed even though the field of medicine is still growing and learning and the physician didn't seem like they listened in the first place (but they know). Usually whenever I have a question they never answer it satisfactorily and without taking any tests and/or additional tests (for questions about my health that would require additional tests that no physician would know otherwise).
-1	I trust my doctor because my doctor hasn't given me reason not to. She answers any and all questions that I have.
1	i do trust my doctor i have to hope he is giveing me  all right answers .you never whant to fell he's not
1	I have been going to him for a while now. I Google him & looked at reviews on him. All reviews were excellent on him. 
-1	So far I haven't had any problems with my care physician.  But I don't someone's word without getting a second opinion. 
1	I trust my physician because she seems very sincere when were are discussing my health. She listens and does not make me feel like I am paranoid. 
1	My care has been extensive, satisfactory, informative and tailored to my and my health conditions thus far.  My doctors make sure I have all I need my medicine, information, care, treatment, tests, annual care.
-1	I feel that my doctor does all that he can with my health care, I just don't completely trust any of them.
-1	I have had a personal, plus three familial situations in which--two if the times, two different family members almost died because if a lack if thoroughness and misdiagnoses. I myself was mid handled during a very high risk pregnancy. Each of these times, I mystery of, was forced to tell the doctors what I felt should be considered it done. I must add, that all three if these instances did not take place at my preferred hospital, UVA, where I wish all three of us would have been treated.
-1	I feel that yes my doctor may be giving me the best knowledge about my health to the best of her ability, but she is not God who is the ultimate physician. So therefore I can't trust her word.
-1	I feel like sometimes my doctor does things that i don't like and I wish they would come to me and go over it with me more.
1	I always trust my doctor unless I have a gut feeling that's something is really wrong with me then I will go get a second doctor to look at me
1	My doctor is patient and takes his time when I have an appointment. He makes me feel valued and never makes me feel embarassed regardless if my concern is minor. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is trustworthy. I've never been giving a reason not to trust her. I don't like going to the doctor that often tho but I trust her
-1	Cool ok yeah I like it a lot it cool fun interest nice storm rainy day cloudy in the sky winter day on the snow of the ocean barn b in the frogs one get rich and horse in the deerr
1	I trust my doctor because they had my best interest and heart and always has been honest with me. My has been truthful with me from days one.

1	I can talk and ask her anything and I feel confident that everything we discuss stays between the two of us
-1	I trust my doctor because they know more about medical things than me and if i knew what was wrong and how to fix it i wouldnt need a doctor.
1	He been my doctor for 15 years.  I trust him. We know either very well, he explains  everything so I can understand it without question. 
1	I've been with my doctor for so long I just trust her word and care and believe she would give me the best options
1	There are numerous reasons why I trust my primary care physician. The main reason why I trust my doctor is because she's always been looking out for me. She's never stood me wrong or gave me a bad vibe. 
1	My doctor ð¨ââï¸ is totally awesome ð and she knows me like the back of her hand ð¤ she is dependable 
1	I trust my doctor because he gives me through advice and he knows what he is talking about. Another reason that I trust my doctor is because he genuinely cares about you and your well-being.
-1	I trust my doctor because of the signs and the symptoms I be having but distrust when it comes to some medications I'm supposed to be taking with harmful side effects
-1	Doctors only care about paying off their student loans and when that is done getting as much money as they can to justify suffering through all that crap in their twenties. Nowadays all of the caring, bedside manner, and respect I have gotten comes from nurses. You barely see your doctor when you are hospitalized and when my mom was dying, it was the nurses who called to tell me, who sat with me after she died and helped me. The only thing the doctor on call did was pronounce her dead and run out of the door.
1	I have been using him for years and trust his opinion. He is a very smart doctor and gives personal care.
-1	I trust my doctor but I always research the decision, the medicine and or treatment plans myself. In addition, I read my bodies feelings.
-1	I have been hospitalized recently and no one was telling me anything except I had to stay in the hospital.  I had four specialist and none could tell me why.
1	The doctors I've gone to are usually right. They've never given any reason for me to not trust them, and they've always been honest with me, even if I didn't want to hear it.
-1	my primary care physician  is honest can do the things that i asked for them to do also trustworthy with me.
1	he told me exactly what was going on with me even though it might frighten me some he explained in detail why this is happening and some things I should and should not do . he explained what off symtoms to watch out for
1	I trust ny doctor to a certain extent, where I am comfortable  with my doctor and can tell if they are telling me bull and if they real care about my health and want to provide the info I need to keep my self in great health.
1	My doctor has taken great care of me for years. Anytime something is wrong I get just the care I need.
1	I just my doctor because he had been my doctor for years. I have never had a bad experience. He has been very honest with me on everything.
-1	They know what they are doing and how to make things better. It's helpfully to know what's going on in your body
-1	doctors are usually trustworthy because they are worried of lawsuits of being disbarred.  most are good at their jobs also
1	Doctors knows best. They are to be trusted at all times. Doctors knows the human body and knows what to provide 
1	She's always explained to me whatever she's doing in my treatment, and she's never given me any reason not to trust her
1	I have a long and trusting relationship with my doctor, who treats me with respect and factors in my demographics regarding decisions. She is thorough and caring and knowledgeable. We make decisions jointly as partners, with my doctor supplying all the technical information for me to make informed decisions. 
-1	From past experience I have time is more important to doctors than a thorough check up. They d do a quick and tell you to come back if your health doesn't improve
-1	I don't know if physicians as a group necessarily know or care about giving their patients the best care.
-1	Doctors cut corners. I know because I am one, and I have done so. So I wouldn't be surprised if my physician made mistakes because of that. 
1	I trust my doctor because he was there when I was born and is very trusted by my parents. He has taken good care of my siblings and is very kind. 
-1	Some doctor's are in it for the money and some doctors really do care. I believe insurance has a lot to do with it to.  I feel doctors, don't like dealing with uncovered patients.  I believe if we had universal insurance, Doctor's would be more understanding, if there wasn't a price tag attached to every person.  If every Doctor could look at every person, the same, and treat each person accordingly healthcare would be in a better light. I think the health care field needs to have guidelines securely in place pertaining to ethic's and morals.  I think it would make a great differences.
-1	I trust God that is because they're always right you need to tell me was glad to do it myself that I just asked
-1	Cool place travel Work plies greatest fits more money more problem  can I can cool sweet just trust ruggr treat
1	Very competent. Annual physicals are conversational regarding my overall health. This includes my physical assessment, lifestyle, diet, exercise, etc.
-1	Because a doctor can tell you that have one diagnosis and it be the total opposite to what you really have. Fix the symptoms not the diagnosis
1	I trus' my physicians because I'm convinced that he is there for his patience. He has good bedside manner and has been in business a long time
-1	I trust him as he studied medicine and knows better in that aspect but on the other hand when it comes to prescribing medicine I feel like doctors have the pressure to use certain medicine
-1	Physicians seem to task the easiest route when it comes to providing healthcare. They come in issue a diagnosis and return back to their lives.
-1	I trust Doctors to a certain degree they are trained to give you medication for a problem but I prefer to take natural methods and lean on my beliefs.
-1	I think he does what's best for me, but then he refers me to other who just want to make money off of me
1	I trust me Doctor because she's good listener and try to do the best to help. i dont know much to say about my doctor. But a Doctor who is supportive and very careful about the medication for me to take by providing me with important details such as side affects and how many times daily and Other important ways to be treated. Also asking me about my understanding and any questions so that I can better understand and Explain my concerns regarding my health. Giving me Important places to go for test results. The doctor also follow ups and calls to check up on how I'm comipatients this type of the Doxtor is caring.Doctors are suppose to be very caring about their patients by doing everything as possible to find Answers to theur patients concerns. The Doctor gives pspers and Highlight important Information. The doctor doesnt take long to receive the patient but is always on time to receive the patient. The Doctor is also a serious and hardworking Doctor but also fun and humorous to give the patient like me a Excellent experience with the doctor visit. I am very well pleased with my doctor and am always in good expectation. The Doctor have a clear understanding of every patient and do the best to give excellent satisfaction. 
1	They take good Care of they patients to put there needs before there own kids and be honest instead of leading a long day talking about you

-1	I trust my doctor, but realize there is only one miracle worker. She does tend to prescribe medications freely, and I don't agree with taking a pill for everything.  She knows when I will not take certain medicines and why.  Leaves the door open if not 100% needed.

1	My doctor spends quite a bit of time per appointment assessing my needs through discussion.  Generally, appointments take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour due to conversation and examination.  He is very good about about collecting and assessing information from visit to visit because he keeps great notes.
-1	Most doctors have a good chance to be able for the rest and a few years back I had a good time with the idea of a new person who is a member of the team. 
1	I trust my physician because since the first time I met her, she's been very welcoming and always willing to listen to my needs and concerns with nonnegative judgment but with respect and understanding. She respectfully and professionally gives me advice with options and helps me to understand prior to make it decisions.

1	I trust that a doctor will work in the best interest of all his patients... That would be a main concern for me because everybody wants to maintain good health treatment for themselves...  
-1	Primary care is ok but I don't trust OB/GYNs. I had to switch twice at the end of my last pregnancy and was delivered by a midwife. The first OB/GYN was trying to force me to have a c-section for no reason, the second didn't support unmedicated birth and my chiropractor implored me to change to a midwife because she specializes in pregnancy and found that her patients had more success with midwives for unmedicated birth. I also had a doula and the birth was still tense due to the overbearing OBs in the practice, who almost forced me to have a c-section as well. Thankfully my doula was there to fight for me to get the birth I wanted. 
1	HE IS THE ONE THAT GOT THE DEGREE AND HE KNOW MORE ABOUT MY PROBLEM THAN I DO SO I TRYTO  KEEP ALL OF MY DOCTOR APPOINTMENT  WITH MY DICTOR.
1	the dr i have i had for years and so far hasn't given me a problem, had 3 different operations and no problems, to me even with the recommendation of a specialist, had no problems

1	She is very thorough. She's always trying to look for the deeper meaning of things in every visit. That's why I trust her.
1	Because I have been with him awhile and I would say health wise he knows everything about my health to make a good decisions about  my over all health
-1	My primary care physician is good and better than most.  I believe that, in general doctors have become salesmen.  They are very quick to prescribe medication and refer patients to doctors to patients who refer patients to them.  I do not feel that anyone should completely that in these days of greed and avarice, no one should blindly entrust his/her healthcare to another human being.
-1	I have complete distrust for doctors in general. Some things are not thoroughly explained to where I can understand what options I have in regards to making the right decision for my health. My former OBGYN sped through his answers every time I asked him a question. It's like a didn't have time to think or make a decision. I was trying to decide what my best option is for birth control and at the end of the day I ended up not making a decision. I was so upset with my whole visit with the doctor in general that I have to choose another OBGYN. I was actually referred to the former OB. I waited like 30 mins to see the doctor and when I finally seen the doctor the visit was like 5 seconds. I had some questions and concerns and he just breezed over his answers 
1	"My primary care physician believes in preventive medicine. If there is a potential problem with any health issues, she will address them and not say, "" Let's wait and see if things will get better."
-1	I believe in no man 100%. They make mistakes just as I do and I can't see looking to someone else to validate me.

1	I trust my PCP because of his past experience and the care that he has provided for my family throughout the years.
-1	I've seen them multiple times and they have been kind and straight forward each visit. There have been other times where a doctor has made snide remarks about something u weight for example) and I couldn't wait to get out of there.
-1	They know more than me with their experience in the medical and health field. They are more experience than me because they have taken the the class for the class. They are very helpful
-1	I personally trust my physician, however I do not trust most physicians in general initially. There are so many different outlets these days urging us to try different medicines, it's hard to know who to trust. 
-1	I believe that doctors sometimes have your best interest at heart and they take the hypocratic oath, however they also have a living to make. They go to school for several years and are sometimes in immense debt, so their personal interests may cloud their judgment sometimes

-1	My doctor gave me information pamphlet about my knee, having slight pain in left knee she suggested going to physical therapy which helped me tremendously 
-1	I primarily trust my primary care physician because I have made a relationship with my doctor. In most cases if I feel uncomfortable or disagree with his treatment I can speak my mind with out ridicule. If my doctor is unsure he will ask a more experienced doctor for their medical opinion which shows he cares and is not scared to show he may not know the most about everything wrong with me. 
-1	Sometimes I can't trust them because I'm thinking they are not being honest what's going on and then sometimes u can believe them it just depends on what doctor you go to

-1	I have nothing to say. I like my doctor. They help me more than not. I really don't have much more to say about it.

-1	I think most doctors these days are just looking to make cash from prescriptions more than really caring and treating their patients. It seems all they can offer are pills or nothing. What seem like common sense solutions are ignored in favor of drugs an constant treatment. Several lifestyle diseases, like most cases of diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol can be treated with lifestyle changes. Dangerous drugs with tons of side effects is not the best way. But how often do you hear a doctor just suggest diet changes and more exercise? Rarely, since those solutions don't make money.

-1	My Dr is an intelligent female. She listens to me & takes my opinions into consideration. I trust her judgement. 
-1	Because some doctors just don't care about me as a person. For a lot of reason that I know of. And they just don't like me because they think I'm a bad person. But they are wrong. Because I'm as good as I can be.

-1	Needed meds for migraines and my doc explained all meds that I could take and the pros and cons of all of them. 
1	Me and my doctor have a 20yrs relationship he new me when I was well and new me when I was sick. So keeping me healthy has been a mission between us. Information he's giving have been good advice so when he  say I need a certain  test I accept with  confidence  we work together to keep my healthcare affordable and efficient. I get my flu shot every year and have saved money for over the counter cold medicine. I my pneumonia shots to stay out of the emergency room. Now my medical records are digital so I don't have repeated test all to keep cost down doing my part to achieve affordable health care.

1	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him. He is very in tune with my medical history. His staff really compliment him as well.
-1	I don't specifically have a primary care doctor. I trust that there are some doctors that can be completely trusted to help you make the right choices. Seeing malpractices and other missed illnesses in my family, I can see how it's easy to distrust some doctors.
-1	Some of the things my doctor tells me aren't true. First of all, everyone knows that medicine is not good for you and second of all, she should be more observing. ð

-1	Because they went to school and studied hard to be what they are, and they are required to know what they are doing
1	I have been going to my primary care doctor a long time and usually what she recommends turns out to be very helpful.
1	My doctor has been very good these past three years in helping with my health issues. I received referrals to help with two issues. My doctor prescribed medicine for my needs. My doctor also stressed the urgency of taking my medicine.
-1	I think many physicians are conditioned to think and behave a certain way, whether that stems from training or peer influence and sometimes cannot be ooen to seing beyond that field of view which can be a detriment to patient care as well as the representation of the medical field as a whole.
1	They listen well; will try various treatments starting with least to most intense. They make note of what I tell them and make adjustments accordingly.
1	The reason I trust him is because he know what I doesn't that's the reason I go is to see what's wrong with me
1	I have seen my primary physician for many years and i have established a long enough relationship with them to trust their input
1	"My doctor has been a ""lifesaver"" on several occasions for. Without him/her I don't know if I would have survived without my doctor and some divine intervention. My doctor has always answered my questions to my satisfaction and fully explained my issues. When my doctor thought that I needed a second opinion there was a quick referral."
-1	Make sure to ask questions and weight out you options your doctor can only go off of what you feel and what they see is not the only thing they can go off of treating you so make sure to be open and speak how you feel.
-1	I don't believe a lot of drs continue to study about new medicines and treatments that are available.  It is difficult to have faith in someone when that is the case.  Not only that, how do you really know you dr is a good one?
-1	I have somewhat trust in my primary care physician.  However, I've only seen him once in two years.  The process now is to see a physician assistant rather than the doctor.
-1	depends on your condition and symptoms you might have to make several visits to figure out what the problems are
-1	I think doctors sometimes rush when they have alot of patients or they have somewhere else to be other than that I do trust them and I think they like to charge your insurance for unnecessary things

-1	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is they don't sugarcoat anything and they give you the honest truth about what you should do

-1	He seems to know what he talking about when it comes to my health plus he explains it in layman terms
-1	"I don't think any doctor or physician is out to like to me or be dishonest. They wouldn't have chosen the profession if they didn't want to genuinely help people. The money is good, but the time investment is huge. Sure they may prescribe me a particular medicine to get ""kickbacks"" or something, but I feel they are fairly trustworthy."
1	I TRUST THE PCP SOMETIMES BECAUSE THEY DO BE RIGHT MOST OF THE TIME BUT NOT ALWAYS ALL THE TIME  SOMETIMES THEY ARE MISLEADING 
-1	sometimes my doctor seems to want to go with what is considered standard medical practice rather than what I am telling him about the effect of a particular treatment.  I want to continue a medication and he wants me to stop taking because I MIGHT have a bad side effect.

1	I love my primary care physician. She always give me the best options regarding me Health and if not she always have more options. 
1	...he is young, discusses his research findings & current opinions, not his personal ones, seeks my input, answers my questions and solicits options, recites what he is documenting, shares printouts w/me of what he has documented & discusses OUR plans. However, he does rely on computers more than I prefer & at times, selections within the computer are not available to address my actual concerns; for example, pain in forearm-nurse only found elbow pain in computer so entered that-PCP discussed elbow pain-redirected to discuss pain in forearm-he kept discussing elbow pain so offered options for that-I declined option for elbow pain & redirected discussion to pain in forearm to no avail, asked perhaps muscle?-ignored/dismissed/discounted? documented tennis elbow & that I declined tennis elbow splint which I did...oh well, another appointment next month to address pain in forearm, partially researched it, found muscle termed brachial-radialis (sp), more to do so am prepared for discussion on next appointment, takes a team to 'git 'er did'! Oh, pain in forearm was only one of other concerns for office visit (monthly weight loss management regime f/u, feeling of something in throat when swallowing, unlike history of swollen tonsils (US ordered), recent pain in forearm when lifting heavy objects). Thank you ~
-1	I have had a long relationship with  of my doctors. I can depend on them to answer all my questions and give me their honest opinion 
1	I have two physicians who I see.  Because I'm in good health (no major health issues) I feel quite comfortable with discussions I have regarding my maintaining my health and with regard to any issues that might effect my health.  I try to keep active and maintain a healthy lifestyle so there isn't much I would not trust them about.
1	I trust mt doctor because whatever is happening to mt health and if i am having a problem and i taln with my doctor and they tell me what is happening they would prescribe a treatment that causing the problem.
-1	I dont completely trust any doctor simply because they get paid to treat sick people and so sometimes i feel they prescribe medications to prolong symptoms or treatment in order to make more money off their patients.
-1	I don't trust primary care physicians because I don't know if they know what they prescribing to me 
-1	First of all I don't trust to many people. I have been to a doctor in about 20 years so trust has not been built at all. From what I have seen from other people their physician is only interested prescribing drug, somehow I think that get a cut somewhere down the line. I also believe the are concern but making that money is their main focus.
1	I trust my doctor because she is smart she has her degrees. She's great at explaining things to me and she really cares about my health.
-1	I trust my physician to a fault; she let's me know what I need to do, but sometimes I feel like she doesn't really get me; on the other hand, whenever I need a referral or a document that has to be sent somewhere, she never hesitates to make it happen.
1	My physician is young like I am, so I can relate to her. She is very good at remembering things that I am interested in so she can make an honest connection with me. So when I get some bad news about a medical condition, she is very thorough about making sure I understand what options I have and that I can talk to her if I need to.  
-1	I trust my doctor because she seems knowledgable and trustworthy so far. ive only been to her oncce though so we will see

-1	i trust some doctors. Not all doctors. everybody is not honest and trustworthy. Some nurses are very nice but not all

-1	I trust my medical physician in suggesting good medical treatments for me and I believe that my medical physician is capable of successfully treating any illnesses I may encounter. 
-1	 I do not completely trust my primary physician because he does not listen to me well enough. He is quick to assert his opinion and kind of ignores mine since I am less knowledgeable.
1	Complete trust in my doctors because they are truthful they explain how my medicines work and if I have any kind of questions regarding my medicine treatments I always give them a call and they always tell me how the medicine work what are the effects of the medicine

1	I have been going to my doctor for years and feel I have a good relationship with him and trust him with providing me with information to take care of myself
1	My last physician I really didn't care for her to much. She was not professional enough for me. She took to long and to get to see me but when she did see me I wasn't there long at all. Her office was to small and she constantly had drug reps there. I know that she was very busy but I think she needs to learn how to schedule her patients and not have them sitting for hours just to see her. She has a very important role and she has a very nice staff but I think her office could be ran better than that.
1	My doctor is very forth coming with information and explains my options so I can make the best decision.
1	My primary doctor always have been sincere with me, I have full confidence on him, is great in all senses actually 
-1	I think doctors are alright, but I feel hesitant with medical professionals because there are so many institutional biases such as racism, heterosexism, classism, and transphobia. I don't feel comfortable opening up to physicians about my sexuality because there is usually some judgement on their end about it. 
-1	Don't have a physician and primary care. Or doctor to trust or distrust in a general care need in general
-1	I trust her as she knows i am the kind of person who will bring an issue to her, take my meds appropriately and calls me back
-1	i trust them alot. they know what to do for me. they give me meds i need.  i like her and her practice
-1	Sometimes not everyone has your best interests in mind. Your doctor is suppose to assist you with your health but at the end of the day they still have to make money so im unsure about completely trusting them
1	I have always trusted my primary care physician, since they have always given me the means to get better when I am ill. I believe my doctor has no ill intent regarding my health, but might be more skeptical of someone who is not a doctor.
-1	I neither trust or distrust my doctor. While I know he will give me what he believes is the correct diagnosis I also believe he will recommend a drug that is more expensive than others or try to get me to go to see another doctor for the issue to get a commission. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is very careful when it comes to my treatment. I believe that if it wasnt for her quick thinking and action my premature son might not be alive today. After that pregnancy I decided to stick with her.
1	I have been going to my primary care physician for almost 10 years and have built trust with them. They always offer me advice on the best treatment for my conditions and help me monitor any possible conditions that may arise.
1	MY DOCTOR IS HIGHLY EDUCATED WITH MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE D AND HIS ADVICE HAS ALWAYS PROVEN TO BE RIGHT
-1	I trust my doctor because he is thorough and caring and asks a lot of questions and persists in a considerate manners even when I seem hesitant and uncomfortable. He is friendly and calm. 
-1	Sometimes doctors are all about what they think is best and not caring much about what the patient things. I say this from experience as with taking a medication I knew that was making me rather sick and the doctor not listening and not taking me off of the medication because he didn't feel the need to look into other options.
-1	Doctors are trustworthy due to their years of experience and training for actual situations when the time comes to be on the floor.
-1	Because of past experience I have with this doctor. I would really like to find a new doctor but haven't had a positive experience trying to find a good one.

-1	I have been in a situation before that could have been life threatening and he made a decision and did a procedure that saved my life
1	I have a good relationship with my primary care physician.  She is thoughtful, caring and provides me with all of the information I need in order to make decisions regarding my care.  We are truly partners in my health and well-being.  I trust her judgment and she knows that if I question or disagree with something she says we can discuss it in more depth and reach a mutual understanding.
1	i figure he knows what he is doing, what meds to prescribe based on the reason for visit/illness,etc.
-1	After multiple tests, a doctor decided that all my issues were a result of stress and that there was nothing they could do or suggest for me.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is honest with me even If I don't like what he is saying. He is a gentle speaker. He thinks about what he is going to say before he just says them. He also gives me options.
1	He is straight to the point,knows his business, asks questions gives feedback without a whole lot of thinking.  
-1	I know I can trust my PCP because of the time she spends with me during a visit and the questions she asks. She always listens to me and has a good answer. She and her staff follow through with what I need.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he told me things straight up and had no problem explaining anything to me and told me things other doctors probably wouldn't even mention. My doctor is very trust worthy in my eyes.
1	We have known each other for a long time and w ae a great relationship.  He is a professional and I trust him.
-1	I trust   my primary  care  doctor   to provide   my needs. They   provide   my   needs and tell  me how to take  care of   my   health   they are  concerned  about   my   health .
-1	I feel that my doctor looks out for my best interests. She gives me advice when I ask . Tells me what I need to do to feel better .
-1	all things in the end are based on the insurance you have or do not have and where you can go to get the care you need
-1	In trust that my physician will tell me every truth I need to know. Referrals are always good. There hasn't been a reason yet to not fully trust in my physician.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is upfront with me.  He also advise me to what type of medication I should take to resolve the issues that I have with my health
1	My doctor holds nothing back from me she explains all options in detail and lets me make the final decision
-1	sometimes I think doctors deliberately hide information to keep you coming back to the doctor so they can earn more money off of people
-1	my doctor is knowledgeable but good gracious they do not have time for you. They are always in a hurry, are as impersonal as possible and that creates a perfect distrust for me.
1	I trust my doctor and all doctors cause they go to school for a long long time and are very friendly and know it all when it comes to my health.
-1	It's a matter of information that is given. If you get multiple opinions and it's the same diagnosis, then it is right, but if there is disagreements then something is amiss
-1	My primary physician is a holistic doctor.  He has pulled me through some really tough situations that conventional medicine could not address.  Yes, I have complete trust in him and in his associates
-1	You can trust your doctor to tell you about your condition and what the doctor tell you about your illness
-1	all doctors are just after the money, and they are all in bed with the pharmaceutical companies vying for free trips an such. write prescriptions like its going out of style
1	My primary care physician is very much straight to the point. I only see him once a year because I am rarely sick. 
-1	I trust my doctor before I do it is good to trust your doctor because they are your doctor and t is good
-1	My primary care physician has taken an interest in my health and well being and has shown herself to be someone who has my interests in mind. She is caring and trustworthy.
-1	They are greedy, underpaid, and will do whatever it takes to make money off their patients and not really try to heal them. 
-1	I have a physician that takes the time to explain all of his decisions, I also look up his decisions on line at different sites
1	My trust in my doctor depends on which doctor I go to. For instance, I trust my general physician and gynocologist but not my dermotologist because he doesn't give me a lot of attention and seems to be in it only for the money.
1	Choosing the right doctor is often put in terms of trust. Can you trust the doctor to do the right thing? Start off with the idea that even very good doctors do the wrong things sometimes. There is so much to know. They may not know as much as someone elseâbut the good doctors will go out of their way to learn what they may not know.  And they will ask for help from other doctors. I would trust some doctors to treat some conditions out of their area of specialization more than I would trust a specialist in that field whom I knew was careless. They can be relied on to approach a medical problem carefully. I cannot describe what goes into having good clinical judgment, but it is a real thing. I am not sure exactly what quality of mind and character it involves. It is a kind of being sensible.
-1	I sometimes feel they're a bit rushed to get to the next patient, but I do feel they are listening to what I'm saying about the state of my health.
-1	Inboxd I am not a problem, I have been a long way. the only one that won't happen to know that you have a lot of people who are you a lot of people. the first to know about it, and the 
1	I typically trust that doctors know how to treat and care for whatever health condition I'm dealing with if they can pinpoint it.
1	Because I routinely ask probing questions about their opinions, medications, and treatment options. I rarely make up my mind about a Physician until I seen then on multiple occasions. Occasionally, I research their background and consult other physicians about their reputations.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. Although I might not always agree with his or her diagnosis, I have their trust and mine theirs. I would not go to a physician who I wouldn't trust. I need to feel comfortable talking about anything with my doctor. 
1	I trust my doctor to give me the right advice concerning my health and give me information on how to take better care of myself. 
-1	I have been going to the same office for my whole life, so I feel that the team of physicians there is invested in my family and I. I am comfortable with them and their decisions as a result.
1	He is a very caring person, who takes the time to really talk to and bond with his patients.  I am lucky to have found him.  We are short on physicians here in Hawaii.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has the education and experience to make the right decisions pertaining to my health
1	My doctor takes time to listen to my questions and explains things in simple terms. He is very kind, compassionate and patient.
1	My doctor is genuine and very caring.  She knows me and what my needs are.  She goes above the call of duty and asks me to call her if anything comes up or I have any questions.  She is a great listener and allows me to make suggestions.  She also takes the time to explain things and doesn't treat me a just another patient.  She asks the right questions and gives great advice.  
-1	Sometimes i know my body more and know how to react to things. I dont necessarily believe fully in pharmaceuticals. 
-1	For the most part, he seems to care. He seems to be very smart and thorough. He has made good judgement when it comes to my health care. He seems to be knowledgeable and knows what he is doing. He has a calming effect on me. I like his personality. 
-1	Doctors do not all have the same opinion. Best to always have a second opinion, or third. At least I would do this.
-1	I don't trust doctors because they are only doctors so they can make big bucks, not because they care about helping people. They do not listen to what you tell them, they are in a hurry to get you in and out so they can charge you the money and get on to the next person.
1	He takes his time and listens to me. He takes what I say seriously and gives me the impression he cares
-1	I've been going to her for many years.  She is as good of a doctor as anyone.  However, sometimes I feel my opinion and desires are ignored.
-1	It's difficult for my PCP to find the time to see me, and when she does, I almost always feel rushed and unable to get through my appointment in a timely manner.
-1	The majority of doctors I've seen dismiss what I say and treat me like a number. They're always in a rush and want to just get in and out, instead of taking the time to listen to what my concerns are. They just want to shove pills at you and get you out the door, instead of exploring underlying issues.
1	They know me pretty well and have my best interest at heart however they are busy so if I really need something I will remind them
1	My doctor has never treated me without respect and has worked with me in the past years to help me stay healthy. Since I don't have any physical or mental conditions to deal with my annual checkup is normally without incident or problems.
1	I just began seeing a new physician since my previous one retired. She is extremely intelligent and is totally aware of my medical history and how to treat and prevent any issues that I may have.
-1	because it is in his own best interest to what would best for me. This what he has trained for and has taken an oath to do what is best for his clients. so I believe he would do what is best for men.
-1	I don't necessarily trust doctors. Some are very trustworthy, others are not trustworthy at all. Doctors are often more caught up in imposing their ideas on their patients and don't actually listen to their patients. Too often they tell women that losing weight will fix all their problems or that they can't have a hysterectomy, even when it is medically called for, because they might want to have children later. Too many of them have relationships with drug companies that make it hard for them to be fair-minded about which treatments are best. Some of them haven't kept up with the latest in medical science news. 
-1	I just that my primary Care physician is well educated on the subjects at hand i mean he doesn't have a degree for nothing right
-1	doctors are too busy seeing people that they have trouble keeping up with the new things that are being learned.
-1	The doctors these days seem not to care about the patient. They are only interested in how many patients they can see per day and how much money they can make. They don't seem to care about the patient and how they feel.
1	Because he has always told the truth and he always gives me a solution to my discomforts or diseases
1	They define the position for the organization, for potential applicants, and legally. If there's any question about whether a staff member is actually doing her job, or being asked to perform duties that have nothing to do with her position, the job description should clarify the situation. It should also make it clear who's ultimately responsible for specific tasks or areas.
-1	I have rarely had any issues with my medical treatments that are recommended by my doctors.  They seem to know what is best for me based on my medical history.
1	My doctor is thorough and caring. I know he keeps up with the latest research, because he mentions that. I am sure that he is doing the best he can.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have informed myself of options and treatment prior to my doctors appointments.  that way I can listen to his proposals of treatment and decide in a positive way if I think he is on top of my situation and treatments.
-1	I trust my doctor because he is dealing with someone's health and helping them survive.  Doctors want to help people that's whey they become doctors and why they are committed.
-1	Because I think doctors only care about the bottom line, Money.  Rarely have I ever met a doctor I thought he knew what he was doing ! 
1	I trust my psychiatrist because I've been seeing him for years. This is someone who has seen me at my absolute worst, and has watched me pick myself up and turn my life around. I trust him because he never makes me feel judged or like I'm just another patient that needs to get in and out of his office. 
1	My primary care physician suggests what is best for me.  They have never steered me wrong in the time that I've been seeing them.
-1	I trust my doctor because he doesn't rush me out of the room and genuinely seems to care. He's gotten to know my family personally. I even have his cell phone number.
-1	They take oaths I disagree with I know pharmaceutical sales reps who tell me info about drug pushing To many politics with insurance 
1	I trust her.. cause Ive had other doctors.. and shes now a female which und erstands my needs alittle better... and always gives me her open and honest opinion.. 
-1	You should always trust your doctor to give you the best care you can receive. Doctors are not there to purposely harm you, they care about you and want the best for you. Not every doctor will have the right answer but you should still trust them 
1	I have had the same primary physician for almost thirty years.  he has earned my trust. he has always given me good advice and care.
1	because me and my mom have been going to him over 15 years and he has never been wrong for both of us and seems honest and caring and always meets our needs
-1	i have been misdiagonsied in the past and have changed dr because of this i also have had bad experiences when i knew i was sick and they refuse to treat me untill i have almost be hospitalized. I really feel that they don't know there pt and really just treat u like a number and a bill
1	I have a background in the medical field and am able to effectively build a rapport with my physician to ensure a trustworthy relationship 
-1	i read my medical documents, and they are two-faced, call my condition fake, reason that I lost my disability.  
1	i believe they tell you the truth about everything and they are sincere and most of them are good doctors and treat there paitents very good i have a very good doctor who is always there when i need him
-1	For the most part I have complete trust in my doctor and his staff. Sometimes money does play a part though. 
-1	Being on Medicaid, I don't see Dr's but students who are still learning and sometimes don't know or make mistakes.
-1	Do not go to doctor. If I feel good, there is no reason to waste mine or the doctor's time and money.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he knows me well and has bewen my provider since 2002. Sometimes I feel he knows me better than me medically and personally.
-1	I do trust my doctor and they do get second opinions about my healthif not more opinionsand more tests 
1	I Have A Caring Primary Physician Who I Have Known Intimately For Several Decades And To Whom I Can Communicate Very Easily.
1	I trust them to do the right things for me and have my best interests in general. They be open and straightforward about it.
-1	to explain the reasons is moot inane and asinine.  questions like this destroy the survey experience
-1	I think sometimes they see only what they want.  They ignore what I tell them in regards to symptoms.  If the symptoms do not match the tests or diagnosis they do not count.  So this is why I only trust doctors part way.
-1	I have a reasonable amount of trust in my primary care physician, but I am not afraid to ask for and make sure I get a second or sometimes even a third opinion if I dont agree with what my pcp is saying.
-1	My Dr. is caring and compassionate. He will try to help people to the best of his ability. He takes time to listen and talk to his patients even when really busy.
1	dr paddord has saved my life twice  once when i was septic and once when i was extremely anemic.transferring me to st. patrick hospital in missoula mt both times saved my life
-1	I trust my doctor. I have been giving second opinions from other doctors that have confirmed what my doctor said. 
-1	MY primary care is quite good, great bedside manner, willing to try whatever works. I've found she is better than other doctors I have seen, and is open to looking at studies, research, alternative treatments, and works WITH me.
1	I had a really bad bout of panic/anxiety attacks over a year ago and that's when I reached out to my nurse practitioner. He has helped me through this whole process and still to this day. He is always there when I need to contact him and I have had to try a few different medications until I found the one I am on now (Paxil). He has helped me to understand everything I am feeling and has helped me make a complete 180 in my life. I am forever thankful for my nurse practitioner. He pulled me out of a very hard time, and it was something at the time, that I knew nothing about. So that was also scary to deal with at the time. 
-1	that what they are there for give us the best advice regarding our health and mental wealth that's what they studied for
1	I trust my doctor because in the past she has encouraged me to seek a second opinion, she has done what she could to avoid surgical procedures (even though eventually it had to be done), and she always gives the most minimally invasive options.
1	he knows what he is talking about tats atatdr is all that i can think of at this time isaid that it is
-1	they always wanting to try new medicines and treat you like a guinea pig, I am not willing to be one
-1	I trust my doctor because he understands my needs and listens to what I am telling him.
-1	He spendsa gooda mount of time with me and makes me keep track of important health information and give it to him on our visits...then he really studies the info i give him.
1	I have a good relationship with my doctor. I knew him for along time and he will always tell me the truth but, will let me decide what I want to do. He is willing to answer any questions I might have and give me the honest answer.
-1	Because whenever I have had a health problem I have been treated well and achieved good results by staying healthy and stable, without having to buy or consume unnecessary medicines
-1	I do not have a primary care physician so it is impossible for me to answer the above questions. For that reason I had to answer neutral.
-1	My current doctor says i have one problem that is not really true and sometimes contradicts what others with more knowledge would say
-1	"She answers all of my questions and gives reasons why she is advocating something that I may ""waffle' with.  She listens carefully appearing to see that I as a patient do know myself quite well."
-1	I believe most doctors do settle for medications when there are other alternatives available. Medications are very expensive, some doctors get kickbacks from sales. I believe most harsh medications actually cause worse physical reactions.
1	i have had the same doctor for 22 years he tells me every thing about my health he holds nothing back he is trueful to me about my health and tells me what i need to do for my own good where i like it or not
-1	i like my doctor because he listens to me and has a lot of experience with different medical problems. he is personable and is smart about medications, side effects, different conditions, and health insurance

1	My doctor has years of training and real live experiences.  He know more about my medical issues than I do
1	I have had him for 25 years. We work together to keep me healthy. He considers the whole person not just the malady.

-1	Medical care has declined as insurance provision has decreased.  Fewer people are seeking the education to become a doctor because they don't make enough money - this due to the low quality of insurance and the amount paid by insurance companies; therefore the quality of doctors has gone down and most doctors are foreign and don't speak good English.

1	I have chosen my doctor with care. He is kind thoughtful and though. He listens and remembers what I have said to him. 
-1	It is hard to trust him when he is rushed and not really answering my questions. I feel that he sees a lot of malingering and assumes that my issues are not as harmful as other people's. I tend to downplay my concerns. I don't want to be a bother to him.
1	My doctor has always been upfront with me regarding my health care and options. Very through with my testing and responsible with overseeing my wellbeing.
-1	I believe mu doctor is too set in her own opinions, and reluctant to support my wishes which are based on my experience with previous doctors.
1	"Although we don't know what is totally wrong with me, he hasn't given up looking for the answers and what might help me in the meantime. Never once did he think that it was ""all in my head"" as many would have. He always takes the time to listen to me even if it goes beyond the alloted time and never makes the appt feel rushed. He addresses all my concerns and conditions @ each visits. "
1	My doctor takes time to talk to me about things going on in life (even politics) and not just my physical condition.

1	my doctor takes the time to explain test results and procedures, also the reason why certain medications have been prescribed
-1	"Sometimes I feel as if my PCP doesn't take my concerns serious and just brushes them to the side. My doctor sometimes has this ""I'm the professional and your not"" kind of attitude, as if she is trying to make me feel dumb. She is also not very comforting."

-1	I feel my doctor is easy to talk too understands my health providing the best medications for my health issues
1	My doctor is a smart man and asks me questions about how I feel and then makes the diagnosis.  If I say that doing spiritual things help then he trusts my instincts. If I tell him that a medicine doesn't work then we change it.
-1	my PCP is new to me.  still getting to know him, only seen him 3 times.  my initial reaction is that he is NOT very proactive and that concerns me.
-1	i do not trust anyone now days. to many things go wrong and to much sueing going on these days. doctors seem like they just want your money more than your well being
1	I have had good experiences so far, he is thorough and very good at explaining all aspect of the treatments he dispenses and is an excellent listener

1	My doctor has years of specialized training and is up to date on all the latest medicine and their side effects.  I feel free to tell my doctor that I would prefer another option, if available.
-1	I basically trust my doctor because he does have a treatment that works. Sometimes I wish they would listen to their patients a little more.
1	I completely liked my doctor the moment I met her I trust her to do the best possible care for me she answers any questions I have and is very patient I never feel rushed
-1	I mostly trust my doctor but I also know that sometimes doctors have other interests in mind. Example, if a new drug has come out and insurance will give the doctor a bonus for each patient who prescribes to said medicine for a certain medical condition, the doctor may persuade you try it if it pertains to your treatment even if it's not the best course of action for you 
1	Feel totally free to talk about anything and to ask questions of my doctor.  Think she understands me and she is always willing to go the extra mile for my benefit.

1	I have been with the same physician for over 20 years and he has never been wrong. He knows my history, takes time make sure I understand. 
-1	For the most part I feel the information provided is accurate, I don't believe the doctor would give wrong information intentionally and if I feel unsure a second opinion is ok to get.
-1	I have been going to the same dr for over 30 years. He knows me and all my ailments and quirks so I believe that he has my best interest in mind even if I don't aways agree with him. If anything he is a little over protective. I like the when my husband goes to see him, the dr always asks about me and visa versa when I go to see him. There are times I have had to fight with him to get my husband the specialized care I feel he needs but I dont have to fight too hard and when the office refused to see my husband once because he didn't have the co-pay, our Dr threw a fit and told them they are NEVER to do that again. He is more than our doctor, he is our friend.
1	I've known my physician for over 25 years. She is smart, thorough and compassionate. She is an excellent medical professional and I recommend her to others quite often.

-1	I have seen my doctor on several occasions. She has always shown concern for my well being and given good medical advice. I trust her advice.
-1	"My primary care physician is ""new"" (at least to me) and a bit young and naÃ¯ve. She knows practically nothing about diabetes, yet tries to micro-manage me and my condition, never understanding why her methods of treatment aren't working well. Thought my Endocrinologist and I had finally gotten my primary care doctor ""out of the picture,"" then she reared her ugly head again. Now I'm again faced with having to satisfy BOTH of them!"
1	I do not thoroughly trust my primary physician I trust my cardiologist the most especially since I had a heart attack last month and a double bypass,I don't feel like my primary physician was doing all he should have prior to my having a heart attack  
1	My doctor is very thorough. She has been since the very first time I met her. Only one time did I think she was extremely busy and didn't have the time to listen to all my aches and pains. But she is quick to refer me to another doctor. I was referred to a dermatologist and thank goodness because what I had turned out to be melanoma.
-1	I really have no reason to distrust my PCP.  So far, she has not proposed anything which I felt to be wrong.  Further, I'll ask questions should I feel uncertain.
-1	It's not that I don't trust him I just think he has limited information.  No one can be on top of all of the new treatments but I think he does the best he can.  He is happy to refer me to specialists or others that might have a better grasp of a health issue.  For that reason alone, I have learned to trust his guidance.
1	I trust my doctor she is always listening and gets to the bottom of it or she keeps trying! The office is also friendly and supportive.
-1	My primary care physician studied for years at medical schools and colleges in order to learn their practice and become a medical professional. They took an oath to help people and never cause harm and so this causes me to trust them and believe they have my best intentions at heart. 
1	My Doctor explains everything to me, sometimes I do not grasps everything but if it is put in his notes I can look it up. If I need to see him he will see me but I will have to wait to be squeezed between appointments of other people. 
-1	In most instances I do trust my primary care physician but sometimes would rather have another opinion about more complex problems
-1	My doctor at times will rush me out the office instead of listening to my questions.  Therefore making me not trust in her as much ah I would like
-1	I had a doctor that did all of the things above and I trusted him completely but he left medical practice and went into administration.  I now have a new doctor and have only seen her a couple of times so there hasn't been time to develop the trust you need with a doctor.  So far this doctor seems only interested in making money off of the insurance companies.
-1	Don't currently have a physician, but have usually trusted them when I have. They've taken the time to answer any questions, and make me feel comfortable
-1	He's a good doctor he has helped me with my lower back to see the pain management doctor but the people that work for him doesn't do there job with referrals for me for mental health

1	I have been going to my internist for over three years now and have trusted her from the very beginning.  She's never given me a reason to think otherwise, but as I am a somewhat skeptical person, I can't honestly give her 5s in these ratings.
-1	I trust him to a point - he is so busy seeing a lot of patients at any given time I sometimes wonder if he really understands all my problems/ailments. 
-1	before this survey I had never gave it a seconf thought  I automatically think that the doctor know what he is talking about
1	"I've had the same PCP for eight years and she's always been very up-front about anything involving my health. If there is an issue with multiple treatment options, she makes sure I understand all of them before making a decision. I've never felt as if she were just trying to apease me or ""get me out of the office"" by doing the easiest treatment. "
-1	She was one of the first one listen to my full range of symptoms and treat all if them, not just one or two.
1	I have been going to my primary doctor for over 27 years and my mother went before me.  He works with a team of doctors from UPMC so that all of my doctors are aware of what is going on with me and develop a plan to figure out what is best for me.

-1	There is changes to history spying something about Obama nh court so A bomb attack japanese and destroy all freedom of information Cuba in history spying
-1	Physicians no longer care about their patients. It's about whatever metric the health system that owns their practice. They typically overbook. They don't care about keeping patients waiting. If you have an additional question that is raised during their cursory assessment, they ask you to make another, separate appointment in order to address those concerns. Nurses are fat and act annoyed that the patients are interrupting their donut break. Another nurse was eating ribs at the desk and barked at me when I had a question. Doctors want to give a quick fix and usually write a prescription instead of looking at the patient holistically and taking the time to do a comprehensive assessment. 
1	Beachsideu doctor ss to care about my needs and have helped me change habits when I didn't want to. Cared about helping me when o was at my lowest and getting me the best help. 
-1	Based on years of service my doctor is reliable, friendly, patient, caring and will tell me the truth about my medical needs!
-1	Doctors today have a lot on their plate. As a result, they are squeezed into a role which makes them sometimes unapproachable. That means they have to rush through appointments to get as many in as possible. As a result, they are not able to spend the time they need with each patient, assess their needs, and prescribe the right treatment. If a doctor takes the time to assess and communicate with me concerning my medical needs and condition, then I trust him or her. I figure that they know more about medicine than I do, and they are willing to take the time to find out what I really need, medically.
1	Because I have never been steered wrong by my physician. She has always listened to me when I explain something. also she believes me when I am talking to her 
1	I have two Primary care physician's so I have the luxury of second opinions. I trust both of them as they have been my doctors for a long time and we have a good relationship that is open in every way. They always include my thoughts in discussing medicines and procedures and are quick to chastise me for my lack of discipline on my diet and exercise when needed.
1	I trust my doctor to explain completely, to tell me what I need to know.  He does not trust alternative treatments very much.  I check with another health professional (whom I trust) about those options.
-1	i  not very sure  so middle ground is the best way of answering   ............................................................................................................................................................... nothing else I have too say about this  but  they wanted a longer answer  
1	I trust my primary care physician because he listens to me and asks questions. He looks at my chart and asks me follow up questions regarding ongoing medical issues. My previous physicians were already writing prescriptions before I finished talking to them and did not bother to look at my file before meeting with me.
-1	I don't have a primary physician, I see whoever is there. And while they all seem nice, I do not feel like they fully listen to what I tell them. I don't think they are as thorough as should be. 
1	I have been seeing my doctor for over 7 years now and had seen her very frequently in the last year. All the treatments she prescribed worked for me and she listened what I had concerns.
1	He is very reassuring and steered me in better directions than previous doctors.  He's up front and honest about every option.
-1	there have been too many occasions when the side effects of doctor's remedies have caused more and worse problems than the original purpose for seeking medical advice
-1	They do not discuss the real reasons for my visits.  They do not listen to my symptoms or how it affects my daily like.  I don't think a 15 min appointment is enough time to asses any condition.
1	I trust my primary physician because he listens to what I say, and plays an active part in my health care.
-1	I am on the fence about this one. Not having a specific promo art care doctor, it is a hard question to answer. I broke my ankle in November and was bounced from doctor to doctor to physical therapist to cat scan to everything else under the sun - I never got a straight answer, regardless of how many times I asked, if my ankle was truly broken and if I was doing damage by every single doctor telling me to do something different. 
-1	I always have full trust and my doctor they have my best interest in mind. So there's no reason I shouldn't trust that
1	They are trained professionals.  Why would I not trust them?  It's their job to tell me good and bad news.
1	My oncology team is also my nephews, they have been treating me for six years and him for almost one and they have managed to keep me up and moving despite how difficult it is for me to tell them everything. Plus our main dr is known around the world and is always traveling so thats nice to know.
-1	I generally trust my PCP. I have been seeing him for many years and his advice is generally good. He does, however, sometimes gives me advice on things outside of his specialty. I take that advice with a grain of salt.

1	I have a lot in common with my Dr. She knows my limitations and spends the time I need with her to see that I understand what and why she is doing what she does.

-1	My doctor is always looking at a computer and asking my thoughts on in. he has brought up his personal problems and comparing his problems to mine 
-1	I am in the process of switching physicians so this is not a question I can answer right now. I had been with my doctor for years, but seem to have lost all faith and trust in him
-1	I feel the 'industry' of medicine out weighs the care of patients. Profit is more important than caring for and treating the person. 
-1	"Never know if they're just pushing what they get paid to push, pills and medications.  Results are hidden in their words of ""care""...never really know what they say unless you research it more."
1	I was sick 10 years ago and my doctor was awesome! He explained everything and put me in the right hands of another doctor in the hospital
1	My doctor is very thorough and intelligent.  He has always communicated directly to me and his decisions about my treatment have been right on target.
-1	I have been going to her for quite some time. I always ask her questions if I don't understand anything she tells me.
1	She is kind and listens to my medical problems and we talk about them together. She spends the time needed with me to take care of me.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been her patient for  many years and she is always on the ball when it comes to my health. She does not overtest, but will prescribe tests when it is necessary to make sure I am in good health.
1	I think that most primary care physicians have the knowledge to do what is best for their patients.  They care about their patients well being and take this very seriously.
-1	My doctor seems to take a conservative approach towards treatment. He is not too quick to recommend medication and advises a healthy overall lifestyle. 
1	we have a young, enthusiastic doctor who comes from a family of doctors; he listens to me. Since I do a lot of research on medical issues, I feel he is giving me correct information.
-1	I would have to say the reason is they do not call you if blood work or urine comes back as bad unless you go back in a week or so later.  Why can they not just call and give one results over the phone especially when you live far away from a doctors office to begin with.
-1	I find that while my primary care physician offers thorough screenings, some of the information given at my appointments seems to be standard for everyone, rather than taken my personal medical history into account. I feel like the treatment is not always individualized.
-1	I feel that she is capable and up-to-date but sometimes doesn't listen to details that might make a difference in my care
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for a long time and have had the opportunity to observe what he says about different aspects of my health compared to my own observations, both of which are quite close.
-1	I need to know all the side effects of each treatment and take a proactive stance when it comes to my medical treatment.
-1	I just feel like they're more worried about how what they can do might impact their career than really paying attention to what's going on
-1	most of the time i agree that they are trustworthy, but i can think of times they just want to prescribe something and not care too much about other possibilities 
1	Personable and sharing, shows interest in and concern for all of his patients. That he listens to my questions and opinions is obvious to me from his answers and reactions.
-1	they accept my agreement or refusal with out pressuring me into what they might want . they discuss all options with me and give me suggestions to my problems without pressure
-1	WELL THERE MY PRIMARY CAR DOC SO THEY SHOULD KNOW WHATS BEST FOR ME. THEY BEEN A PRIMARY DOC FOR YEARS AN KNOW BETTER THAN I DO
-1	I trust my primary physician, because they are consistent about my well being. They always asked if I need anything or any questions I need to ask, or about any problems former or current.
-1	I trust my physician a whole lot. I trust that he/she will give me the perfect advice all or most of time at least and wouldn't stir me the wrong way.
-1	I generally trust my physician because of past experience. I also tend to recognize the reason for their assessments.
-1	He has always been straight forward.  When something serious has arisen, he has no problem forwarding me on to a specialist for care.  He is quick to respond when I need an appointment.  Sometimes, he is a bit distracted, but then again aren't we all.  Now, you say in the medical world that is not to be, but when he has been this way, it has not been regarding anything really serious and just seemed in a hurry.
1	I have had my PP for a few decades now and he is always on top of any of my concerns. He knows me and has all of my medical background info. 
-1	At times I feel the Dr. is rushed and needs to get on with other patients, at times I feel like I should be given the time to write down directions I may forget
-1	this doctor is new to me, he seems like he is in a hurry all the time. so, its too soon to tell at this point.
1	My PCP has given me care for over 25 yrs so I literally trust her with my life ang9the life of my child.
-1	She is a good doc but doesnt always like to do what i feel is right treatment for me. Example. I would like the shot for shingles but she says i am not old enough. I also want the pheunemenacocal shot she wont give it. I am almost 51 and want prtected before i get sick
1	I have no reason to not trust her. She seems to truly care about my health and seems to make good decisions for my health.
-1	I trust my care physician they know what's best in my eyes I trust them they know what best when it comes to Heath 
-1	I trust in my primary care physician to a certain extent . Sometimes, I do not always agree with everything that she says. But, I feel she thinks she is right and that is fine but I can agree to disagree with her. I do not always agree but I try her way first .  If it gets so I do not fully trust her opinion then I will find another primary care physician. 
-1	I trust my primary doctor in all the basics.  But, I have not had to question about something serious, at this point.  Sometimes my doctor seems too busy, but she has never ignored a question or concern
-1	I feel if I picked them they must be good and good reviwes. I ask others I know as well if they know of my do today and any concerns fromantic them or otbers
1	My primary care person listens to what I have to say and we work to find the best solution to any problem I might have.
1	My PCP is a very intelligent, capable and thoughtful man. He is actually the first doctor I've ever had who listened to what I said and accepted that I don't always agree with him. He works around it.
-1	I trust my physician because they are thorough. They seem to have my best interest at heart and will go out of their way to help me when i need additional help
-1	He's great to talk with, but aging, and perhaps a little less careful now with actual exams in his office.
-1	"I have a long standing relationship with my primary care doctor.   He ""gets"" me and knows how much to push if extra treatment is involved."
-1	I just started with a new primary care physician so I answered based on my experiences with my past doctor.  She always took the time to answer questions and provide information and made sure that everything was understood.  She also was very interested in my thoughts regarding my medical situation and/or treatment.
-1	i do not feel a sense of closeness to my doctor that i would like to feel.  Sometimes he does not seem like he really listens and understands me
-1	It take a mouth for to see Dr then u wait 2 hours and he see u for 5 mins.in the 5 mins he just tell u time for check up .
-1	I have never had a problem with a doctor.  This survey is not for me because I don't have any of these problems.
1	he has always been honest about everything I have asked or had concerns about responsed to all my needs and truly cares about the welfare of me
1	other than she's my best friend and the smartest person i know. there aren't any more reasons needed
1	we have a great connection and i feel that we are able to ask anything to him about my health i feel he wants whats best for me 
1	I trust my PCP because she is very caring and if I need a referral she gives me one if she feels my condition is something another doctor needs to handle.
-1	I trust my physician because he cares about me. He always gives me good advice. He doesn't give me medicine that i don't need.
1	I have had the same physician since I moved to IL which is almost 9 years and I trust her judgement implicitly.  She has proven to me that she has my best interest at heart.
1	Dr. answers my questions whether time  is factor or not.  Does not just give an answer to shut me up, is truthful.
1	My doctor has been very dedicated to providing me with good advice and explaining situations so they make sense and in my best interest.
-1	My doctor has always helped me to fix what it was I went to him for. He also acted calmly and explained what was going on.
-1	I switched doctors within the program I am enrolled in. The first doctor was not a good fit - I never felt at ease around her and doubted her expertise. My new doctor is much easier to talk to but one must be on one's toes when meeting with him. All-in-all I find it much easier to talk to him. Sometimes I have to ask for clarification as to the why or details but he will usually explain things to my satisfaction.
1	I thinks he cares about his patients and he knows what's he doing. He has helped me many times and I trust him
-1	My doctor frequently overbooks his appointments so I don't always feel that I have his full attention.
-1	I have military healthcare through my husband. Both my primary care doctor and my neurologist were recently rotated out to new duty stations. Both of them were really good, and saw me through my initial GBS-CIDP diagnosis and the first cycle of recovery and recurrence. I'm now on cycle #2 and both my current doctors are new to this duty station. They may prove to be just as good as my last doctors...but I just haven't seen them often enough to make that determination yet.
1	I have had the same doctor for several years and have had no problems. I know what all my conditions are and she explains everything I need to know
1	He spends the time needed to answer all my questions. He is respectful and kind. The office staff reminds me of my appointments.
-1	He's a nice guy, but I don't think he weighs all the options. I have been diagnosed wrong a few times, so I have less confidence in him now.
1	I been with the same doctor for ten years at least. She and I are not just patient and doctor but true friends. I know she has my best interest.
-1	HE IS VERY IN THE KNOW AND TAKES TIME TO LISTEN AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT I MIGHT HAVE. HE ALWAYS SEEMS TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHAT ID CAUSING THE HEALTH PROBLEM.
1	He spends alot of time with me & is very thorough & explains everything. He takes the time to listen to me.
-1	i like mty proimary care physical physican i like him alot he seems like a nice dood i can trust him with a lot of info :)
1	I've been seeing my doctor for years now and I trust my doctor. My doctor knows almost everything about me and my conditions. She is honest and straight forward to me about my conditions.
-1	they never call as needed or when i ask them to disreragrd my messages all together. never return my calls
-1	I don't always trust my Dr. I think he tell me one thing and somebody else another.I feel he does this because he afraid he's going to upset me or scare me
1	My doctor spends time with me and also is thorough  He is good with making patients feel comfortable and also it detailed
-1	I trust my doctor completely and she helps me understand and goes out of her way to help and explain my medical situation with her.
-1	Doctors only alot a certain amount of time for each patient (not long enough) causing them to rush through your visit with very little time to explain what's wrong with you let alone explain different procedures or treatment options.  Doctors also almost always jump to a pill, or a test or a procedure rather than trying a more down to earth, logical approach.
-1	Overall I do trust most health care professionals. but my only contact with health care is going to the Dentist twice a year and seeing the Eye Doctor about once every 3 or 4 years
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has the medical knowledge to guide me regarding my needs in health care. 
-1	In my experience my doctor only gives bad news or the worst of what can happen. He dosnt give you any hope in healing things or being able to fi anything
-1	the last few doctors i have seen are quick and dismissive and none has got it right.   I was sent home to get dandruff shampoo when it is excema.  i was sent home with a surgeons number when i had a gall bladder attack that i have managed on my own
-1	I have been given no reason to distrust my current physician. She is thorough even though it is difficult to get in to see her.
-1	It depends on the individual personality of the physician, which can vary widely just like individuals in other professions.
-1	He has always done what is best for me, and I trust his decisions and opinions.  I've had health issues, and he has helped me.
-1	I've used the same primary care doctor for more than a decade, I definitely trust their opinion when discussing treatment options for various ailments 
-1	i trust my doctor,it is the insurance cos. that i don't.They are in charge and make the rules they want.That is the framework drs. function within.A tratment must be insurance approved or you won't get it.
1	I really like my primary doctor and while I trust that my health is important and he is very easy to talk to, he doesn't explore some things as much as I think he should and I have to insist on him doing so if I think he's not understanding the severity of an issue. He does not truly understand me as well as my previous primary care doctor so can be quick to dismiss something that I know needs more attention.
-1	My physician is very thorough and takes considerable time with me when I see him for an appointment.  He takes extra time to research the proper course of action.
-1	My doctor doesn't care too much about me he just tells me a few things and hands me a perscription to go to the pharmacy to get pills
1	He knows more about medical conditions than I do. He has years of education in the medical field and I would only know what I can find in books, searching on medical websites for information and from asking other people about medical conditions.
1	She has done a great job for 20 years and takes her time to explain things.  She listens to my concerns and has good advise
1	I have known my doctor for quite a few years and completely trust her with all my medical needs. She knows what is best for me and what I need to do to feel good 
1	He genuinely is concerned about me. He talks to me about every day things that are going on.  Asks me about my job,  my home, my personal life. 
1	I have been going to the same primary doctor for decades, have gotten good advice, and good treatment, that whole time, and have built up trust in her opinions.
-1	Happily I've not had serious medical problems requiring decision making or second opinions.   My PCP is a kind but busy man and I do feel strongly that if I do develop a serious issue he might not be the best care giver. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to the same one since I was a teenager and my doctor understands me. My doctor knows everything about me and I don't want to go through getting to know a new doctor.
-1	My pop suggests non prescription processes initially. Fights email, he may opt for writing a prescription.ifi have a questionable side effect from a specific med., he will stop fora few days, possibly terry before changing medication. All in combination with healthy diet and excercise
1	I've been a patient of my doctor for 25+ years and he's never steered me wrong ever he takes good care of me.
-1	My former physician has made the best decisions about my medical care based on the tests and my answers to his questions.
-1	She is too stuck in the allopathic medicine.  I'm about to fire my long term physician. She sometimes does not listen, and has to be forced to listen.
-1	Generally all doctor do not take enoug time to talk to their patience. Sometime the doctors just want to see as many as patience as they can 
-1	I only will trust a doctor who believes in God, I find this to be very important in how they handle situations

1	My primary care physician is very through and takes the time to listen to me and explain any options.   
1	my primary care doctor is always willing to explain any doubts or questions that I have. He is thorough but does not needlessly order tests and procedures. He is very knowledgeable and keeps up to date on new info
-1	I trusted my previous doctor who referred me to my current doctor.  she seems to be knowledgeable.    
-1	I have no insurance,so dr visits aren't often,some drs are great,others seemed rushed to get to next patient
1	I trust my doctor because they never give me a reason not to. They show me everything I need to know. They have a website where I can see all my medical records, what test they ran and how they I did on it. My doctor is the best!
1	I have a doctor who is an older gentleman and he is very caring and thorough with me.  He talks to me, not at me and that gives me a comfortable feeling about him.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for about 15 years and continue to be impressed with his empathy and competence. He has been voted one of the top Internists in our city year after year and he is very well respected in the medical community.
-1	I think the vast majority of doctors have the patient's best interests at heart, but occasionally they may push for a certain treatment or medication for political reasons.
1	I have been under the care of my primary physician for over 10 years and I have complete trust and faith in him and his clinic staff.

1	I trust them because we have built up a relationship in the past. It has taken time but we have a good feel for each other
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never given me advice or information that has not proved to be true. 
-1	They are just guessing on how to fix whatever ails me.  It's always a gamble trying a new medicine. 
-1	I have not been to a doctor or care physician in many many years because I am way to anxious to do so 
-1	My primary care physician has practiced medicine in my hometown for about thirty-five years and is well respected. More over, he has been treating members of my family for most of that time. I trust him fairly implicitly.
-1	My physician takes the time to thoroughly explain procedures & health care information.  I can trust him 
-1	 i trust or distrust your primary care physician because he is good and stuff like that and its easy to talk to them openly about everything you need to talk to a doctor about in a situation
1	In 2013 I moved and got a new primary care doctor.  Within a three month period I broke 4 bones in my foot and had to be hospitalized for a severe intestinal problem.  My doctor took the time to explain all options to me and followed up with me to make sure I was doing well.
-1	he knows my health condition adn also take care of all my allergies very well. he knows my food habits and also suggest nutritions. he speaks really well
-1	He works WITH me and asks me questions and gives me a voice in my care. He used to ask if I was ready to discontinue a certain medication, but when I finally explained why I wanted to continue it, he understood and stopped asking. 
-1	I have a very good connection with my healthcare provider. I trust him very much. i am not worried at all.
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part, however I don't think doctors know everything and they should really listen to their patients views and opinions when it comes to their health and what their body is telling them. 
-1	I don't trust the medical system or any doctor for much of anything.  They very often do more harm than good.
-1	Well I do not have a specific primary care physician, so as far as having a level of trust or distrust for one, it is not possible.
-1	I generally trust my doctor. He, unlike many doctors, is actually interested in what he does. He is still human, and I challenge him when I feel the need. He doesn't mind, it makes him think.
-1	I trust my doctor mostly but sometimes she can seem a little cocky. That concerns me because she doesn't think she is capable of mistakes.
-1	He has been my physician for several years.  I have never had a problem with his treatment plans.  He is willing to bring in a specialist when it is warranted.  I am confident in his care.
-1	I  prefer to research on my own but you in general need to trust primary care physician and believe that he is doing good for you

1	he has always let me to kake right choices I have never had a reason to not trust him I have had him for a doctor for over thirty years still in about as good a shape as any year old man
1	Although I do generally trust my doctor there are times when I feel I am seen as a patient and other times when I feel I am seen like one more hurdle the doctor has to get through before his work day is done. Sometimes it seems it is a quick examination and a treatment and throw me out the door. 
-1	I have great faith in our medical staff, resources and facilities here in the swell state of Washington.
1	he has a lot of years experience and has had his own practice for many years,and gives full explanations of medical conditions
-1	i do not really have much to say about it after all medical treatment is not an option its a nicesity
-1	I am still new to going to the doctor and entrusting them with my illnesses and overall care. I am attempting to get the doctor to understand.
-1	I just got a new doctor and she seems to looking out for my best interest. I question her sometimes but everything is explained and discussed to my satisfaction.
-1	There is never enough time and he is always running late. I wish he would be on time and listen to my issues.
1	I trust the physicans i currently have because i have had positive experiences through the many years that i've been a loyal patient. And when issues arise they are always handled quickly and efficiently. 
-1	medical offices are constrained by regulations and requirements to post insurance companies, medicare 
-1	 trust my doctor because he is very knowledgable about most if not all medical information that is relevent to my medical and emotional wellbeing. if i have any questions, he explains what i need to know to make an informed decision.
-1	I trust my caregivers because they would not decieve me. They are supposed to do no harm and care about their patients
-1	They are in and out seeing in real quick, prescribe a medicine that costs an arm and a leg and come back in 4-6 weeks. And rumor has it, the doctors get a kick back from drug companies for drugs they prescribe. And they also schedule 8-12 patients at once so all patients wait and wait some more, frustrating yes
1	I trust my primary care Doctor to take the best care of me. Primary Care Doctors take as an oath to provide the best care. Primary Care Doctors want a good reputation. Primary Care Doctors have great mal practice insurance.
1	She has been my physician for many years and has always looked out for my best interests. I have full confidence.
-1	Because they get paid when you fill out a prescription they wrote.  The more prescriptions they write and you fill, the more they make.
-1	I believe we are all humans and humans make mistakes. So, although I trust my doctor they are not perfect.
-1	he is very free and open to talk to me about just anything I may ask, has my best interests at heart
-1	It's never occurred to me not to trust her. She seems to explain things well. I don't know how to expand on this answer - it's never something I've thought about before. 
1	shes friendly an nice to me an all her patients she does what is best for me  an i trust her a lot  we get along great 
-1	I trust my doctors because they take the time to make sure I get a reminder call for appointments, they are friendly and don't mind taking a little extra time to explain something to me if needed, I even have a doctor who constantly tells me not to worry about his fee. 
1	The main reason I trust my doctor is that I have been going to him for many years for yearly check ups and other medical attention and over time I have discovered that his diagnosis is generally correct and that he has my best interests at heart. 
1	The reason I trust my primary care physician is because he really looks out for my well being he understands that I have a 6 year old and he wants me to be around until she is grown.
1	My Doctor is from our community and goes to our local church. She has a daughter also that is one of our best EMTs locally. She also doesn't care about if you can pay her right away. 
1	I trust doctors until I find out they are wrong. So far all my doctors have treated me well and never been wrong.
-1	I have been going to see him for about 10 years and he seems to do right by me I can't really say what things he has done wrong as he seems to do me good..
1	My primary care physician has been very good for me and too me. I have been going to her since my last doctor retired. The doctors that she refer me to are the one's that she trust with the care of her family members and herself. She is also an affiliate in one of the best hospitals in my area.
-1	I do not have a primary physician, however I rely on my sister, who is a physician, for all things medical. I don't always follow her advice, but I do listen and ask the appropriate questions before making my own decisions. However, I know many, many doctors and don't trust a great deal of them to have the patient's best interest at heart. Sometimes they are lazy. Sometimes they are condescending. Sometimes the amount of money they'll receive from the patient's insurance/pockets matters the most.
1	If I didn't have trust in my physician I'd find one I do trust.  This is somewhat of an absurd question.  My physician ALWAYS explains things, is upfront, takes necessary time and explains everything 
1	In the time I've been seeing him he has told me things that I NEEDED to hear rather than what I wanted to hear. He always spends as much time as is necessary with me to make sure I understand my options and instructions. 
-1	I do trust my doctor but not doctors in general. Many are only looking after themselves and do not have the patient's best interest at heart. I will not stay with a doctor I think is doing that.
-1	They are there to do a job and I think doctors want to help so they always try to do their best and sometimes they are wrong you have to look to yourself to help too
1	i have known him for a long time and he is honest and dependable to a fault.  he is always clear and concise in his diagnoses and instructions for treatment.
-1	I trust my doctor. I have never had a problem. They have always been nice and made me feel comfortable. 
-1	I trust the knowledge that doctors have to identify a problem and provide solutions, but I distrust the use/prescription of medications when they aren't necessary to solve the issue.
-1	My Father was killed by is Dr.  My Mother was killed by a Hospital.  Dr's in America are trained to prescribe Pills, not cure the ill.  I have a primary care physician, but I take charge of my health.  I am 70 years old and take no prescription drugs.
1	My doctor is very conscientious.  He asks me a lot of questions to get to why I feel the way I do.  He is very empathetic.  
1	He takes the time to listen to me.  I am comfortable talking to him and he answers any questions in a senseable way. He also suggests more economical a alternative options instead of just drugs. 
-1	They are always rushing and not receptive to questions.  They seem to be overbooking for the money.  I think ultimately it's my responsibility to take care of myself so I don't blame them in my mind.
-1	I am neutral on how I feel about trusting my Doctor. I will listen and use my common sense or go with my gut feeling and/or research more on my own.
1	I have been going to him for many years and he has always been right about his diagnosis. If he does not know the answer to something then he will recommend I go to a specialist.
1	I really like my doctor. She is very thorough and friendly. Always has done the right thing. Very patient and listens to me. Never have doubted her.
1	i do trust my doctor to tell me about my health an what better I can do to help myself an the things I should do
-1	My doctor doesnt seem to be quick to prescribe medication, answers all my questions, is calm, doesnt seem to be in a hurry to move on to the next patient. Makes me feel confident in his ability.  
1	I have went to the same doctor for a number of years and he has always listens to the questions I have. For example, if I need additional blood work or tests, he explains why this is necessary and what he is looking for. I trust his judgment and am appreciative of his care and concern.
1	I like my doctor and trust him, he is caring and thoughtful of me and my needs I would not change doctors, I will continue seeing him
-1	had personally bad experiences with doctors in regards to making/performing good decisions, seems to be more out to make money than helping patients
-1	Have only seen him 2x but he seems nice and  seemed to know what he he doing, more than willing to,set up appointments for me with other hwpealthcare specialists
1	he-she has my general helth and well benning in mind so I have to trust that what do for me will be the right thing for me 
1	Been with my doctor for many years. When he thought something on my leg looked like could be skin cancer, he didn't wait, he called a dermatologist right away and sent me right over to have it checked.  Sure enough it was skin cancer.
1	My doctor is extremely familiar with my worries, feelings of helplessness at times and he provides enough time to listen to my concerns. He is very empathetic. 
1	I have had many Drs over the years, I have 3 right now, and I trust them all very much. They talk to me about what is being done or what I should do to do better. 
-1	My Dr. really cares for her patients. She is wonderful. If you have an issue, she will give you a list of specialists and tell you, which one you should go. he is very professional.
1	He is the professional with access to studies regarding medications and illnesses.  If I didn't trust in him, then do not know where I would turn.
-1	"First, I want to say that it's very hard to rate the sentence ""all in all you have complete trust in your doctor"" on a sliding scale. The sentence contains an absolute, so it's not clear. Next, to sum up how much I trust my doctor, I'd say I generally trust her, and I think that she's a competent person with good intentions, but that she also has a reasonable amount of self-interest and might not be above soft-selling me something I don't really need, like botox. I don't think that she would lie to me about it, though. She has a fairly conservative point of view about prescribing medications and I appreciate that."
1	This is the person I rely on for the truth more so than anyone else besides my family. These are the people that try to keep us alive.
1	I trust my doctor b/c when I first started seeing her I was a mess and she ran labs on me and found a ton of my problems and worked hard to fix all the problems and every 6 months she runs labs on me to make sure all are in the level they need to be.
-1	I think that most doctors are basically helpful.  They do tend to be arrogant and think that they are important.  No doctor wants to be sued for malpractice, so I think they tend to over treat many medical conditions.
1	we have built a relationship, he knows what we desire and expect and all live up to the exceptions we have set
1	I trust my doctor with my healthcare needs because of his knowledge, compassion and care for my well being.
1	She has been my doctor for years. She is older and has been a doctor for years. I basically like how she conducts an examination. 
-1	my doctors always explain all the side effects of all the different medications that are planned to be taken by me and they will answer all questions i have to the best of there nowledge
1	He is a kind, compassionate man who always takes time to explain in detail what should be done and how it will be done. He always takes time to explain everything in detail.
1	It comes from experience. he is very honest and explains everything. I don't know what else you want to know
-1	I do not have complete trust  or distrust for doctors but I feel most are more about making a buck than they are about caring for their patients.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor - overwise I would have change my doctor immediately. No reason to visit doctor I cannot trust.
-1	Doctors have operated on me and have messed their operations,therefore,I do not have much trust in doctors !!!
-1	too busy and they can't be bothered to sit actually listen to what you have to say. your just a number to them
1	He has been my doctor through cancer and other maladies for 20 years. He is very modest and gentle. He has found problems with my health that I was not aware of, such as pneumonia.
-1	i like my doctor but sometimes i just do not know what to think about things they have help out a lot over the years
-1	It seems that physicians want to treat symptoms rather than dig to find causes and solve complex medical issues now.The latter takes more time and effort and expense and the medical industry does not favor the old diagnostic approach to medicine.Physicians are too ready to write prescriptions than to treat patients with drugs.
-1	sometimes I think they take things out of control because everyone body is different and sometimes the things they said we should be taking it ends up making us worst or bad 
1	I have had the same physician for several years. He is patient with my many questions. He is easily accessible. 
-1	I have been seeing my doctor for several years and have established a trust and confidence in his ability and diagnosis
1	I don't know, I just trust her. Maybe because she is friendly or maybe it was the time she didn't know something and consulted her colleague while I was there. I just feel that I can trust her.
-1	Being given conflicting information then the denial, can never simply admit being human and making a mistake
1	She is very good at what she dose and she know what she dose and tell u what is wrong and is very understanding and talk to u
-1	Sometimes physicians give unnecessary treatment and sometimes they are on point with treatment with my personal experience I always recommend a second opinion 
-1	My primary care doctor works for the Dept Of Veterans Affairs, I truly believe he has the best interest of the VA not me.
-1	i do trust my primary care doctors thats the way it is and i do believe they are doing their best to help and assist as in our condition and they are knowledgeable enough to just do what is the best for us 
1	goes in depth with our discussions, goes the extra step when preliminary tests are not within the appropriate range, explains actions and my consent before adjusting meds or recommending actions
1	I trust him because he has been one of my doctor's for 15 years and knows my medical history. He bases decisions on my history.
1	I have some very negative experiences with doctors trying to treat beyond their personal capabilities. My current doctor is great at discussing the problem, and if he does not feel totally confident in a procedure or treatment, I get a referral to a specialist. I love it.
-1	I trust my Dr because she is very honest with me. She tells me what she thinks is the best situation for me regarding my diabetes. We also talk about family. I know she is married to another Dr, and they have 2 boys. I broke my fibula last year, and she was very honest with me regarding the healing process with my leg. I took about 10 months to heal, and I sometimes still have pain. She told me I will probably have pain on and off for the rest of my life. diabetes and my age are factors in the slow healing.
-1	I don't feel they go the extra mile to check for any ailments I feel they are in a rush and don't check for everything they could sometimes we have to offer suggestions which is not cool 
-1	I trust him enough to provide me with the information I need to make a decision - as to agreeing with what he thinks is best for me, I am neutral.  I make my own decision after speaking with those that are close to me.
1	do not have a primary doctor, but I feel that doctors are desensitized to the health concerns of their patients
-1	I trust him but there is always that doubt that they are just guessing your diagnosed things because they are doctor
-1	Most doctors are either trying to make money or don't take the time to fix the problem. They rely on medications to make the patient feel comfortable while making him or her more sick. 
-1	Doctors tell you what is good for them financially. They may have stock in a certain type of medicine so they prescribe that medicine more often. It's always best to get a second or third opinion.
1	I do my research before choosing a doctor. I also go off of word of mouth and trust my doctor completely because of the people who recommended hi and my faith. 
1	Doctors take pride in their skills. I trust them to want to be right. Being dishonest would be a conflict but we all have convenience concerns. 
1	i have been with my primary care doctor for over 5 years. i trust her and i feel that i have a good means of communication wuith her plus she always takes the time to sit with me and explain any issues i may have

-1	i trust him we are from a small town and see him al the time. he always ask how we are doing and remembers everything
-1	I believe that my primary care physician has my best health thoughts in mind and would not lead me in a direction that would be bad for me
-1	She used to be an excellent doctor. Not so much as her practice has expanded. Now she seems to take longer and longer extended vacations.
-1	I will never trust a physician because they are just doing their job as an employee and dont genuinely care about you personally. They do what they are trained is best for their career, not for you.
1	I trust my primary care physician, but sometimes I don't feel like we could do be everything that we should be doing to make me feel better.
-1	Sometimes, doctors are pressured into prescribing their patients with medication they really don't need. So, some doctors are honest and are straight-forward with their patients and some aren't. 
-1	Because they provide me with the best decisions for my health and body. Both physically and mentally 
-1	"I am not willing to allow a physician to ""put me on"" a batch of drugs that have  adverse side affects so I am not the type of patient most doctors want.  I will listen to their reasons for the recommendations and then weigh what I may know about a drug and whether my symptoms are bad enough to take the risk of the side effects.  "
1	I think he's looking out for my best interest. Checks thourough an yet d doesn't do excess. Just the right amount
-1	I trust the doctors I have seen because they have spent time listening to me and fully answering my questions.
-1	My new doctors seem to be very knowledgeable and intent upon learning all about me. I am not too sure if I agree with the judgement that I should stop taking metformin (which I have been taking for over 12 years) because I am over medicating because my A1C is below 7 (6.2) and they seem more worried about my blood pressure than anything else.
-1	I feel as though doctors sometimes see too many people to really be able to focus on one person care. Also they can't know everything about each individual.
-1	I think they are more into there own money earning then into really helpping me out with my needs. They do help in the way they tell me but with the other needs I need I have to find out my own information since they dont offer it and I think they should give that information also
-1	I trust my primary care physician because ethey know me and my health history not to mention they also know my families health istory
-1	I trust doctors in general because I believe in the Hippocratic oath and I haven't had a negative experience that would make me distrust them. There are cases (specifically scheduled c-sections) that I think are about convenience, but for the most part, doctors are trustworthy. 
-1	He has never held back on what he thinks is best for me. He speaks plainly and bluntly about what I need to help me get over my conditions if that is something that can be done. He does not play games or go easy on my feelings he tells it like it is. I like a doctor who gets to the point and gives me the bad and good without trying to downplay how bad something is. 
-1	Over the years the doctors have done vary little to help with my disease other than take my money, give me medication that does nothing or makes me feel worse, or give me no hope at all. I have been able to do much more for myself than any doctor has
1	I have a god relationship with all of my doctors.  They always take as much time with me as necessary
-1	They are sometimes in a hurry. They don't always have all the answers. I value  second opinions or even thirds.
1	I trust my primary doctor because she takes the time to talk to me and to listen to me. She asks me questions pertaining to the situation and is thorough in explaining what her opinion is. 
-1	Very young dr. I am new to practice. She has me on expensive mess that I cannot afford. This causes me stress and anxiety 
1	My doctor is kind and very well informed.  He always takes the time to explain things to me carefully and has literature to support his positions.  He takes my opinions into account and doesn't ever denigrate my own research.  It's a great partnering relationship.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has never done me wrong. My old doctor was and old arrogant man that was not sympathetic to my problems and concerns so I know a good doctor when I get one.
-1	My doctor doesn't thoroughly talk about any diagnosis. My doctor also seems to always be in rush. I appreciate though that my doctor does seem to take an interest in being there and providing steps.
-1	My doctor is getting old a d is probably ready to retire.  Its time to find a new dr but im not one for change
1	Just general anxiety from test results. The people I deal with are all very good and do all they can to make me more relaxed. 
-1	I am somewhat distrustful because of a misdiagnose of one of my children in childhood. It delayed his recovery and caused hospitalization that was not necessary.  I believe you have to be your own advocate.
-1	In general most practitioners do a good job, some spend more time with you and some it's different each time you visit. Some make you feel like they are guessing while others give you assurance they know exactly what to do. 
-1	It all depends on (1) the doctor (2) the city (3) the facility (4) my personal experience. Some doctors (like the one I have now) I trust 100%. Others in the past? Skeptical.
-1	I think that I'm just a number and he just wants to me get in and out as soon as possible. I don't think that he really cares about me at all and I'm just a paycheck
1	Doctor takes the time to explore any and all problems. Gives the benefit of his knowledge. Never hurries an exam.
1	I trust them because they are here to help us all not hurt us and for the better being of our lifes always in a positive way of life always.
-1	I don't distrust my primary care physician, but I have had a couple of bad experiences with doctors in the past.  Doctors are humans and humans make mistakes.  My last primary care physician didn't listen to my daughters symptoms and the next day, she was hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis.  I never went back to him .  (She won't either. )
-1	He is always to quick to put me on a pill. Does not want to listen to what my contribute to what is going on. Rushes me out the door.
1	Have a new doctor, she seems to understand my medical conditions and prescribes prescriptions for them. I do/have to trust her for prescribing new prescriptions, or taking some of them away when no longer useful.
-1	Sometimes I feel that certain doctors are only in it to make the bucks not to look at the person's health as a whole. 
1	based upon past experiences, I believe he is thorough and has my needs at heart.  If I have questions, he answers without hesitation.  We discuss the issues.  I never feel rushed.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician - I see numerous different doctors in a charity clinic setting.  Some of these doctors I trust as they have a good bedside manner and are clear in their instructions and information.  Others are lacking in bedside manner and seem cold and impersonal, with little care about explanations or answering questions or concerns.
-1	It seems like doctors only want to pass out pills. That is a bandage and dose not resolve your problem and has side effects
-1	medications are mostly prescribed based off what pharmaceutical reps are pushing, right? So whatever medication I get may not be what the doctor would have preferred to give. 
-1	My Doctor has a degree and knows what he is doing , When he is doing surgery on me he is in control I am a sleep and give him all my trust. When he orders medication I trust him to do whats right
-1	most doctors have so many patients to see that they take too little time thoroughly listening to your problems
1	I trust my physician because he or she knows the best in health and will tell their opinion based on knowledge.
1	I have been with my current primary care physician for over 10 years.  She knows me as well as my family.  She explains things if I don't understand.  She listens when I have concerns.  I trust my physician to provide care that is best for me.
-1	Doctor has seen me and my family through loss, illness and family ifficulties. He has always weighed the options to get us any help or medications we have needed
1	They tell me the things that I have to do and not to do to be healthy. They don't beat around the bush, they tell me if something is wrong with me.
-1	I think doctors usually try to give the best care possible, although sometimes there may be other options available.
1	I feel like my doctor provides me with all the options available for me and helps me decide on the best course of action for myself. she takes the time to explain all options I may have access to
-1	I believe I bring with me an army of negative people.  It has been this way for over ten years.  Without me these people get nothing.  It is difficult for me to focus on my life when so much of it revolves around other people.  Of course the only evidence to me is going from a grade a student to homeless and unemployed.  Like I set that goal for myself.  I find life gives me the opposite of what I ask for.  However due to current small successes I am beginning to change my opinion and that I believe will also change my homelessness.  That being said people who set out to help me find they now become part of this negative crowd's aggressiveness.  Who to blame but me.  There is no evidence.  It's about a person's attitude and their true intentions.  I trust my helpers to make informed decisions according to their god given abilities and people given authorities.  The second amendment.  The fifth amendment.  To defend the first.
1	the advise given to me so far has proven to be right on target as to fixing a few minor problems , results have been very good, feeling much better
-1	My primary physician has all the best intentions and is a very nice person. I like him personally but he has misdiagnosed me on two different occasions and this has had a negative impact on my trust level.  
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never steered me in the wrong direction.  I have had this same doctor for several years.

-1	to be honest I have really never trusted doctors  but the doctor I have I trust him sometimes I have my doubts about him but he really seems to know what he is doing and I guess I trust him more than I would any other doctor 
-1	Doctors can be trusted but sometimes I feel they prescribe medications because they get a kickback whenever a patient buys a prescription for a medication they have written a prescription for. I feel that there are alternative solutions for some medical problems that will work just as well.
1	I trust my doctor because she went to school for a very  long time and she knows alot more then I know about anything
1	he was able to get me better when I was si ill and he told me what was going on  with my body and every thing he has told me had help me get better
-1	I've only been to her one time but she was very nice and listen to what I said but didn't seem to do much of an examination but it was just an initial first time visit
-1	Some times it's as if some doctors need someone to experiment on. Some don't even know how to diagnose correctly. Very skeptical about making appointments or even going to the emergency room because of it.

-1	I recognize that doctors have bad days or hold onto rigid views.  At the same time, I admire their minds and dedication. I trust my own views more than a doctor's about some things, e.g., nutrition.  But when it comes to serious illness, I would listen to their recommendations and take them under advisement.
-1	she's good at most stuff but doesn't believe that certain conditions exist or that treatment not conventional would be helpful.  but she does listen pretty well and has quickly diagnosed some critical problems so she's a keeper.
-1	in this day and age many physicians are more beholden to outside interests such as insurance and drug companies than they are to their patients.
1	She has been very thorough and asks questions about me personally we have a good relationship she checks me out 
-1	My doctor has proven a lot of times that he tries to treat me the best possible way available and I tend to trust him because of it. 
1	I have not seen a doctor in 8 years.I feel stress often but after seeing what kind of stress they go through,I will take on my own issues.
-1	The doctor does his best but must be a good listener and read between the words to understand me and be a good judge of what will work a long time.
-1	"He is often in a hurry to get to the next patient and does a poor job of explaining my condition/medication and shows no sympathy.  Just because someone is a ""doctor"" does not mean they are any good.  "
-1	Pt was also educated about the importance of compliance with psychiatric treatment and need for regular follow ups to check on response to meds and seems to understand the same. She was also educated about the importance of abstinence from illegal and intoxicating drugs, like alcohol. Consider addition of Lamictal vs abilify in the future. F/up in 2 week, get records, safety plan discussed.
-1	my doctor does not tell me choices I need to figure out the options that I can choose from.  I have side effects
1	My doctor has my best interest at heart and through what i have encountered this past year my doctor has showed consistently over and over that there is care and concern

-1	"I know multiple cases of healthcare providers that pressure doctors to perform ""low risk"" treatments that have ultimately harmed their patient in the long run until     their insurance ran out. This is an issue with insurance companies, however the medical profession seems to be tied with them on some level."
1	My current physician seems trustworthy and has given me good recommendations to improve my everyday health which have been working. 
-1	My primary care physician is part of a large group. I feel my appointments are sometimes rushed, that I get certain tests because of age or other reasons, not because it's warranted. It feels like a 'doctor shop' without personalized attention. The specialist I see often cites outdated information, and doesn't seem to listen to my issues
-1	I feel that she is too busy , pressured to not spend enough time. She frequently refers me to a specialist so that my medical information is scattered
-1	My doctor gives you options and lets you pick what is best for you. So if he said this is the only option I would most likely believe him. Plus he would probably refer me to a specialist. So I would have a second opinion with the specialist.
-1	i trust as i use the primary care physican for years and my family has as well. a stellar reputation in the area . Plus the hospita affilation is strong with good rep there as well
1	I have used the same PCP for many years. He cares about his patients and researches each out of the ordinary problem and comes up with the best answer.
1	Because me and my doctor are able to go over every ingient so I will have a better understanding what each one does
-1	"I usually trust certain doctors depending on howe well they listen to me, but doctors who talk over me make me mad. My GP she patronizes me and its sooooo aggrevating. She wil also say, ""Im not your mama, so you should be doing this or thta but Im not your mama.....Im like ..look lady my mama is dead, so can you please stop bringing that up everytime I see you?

1	I trust my physician because he is a Christian. He is always up beat and nice to me. He knows my health condition and treats me accordingly.

-1	I don't distrust my primary physician, he just doesn't completely understand how to handle my current condition. He tends to defer to my other doctors, who I don't trust much at all.

1	She has always treated with respect. Explained her answers to questions I had about my health in terms I could understand
-1	Because they think they know everything and they dont. We are not at the brink of medical technology. They still dont have a cure for the common cold.
1	In regards to Doctors in general, based on my families experience, they were very reliable.They benefited (my family) On the judgement of the Physicisn
1	My doctor is non- judgmental and honest. She even shares stories about her in college so she seems relatable.
1	I trust her as she does not insist on any medication that we do not feel that we need.  We are not much on taking medication that we feel has adverse side effects.  Thankfully we do not need a lot of medication.
1	I don't general have trust in many or all doctors, but in my primary doctor I do.  When I have my yearly physical each year, he doesn't rush me and always listens, and patiently answers any questions I might have. 
-1	I trust my doctor to make the right decisions based on their training and knowledge but doctors are human and still make mistakes
1	I just changed to a new doctor and she is very caring. She was very patient when I saw her for the first time. She took time to listen to my concerns and started an immediate plan of action. So far, her plan of action is working and I'm starting to feel better.
-1	I think he's just motivated by the dollar. Doesn't care if I die, just wants to prescribe me items that he gets a kickback on.
1	I just started to see my new doctor & hadn't been to a doctor in a # of years, but she seems very thorough about testing me for almost everything.

-1	My doctor is caring and compassionate to say the least. They have my back at all times and i appreciate it very much
1	I trust them because I have a gut that I use and it is always right. Also they are honest and incredibly amazing. My doctors always try to make me calm and happy. I love that about my doctors they are there to help me nothing else.
-1	My doctors are the professionals, & I am supposed to be able to totally trust them.  Since I am a diabetic, I have to take more insulin than my endocrinologist actually tells me to.
1	My doctor takes the time to listen and help me she doesn't try to rush you out the door. When she isn't familiar with an issue she will find out about it and then help you 
-1	I feel to believe, my primary care physician, is good at what they does. I feel confident, when it comes to advise from them.
-1	Usually I trust my doctor for respecting his knowledge at least, but still I have some opinions, I will depend on him in severe conditions
1	I have been seeing my PCP for years and with my complex medical history they have always been very good about discussing my options and letting me decide.
1	I trust my child's physician because she has been with her since birth and does and amazing job at always explaining the immunization and anything else she will do or we should be concerned about

-1	I don't like being pushed to have flu shots and also having to take certain medications for 'maintenance' reasons.
1	There is no reason to not be honest about any conditions. I see a physician once a year and take no medications, so there's nothing much to tell.
-1	I feel he listens to my concerns and takes the time to listen to what I have to say and clearly explain my options.
-1	Don't have a primary physician at the time. Don't take the time to really know me and what have led to any problems I am now experiencing.
-1	She seems overburdened, yawns a lot during our visit. I'm just not sure that she's all that engaged. Does spend a good amount of time and is very nice. Just not sure how much she really gets done though
-1	Doctors know more than the low class so they are going to organize and make references to medical advice based on the economy and budget.
1	My doctor always takes time with me and ask my feelings towards things. They have never misguided me and always seem to have my best interest in mind.
1	Past experiences in hospital and evaluations,Help given to family and friends,hospital meeting to discuss treatment and future options
-1	Being in an HMO I feel cost concerns sometimes trump procedures that should be done Doctor sometimes seems rushed and spends too much time on his computer instead of talking to me.
-1	I trust my doctor, but i trust myself more. I know me and what's right for me better than my doctor does. 
-1	I have only had my PCP for  a short time so we are still in the trust building stage - more to be determined after further diagnosis and treatments.
-1	I hardly ever see a doctor because my health  clinic has mostly nurse practitioners.  I do trust their judgement but they don't have the experience and training that doctor's have.  When I ask to see a specialist it very seldom happens unless I keep asking.  In conclusion I trust my nurse practitioner in general but would like to see a doctor sometimes.
-1	It is not that I mistrust my doctor but I do need let him make all my decisions for me.   If they prescribe me a medication I research it thoroughly before I decide to take it or not.    I am more in favor of hollistic medicine so I always look for a natural way to help my problem.   Medical doctors only want to give you more pills and I am afraid of the side effects so sometimes I do not take them and seek   a natural way of treating my problem
1	I have always trusted my primary care doctor as she listens to me when I talk and always asks me if I understand the treatment/ etc.  She makes sure that I know about all my health issues.
1	My doctor listens well. He all test needed. Though I think he may have to many patients. At times I feel rushed.
1	I trust my doctor because he is very thorough at each visit. He wanted to do 3 month check ups and I kept on saying months. He finally agreed to 6 months if I agreed to come back soon er if I needed to so I did and it never lasts the 6 months. He was going to admit me to the hospital and he had all the paper work done and they even had a room for me when I got there. He wanted me to go in an ambulance and I said I couldn't afford so I went in a personal vehicle.
1	I trust my doctor as he has never led me wrong, He listens to me and isn't showing me the door for his next patient..within reason of course...He has been my primary care Doctor for 8 yrs. and he's the best one I have ever had...
-1	 I have no reason thus far not to trust his ability to treat me as a patient. He takes his time during my visit and goes over all my medicines, problems and all. Gives his opinion on things and together we decide on the best treatment plan.
1	My primary care physician is thorough and never overlooks so she has ample time to spend with her patients. 
1	She's never steered me wrong.  She takes as much times with me as she feels is needed, she's extremely thorough and understands my condition well.
-1	I have a physician that is not bothered by all my questions that I ask or bothered when I ask for alternative options available to me.  He explains everything in a way that I can understand and make a logical decision.
1	all doctors are not created equal; some are better than other my own doctor is very trust worthy i completely  trust him
-1	I trust doctors in general because I feel like they have the knowledge and experience to make sure that my health condition improves. 
-1	I feel that they have my best interests at heart. I do not go to doctors that don't listen to what I have to say
-1	They want to see patients more quickly to make more money so they aren't careful or thoughtful. Some healthcare professionals are also judgemental if you do or don't do something that's right.
1	I haven't had him long but so far he is very caring and listens to what I have to say.  I bring a list of questions when I go and he lets me ask and gives thoughtful answers.  Doesn't blow me off like some.
1	"Since my first visit, post-diagnosis, my Oncologist has taken the time to thoroughly explain all treatment options, along with the associated benefits and side effects.  He advises which treatment course he recommends and then discusses any questions for concerns I may have.  I am now 8 months past what I like to call my ""expiration date"" of 7 - 14 months life expectancy, on my second treatment option and controlling side effects efficiently with minimal use of additional pharmaceuticals, as my wish s to control my cancer with as few chemicals as absolutely necessary and my Oncologist completely supports that as my choice."
-1	The reason I trust my primary care physician is because he gives me the right info I need to staying fit and the right ways to make sure I don't screw up on being healthy.
1	I've been with my primary care doctor for a number of years, and feel he does have my best interests at heart... he takes enough time with me at every visit, and will answer any question I have. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because she always takes time to listen to my concerns and explain things.  She also doesn't dismiss my feelings and thoroughly checks things out.
1	Doctors are great people who you can trust. I know I trust my physician with my life. Never let me down. 
1	I have went through hip replacement serg and my Drs were very helpful, explaining everything to me. I trusted what they had to say and I followed their advice 
1	Because one Doctor put me on medicine that would kill me, didn't believe my medical records.  And couldn't be bothered to ask.  Reduced my faith in everyone in the medical profession
1	He is always up front with me and he explains thing's so I can understand what he is talking about. He really seems to care about my health. If he's not sure what is going on he will send me to a specialty doctor to find out what is going on. 
-1	Doesn't take enough time to discuss options & doesn't follow up. Cannot trust and I have to research everything to be certain I am getting the correct treatment. And/or get a second opinion.
-1	Doctors' relationship with big pharma inhibits some from providing the right treatment when providing the most beneficial (for them) treatment is a better career and fnancial move. 
-1	I trust my Dr. But sometimes they need to take people serious and learn about a disease instead of blowing it off.
-1	i trust me primary care physician because they provide my health information and perscribe my appointments.
-1	I've only seen my PCP twice, and trust takes times to build. I like my Dr. Very much, and believe that I will trust him in time. He has a good bedside manner and appears to genuinely care about me . 
1	My doctor I found to be honest with me, taking precautions so that if something is wrong we can correct it in the easiest way rather then going to the extreme (operation) to correct it. He seems to cares and calls me as soon as the results for a test are available.
-1	Overall, I trust my doctor because I know they are knowledgeable and have years of training experience. However, I don't feel that my doctor sees me as an individual and will always give the best treatment option
1	up until now everything my dotor has told me and prescribed, has been right on the money.  i trust her completely as to her ability 
1	My primary care physician is very good at listening.  She listens to any input tht I have and we make a plan of action.
1	My doctor is very thorough and takes the time to meticulously ask questions and make sure she has all the facts before treating me.  She is never in a rush, and is always honest and up front with me regarding conditions and medications.
1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR VERY MUCH - I KNOW THAT THE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE PRESCRIBED FOR ME HELP ME.  I KNOW THAT MY DOCTOR TAKES THE TIME TO GO OVER MY HEALTH ISSUES AND PROBLEMS.
1	My primary doctor is good at her job and seems to be open and honest about what I need and what is best for me.
1	I trust my primary care physician to do what is best for me when he knows my situation .  Ask the right  questions and be concerned about what is going on 
1	i trust them because there honest and genuine and really nice also they really care about my health and well being 
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She is very knowledgeable about a lot of conditions. The only thing I'm not thrilled about is she tries to get me to take medicine I don't want, instead of looking at natural options first. I know she was trained that way, but I want to try to heal naturally instead of using medicine.
1	My doctor was referred to me by another doctor who spoke extremely highly of him and had nothing but excellent things to say about him.
1	She is thorough, thoughtful and knowledgeable. My health is good. I have no data that argues for mis-trusting her
-1	I've had a reoccurring issue, and I feel like im not being taken seriously. Nothings been diagnosed. Ive been given no assistance, or alternatives
-1	No matter where I go it seems doctors and facilities are more concerned about expediency and cost than care.
-1	I trust most of the things a doctor tells me. But they are human and can make mistakes.If it is serious,getting a second opinion is a good idea.
1	I have been in the hospital more than I can ever think of, and every time I go to the hospital, my doctor is the best that I have ever found
1	My doctor is very good.  He kind of reminds me of the 'old fashioned' type who would actually take on your health care.  I know that I still must stay tuned to my body and it's needs it's just nice having someone like Dr. Kang who takes it seriously.
1	My doctor takes a good deal of time to sit with me, answer my questions and advise me about courses of treatment when necessary. She has not steered me wrong in any of my medical issues.
-1	Many doctors follow the western methods of treatment: cut, burn, poison. Still others, are constrained by the medical system they are in.
1	I trust my primary physician because he will let you know if he is unfamiliar with a condition and wii arrange for you to see someone else 
-1	I have had bad experiences with medical doctors in the past.  I never assume a doctor knows what they are doing or has my best interest at heart.
-1	My doctor urges me to do treatments that will cost the most and does things to her convenience. But she tells me everything I need to know.
-1	My prenatal care experience did not always fully inform and in some areas misinformed or sometimes gave bad recommendations.  
1	I trust the doctors I have for my various needs. I like to do my own research and ask lots of questions if I don't understand something. Sometimes, my doctors aren't completely aware of what I've researched and our opinions are different, but for the most part, I trust my doctors to have my best interests.
1	She has been thorough with my care and has earned my trust. Most doctors have not been able to do that. 
-1	doctors and hospitals are greedy and profit-driven and are no longer dedicated towards helping patients
-1	Doctors make mistakes, MRI's don't show things correctly sometimes and doctors believe the MRI's more then listen to what I am telling them.  Doctors don't consider that I know what I am talking about, and they just assume I am not communicating the symptoms correctly. 
-1	He always refers me out to specialists/it seems he is reserved about making some decisions about my health issues
-1	I believe doctors will sometimes skip over something in a hurry to get to the next patient. I do not have any severe illness, but if I did, I would not take the word about care from my primary I would seek out a 2nd and maybe even a third opinion from a specialist.
1	I HAVE COMPLETE TRUST IN MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. HE IS KIND  AND IS ALWAYS OUT FOR MY GOOD BEING  MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN ANSWERS ALL MY QUESTIONS AND IS VERY HONEST.
-1	I have worked with doctors for years, they are people with problems and attitudes and unrealistic goals also.  MY OBgyn is useless. 
-1	I have a history with the doctor I see every month, and so far he listens to me, authorizes diagnostic tests when I have problems, and discusses results with me when he gets them.
-1	I trust my doctor but will also do independent research to see if there are other options that my doctor is not aware of.  I also prefer to discuss medications with a pharmacist.
-1	I trust him because he has never steered me wrong he has taken his time taking care of my medical needs and he answers all my questions honestly iv never had any problems with him 
-1	He doesn't know my history even though I've been seeing him for years. I have had the same complaint for 3 years and he has done nothing to find a cause. 
-1	seems like i am rushed n and put... wont stay to answer ,y question... seems pissed or upset if i do
-1	There are no problems with any of the health care people i have, they understand what iI need and supple it.
-1	I believe that doctors try to give the best advice but they are also human and thus are prone or at least able to make mistakes.
1	my docter is very good at what she does. she knows exactly how to treat me. and what I need to do to stay healthy.
1	I trust my physician because I know that they will do what I ask. They are very trustworthy and I know they will do everything they can to help me
1	She is knowledgeable, thorough, and rated a top doctor in our area.  Therefore I trust her to recommend proper treatments, medications, and procedures that I may need.  She is also good at answering  my questions and keeping he records of my past visits.;;
-1	My regular doctor knows what i need and has never been wrong. The hospital doctors on the other hand just send me away with what ever they feel like saying that day and send you home with out treating you.
-1	I'm unsure how I feel about my physician because I rarely see her. I trust her to give me good advice because that is her job.
-1	The reason I do not have trust in my doctor is because they rush through the appointment becaus ehe more peopla see means more money they make. The quality is poor.
-1	"I have had the same primary care physician for over ten years now, and he has slowly been losing my trust over the years. I have seen him often over the years and have grown tired of him telling me he can make me feel better or that I will be back to my ""old self"" soon. It never happens. I don't trust that he knows how to help me. "
-1	they do not make money of of me not coming back. they need to know i will come back. they took an oath to help people and do what is right
1	the last dr. i had was nice but she left but i'm supposed to have another woman dr. i think that is a plus for me.the former dr. listened and spent time with me and was on time.
1	So far things my doctor recommends have worked. I don't always take everything prescribed though.  She always answers all my questions 
-1	He takes the time to listen and then to explain. He asks me questions to understand me and is most often correct.
1	I have been with  my primacy care physician for 14 years.  He has been with me every step of the way during my cancer surgery and treatments and has shown a great depth of interest in my well being.  He was very understanding and compassionate during that time and extremely helpful as always.
1	She hasn't stirred me wrong as yet, I feel confident in her abilities to what is right for me. I trust my Doctor very much.
1	In today's world and insurance drs have to turn alotbof patients Not only have I never been rushed through an appt but the dr never forgets to ask about my family When called I always receive a call back the same day
-1	I have been misdiaganosied a few times. I had a stroke and was told go home and rest it was a pinched nerve. My doctor does not listen well and does not trust I know my own body. I have been told many times I dont have something like kidney stones and after tests confirmed that i do.
-1	I do not generally trust or distrust people, doctors included.  It depends on the individual doctor, the condition/issue, the degree to which that professional is (or is not) already behind schedule, on overload, in a hurry, worried, etc.  They are human, after all.  My doctor is quite thorough; in part I suspect it is her way of assuring she stays on track and covers everything though it sometimes seems to be at a cost to whatever my particular agenda might be during a given visit.  We have worked it out that she does her routine questions and I bring a list of my issues, so both of us has time.  This seems to be effective, though it would be wasted in a rotating medico situation where one did not see the same physician regularly.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician yet I realize that any final decisions about my health (including treatments, medicines, etc.) are my choice to make.  Doctors are there to help the patients, give them advice, and so forth.  It is up to the patient to also rely on him or herself for health care.
-1	I don't trust most doctors. They just see you for like maybe 5 minutes and then get rid of you with meds.
-1	I trust my doctor to help me make decisions in regards to my emotional health and physical health. I am comfortable asking questions about things.
1	I think that doctors in general have your best interests in common and that you should trust them generally speaking to help you whenever you need it.  You should follow any and all instructions that they give you under most circumstances unless you feel you might need a second opinion from another doctor.
1	my doctor always takes the time to explain all  my options to me all what happens with each option  he is very patient with me and my questions
-1	My doctor seems to want to help treat patients but applies his personal beliefs too often and wants me to mentally overcome certain aliments or rely on God.
-1	I don't have a primary doctor so these don't really apply to me personally. I think a primary care doctor is more reliable than an error doctor because they're less rushed and spend more one on one time with patients
1	When I was recently seriously ill, he figured out what was wrong and gave me several solutions and suggestions. When I follow his orders, I feel great.
1	I trust my physician. He encourages questions and respects my preference for natural alternatives to prescribed services.
-1	Doctors have expertise in field of medicine, have completed training, and continue to train when new science is applicable, where I on the other hand do not have any experience in the medical field. 
-1	My dr only cares about getting out of your room and on to the next person. I am looking for a new dr. At the moment.
-1	this is part of a doctor's education and the Hippocratic oath, the only problem I have in trust is when insurance circumstances limit what's open or if the doctor doesn't seem to be aware of costs (this has not happened for some time)
1	They have the knowledge and understand the best course of treatment for whatever is medically wrong with me.
1	I have know my primary care physician for a long time and have the utmost trust in him in treating all my health issues. 
1	I have always felt my doctor has been totally open and honest with me.  I have never felt rushed.  I feel like I can tell her anything and will get an truthful answer back.
-1	I don't know him very well yet, but I think he will be a good fit to handle my complex medical needs.
-1	Cause there's no guarantee in what a physician tells you about your state of health and also rely on yourself to take of a health matter that is important to a cause or effect to see how a health matter is a concern to a individual in certain situations.
1	they dont listen to what you try to tell them, when you try to tell them how you feel and what meds you need they dont wanna try to make you feel better
-1	I trust them and they usuallt have my best interest at heart... i love doctors and believe they gerenally are good and have my best interest at heart
-1	My PCP only takes 5 minutes with me, asks me a couple of questions, fills out a prescription slip and quickly leaves the room. I do not feel she is acting in my best interests, and she does not listen to me. I react very badly to most manufactured pharmaceuticals, my doctor knows this and keeps trying to insist I try newer meds. Every single time I switch doctors they want to try this. I flatly refuse as I know how ill they will make me. My attitude is... if it's not broken, don't fix it!  I have met very few doctors that actually take the time to listen and really HEAR what I am saying. All I want is a diagnosis and I will treat myself with natural remedies, if possible.  
1	I trust him because he has the knowledge and I have told him everything about me. I don't think he would give me the wrong information about any treatment he would suggest.
1	I have total trust in my primary care physician because he did extensive test during my first visit and was able to make diagnosis that other Doctors had not been able to make. They did not do any of the test that the Doctor I have now performed. That is why I have full confidence in the Doctor that I have now. 
-1	kickbacks, bribes, drug deals, side effects, over booking, arrogant about their importance, believe their own lies hate it when others done.  do not care for clients health because when they are healthy doctors and hospitals, insurance companies and drug companies do not make money from them
-1	They don't know anything about real health.  They mostly just make decisions based on money and convenience.
-1	they are only after money not my health care needs with out money they wouldn't give me the time of day.
1	I trust my primary care physician because we have been in a dr patient relationship for some time and have gotten to know each other pretty well she listens to me and we don't always agree but come to a workable solution 
1	has always been to the point and forth rite in dealing with me in all of my health concerns even now that I have a rare terminal condition
-1	At times I feel I can trust doctors but there have been times that I have been uncertain with a few doctors.
-1	There have been times where I left the doctor's office without a diagnosis, without any assistance in dealing with my medical issue.  When I went for a lower back pain, I left with instruction to drink lots of water, but no indication to go for physical therapy, which is what I needed.
-1	I might trust them if they seem professional enough. But might not if they wind up  telling me or doing something to me that might not help me.
-1	been dealing with my doctor for along time trust what she says                                                        
-1	I always have to call and remind my Dr. of things we already discussed.  In someways they are good, but still needs some work.  I don't like it when they screw up the Rx's or don't place the orders.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician, but have no problem with trusting a doctor with my care, as I have in the past.
-1	well, I need trust of doctor due to better criteria about some item or procedures about healt. then I feel good with this
1	I have never had a problem with anything my doctor has recommended or prescribed for me for any conditions.
1	ive had past xperiences with my physician like a family doctor.and my doctor tells me everything that i need to know about my condition.
1	He has always given me good advice and I trust him to help me make medical decisions.  Everything he has told me has worked out for the best.
1	I have been going to the same Doctor for 20+ years I have total trust in him he has always helped me whenever needed
-1	They are often too busy to give patients the time needed to thoroughly discuss patient options or concerns.
1	I feel that with all his training and years of practice he does know what is best for me and tries to help with any problems I may have.  Once in a while we don't agree but can work something out that we can both agree upon.
1	My GP lives down the street from my parents.  He goes to my church and his children are the same age I am.  He has known me for over 20 years, and is both an exceptional person and physician.
1	My doctor is a really nice guy, very competent, and is open and honest with me about my treatment and diagnoses
-1	I don't really have a relationship with my Primary Care Physician. I probably would mostly trust. I respect their knowledge.
-1	They are pressured by time to see the next patient. They have limitations from keeping up with every change in science and medicines. 
1	My doctor takes time to listen to me and takes time to explain things to me. He us very caring and very through 
1	I trust my PCP because when it comes to his patients he is very thoural. He does what is best for the patient. He also discuss a plan of care with his patients.
1	He knows me, been a patient for years and never had a bad experience. He is kind, a Christian and I trust everything he says.
-1	Sometimes she will give quick fixes to a problem instead of finding a long-term answer or resolution.
1	she has been taking care of me for 10 years and I trust her completely.  She always listens and helps me with whatever is going on
1	He has been my Doctor, and my friend, for many years.  He was also my Mother and my husbands doctor.  I also knew him when he was a resident at the hospital that I worked at when he came to my floor as a student
-1	I am not one to question life I take what it gives me and when life gives me lemons a I take em and make some damn lemonade out of em
1	I trust my physician because he seems very thorough with his exams and questions for me.  He listens to me and seems to have my best interests.
-1	She listens to my needs and trys to get to the root of the problem and orders tes%s if applicable and she if affiliated with the neareat hospital
1	She will spend as much time as necessary with all her patients, so you dont mind the wait, because she listens to all your concerns and will suggest a specialist for anythig out of hr expertise.
-1	No human is infallible, and too often people in positions of power, such as a doctor, can get a bonus for encouraging certain courses of behavior. I like to do my own, unbiased research instead of blindly following new orders. 
-1	they worry more about the general public or what people think about things a prime example to me is pain meds 
1	Listen to my questions by verbal or notes and they give me eye contact not ignore me and also give me advice of things to try out before the next step and have me at times look up information on line if I don't understand what they are talking about
-1	I live in Racine WI. Our primary hospital was bought out by Wheaton Fransiscan. They refused to pay the best doctors what they are worth, so, hence, those doctors left town. They were replaced by doctors who got bs and cs in college. Many have a very hard to understand accent. ALL act like they are on a stopwatch
-1	I think doctors ca n be trusted in general. I do think they hurry you out more quickly than they should to maintain their schedule...which is wrong. I think doctors rely ro heavily on the patient to know what to ask, instead of asking the pertinent questions themselves
-1	I do not trust anyone off the bat you have to earn that trust is not free in this world it has to be proven
-1	I don't have a primary care doctor. Why not? Because I basically don't trust them, they did no good for my mom, told her it was all in her head. She had MS
1	I trust doctor she's very trusting and she's knows what my condition going to be and what medication to take and keep up to date with it
-1	This doctor now I have is new; so I don't know very well but my last primary care doctor; who just recently retired, always sat down with me and explained the pros and cons of each action he wanted me to take or not take.
-1	trust because they should know what they are doing in there field. if they don't then they don't need to be in the health field
1	I have a very good doctor, we have been together for over 20 years. H knows my case history and is a very good doctor
-1	I have been with my doctor for over 13 years.  He has been with me from the worst (near death) to my health as of today.  I do have a complex medical history and he will check on the computer just to see if I was in the ER or Urgent Care and will follow up with me if needed.  I feel that my doctor is going far above his help for me.  And I really agree with that.  It is not always a happy road.  We may argue about some of the treatments, but we always come to an answer to the problem.  To me, that is a very big trust in my doctor.
-1	My doctor is real friendly & will answer all of my questions. She seems to really care about her patients. 
1	never met a doctor who is as thorough or takes the time with me to male sure i understand everything going on with my condition
1	My doctor ask a lot of question and does a good job in knowing what is wrong with me or if something is going on.  Never in a hurry.  Goes over info with me.
-1	Sometimes I feel doctors in general cannot recommend the best course of treatment for a patient if he or she doesn't have health insurance.
-1	Sometimes I feel like certain doctors I have been to, just want to get you out of the room. They don't seem to be paying attention to what I am saying. 
-1	he is totally trained and professional, educated about what he does and he does it well. Seems to care about my problems and researches everything  quite well and very thouroughly. Cares about me as a patient.
-1	Previous experience in which a major medical issue was overlooked for years resulted in me not trusting doctors
-1	My GP is relatively new to the practice, so I have not had to see her very often, thus cannot rate her as totally trustworthy.  My encounters have been productive and useful.
1	I trust my doctor because he/she allows me to make decisions within my rights, but makes recommendations  that he feels would best suit my body and well being. 
1	Sometimes I don't think he tells me everything I should know. It seems the doctor knows everything about you but is unwilling to tell you what he knows. The seem to hide your charts from you and sometimes never tell you your blood pressure or really how you are doing.
1	My Dr explains the good and the bad.She's doesn't sugar coat anything. I trust her,she's easy to talk to
1	My doctor has always been honest with me and he is very humble. If he doesn't know what's wrong, he will say so and have another doctor come in for a second opinion. 
-1	I have hypothyroidism and my doctor does not like to go above what's the current dosing which I believe is what I need in order for it to be effective
-1	They have put in a lot of work to get where they are in their field. They are going to make sure they are doing their job right.
1	I have an excellent doctor who always takes all the time I need at my appointments and from past experience has been very helpful in any condition I am seeing him to be treated.  Feel very comfortable and trust his decisions in my care.
-1	I trust my doctor as far as he wants the best for me. However, he is limited in what he knows. He does not want to say outright that he does not know what to do but he just doesn't know everything. There is just too much to know that no one man can grasp it all. He will suggest herbal supplements but he is not knowledgable about them. He only knows his drug options. I really only go to him when I think I know what is wrong and he can verify it with blood tests or something.
-1	To me it seems like my doctor is always looking out for the best interest of me and my health. My doctor has been there the past few years and most of my major medical issues and has given me excellent advise that I have followed and improved my overall health.
1	Doctors are generally better educated and up to what's current in health care.  I have trusted my doctor for many years now.  He was the first one to recognize that I needed surgery.
1	They have proven to be thorough and caring in the way they handle me and my health problems, they have never given me any cause for doubt and have a good open bedside manner.
1	I trust Mt physician because they are very thorough and tell me the truth they answer my questions at all times
-1	I have been around the medical community for a long time and would trust the training of doctors more than myself or the internet. 
1	I trust my oncologist to treat me in a way that if best for me. She makes sure I understand everything and takes the time to listen and respond in a way that is clear to me.  I feel that she cares and does not rush me through my appointments.
1	I trust my physician because he knows everything about me and he gives the correct treatment what ever you are suffer
-1	I have made substantial progress with my physician in reaching my health goals.  We have good communication between both of us
-1	tnhey have the knowledge and training and should know what is for the best for thier patients whether they do or not
1	been with my doctor for 5 years and he's great at what he does always answers my questions and my commonlaw wife has him also a a primary physician
-1	I believe most doctors only have the patient's best interest in mind. I just don't believe you can trust any one completely.
-1	My Doctor is so very busy that she has some helpers that see her patients. They are good at what they do I suppose, and it is easy to see them for an appointment. I do wonder if they know my health as well as my Doctor. 
-1	I knew that my physician was honest and caring when he called me at home to check on how I was doing. He is a straight talker - doesn't sugar coat anything but is still kind in delivery (even with unpleasant news). He never seems in a hurry to be done with an appointment. 
-1	"i think more than the majority of doctors care about their patients but that they are stretched in time needed to actually give the right amount of time to the care of a lot of situations and rushed. i have to trust in the doctors i have. some are better than others but the extent of what is needed to become a doctor entitles the doctor to depend on that trust and my giving it to him. if i knew what was wrong with me, i wouldn't need a doctor but i do know my body and what is going on in it and need to let him know so he knows where to start to ""fix"" me, and also follow his directions. it does make it hard to trust anyone that is in charge of your health and how you feel, live or die when they have not the time to really know their patients and sometimes therefore form clinical decisions that are not necessarily the best answer for them causing the patient to mistrust his doctor. i feel i have no trust but to try to or change doctors."
1	We have known him for over 20 years and two wonderful children and he has never been wrong with us. We trust him with our lives and children
-1	They have experience but very alert of some doctors but mostly they are trustful and put their patients first 
1	I have a long relationship with my doctor.  I have every confidence in her ability to research and diagnose conditions.  She is a very respected and knowledgeable phycisian
-1	Because if he doesn't come through with being honest, I will own him...I will sue him into oblivion, and I will have his medical license yanked.
1	my primary care physician takes time to talk to me and helps me understand what the medications she prescribes are for and how they can help me. she seems to care about my health.
-1	I am neutral in regard to this question, for I at the present time do not possess a primary care physician.
-1	I do trust most things she tells me, but feel she does not take the time to be thorough in her assessments. She always seems to be in a great hurry to be done with the exam.
-1	healthcare profession is doing the best that it can, the situation at times for them can be limiting and handcuff much of the industry.
1	I have been going to my doctor for the last 26 years.  He is a fabulous doctor and I trust him in every way!!
-1	I rely on my doctor to select what s/he thinks are the three best treatment options for me based on what s/he knows about me.  However, I expect her/him to review the pros and cons of each option, entertain my question/s and then let me pick the treatment that I think is best for me.  If my medical professional can not help me navigate that process then I do not trust him/her and would look for a new PCP.
-1	Doctors spend minimal time with their patients and don't devote honest care to them. They always seem really busy. 
-1	i trust my doctor - he has never lied to me and always is there when i need him - i can call and get an appointment the day i call
-1	I do not really have a doctor.  I have a physician's assistant.  There is a doctor there, and he is listed on my card.  However, I do not see him.  I see the physician's assistant.   She is very considerate and helpful.  If I have a need for anything, I can email her which is very helpful because it is hard for me to hear on the phone.  She usually gets back to me in a good amount of time.  She answers my questions the best she can.  
-1	I trust my Dr to a certain extent, I don't believe in taking so many different medications just to treat minor issues

1	I have been with him a long time and totally trust him with my care, medical advice, treatments and recommendations.
1	"Because my primary doctor sent me to a specialist, I have a second opinion that concurs with her conclusions and course of treatment so I trust my doctor.

-1	I generally just my primary care physician, because I've had good experiences with her for the most part, but she did let me down in a big way recently and that's shaken my trust in her.

1	I have a long relationship with my family doctor.  He is an internist in family medicine.  He looks for possible problems developing down the road and speaks freely with me.

He will call on a Sunday afternoon and say I was just reviewing your chart and I think we should do.....He is board certified and makes me feel confident in his decisions.

1	You ask him a question and he answers with plain English.  If he doesn't know something he will tell you and look it up.

-1	I trust drs because as a general rule I think they will do what is best for you. If for no other reason so they can keep your business.
1	My primary care doctor is thorough and caring.  He never rushes my visit and always asks a number of questions about my various health issues.
1	I formerly disliked, feared, and distrusted doctors. I have recently found a new primary care physician in whom I have complete trust and great respect for. Doctor Hekman at Cleveland Clinic has completely changed my feelings about doctors. He is knowledgeable and compassionate especially regarding my being a transgender woman.
-1	I have trust in them for the most part. However, I also know my body and don't just simply take them at their word when they say everything is normal or ok
-1	I get a long well with all of my Dr's, If I do not trust them I will get another Dr.I also listen to other peoples opinions on what they think of the Dr's
1	I trust my doctor for two reasons: 1) I have close family members who have been patients of his for many years all of whom highly respect and trust him, and 2) I have been his patient since moving to this town four years ago, and have never had reason to doubt or question his diagnosis, or opinions. when he makes a decision, he ALWAYS asks MY opinion of it, and if I have any questions about it. He is always willing to spend the time to listen and explain everything to my satisfaction.
-1	I use the v.a hospital for my Drs. I just moved from Michigan to Tennessee & the Dr here is not staying on her job very well
-1	My primary care physician wasn't honest in a medical report over a small issue which causes a patient to mistrust!

-1	I dont have one. Cause I dont want one. I take care of me. No medicnes here EVER.I know what it is the best for me. A doctor dont.
-1	The doctors ive seen lately come in the room like a tornado .they are always in a huge hurry theres no way they can properly diagnose patients 
1	I trust him because over the years we have built a relationship the is both honest and respectful.  At no time have I had reason to doubt his expertise
-1	I trust hee because she is a specialist but i have done everything she asked me to regarding changes my diet and takon medications and gettung tests done but she never calls to check how im feeling or gets to results
-1	I give them the benefit of doubt.  They are schooled doctors and took this profession to help people. Why would I not trust?
-1	They have an education and experience that cars outweighs any medical knowledge I have so I trust them to lead me in the right directions  
1	Have had the same doctor for years and is always patient and never rushes. Has called the house even to check after a hospital release and called my husband to make sure we were settled
-1	I just do because they talk and ask me questions so they are really educated on that kind of stuff that makes me feel reassured
1	My doctor always takes his time with me. He talks about everything I need to talk about and do not need to talk about.
1	My doctor always takes the time tot talk to me.  I never feel rushed.  She will take all the time necessary.  She will answer any questions that I have very thoroughly.  Over time, she has won my trust by doing right by me.
1	My doctor takes the time to explain things to me. He gives me options and gives his honest opinion about them.
-1	"Trust is a two way street.  The doctors do not trust you when you are in pain.  Because they do not trust you when you are in pain, the doctors decide that it is a good thing to poke and prod you until you actually scream.  After they hear you scream, they then decide that ""oh, maybe you are in pain"". That is when you will be given a hand full of papers otherwise known as referrals, to go to a place where they do x-rays.  After signing in with them, you have to fill out all of the paperwork once again.  It is a tedious job to continue to fill out the same forms over and over again.  The referral doctor takes the x-rays, and tells you to make an appointment with your original (primary) doctor.  The doctor that tells you to make the appointment with the primary doctor will then read your x-rays and send the results to your primary doctor. It seems to me that the primary (original) doctor is just sending you back and forth to different doctors to get additional payments from the insurance company.  I just do not trust any doctor.......they are all out for themselves."
1	She actually cares, she listens to resolve instead of listening to respond. She allows me to speak and fully explain myself without cutting me off like most doctors. 
-1	I really love my primary care physician. She is careful and thoughtful, but she is only human. I know she will do her best by me, but that doesn't mean she is always right.
-1	I have never had a doctor that I trust 100% because they are human beings and they see a lot of clients in one day and have made plenty of mistakes. It is up to me to stay vigilant and decide on how to proceed based on my doctors suggestions.
-1	I like my primary care physician, but I don't really trust the technology that is used.  I don't trust that information entered into computers is always correct and not entered into someone else's account.  I would not trust everything that is done or said if it didn't seem to make sense.
-1	Shes nice and kind to me. She makes sure that my needs are taken care of and she listens to what I have to say and what questions I may have for her.
-1	Most docs where I live care about money, not their patients. There is very little access to a large health system in South Carolina where I reside and what we have is what we have. If you have to go to the ER it's best to go over the border to North Carolina than to go to Piedmont. 
-1	I have a general distrust for those with medical training. This is caused by a negative experience with a doctor that I had as a teenager.
-1	My care physician is the closest I can get to without having to drive almost 100 miles round trip. The clinic that my doctor is based at is always over crowded and busy so I rarely get much time with my doctor. She tries to do what she can for me but she has admitted that it has not been easy since more and more paper work has been added to her daily work and she was forced to take on more patients than she can handle. My doctor is wore out most of the time and often times I have to mention things like possible blood work that should be done or scans because she won't always think of them. She has too much on her plate and it is hurting her patients overall.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a very long time with no issues ever my routine checkups go well with everything explained to me 
-1	I trust my doctor but I feel like I'm certain situations like if I had cancer or something serious, I would look into my options.
1	I trust my doctor because he is a professional.  I am also in good health so I know that I am not at risk.
-1	I had a hard time answering because I have not been to a PCP for 8 years or so because I have not been at all sick.
1	I have been with her for 20 plus years and our relationship has grown to the point that I know she will not bs me on any issue
-1	My Doctor seems very lackadaisical to me. Going through the motions while trying to act interested in what I am saying.
-1	"I trust my primary care physician because I believe that (while it is a generalization), doctors are overall very dependable. However, I also feel as though many physicians will tell patients they ""need"" certain testing, only for their own financial gain."
-1	Not all doctors let patients know all of their options as far as treatments are concerned. I try to trust my doctors because I have to. They are the ones with the MDs in ultimately should know best. I do use my own judgment at the end of the day but put trust in my doctors and what they tell me.
-1	Depending on what type of insurance you have, some doctors may give you the cheapest treatment instead of what's best.
1	He is thorough and answers questions also personally calls  with test results Will take time to explain tests ordered and why. Always feel he has time to listen appointments are never rushed
-1	i don't trust anyone especality doctors i mean what is the worst that can happen if one of their patients dies i mean after all the have malpractice insurance and the law on their side.
1	I trust my doctor because I would think he knows what he is doing, at least I hope he knows what he is doing. I've only had one doctor in the past that I don't think he knew what he was doing and I found another doctor.
-1	I have seen my doctor for a long time. We have a good rapport, they're honest and clear me. In aldi very much trust my son's pediatrician, he's good at what he does. Quick to the point. 
1	She listens to me and we have an excellent report. I think she is  caring and remembers me from previous appointments.
-1	I trust my primary care physician although it sometimes hard to understand her. She is not from America. She is Indian.
-1	some of the doctors are very trusting and some can be not as trusting and they have sometimes they kist think that its okay but i know better and i would get another opinion sometimes .
1	i trust my doctor  they know what they  are doing most doctor u can trust and u can relie  on them for medicial needs
-1	They make matters worst. They don't want patients to get well.  Money is only on their mind.  They don't fully try to understand the patients' needs.
-1	"My Doctor is extremely overbooked and is always trying to get me out of his office as soon as possible. He interrupts me constantly when I am trying to describe why I am there. He does not answer any questions I may have ""telling me to ask the nurse:."
-1	My primary care is good enough.I really rely on my heart doctor though.My primary can be dismissive,abrupt and officious.My heart doctor is gentle ,sensitive and caring.
1	I believe my physician has my best interest at heart and tries to offer the best professional help as possible.
-1	A primary care physician (PCP), or primary care provider, is a health care professional who practices general medicine. PCPs are our first stop for medical care. Most PCPs are doctors, but nurse practitioners and even physician assistants can sometimes also be PCPs.
1	I very much trust my doctors at the VA,  they have been unreal kind, right on & always right.    Everything I've had done there has been great & right on with what they say.  I'm completely happy..
-1	Doctors in the past seemed to care more, and spent more time with you, now everything has a prescription, and they don't tell you about something that will work without prescription.  And it seems as if they're not really listening anymore.
1	We discuss what I should be doing at my age in regards to health screenings and such be he always leaves it up to Me he gives the pros and cons , but he has no agenda other than to inform me which I like
1	"Very caring.  His words to me were ""I'm going to treat you like I would treat my Mama.  And I love my Mama.""  He has even called me at home after hours to make sure I am okay."
-1	I trust them but sometimes they want test that I feel are unnecessary that cost me to much money that I do not have and the test come back ok anyways
1	I trust my doctor by telling them if something is wrong or if a medication isn't working. They are very helpful if i have a question for them
-1	I was not sick after going to my Physiciaan  I am more like dead person lot of pain and discomfort which I never had before
-1	I don't trust the newbies sometime because there new but I feel like why would a doctor deliberately
-1	I just recently started to see my doctor. He seems to have a good bedside manner. He spends time with me and listens and is trying to help me resolve my issue 
-1	I mostly trust my doctor, but sometimes I feel as though the doctor may think some of the things that are bothering me are insignificant.
-1	I was diagnosed last year with NF 1.. instead of my doctor trying to get me to a genetics doctor who specializes in what is wrong with me all he would do is say I had a patient with that once.. no test, no scans, no mri's, nothing to see what is going on inside.. I would show him the tumors on the outside of my spine and no reaction.. just I use to have a patient with that..
1	My PCP seems to be a thoughtful woman and is very good at listening to me and my concerns.  She is not assertive so might seem hesitant but I feel that is just her way.
-1	Doctors are only in business because people are or think they are sick. You go to them for one thing & immediately they want to send you for testing to see if they can find something wrong. I feel if it isn't broke don't try to fix it. There is a lot of truth in the statement what you don't know won't hurt you. Some people make themselves sick because they worry what if.
-1	Because I hate people and no one truly cares about u unless they love you. People become doctors mostly for the paycheck 
-1	I feel like drs in general go the easy route. Also, I feel they prescribe more medicine than is necessary and it causes harm, and I don't like that feeling. 
-1	In the past I have been misdiagnosed three times finally I found a nice doctor who tested me for Lyme disease and it came back positive being misdiagnosed made it worse and very hard to eliminate.
-1	I trust my doctor because he's been my doctor for many many years and knows me.  My only concern is that he sometimes deems my problems less serious than I do.
1	my doctor always seems to know how to treat me well I wouldn't go to anyone else unless referred to by my regular doctor
1	My doctor seems to have a genuine interest in my well being. I am open and honest with him which I feel is rare in patient-doctor relationships. I don't see any reason for him to be dishonest with me. He takes time to know my needs and problems so he can effectively treat them.
-1	too rushed, not enough time for appointment because they are running behind all day. too many patients.
-1	Im in the middle.  I trust him because he is a physician and he tries to make my health better.  In a way i dont trust him because he doesnt give me more alternatives to make my health better
-1	I often trust what doctors are telling me because most of the time, they are right. I believe that most doctors in America are well trained in medicine, so I would expect them to be very helpful and/or professional.
-1	I have a long term history with the medical practice and have had good experiences.  I have trained with several of the medical professionals and have trust in them.
-1	I think there are high quality people in the healthcare professional and some that are not of average or less as providers. I judge by my interactions with each individual.
-1	I typically trust doctors who have a lot of experience. I trust my doctor to know the best treatments for me, but I don't always expect my doctor to know everything about me. Sometimes, doctors don't believe what I have to say if it is strange or abnormal. 
1	I jave changed doctors several times in order to find my cuuent one.  She listens and doesn't just push pills.
-1	I believe that most doctors have the patients best interest at heart and they want to help them get better and give them good medical advice
-1	I do not think that doctors much care any more. I think they are short on time and just need to earn the dough. 
-1	At the moment I do not have a doctor.  The one I went to for many years retired a few years ago.  I have not needed one since that time.
-1	Do not always feel he is listening, but he does often get back to me after investigating certain things.
1	because i feel we have a great relationship beyond patient and dr. i feel he is my friend looking out for my health and well being
1	she is very through and knows exactly what my needs are and recommends specialist that I need to see for any problems she knows I need. she follow ups with my blood work to see if my meds needs to change. she ask me if i'm having any problems since my last visit and what is going on with my current health issues.
1	I have been with my doctor for many years; we trust each other and work well together, also have mutual respect
-1	yes i love my primary care physician and my insurance through my company it helps keep my health together
1	I trust my doctor in every way when he tells me what I need to do and when to do it and I have total trust in him
1	I have known this doctor for 32 years he has always been caring and honest with me and my whole family 
1	I trust my doctor because she seems up to date on everything new and lets me know the best options fo rme without breaking our budget
-1	Doctors are practicing physicians and to me that means they are still using us as experiments to see what will work and what will not work.  There are to many side effects for the drugs on the market to be prescribed for anyone there are more side affects than cure and the doctor knows this but yet they prescribe these medication for people what ever happened to using more natural products like the olden days.
1	My doctor is an exception to the rule; she is interested in what I have to say and the questions I ask and is in no hurry to rush me out.  She leaves when I signal that I am satisfied with my visit.
1	what with all the writing questions enough ok, my doctor is the best and has been for a long time but is retiring and that is a bumer
-1	My primary care physician didn't thoroughly investigate my son's condition when I brought him in. She just assumed it was the Flu because of the season. My son was later diagnosed  with a Pneumonia.
1	I trust my doctor because he always gives me options on treatments. he tells me the pros and cons of each type of treatment offered. He lets me choose what I feel is right for me.
1	My doctor has demonstrated thoroughness for many years, and stays on top of my needs and/or issues. 
1	I trust my provider because they are very good at explaining all the options available to me. She takes time to listen to my concerns, even if it isn't very serious.
1	My doctor takes the time to explain options to my condition and never tells me what option I have to take.  She recommends what she thinks is the best option, but has no problem if I select another option. 
-1	been wit and hah him for 35 years he has helped me with so many health problemsand never steered me wrong
-1	my reasoning to why i trust my primary care physician is because she makes feel like i can be open with my doctor. 
1	I trust my doctor as she listens to my concerns and addresses them with testing and the specialist I need. I have became better health wise since being under this doctors care
-1	Some doctors I feel rush through the appointment and I leave feeling uncared for which is not the purpose for my visit
-1	I dont have a primary care dr because of insurance reason but i do tryst drs however i feel they dont help everyone 
-1	My doctor has never done anything to not have my trust. He goes out of his way to make me feel comfortable and is willing to go out of his way for me and my family. To the point of calling me after hours when my oldest was sick and not getting better.
1	Because he never really can tell me what is wrong with me. And I can't understand him clearly which bothers me. And he always blows me off
-1	In all honesty, I do not trust my doctor at all. It seems as if most doctors in general mostly just care about their own convenience and making money. Even though the job itself is to help people, to them it's still just a job to them at the end of the day. 
1	of course i trust my doctor i have chosen him  because of his good fame and he always give me the right treatment.
-1	i trust my pcp because i have not had a reason not to when it comes important things in my life that could meen life; or death.i do get nervous when it comes to something major though.
-1	My doctor seems to have a thorough plan for my various ailments and seems open to any questions that I have.  I don't feel rushed by him during the appointments.  He is personable.
-1	Mostly I trust my doctor, although she is relatively new for me.  Initially, I did not feel that she listened well enough to what I was saying, but my latest visit with her felt much more complete and comfortable.
1	 I've been going to my doctor for about 10 years and I feel she knows me well. She has been very caring when I had upsetting personal experiences in my life. I definitely feel she listens to what I have to say.
-1	when i told her i had a cardiac problem she said i didnt. i ended up in the hospital for a cardiac ablation. she was told by my mental health doctor to check my thyroid, she didnt. when the cardiac ablation was done and bloodwork by the hospital they told me i had a thyroid problem.
1	I trust my Rheumatologist and my Nephrologists because they got me on the right treatments to steady my condition to were I am more balanced mentally and physically.  
-1	I feel like they are doing the best they can, but are overworked and quality care is diminished, that does not mean that I distrust my doctor by any means, I just know mistakes can be made because they're only human.
-1	good experience in the past and a relationship of several years; i trust they are educated and continue to update their knowledge
1	I known my doctor for over 10 yrs and they will go over my meds and tell me if it's unhealthy and who is better and make sure I'm happy or not
-1	Doctors are highly trained and know what they are doing. They would never intentionally do something to harm me. They want to make me better
1	stop asking for such long answers to these questions   my doctor never steered me wrong  blah blah blah
-1	I do not know my current PCP well.  She is the 3rd PCP I have had in as many years. One doctor retired and the next one moved to an employee health position.Once I get to know a doctor and they get to know me we can work together equally to give me a positive outcome.  I have been on Medicare less than a year.  There are many changes in what a physician is allowed to prescribe for different parameters.  Each stage of life has it's own learning curb.
-1	I have no problems so far. I have been with my doctor for a little over 2 yrs now. I think he does a good job and would recommend him, and have. 
-1	I do trust doctors. The only thing I disagree with is if you call with a question they say go to the ER or doctor immediately. that is not always the case.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that she truly cares about my well being.  If a medication is too expensive/not covered by my health insurance, she will suggest a generic alternative that works just the same and saves me money.
-1	I believe that I trust doctors in general because they have more knowledge that pertains to the situation that I might find myself in. They have endured the proper schooling and training required that qualifies them to make diagnoses, and give medical advice. They are professionals for a reason. 
1	I have been with him for many years. I have done just about everything suggested and I am in pretty good health
-1	I didn't trust many of my previous Dr's.  I felt they gave me lip service and didn't really retake an interest in me. I now have a new medical person who seems to care.
-1	I do not have a primary doctor at this time, just lost my health insurance and moved to another state, but my previous doctor was ace all the way.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she has never done me wrong. They have gone above and beyond to help me, and get the proper care I need.
-1	I don't think most physicians are as up to date as they should be or as willing to look into the issues that they should always
1	I have never had any reason not to trust what my Doctor tells me. He has always been very straight with me about everything.
1	She does not pretend to know everything. She considers my ideas and opinions. When it comes to my health we act as a team.
-1	I have been dealing with my doctor for a very long time, over 30 years. We had many different discussions on multiple ailments, concerns, sickness, cures and how I feel. We always discuss how each cure, symptons, sickness and feelings and he has been thorough discussing what he feels that I need to do, actions that need to be done and when I have been sick he comes up with different suggestions that will assist or cure what ailes me. 
1	I relay on the physician to make care of the situation that the doctor can determine to right medical knowledge best suited for me.
-1	I have been seeing him for a couple years and he has helped me. When I didn't know what was wrong he did and he also helped point me to someone else who tried to help me.
-1	I trust them because they always give me the right medicines and treatments for any problems I have and go through. They are always there when I need her
1	All doctor miss things on some patients that they deal wit they can't catch everything so if u smart enough to know something is still wrong even tho ur doctor told u that everything was ok u all ways go to a higher physician that can assist u better
-1	Doctors in general. Are great for the world.  89 percent of dr.s are good at wat they. Afew dr.s make mistakes as any other human.  Dr.s should continue to evalate their patients and keep saving lives. And also 
-1	I know he does what is good for me hes been in practice for years sometimes he does things weird but in the end he is right
-1	I have concerns about certain issues my doctor seems to just not care about or tell me its normal when i know its not normal for me, i dont like the word normal when it comes to health care because nobody is the same.
-1	If my doctor would try a little harder and ask the questions this survey has,  he might understand me more.  Instead he will ask two questions prescribe a pill and send me on my way.  
-1	I don't have a regular doctor anymore due to no insurance and the clinic we were seeing closed. Most doctors I've experienced blame any and all of my health issues on my being overweight. Unfortunately, this has left many conditions undiagnosed for years, some of which actually contributed to my overweightness.
-1	I trust my doctor because he is truthful, he is always right in the diagnosis because he does all the necessary checks and he is also the family doctor
-1	I have found doctors are more interested in shoving pills down a patients throat than actually addressing issues that are causing the problems in the first place.
-1	My primary physician has a good bedside manor and takes time to listen and explain things.  She does not rush me.  She seems to have a good understanding of my health concerns.
-1	I have never had a reason not to trust anything my doctor has told me.She's always very thorough and honest
-1	Sometimes my doctor doesn't remember my conditions and even though my chart is in front of him automated.  I have to remind him of my medical issues.

-1	I do not have a pcp, although  it rust that doctors do the best they can; unfortunately they do not know everything.
1	Cause he never told me something that was wrong I have a lot of trust for my doctor until I am proving wrong I have high trust for my doctors 
-1	i read a lot, so a dr. would really have to explain why i might need more medication or might need a procedure before i decide to go with her advice
1	He's very sympathetic and a good listener.  I have been going to him over 20 years.  He's never steered me wrong
1	I trust my primary physician based upon the relationship that we have developed since I began seeing him.I can trust him.
1	Everything my doctor has done for me has turned out real well so i trust him completely. He explanins things to me so i can understand them and also lets me know what we are going to do in the long run for my treatment.
-1	He does listen to me and give me suggestions to solve a problem (see another doctor, specialist) but never has the answer himself.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician and most that I have visited in the past do not listen as well as they should.
1	My doctor has a great track record.  He cared for my mother and for me.  Wouldn't give him up for the world.  He has stayed true to himself and others!
1	I don't have. A primary care physician. But previous ones have been very trustworthy and have my best interest in mind
1	I have been with  the same doctor for quite sometime now I have full trust in him and his staff has well has the hospital that he works for , I have never had any doubts with him
1	Well, I trust the doctors for their knowledge and their experience and that is the most important thing for me
1	I have never had a reason to distrust her. She has always been forward with me about all my illnesses. If one medication doesn't work, she has a lot more that she can tell me about. I always ask about possible side-effects and she always tells me.
-1	my doctor gave me blood pressure meds that i almost died from, when i told her that it has an adverse effect on african americans she said she did not know about that, even though it was all over the paper.
-1	I really love this idea, and I think it's really good, and interesting, this also shows a great variety of many things, and I personally think this is super interesting, and really shows a lot of information, and things.
1	I have had the same doctor for more than 10 years & he has helped me allot.  I can tell him I have a weird pain & he figures it out quickly.  
-1	I think the doctors that I have seen lately , let their degreesâ get in the way of understanding their patients needs, they are quick to offer solutions withoutâ all of the facts..not sure I trust many doctors
1	Very good eye contact! Explains things carefully and completely, encourages questions. Not afraid to touch me! Takes his time, not in a rush like an assembly line.
1	I think my doctor has a great deal of compassion and caring for all her patients...I know how she interacts with me and other patients and it shows she is a trustworthy doctor to all her patients.
-1	I truth my doctors they wont do anything that would hurt me they are there to help me not to do me any harm
1	I have only been to my present PCP once, and have not completely formed opinions making it difficult to answer the questions on this page.  However, I was favorably impressed by him and intend to keep using him for the foreseeable future.
-1	My primary care physician spends time with me in my appointments and explains every little detail about the procedures or treatments that I may be going through. She never rushes and she always takes time for my questions. 
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for q little over a year now. I am comfortable talking about him with anything at this point.
1	I have been going to the same primary care physician for many years, probably at least 20.  I have always trusted what he has said about my conditions because they correspond with the test results I have received.
1	I definitely trust my physician in the sense that they are well trained  and belief they are competent
1	Well, this doesn't seem like a very good question to me. But I think that one has to trust their doctor or find another one to deal with. So what can I say. that is about it, about that........
1	I am comfortable with her. She answers my questions in a language I understand. I don't like to take medication, so we discuss how to do things in a natural way.
-1	I'm not sure if I trust the Doctor.  Now a days, he checks things off on the computer, while asking me questions.  I can do that!  Is the system good or is the doctor??? I don't know!  ...not sure!!!
-1	I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have been dealing with it for years, but I don't believe my primary care physician has helped me control it. They don't always listen to my concerns with taking certain medications.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because when I talk to her she gives me her opinion and with my medical back ground I know that she has my best interest at heart. I know she cares and can tell by the way she responds to me
-1	I like his speech with me . It is full of love and cer toward me . He is very special in his way of speaking and learning
1	I trust my doctor because he always asks me if i understand or if i have any questions he is always following up with me and he is really nice
-1	I believe my primary doctor knows me well enough to know I want honest answers and the real bottom line, and so he does not sugar coat anything 
1	Very likeable doctor. Really wants me to be in good health. I am overweight and he wants me to work on that.
-1	I think I would distrust a doctor because they aren't involved in their patients health and they aren't prepared. 
-1	I trust my doctor, as I have seen him for a while and several of my family members (as well as family friends) go to him too. He is knowledgable and friendly, and is also open to hearing your thoughts and feelings about what's best for your health.
1	I trust my doctor because she is always looking for and telling me about things I can do to improve my health. 
-1	I have no reason not to trust my primary care doctor.  If I have a problem, I can ask my doctor anything.
1	He listens to me and we discuss the findings, treatments, and plan options. He is always been right, but I'm also a good historian of symptoms.
-1	Overall, I trust my primary physician but I don't think they always want to commit to a detailed answer.
-1	Always rushed, pushing pills for things even if you don't need them. For example exercise and weight loss can help many conditions, but once you are on medication, rarely taken off. 
-1	I think doctors are more interested in making money through prescriptions than the well being of their patients. They often are too quick to prescribe medication with bad side effects, or are uninformed about what would be best for the patient. Sometimes they prescribe medication that would react badly with other medication that the person is taking. Because of this I have to take what they say with a grain of salt. It's better safe than sorry so I trust myself first. Plus doctors might forget some of what they learned in school.  I saw one of my doctors looking up the answer to their question online
1	My doctor spends 45 minutes every time I go see him. It is much needed. We talk about my medications and if I am on track 
-1	I do not have a primary care physician so I am unable to fully complete this section.  I do trust doctors in general and rely on them if I should ever need to use a medical service.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician. I haven't even been to the doctor since I was a kid. But I don't see any reason not to trust your doctor. What advantage could he gain by lying?
-1	I generally trust my physician because usually he will explain everything to me before any decisions are made. I think that they are knowledgeable and know what the fix should be. 
-1	I think my doctor cares about what is wrong with me but i feel he is to busy to listen one hundred percent. He is at a clinc for low income people
-1	My past experience has demonstrated my confidence in my Doctor and his recommendations. His history of tests, advice and goals have proven correct.
-1	my promary doctor is very thoghell when notices the blood test he sends me to a specialist for further testing
-1	I don't think doctors are not taught enough about health.  I prefer to trust myself when it comes to my health.  Doctors only like perscriptions for health. 
-1	I have been going to him for a long time.He respects and knows what kind of person I am.He always Nswers my questions listens to me and helps in anyway he can
-1	If I didn't trust my family physician, I would not continue to visit his office.  I have been blessed with very good health (no major illnesses, never had to take prescription medicines at age 76) so it is difficult to judge my family physician as to trust or not. 
-1	I think my doctor does not have time for me.  I have to be my own advocate to find out what is wrong.
-1	He is always pushing me to have surgery. when my back hurt he said surgery, I said physical therapy and the therapy fixed it. he now says I need knee replacement now, but when I went to the orthopedic surgeon, he agreed with me and put me in physical therapy and I am much better. 
-1	my primary physician is new to me, so I dont have a built in relationship with her yet.  She's new to medicine, and that makes me think she is up on the newest medical trends but may also lack experience of knowledge.
1	I trust my primary doctor because she takes the time to talk to me and explain things so I can understand
1	She has always helped me out.  If she doesn't have the answer she sends me to a specialist.  She makes time to listen.
-1	I can trust my primary for basic everyday issues like a sinus infection or acne. But she is not a specialist and doesn't habe experience in more unusual issues.
1	He tells it like it is. He's straight forward no matter if it hurts your feeling or not.  He has always been honest to me and my husband 
-1	Seems nice and listens to me she reminds me of me physically so I can relate to her.  She is a female so it's nice that we can discuss colon topics 
-1	She does a good job in keeping up with my care and treatment. I feel comfortable in confiding in her with all my problems and medical needs.
1	My doctor usually tells me everything that they want me to do and why I need to do this and why it will help me.
-1	I believe that most doctors sincerely care about their patients. A doctor should care about his/her reputation. I do not think doctors wake wanting a malpractice lawsuit. He/She will do their best unless there is lack of knowledge.
1	My primary care physician always listens to me.  He always answers any questions I have about any of my health issues.
-1	I ask about medicines I see advertised on TV if they would help. And he will sometimes say lest try it. Are if another doctor orders medicine for me he acts like it was his idea. I haven't found a doctor I truly trust.
-1	I do not trust any doctor I have seen because all they do is ignore you and always write a prescription just to get you out of there office so they do not have to listen to anything your saying.
-1	I don't feel that my doctor has the time to spend with me on a one on one basis because of too many patients.  I also feel that when I ask the doctor to give me a certain test because other family members have a certain condition there should be no reason why I shouldn't be tested to catch an early diagnosis. 
-1	I have been with her for years , and always be honest and truthfully with me on very thing . i want to anything or ask anything ,she will take the time to explain everything to me .
1	I trust my physician Because she asks the right questions and helps me out. She just doesn't rush through the appointments
-1	Giving me information about my laboratory results in a broad way and explains every detauls whats going on with my condition
-1	She's always been helpful and willing to explain things to me. I haven't run into any issues as of yet
1	I don't have a pcp at this time.  However, while I have some good doctors and some not so good doctors, most of the time I have had exceptional care from my pcps in the past.
-1	I feel that doctors have a person's best interest at heart. I sense see that in the emergency room,  people seem to have the same diagnosis. 
-1	I trust my doctor enough, but I still can't fully trust everythig they say wehn it comes tp payment information and everything else I need to know. The overall feeling of not knowing everything is what keeps me from completely trusting them.
-1	I do not currently have a primary care physician, however, I trust most doctors to be caring and competent while I am proactive in my own care and research treatment options and ask questions of my physician.
-1	My primary care Dr seems to think I'm capable of more physical activity than I really am. My orthopedic surgeon knows exactly what I can do and is proud of my accomplishments.
-1	He listens to my questions and concerns and then tells me what he feels concerning them.  I feel he gives me his undivided attention.
1	I feel like they have my best interest at heart. I can trust that they know what they are talking about and are educated in their field so I don't have to worry about my health.
1	It has taken me several years to develop positive relationships with all my physicians.  If a doctor does not meet my needs I look for someone who is a better fit.
-1	Doctors in general have to work to gain my trust-I have had very bad experiences in the past with doctors, so I would say that I am wary anytime I see a doctor.
1	I trust my doctor completely.  We have a long history of him helping me when I was seriously ill.  He has literally saved my life several times.
-1	I am neural. I neither trust nor distrust my doctor, however I put the most trust in myself and my family. They know me better.
1	I trust my doctor because he has always been honest.  He has never mislead at any doctor's appointment.
-1	Right now, I have a very good doctor. She takes the time to explain everything. I never feel rushed and in the way. She make me fill like she cares.
1	"She is ""new"" since my doctor left  and I had to find another.  She is earnest, thorough and explains what is need to know,"
-1	I trust my doctors for the most part. I don't however completely trust medical science or drug manufacturers. Medical science just doesn't seem to have all the answers where many diseases are concerned and drug manufacturers seem to be more interested in profits than life.
-1	My doctor has never given me advice or medical care or information that turned out to be wrong or incorrect
1	He knows me well and even asks me if I have researched something to enable us to better understand a subject
-1	I trust my doctor but I always do my own research about my health and medications. I have no problems asking if something is right for me.
-1	I trust my doctor's assesments completely although I often feel he knows more than he is willing to share with me
1	I trust my doctor. She always tries to do what is best for me and addresses any of my concerns. She also listens to me and let's me explain any symptoms I've been having.
1	I trust my doctor because he always listens when I express concerns. He takes what I say into consideration and does not dismiss me rudely. He treats me as if he cares about me as a person not just a patient.
-1	i have no response to this question because i feel every dr are sworn to be honest to every patient 
1	my doctor is honest with me. She gives me the advise I need. If I have a problem, I can rely on my doctor to give me the answers I need and require, I have a lot of failh in my doctor.
-1	I do not visit them enough, but from the doctors i've visted, they were always pretty honest when it came to my health.
1	I trust all doctors to a point, and that point is there is a LOT of new information out there, new discoveries, theories and medicines. The average primary care physician cannot possibly learn it all.    When I had diverticulosus, the surgeon was going to remove part of my colon, and told me I may or not need a colonoscopy bag. I daughter and another friend looked up liposcopic surgery, and suggested that to drain the shit that was filling my abdomen. The surgeon agreed to try. It was successful. When he finished, the surgeon declared that if he ever had diverticulosus, he would want this procedure. I think we can trust our doctors, but we need to educate ourselves to make life better for all of us.
1	"My primary care doctor has been part of my life for 26 years! He & I know each other well & have ""grown"" over the years."
1	my primary doctor has all my my health in good hands and she works to keep me on the right track. she is truly successfully keeping her pentions in good health 
-1	I feel like I am going through an express line in the food line. I go in he asks me a few questions, write a prescription and that is it. They do not get to know you personally.
-1	My doctor and my health care plan have a very good reputation. Therefore, I am trusting them for my Healthcare needs.
-1	I wonder if there might be something she's not telling me to keep me from becoming upset--not diagnosis-wise, but possible non-serious effects of medicine or activity
-1	I have certain problems diagnosed and my Doctor has me come back multiple times to try new medicines instead of listening to what works for me. 
-1	My Doctor is very thorough and I trust his recommendations for treatments or prescriptions. However, I always do my own research and have refused drugs based on public evidence of problems.
-1	I think sometimes doctors get more money-minded than how they care for their patients. They have a tendency to sugarcoat whats wrong with a patient. I prefer that they are open and honest with me when it comes to mine and my familys health.
-1	My doctor seems interested in moving people from the in door to the out door in record time.  He rarely gives more than ten minutes of time to his patients.  
1	My doctor spends the time with me to not only get to know me but II know what my concerns are and delves into things that could be harmful to me and make sure that don't have things negative to my health that can't be seen on the surface
-1	I usually feel that doctors are in a rush and not always taking the time to get all the information to make a diagnosis or recommend treatment 
1	I trust my doctor because she is always honest and trustworthy and helps me in any situation that I need her opinion or advice.
1	"My PCP goes to great lengths to ask me in-depth questions whenever I go for my checkups; I'm rarely ill.  It's obvious that she's reviewed my history before I'm ushered into her office; she inquires about occurrences in my personal life as well as about my medical issues.  Most importantly, she actually listens to me and respects my opinions and wishes where medical options are concerned; she won't attempt to persuade me if I say I don't want to risk a med because of its potential side effects - she takes me seriously, unlike some doctors I've had in the past.  She's not got a ""cookie cutter"" all-knowing attitude."
1	My primary physician and I are a team. He knows me well enough to suggest various options for health care with me first before just ordering test or medications. I normally tell him what is wrong and how I think I should be treated and he will either agree or recommend a different course. I trust his opinions and feel very confident in discussing issue with him if I have concerns about what he says to me.
-1	I went through 3 PCP's before deciding to stick with my current choice. This one said the right things on my first visit and instilled confidence in his approach from the get go a marked contrast from the previous two.
-1	She tends to go above and beyond when it comes to finding treatment options that specifically help me both financially and mentally.
1	I have been with my doctor for many years.  he has known my conditions and has had them treated as they should be
1	My doctor always seems very concerned whenever I come in with a serious problem.  He listens to me & tells me what I need to know & do & is always very cordial & understanding.  
-1	My Dr is a great lady. She is baptized, filled with the Holy Ghost and really cares. on top of that she is beautiful inside and out. For the first time in a long time I am actually starting to fill better even though I have copd, Praise God
1	I trust my Doctor because I know he has his patients (myself included) best interest at heart.  If I have questions he always will explain his answers in a way where I will understand.
1	I have been with him for a long time. He is honest and direct. He doesn't beat around the bush. I trust him immensely
1	I trust my physician to do what he and I both think are correct in keeping me healthy and protecting my medical records
-1	They could be lying to me in order for me to spend more money with them.  They could fake that I have an illness, only to steal more money from me later on.
-1	i trust my doctor the are very good and care about my needs and questions.i see him twice a year and do tests
-1	My Doctor is very caring despite the short time I have with her during check-ups and I trust her judgement. She always answers my questions and does her best to give suggestions. I trust her judgement but I also do my own research on what is best for my condition so I can be sure that it is the right decision. 
1	I feel totally confident with my doctor since it tells me clearly that it is what I have explains to me how the disease is and how it will cure me according to the treatment given to me
-1	My husband has a situation going on right now when it could be a bacteria (using a certain medication) or it could be an autoimmune issue.  It is all new to us and it seems that the doctor's sense of urgency is just not there .. probably because he has seen it all before where we would like more info, more tests ... more or different meds.
1	I completely trust my doctor. He takes the time to actually sit and listen to my concerns and thoroughly answers every question I have.  He is a doctor, and educator, a mentor and friend. 
-1	I think they are prone to subscribing meds for everything versus trying something else. They don't take into consideration long term effects.
1	My primary care physician has been a faithful friend and advocate for me. She spends time finding out about my illness and she spends lots of time with me.
-1	My primary care physician as taken care of my family for years my mother and her mother both see the same primary physician 
1	I've been with my doctor for a long and he understand my illnesses and treats with the utmost care. He always makes my health and wellbeing first priority. 
1	I   guess   all   I  can   say   is   that   the   guy   working   on   you  went    to  school   a  long  time   before  he   got   where   he   is   today   so   I  want   to   trust  him   or   her   completely , my   life   is   in   his   hands  on  Earth  but   ultimately ,  we   are   all   in   GODS   hands  and  when   HE   calls   us ,  its  time
-1	I trust my doctor because she seems to care about me - and listen to me when I talk. I have never had a problem talking to my doctor.
-1	I trust them because they went through years of intense schooling to get where they are. That means they know more than me seeing as they are the expert. However I will still do my own research
1	I have been going to my doctor for years & he is honest & straight forward about telling me what is wrong.
-1	I have not been with my primary care physician very long. I was with my last doctor for 22 years and trusted her extremely. She was very thorough and took great care of me. My current doctor is not as thorough and does not prescribe medications, just ginger tea for everything and his blend of vitamins. So I'm not sure how I feel about him just yet.
-1	I trust doctors to a certain extent. although sometimes I feel as if I need a second opinion depending on the situation. 
1	I would not be using the doctor if I did not have complete trust.  I have been with this doctor for 15+ years and she knows my history very well.  She has always explained things really well, especially when something out of the ordinary occurred,  When there was a problem, she found it quickly and was quick to act and resolve the problem.
-1	I do not have a primary doctor and do not trust western medicine.  Drugs that are legal are also harmful to people.
1	My PCP is a doctor for the right reasons. He cares. He has never tried to rush me out or not believe me in describing issues I had.
-1	I had little choice in who s my primary care physician, limited by my insurance.  He has a large caseload and cannot spend the proper time.  Also, he is careless and has often prescribed inappropriate medication that would have harmed me if taken.  Generally shoddy medical practice
-1	when visiting with him he spends a great deal of time explaining and going over all my questions and advises me of all the wrong things I do and tries to have me correct them
-1	I trust him because he is a good person and he has never been wrong in the past. About none of my medical history he is the best.
-1	Because they are in the business of making money and the more sick I am and dependent upon the medication they are giving me, the better for them. I do not believe they truly want me to get well.
1	My doctor understans and is careing about you i trust him to the fullestmy doctor care he stays the same make me want to go back
-1	As a patient, you have probably had the experience of meeting a physician for the first time and very quickly becoming comfortable that he or she has your very best interests utmost in mind. The sense comes quickly; you become comfortable, less anxious. Unfortunately you may have had the opposite experience of encountering 
-1	I do not have a primary care physician.  I am in reasonably good health with very little by way of health issues.  The last time I needed medical care I was able to go to the local urgent care office.
-1	I feel I must trust a physician.  If I feel something doesn't sound right about treatment, I would question the physician to find out pros and cons.
1	My doctor visits are follow up type that makes it easy to communicate with him any problems that I may be experiencing.my doctor asks me questions as well as I ask him questions.we have open communication which is best for my conditions
-1	I trust the doctors I see enough to keep going to them. I like the health system that I use I think they have really great nurses and doctors and a great reputable hospital. So I will trust them more than distrust
1	He does everything he can to make me healthy!  He provides all my needs and is always there to help!
-1	Distrust as he's not always forthcoming. Had a recent incident which resulted in x-ray and he deliberately misdiagnosed it. Protecting someone.
-1	Some doctors tend to be lazy. Not all doctors can be trusted just because they are doctors. You have to trust them obviously because who else can you trust.
1	she seems to remember all the tiny details of my case. she seems genuinely interested in helping me to feel my best.
-1	I trust my physician because I have been seeing him for quite a few years now! As er say bedside manners in a dr is a must! Someone who shows you they care & what's best for you!
-1	My doctor tends to think clinically as opposed to holistic. That is, she would rather have take another drug rather than finding a solution that might be more healthy without side effects. 
-1	Some of my specialists are excellent doctors, but others take an approach f get the meeting over with as fast as possible
1	I trust my Dr completely, his communication with me is always good and I have complete confidence in his communication.
-1	Sometimes I feel my doctor does everything by textbook without looking at the whole picture.  For example, she was going completely by BMI without looking at my body type.  I have a LOT of muscle as I work out often.  After examining me she agreed with me.  
1	I have a great trust in my doctor.  He lets me know how things are and if any changes need to be made he explains how and why.
-1	He has prescribed me a medication that could have caused serious harm due to an interaction with another medication I was on, which he knew I was taking. He has also prescribed me a medication that could have prevented me from having more children and did not mention this. He is also not as knowledgeable about my condition as he should be given that he specializes in the area. He works at an office that has incompetent staff across the board. I would use another office if my insurance allowed me to, but unfortunately they are the only option. 
1	My Primary care Physician is a HEALER, NOT A BUSINESSMAN, LIKE THESE YOUNG QUACKS THAT ARE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY. Outside of my father, he is the finest man I have ever encountered. 
-1	I like my primary care physician, but I don't ever fully trust my healthcare to any one individual. Humans are fallible. I take my physician's advice, but I will separately do my own research and, ultimately, decide for myself and talk it over with my physician. If I disagree with them entirely, I will seek out a doctor that will oversee my care in the best way I see fit. 
-1	Sometimes they give you the wrong information . Or may say you have something and not tell you what to do about it. 
-1	I DISTRUST SOME DOCTORS THAT I SEE, BECAUSE THAY DON'T TELL THE TRUTH AND I FIND OUT FOR MY SELF AND LET THEM KNOW ABOUT IT.
-1	If I didn't trust my physician, I would change to another physician.  I have stuck with the doctors I have because I have developed a trust for them and their judgement.
-1	I like him a lot and think he is good and means well, but he is always in a hurry and lookingâat the computer too much. I think he is overbooked.
-1	distrust has been established due to a mutual disrespect amongst myself and the non-medical personnel that staff the doctors office. As they seem to believe that they are well aware of how to treat me and better capable of handling it than I. 
-1	I sometimes trust doctors. There are good and Bad people in everything. Not all people are bad. I feel like they do the best they can to help people 
1	been going to my doctor for 40 years never had any promplems he doeas everyb thing he can to see I get the care I need to stay healthy
1	I have been going to the same Dr for several years and we know each other very well.  If I disagree with him I will tell him, and he knows it.
-1	I've known my doctor for over twelve years. He is well educated and respected by all who know him. He has been in practice for over twenty-five years and is tops in the midwest.
-1	my doctor always listens to what I have to say.  If i have a problem I make sure to let my doctor know.
-1	I do not trust doctors in General from past experiences.  This is in regards to family members not getting the care they needed in order to prevent death
-1	I had a bad doctor, ended up almost dying because we (doctor and I) ignored my health. After getting out of icu, I changed my doctor and my attitude regarding my health. I an now back on track with a doctor who listens and makes me listen! 
-1	I feel as though she listens to me and takes the time needed for my care. I do not feel rushed when I am see my Physician.
-1	I truly trust my primary care physician because they always provide me with all of the information that I need to stay up to date with my health 
1	I've had my current doctor for three years now and he is the best doctor I've ever had. He is thorough in his assessments and is totally trustworthy.
-1	She listens does not make me feel in a hurry not many Doctors take the time to listen ,no useless test are done
1	My primary physician always gives options for care and leaves the decision up to me after explanations as to why he would suggest one option would be more beneficial than other.
-1	I mostly trust the doctor.   I believe with how the current healthcare system is, that there are unnecessary tests being done to give them extra money.
-1	I just started with a new facility for my medical care.  The two doctors I have seen there so far seem to be very nice and helpful.  This is a walk in place, where you see whichever doctor is there, you don't need an appointment.
-1	I really don't go to the doctors, but when I did in the past they always treated me with compassion, and patience. 
1	My primary doctor shows empathy and actually listens to what i have to say to him. He's honest with me about everything. He tries his best to help me whether its getting a referral to someone else or getting information for me.
1	Very knowledgeable. Works for an excellent health system. Great bedside manner and caring. Takes the time to hear and address my concerns.  I don't feel rushed during my appointment.
-1	I have been with my current primary care doctor for over a year and he is very trustworthy. He explains diagnoses and treatment options in simple easy to understand language i understand. 
1	I feel that my primary care physican has my best interests at heart. He spends a lot of time with me and answers all my questions to my satisfaction.
-1	I've been seeing her awhile. We talk bout things. I just trust her.  She listens to me, we talk about each issue. 
-1	I should be able to trust my Dr. I have no reason not to trust them. I have had no problems with any of the Dr.'s I have seen.
-1	She hasn't given me any reason not to trust her. She gives me plenty of her time, answers my questions, is friendly.
-1	First off with my current Dr. I have researched that individual, and have spoken with people that have this particular Dr. as their Primary Care Physician. I check out the reviews online by individuals, and as well as the PCP's background information.
1	My doctor is very thorough, he always listens to everything that I have to say. He also makes sure that no stone is left unturned when it comes to my health.
-1	I don't know that I actually trust my doctor, but I don't actually distrust her either. I guess I trust her to do what's best until she proves otherwise.
1	I feel my doctor has my best interest in mind and treats me with dignity and respect at all times. I have no complaints about my treatment.
-1	I had galstones in Sept. Of 2015 and my doctor thought it was an ulcer. This made me sicker for longer, and I couldn't get the care I needed. That's why I distrust doctors sometimes.
1	i consider my doctor a friend. he is very open and honest to me even when he knows i might not like his advise.
-1	i see my doctor once a year she is very nice and easy to talk to good at having tests down and prescribes the medications i need
-1	Doctors only care about shoving pills and expensive treatments at their patients.  They care about money and not how to fix issues with patients. 
1	i totally trust everyone of my doctors i know that they thinking more about me and my health problems
-1	I personally have had bad experiences with doctors, NPs not listening to what I am telling them. Doctors are constrained by a broken healthcare system, insurance system, so they cannot spend the time with patients, even if they have good intentions. the federal gov. is meddling in the doctor/patient relationship. 
-1	My primary care physcian always seems to care about. He always wants to make sure I'm telling him everything that is bothering me . Mentalliy and physically.
-1	None i trust my doctor pretty well I have been going through the same doctor for years and I'm treated pretty good so far 
1	He never jumps to conclusions, he will talk to me about what ever it is and do tests if that's what is needed. 
1	I have 4 very close drs that have been actively in my life one for 15 yrs  another for 14 and the other two i believe now 4 yrs. They know my body better than i do. I completely trust all 4 to any descisions may may conclude
1	He has helped with some of my medical issues when other doctors didn't. He listens well to everything I say and makes you feel comfortable. 
-1	I feel that she wants what is best and is honest and has my well being first when it comes to me and my health
-1	I trust him, he is very nice and kind and seems to care about his patients and wants what is best for them
1	I feel very lucky to have the PCP that I see. She really listens to what I say and answers my questions. She doesn't rush through things to get me out and on to the next patient. She is thorough and I am always provided written documentation about what we discussed and any changes to medications. First thing she does is read the nurse's notes of why I'mâ there and the notes made at my previous visit. I get nervous any time I have to see any of my doctor's, but she and her staff treat me with respect and dignity which usually calms me. I have no complaints.
-1	"The reason I trust and don't trust doctors is because I feel that a large majority of them are financially driven and often give responses to clients/patients based off of biases. I also believe that even some honest doctors tend to sometimes fall victim to having to concede to company policy's and ""unethical"" medical industry standards."
1	Doctors and nurses ppl must have full trust in and clinic and hospitals along with billing and paper work 
-1	doctors are paid by number of tests and other billable transactions they can perform on patient.  so they are only interested in increasing the number of tests and unnesessary operations for no health benefit.  need single payer health care
-1	i would hope i can trust my physician, nobody really knows someone 100% so sometimes there is room for doubt
1	I have bene going to him since I was 16 and he has always given me good advice and medicane to amek me better when I have been sick
1	I had a serious medical problem two years ago and my primary care doctor has been great with all the following up that has to be done and have explained everything to me the time.
-1	They don't give me options for any medications or treatments. They also don't go in depth about explaining all of them to me. They only explain the one thing they want me to try.
-1	"My doctor has a few quirks -- she is somewhat superstitious, and seems to believe in some ""old mother's tales"" regarding diagnosis methods.  On the whole, however, she seems to trust modern medical techniques more, although there are times when I worry about her judgement (""you must be a very jealous person -- you're quite ticklish"", said by her with little or not evidence that she is saying it as a joke, for example)."
1	My doctor doesn't try to pressure or shame me into doing anything or taking any medication that he feels I need if I object. He respects my opinion.
-1	I really like my PCP. He listens and relys on my instincts as to what is going on. He is geniuinely nice and appreciative of my time and efforts.
1	I can depend on my provider. I trust that my provider will steer me in the right direction. My provider has never given me at reason to have trust.
1	He takes the time to listen to me thoroughly.  He gives me advice that makes sense and has been proven to be valid and true in the past.  He cares about me (remembers things I have mentioned), and seems genuinely please when things are going well for me.  During one crisis I had about 5 years ago, he called me a few days later to make certain I was all right.
-1	I like him and have known him for 30 years. Not sure I trust him completely but he's pretty good. Needs to spend more than 10 mins. with each person...
-1	He seems to know what he is doing and I rarely see him for anything outside of being sick which I rarely am
1	I have been with my doctor for 15 years.  She is awesome and has made me feel completely comfortable with all of my health care questions and needs.  I travel almost an hour to see her as her practice moved.  I have no qualms about driving that distance because I know I am getting superior health care.
1	In my lifetime of 79 years I have had no reason to distrust my doctors. I have done research into my choice of physicians and am therefore confident that they are trustworthy.
-1	Doctors today spend too little time with each patient because they're in a rush to get to the next one. Doctors also hand out prescriptions for medications based on the added income they make for doing so. Its very difficult to rely on and trust the medical community anymore.
-1	"i don't trust someone that i can't understand. i don't appreciate being ""talked over"" because i am not understanding what they are saying. i will not go back to that doctor, unless i absolutely have to because i care about my life and well being more than some stranger with a diploma does. when i find a doctor that treats me like the intelligent human being that i am, i am more willing to listen and discuss my concerns with them. if not, they are plenty of doctors that i will go to until i find one willing to co-operate with me."
-1	she is curt, rolls her eyes when i tell her what is going on with my body, she is dismissive. she doesn't tell me stuff like do not  take your thyroid pill before your blood work, so my blood work is screwed up, i know she does not believe things i have had tested or experienced in the past are true facts. they are quite oddities and hard to believe, but yet all of them tested at least 3x before the dr's back then believed what was going on. it is my fault i am still with her, but my file could probably go around the earth once. i am lazy and honestly do not want to fill out new patient info sheets. when i do see a new dr, i have them send me the forms and it usually takes me about 3-5 days to fill them out.  i am content to know what i am dealing with my mean dr.
-1	I think that for the most part that doctors do look out for you and want the best for you but I also thing that life gets in the way sometimes and maybe they just want to shuffle you out of the office so they can go home.
1	SHE IS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL RELAXED AND TAKES THE TIME TO ANSWER ALL MY CONCERNS. SHE IS ALSO REACHABLE WHEN I CALL.
-1	I just feel at times I am more of a # than a patient. In and out quickly without always listening to me. I. The past I have had to go to the doctor 3 or 4 times for the same issue before that issue is actually dealt with. That sucks to me.
-1	I think most doctors are trying their best to provide good care but you really need to be your own advocate when it comes to your health. If something  doesn't  feel right or you are not getting better, get a second or even third opinion. 
-1	they do not listen or read my chart when I tell them something, Its like I tell them and they look at me as if I have two heads
-1	I trust my Primary because we hve been going to him for years as a family and he cares for each of us as if we are his own family. I feel I can talk to him about most anything.
-1	I've been put on meds that ended me up having renal failure and hospitalized. I had another doctor prescribe something that didn't work well with another medication. I'm overly cautious.
-1	I would generally assume that they are giving honest answers, and given their training and experience it would seem sensible to trust them. They would have little reason to deceive me, although some of it involves guessing.
-1	I have learned that it is best to watch out for yourself  with the medical field.   Find out all you can about any treatments they suggest.
-1	I don't believe my doctor has read my medical history and pays any attention to me when I try to address it. The doctor is constrained by some CDC guidelines  which have left my issues untreated for years now and now I suffer more issues so I no longer trust my health care office and they also gave me a vaccine that I had refused for years and I decided to not worry about it until the bill came for $375 that insurance will not pay and that I do not have. I no longer trust them and don't feel I have anywhere to turn for medical care at this time.
-1	Depends on the expertise of the doctor. If he/she is a specialist then I have a little more faith in the diagnosis. 
-1	i don't know my primary physician well enough as I never used him more than once a year so I really can't say.  Now that I'm older, I'll use him more
-1	I trust them because I feel like they know what they are doing and how to approach a certain problem. I also trust them because previous treatment have turned out to be good for my problems 
1	He has always took time to listen to my concerns or questions, makes sure he answers and acknowledges everything I say or ask. He always makes sure I know how to contact him via the offices site and e-mail if I have any further questions or concerns.
1	I believe in my doctor and she very thorough and I have confidence in her.  Whenever I hav had a problem she has always been right.  She is very cautious
-1	It seems that it depends on what mood she is in..maybe in a hurry at times and doesn't appear to be thorough
1	She is very smart about what is new .When ever I call emergency, she takes me on . She never knocks me down .Explains every thing an never rushes me out !!! 
-1	I don't have a regular primary doctor due to not having health insurance so I see a general based on income doctor when I'm sick.   
-1	I know you lying. I was just aBout to make sure you have to be a good girl. She said she was going to move up there for the summer. I was just aBout to get married. The only way to get my own place in the bed . U can be found in the bed and breakfast in the bed  
-1	he is considerate and open with helping me with my illnesses almost always right and usually gives me choices
-1	I think doctors try to push too many drugs and don't give alternative and lifestyle treatments that would be better.
-1	I basically go to the doctors once a year and always listen and ask questions of my doctor.  We usually have a good conversation about different things and I walk away learning a new thing or two.
-1	I do trust him, but he is a GP and usually sends me to other people to really do a good physical.  Many things he has me do have all come out clear, yet I have spent a great deal of money doing all of his tests.
-1	My doctor is a good doctor, but her staff is not very responsive to patients needs. She doesn't understand my personal problems as well as she should.
-1	I have found in the past with primary care physicians I've had that they are interested in providing me with prescriptions I don't need and calling it preventative. 
-1	I believe that many doctors will run unnecessary tests to make a quota set my their practice.  For instance, a dermatologist may do a biopsy when there is not a good reason.   
-1	"I've had a bad history with doctors. They tend to condescend to me, to pick on me for my weight until I get compulsive and self-destructive about my eating habits, and give me drugs that wreak lasting havoc on my system and then just shrug it off (""Oh, well, that doesn't happen to most people.""). This one seems good, like he actually listens, but I'm still wary."
1	I trust my doctor since i have enough time dealing with him and also i entrust is to my family and my friens and colleagues
-1	I often feel the doctor chooses treatments based on my level of insurance coverage rather than what might be best for me. I often feel the doctor is more interested in prescribing drugs for which the pharmaceutical reps have given incentives, even though I might not need them.
1	I see a resident doctor that practices in a family clinic.  My doctor is supervised by experienced physicians.  I trust my doctor because she listens well.  She has supervision regarding her treatment decisions.  In addition, I have net some of her supervisors
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been the whole family doctor and has been treating me since birth also has answered all questions i've ever had bout me and my family members
-1	They don't listen to the patient.  They give you therapy before they even xray anything.  Everything is either your dehydrated, to walk, go check your eyes and other hairbrained answers.  I wish old school doctors still existed.  These young ones are terrible.
-1	I trust her and ask questions as I need to about health issues or concerns. I can ask questions about different medications or choices that I have   
1	"I've dealt with a heart issue since I was 8 yrs old. Had a major ""episode"" almost 3 years ago & my current PCP has been very open about theories, treatments, test results & options. He has listened to my questions/concerns as well as let me participate in my care as far as refusing or suggesting a similar or different course."
-1	I tend to trust Doctors that listen to my concerns more so than Doctors that talk at me with a know it all attitude.
-1	My Dr. doesn't isten . He just gets in and out as fast as he can. I don't think he even really cares I am just more money to him. Ireally get upset. I wish he would take more time to pinpoint what is going on.
-1	I do not completely trust my doctors because I don't have a primary care physician and I see different doctors when I go to the doctor.
1	I HAVE BEEN LUCKY DO TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE BEEN SEEING THE SAME DOCTOR FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS, THATS WHY IN TRUST HIM AND OR HER
1	I trust my doctors they usually tell me the truth about my health weather I want to hear it or not i learned alot about my health by asking questions  also i learned alot of medical terms 
1	I one-hundred percent trust my primary care physician as well as all of the employees at the practice I visit. He has done an excellent job at helping me maintain my health this fas. 
-1	Don't always spend enough time or ask if you have any questions. Just want to get you in and out. Therefore how can one totally trust if they don't get to know you as a person.
1	I feel like I can trust my doctor because he sees you as a person and not just getting some kind of money benefit from his patients and cares for each one no matter who they are or the financial differences. He shows respect and trays to make everyone comftorable and like a friend.
-1	I trust my doctor because I've had the same doctor since I've been born. I have the same doctor that helped my mom give birth to me 
-1	My doctor is pretty straight forward is sensitive but to the point.  I must trust he only has my best interest at heart
-1	They don't always take my concerns into account. They are in a hurry to get me out of the office a lot of the time 
1	He is friendly and really interested in what you have to say and is never hurried when speaking and treating me,   He diagnosed my wife's condition just by looking at her after several other doctors had no idea what her medical problem was.
-1	I recently had to switch primaries and she isn't as easy to talk to nor as thorough. I always feel rushed when I see her
1	Have been a patient for 18 years, he has never steered me wrong yet. He is very dedicated and thorough with me, taking his time with me at my scheduled appointments. I even have his cell phone number in case of an emergency.
1	I trust my doctor completely, he has the knowledge to tell me all the options that I have for what is wrong with me.  We will talk it over and come up together with what we are going to do.
-1	my doctor is human and even though researches the products still want to make a quick buck and ginipig pig us patients
1	She takes the time to read about my cases and issues before we meet.  We generally has several solution to the problem at hand....but to be honest with you I am very healthy for my age, so I only go to the doctor for an annual check up at this time in my life.
1	I trust her because she is a very good peron.  She tries to do her best at all times.  The small lack of confidence I  might have relates to her overlooking something or being pressed for time.
-1	I feel like my primary care doctor has a lot to accomplish by stating what might be wrong with me but also feel like they are just doing their job 
1	I trust my mental and physical doctors as they seem very concerned and helpful, even tho I may not agree with them., I feel they are straight forward with me and my problems
1	I trust my doctor i know that wind i go see them she take her time in doing what she do make shore all my test are up to date
-1	I have had alot of experience in dealing with doctors because I took care of my ageing parents. I do know that sometimes doctors do whats easy for them and they look at the ageing elderly as if their life is almost over anyway. For that reason and others I dont truely trust every word my doctor tells me. I get second opinions first.
1	My doctor usually takes plenty of time to talk about my concerns; I almost never feel rushed. She is kind, concerned and considerate
-1	I trust doctors to a point. However I feel that they do not always listen and just generalize your condition. They lump you in with other patients they have experience with
-1	I guess I was always raised to have the utmost respect and trust in my primary doctor. they have never given me any reason to distrust them. I feel very comfortable with their opinion on all things .
-1	I trust them a little but often feel they want to rush to get to next patient and not focus on me 100%  or learn all there is about my situation
1	because he has not steered me wrong and has treated for years. Furthermore, he has sent to me to several specialist who were both professional and excellent doctors as well. He carefully explains any medication changes that he makes and why he is making them, and he listens to me.
1	I recently switched physicians and have found a truly remarkable one who actually listens to me and works with me
1	its hard to trust sometimes. sometimes they are just there for the money, and some really do care about you
1	He explains things well. I never feel rushed during a visit. He takes time to answer all my questions.
1	Because honesty trusworthy, down to earth easy to speak to and explains in a eay to understand. Easy to lean from
1	My doctor has never given me false or misleading information. He's always been straight forward with me, even when he knows there are things I should change but probably won't. 
-1	I trust her because I know that she listens to me and what I have to say. However I don't think that she agrees with my diagnosis of Fibromyalgia, which was diagnosed long before she became my doctor, and so I feel she does not really believe the pain that I am in. She also seems to be always looking for another reason for my pains. Which I have been through numerous times with other doctors. So I don't always trust her to believe me. 
1	There should be a general patient to doctor relationshipâ, to where I can trust them and to where they can trust me. If I can not trust this doctor I have to find one I can trust. Mistrust can result in my life ending so I prefer to go to a doctor I can trust with my life.
1	When I was 41 yr. old I had a severe asthma episode.  I had never had asthma before and I almost died.  The Dr. the ER called in saved my life then and I had him as my doctor for many years and had me on meds that controlled the asthma.  More recently I have had other doctors and have been treated well; have had questions answered; been given meds that did what they were supposed to do.
-1	My doctor just hurries through the appointment and does not really listen to me especially about woman problems and he just does not understand or know how to fix them.
1	I have seen the same Dr. for 17 years so she knows me well. She's open to my suggestions involving my care and will usually agree. She orders appropriate tests and mess and is available to receive and promptly answer emails.
-1	I generally trust doctors, but also have some degree of skepticism and will ask questions of medical providers until satisfied with the answers I have received.
-1	i view my doctor a partner in giving me the best advice from their professional point of view, but at the end it's really my decision to make
-1	My doctor is friendly and sincere, but more and more she seems a bit hurried in getting me in and out. I still generally trust her, but would appreciate more time or discussion
-1	Doctors are only as knowledgeable as they are taught and what is told to them by the pharmacy industry. 
-1	I someti,es feel that my best interests are not met. I feel like the dr is doing things that require me to have to spend more versus dealing with the issue at hand.
-1	My primary care physician is very intelligent and knowledgeable.  However their are conditions that he does not know the details of and when questioned he dismisses concern.  He is not likely to discuss emotional reactions to anything.  That is fine with me but he has patients that are upset about that aspect.  He is very clinical.  He trusts lab tests for most everything.  I trust him but wish her was a little more curious about symptoms.  It is possibly an age thing as he is ready to retire.
1	I have been with my primary care physician for almost 20 years.  He discusses everything with me and utilizes my input into treatment plans.
1	i think my primary care physician is very skilled and is straight-forward.  he is also compassionate (and funny)
-1	I trust my doctor to do his job and explain my medical options. It's not his job to decide for me, so I wouldn't take his recommendations automatically.
1	He's a great guy that truly wants me to be as healthy as I can. I swear he wants me to live to 150, happily, healthy, and active.
-1	My doctor always seems to know what the correct diagnosis is for any given thing for which I consult him. Sometimes he's a little rushed but he does try to make conversation and show interest in my life outside of whatever medical issue is at hand.
-1	My doctor explains my condition with good verbal skills and help me understand his medications and the way to take them and how to use them.
-1	I feel like my doctor is quick to prescribe something for my condition without fully testing me or suggesting natural methods or cures. 
1	I have had a bad experience with another doctor.  She is very through and concerned.  She listens and takes her time. 
-1	I trust that they know what they're doing, but sometimes it seems they are trying to rush you in and out because they have other people to treat 
1	I have never had a doctor recommend anything that was harmful for me. My doctor's have always been sure that i understand everything going on with me. 
1	I trust him completely.  He has never given me reason not to trust him.  He takes as much time as needed with me when I visit.
-1	my main dr is a va dr. I trust her for the present time. sometimes I feel that she is just searching for a problem and a cure. but overall I am pleased with what she has done.
-1	The doctor takes the time to explain, advise and council. Dosent run patients through like cattle, or make you feel rushed
1	I trust her because she seems to really care about me and really listens to what I have to say. She doesn't dismiss what I have to say, big or small.  Nothing I talk to her about feels silly to talk or ask her about 
-1	I generally trust my doctor because she is highly educated and has gone through years of training in her profession.
-1	I trust my primary doctor, due to a length of time with him and believe he is honest . I would hope my doctor is honest with myself, and all his patients, when it comes to my health and others health.
-1	I do not have a long relationship with my doctor but am confident that they are skilled and motivated to address my issues. 
-1	i trust my doctor because he has never been wrong or told me anything just to get money out of me, he is a very honest and caring doctor
1	I have had my primary doctor for 26 years and he always does what is in my best interest. He always explains why he is giving me the prescription,
-1	i have only met my primary care physician once. i do not tend to trust most people so doctors are no exception to that rule.
-1	I think most doctors are in it just for the money I take their advice with a grain of salt and research stuff on my own...I have been given wrong advice often and wrong diagnosis more then once
1	My primary care physician has never done anything to cause me to distrust him. Every time I've needed assistance I've been met with high quality service and solutions.
-1	because i trust my primary care physician and i have complete trust in my doctor. My doctor is totally honest
1	I trust my doctor thouroughly. She let's me know what works and doesn't work. She is truly intetested in me as a patient and her nurses have called after a sick visit to see how I'm doing. She's awesome. 
-1	for the most part I trust some of my doctors.  I don't have a primary care physician but I have other doctors I see regularly.
1	I trust her, but so far she's been fine. I was diagnosed with Diabetes 5 years ago, and then my doctor retired and I started with this doctor. I lost 55 pounds on my own and she took me lots of my meds including Alendronate because I was on it for 10 years. My osteoporosis didn't get better, but stayed the same then I hurt my back and they found two fractures, so she put me back on it. She also doesn't check for A1C because no diabetes anymore. So I trust her, but really doesn't check a lot of things.
-1	Somties we must make hard decisions and know what is best for our health and i dont think a physician has all the awnsers
1	My dr is caring and competent. She listens to me and always is able to pinpoint and fix my problem. I trust her opinion and feel confident she has my best interest at heart
-1	All my trust is and will remain in God.  I only trust Him an if He assigns a doctor for me I believe that he will use her in a honest way.
1	I sometimes research my doctor's suggestion.  It seems like when I do, I ask him more questions.  I do not disagree with him very much.
-1	I strongly consider their opionions but dont necessarily trust them. Some doctors force their bias on patients amd are sometimes inpatient and rude. 
1	because everytime i have went in to see him for anything he has always been concerned and always explains everything i ask him
1	My doctor has never steered  me  wrong or had me  do anything  without listening to my concerns . He  explains things to me in simple language.
-1	I do not trust doctors at all it seems there thing is to give a pill for a pill and this side effect will outweigh this side effect
1	My physician has always been very open about what she thinks I should do about any condition that I am curious about at the time.  She has always been very thorough in her explanation of things and questions me as to whether I have any questions at all.
1	My doctor  is a do.She is there first do primary care doctor I have had. She is  more holistic in her approach to patient care. I like that.
-1	I have had doctor's only tell me information that would make them the most money, or be lazy and not give me all the information, especially if was not convenient for them.  It's hard to ever know for sure if a doctor is telling you everything or not.
-1	The doctors I see now are always open and up front with me about the treatment I am receiving. Because of this, I trust their judgement in making a diagnosis and the possible treatment(s).
-1	I trust my PCP as I have been seeing her more than ten years and she has helped me through a number of illnesses, chronic and other. 
-1	This one is hard to answer because my old doctor retired and I now have a new doctor that I've only seen once.  She seems ok, but very different than my previous doctor who was really personable.  She is more professional and not really into have a relationship with her patients.
1	I trust my doctor because she takes the time to explain things to me, answer my questions and have a discussion with me regarding my health.
1	I have know my doctor for a long time. I trust what he does. He looks after my best intrests and takes care of me. 
-1	I think a lot of doctors these days, especially young ones, are not that concerned with taking the time need to solve a medical problem. They want to take the easy course, get paid and move on to the next patient.
-1	I don't have a regular physician at the moment but when I do I stick with one who I feel is great at their job
-1	I trust that my doctor has my best interests at heart. I have often had many questions and my doctor always had time to answer them and give me as many options as I needed to make health decisions.
1	I trust my doctor a lot because she's the one with the degree and not me. She knows what she's doing and I trust her because she hasn't given me a reason not to.
-1	I have been going to my family practice for over ten years. I am very comfortable with the doctors, nurses, and aides working there. They take the time needed with me, listen to all my concerns and answer all my questions, and will offer me additional options if need be.
1	 All my doctors have always given me competent information and competent care. I trust them very much.
1	I trust my doctor completely.  She is very up to date on things and knows how to explain in my language.
-1	he listens and explains things very well.my family has been a patient of his for over twelve years and everyone understands his explainations and plans for treatment.
-1	I tend to trust my physician inasmuch as he knows me for nearly 30 years and I know him well enough to know when I'm getting short shrift.
-1	I am doing fine and very healthy and nothing wrong with me. I am non-smoker, non-drinker, non-drug, and stay out of trouble, etc. I have one indoor cat. 
1	I trust my DR as he is always kind and asks all the right questions and spends time with me also I never call unless I am really sick and he always sees me the same day
1	I go to my GP with a concern about something, and even if she doesn't think that is what is happening, she will still follow through in checking herself, or else she will give me a referral to a physician that can give me peace.  Every specialist I have from her referrals has been just as interested, and just as careful to handle my concerns as my primary.
1	I've seen the same person for several years and we have developed a rapport with each other. I trust her to tell me the truth.
-1	I go in his office and he asks me how I am doing and looks at the lap top to see what is going on and says a few words and then says I will see you in 6 months. I keep him just for my medications.
-1	M doctor is big on test results but not as good as chatting about life. He is getting better. I talk with him more each time, and tell him what I need.
-1	I don't necessarily trust physician's opinions a hundred percent of the time because they can be wrong like anyone else. One physician is just one person's opinion. 
1	never has given me a reason not to trust him seems open and honest if i ask something takes the time to explain
-1	I live in a unsafe environment very sure that with the president. We can't trust anybody because it has come to that decision when it's one for all and all for ine
-1	I trust him because he's a good guy and he's kind and smart. I really like him a lot and he's good. Nothing else
1	So far nothing has happened to encourage me to distrust my primary care physician.  To be honest, there are very few primary care physician's that I have ever distrusted.
-1	I have many issues because of my Lupus diagnosis. Therefore I listen to my Doctor as well as listen to my body. I believe that my being well informed helps my relationship with my doctor.
-1	I trust my doctor based on her reputation and referrals.  but have not been with them long enough to build that trust on a long term basis.
-1	I do not see a primary care physician. I prefer holistic medicine, ie. natural or herbal medications, essential oils & studying changes in diet to aid in healing the body naturally. Our bodies were created to heal themselves. The use of synthetic medications tend to cause other physical side effects. They focus on the symptoms rather than the root problem causing the symptoms.
1	My doctor takes time and listen to what's going on with me. Takes time and doesn't rush. Takes time to explain
-1	I trust my doctor because its his job to know how to treat his patients but i think he could be more thorough and listen more.
1	I have only been going to him for 6 months but his dad has been a doctor in town for 30 years. He seems to be caring, knowledgeable and a good listener.
-1	my doctor is head of Neurology at a very large and well known teaching hospital in Alabama. My doctor has operated on my brain and I can still walk and talk but I am blind and deaf on my right side. I would rather be blind/deaf on one side than be paralyzed. I had a brain tumor and one doctor wanted to remove 100% which would have resulted in me being paralyzed. Thanks to my Mom's knowledge, I switched hospitals and neurosurgeons and I am not paralyzed. I do have 20% of tumor wrapped around my brainstem but 80% of tumor was removed by my current doctor
1	i trust my doctor to make the best decisions about my health. we have developed a good partnership over the years.
-1	The Primary Care Physician I have right now I trust very much, but she is leaving her practice and has not informed any patience as of yet. I am afraid of finding a new one Because my previous physican gave me a hard time helping me manage a medical condition
1	i trust my LNP greatly, she recently listened to me and wrote me a RX for an Ultrasound. We discovered my gall bladder was full of sludge(pre stone condition) , I now cann look forward to finally some relief. 
1	He is extremely careful and asks many questions. He has always been very inquisitive and helped me understand my thyroid problem.
-1	he knows what is best for me  they care about what happens to people because of their health. Doctors care I believe
-1	I trust my doctor because I can talk openly with her and she takes the time needed during my appointments
-1	I trust them because they went to school for being a doctor or physician I don't trust them because of the reason they push lots and lots of medicine on people when the main thing they need to tell the patient is to eat healthy and stop being sedentary 
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part and he does spend time with me when I have questions.  If he does not have answers to my questions about a specific problem, he would send me to a specialist.
-1	I trust my doctor in regards to being thorough with my medical needs but he has hundreds of patients so sometimes it feels like I'm not getting his total attention.
-1	He pays attention to detail.  He recommends another doctor if a specialist is needed without hesitation.  He is in the loops if I need to go to specialist.  He does not horse,around about giving medicine that will do the job.
1	No matter what my condition was or is mu primary care physician was able to make a correct diagnosis 100% of the time.
1	My physician takes his time in examining any problems mental or physically. He will provide accurate detailed information to in which once after the visit, you're more aware of your body especially on things that you didn't know.
1	HE LISTENS TO WHAT I TELL HIM ABOUT MY HEALTH AND IF SOMETHING IS NEEDED, HE WILL EXPLAIN IT TO ME. I ALWAYS WILL GET WHAT EVER TESTING  I NEED DOWN WITHOUT A SQUABBLE.
1	My doctor is open and honest with me. He is very thorough in his examinations and he seems to listen to what I'm saying to him. 
-1	Because every Dr I been too has mix diagnosed me,missed broken ribs,an tell u anything an think u are drug seeking. But don't care if you are actually in pain or sick
-1	I think she has so many patients so I feel like a number. I also thinl she wants to prescribe certain medications. I assume rhere are kickbacks 
-1	I do trust what the doctor has to say almost all the time. If it is something pricey and serious, I will get a second opinion.
-1	I don't distrust them. I place very high trust in them because they have been through years of school so that they can be in a place where they are.
-1	It is not that I distrust my primary care doctor but that I am fully aware they are human and humans make mistakes and or tend to miss things that aren't obvious so I am a strong advocate in believing in my gut and getting a second opinion if I have any doubts 
1	My doctors are very aware of my physical circumstances and listen to any objections I have. We agree together as to what is needed. If I have an objection, they willingly listen to me and change things.
1	this is a get one for me.being going for a long time.i like very much.he is the best one for me.that is why i go to him.
-1	I trust my primary. I believe they would never tell me nothing wrong, or give me something that's not good for me. An the same goes for my kids. I have trust in my primary doctor, and believe he/she will not harm me and my family.
1	we have had a close realationship for the past 8 years and he spends the time nessecary to make sure i understand all my opitions when it comes to any problems i have and the treatments available for me
-1	At the moment, I am in between a primary care physician.  I have been with an internal medicine doctor as my primary care doctor for almost 30 years and for the last two years (I go in once a year for a physical checkup), I feel I wasted my time.  He read my blood work and didn't even ask if I had any questions or problems to address.  I now have an appoint next month to see a new internal medicine doctor.
1	i trust my doctor because she takes her time with me to find out what is best for me. she also gives me advice on what kind of medications that would be good for my condition
-1	I am neutral about whether I trust or distrust doctors because there are many factors involved. You sometimes have to see different doctors and the circumstances are different for each one. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician to a point.  I trust her to know mainstream illnesses such as flu, colds, strep, UTIs, etc.  I would not have full confidence in her medical knowledge in more rare or extreme illnesses due to her age and lack of experience - she is barely 30 years old.  Also, I fully research any recommendations to verify her information.
1	In addition to a primary care physician, I also have many specialists and sub-specialists.  I find my primary-care physician works well with these other doctors to ensure positive outcomes.
-1	I trust the PA more then my primary doctor, she is more willing to find out what is wrong with me. Some primary doctors are only in it for the money and are not willing to diagnose and find out what is wrong with their patients. If a test doesn't show what is wrong then it ends there
-1	i trust him because he's a physicaian in the professional and medical field,he,s never steered me in the wrong direction that i can prove if anything to prove he is a kindhearted peson and really cares about his patients
-1	feel that she is rushed and doesn't have the time to address my concerns. i'd like to try a different type of a medication and also manage my chronic conditions better
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for 13 years, we have the same medical condition so we have a great repore.
-1	My primary is kind and caring.  She is also educated and thorough in her practices.  She makes me and my opinions matter.
-1	He's fine for check ups but quick to refer me to a specialist without trying a treatment first.  After I see the specialist, my family doctor defers to them and doesn't stay in the loop.
-1	"Medicine is now practiced by rote. The ""average"" person will accept the off-the-cuff surface diagnosis.  I'm not one of those people. As my mother pointed out years ago, presidents, kings, and doctors, all put their pants on one leg at a time. I only accept the ""Gospel truth"" from the Gospel."
-1	my primary care physician helped save my life, he was able to find, diagnose and treat an illness that could have killed me
-1	I trust them, She isVery in tune with me. She listens to me, she takes her time.  She doesn't rush you through and not listen
-1	I have been with my doctor fer a lot of years as well as he was my fathers doctor. He is more then competent as well as being a trusted source of medical needs and advice.
1	We have a great dialogue with  each other. He seems to actually listen to me, unlike other doctors in my past.
-1	To be honest, I haven't been to a primary care physician in many many year.  If I did go see one, I would have a great deal of trust. 
1	always trust my doctor all the time and he totally helps me take care of myself and my family all the time
1	I get a very strong impression that my doctor is looking out for my best interests and she is very knowledgeable about my conditions. 
-1	I trust my doctors because they have been there for me and have helped me find medical conditions that I didn't know existed and without them something bad could have happened.
-1	Sometimes I feel my clinical doctors are overwhelmed with too many patients and just skim the chart of the patient before him. His skimming the page can hardly relay too much confidence on said patient. 
1	I completely trust my primary care because I left his practice for 1 year many years ago and I got very sick. And the new doctor could not help me.. I went back to him and stayed and told him I would not leave again. It been over 25 years.
-1	That is hard to answer with any amount of certainty as my primary doctor has just retired and I have only had one contact with my new doctor.  That appointment went satisfactory -  but don't know the whole picture.
-1	I trust doctors because they have medical experience and know more than I do That is why I go to them when I am sick or have a medical problem
-1	I have not found a primary care doctor that i actually like. They are always quick to give medications or rush you out of the office. 
-1	He is a family friend but I personally do not like his bedside manner. He is a good doctors but he can be cold and brusque, which I do not like
-1	I feel that my doctor is completely up front and honest in all aspects that I deal with him. he has a very good reputation.
1	Typically doctors are there for your well-being and they have no interest in being dishonest or holding out on you usually they want what's best for you and will give you the best informed information about what is best for your condition and how to diagnose it and take care of it properly
-1	Sometimes I feel the Doctor has too many patients to concentrate fully on my medical results. I think they are preoccupied or overwhelmed with all they have going on in their own lives
-1	Now a days physicians could care less about patients its about money to them sadly to say...there isnt much more to say other than that
1	I have researched my physician thoroughly and I have known her for a very long time.  She always has my best interests in mind and has proven herself trustworthy.
1	I went through several doctors before I found my doctor.  He is always ready to listen, doesn't prejudge and is willing to go the extra mile to make sure that I understand what he tells me
-1	I trust because they talk to me and explain all my option and care about my needs always there in an emergency
1	I feel my doctors look out for my best interest.  They listen to me, answer my questions and make me feel confident I am doing the right thing.  I have been fortunate in my selection of physicians
1	I trust my primary care physician. I've seen this physician for many years and have never had a problem discussing concerns or listening to what to do to be proactive in my health.
-1	I have been having some health issues and they are not really sure what is wrong with me.  We are testing multiple theories but it is frustrating 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because my mother used the same one. Also, my physician is caring, kind and considerate to me when I visit. 
1	i have a long term relationship with my doctor and can talk frankly with him. we un derstand each other and he knows my history very well
1	I hadn't seen a doctor in many years when I found my current one, and she has always been upfront and forthright with me about my medical conditions, She has helped me get used to the medications I have to take, always explains why I'm getting them and always answers all my questions to my satisfaction
1	I started going to a new doctor since we moved. He is very gentle & kind. I had to have tests done, it didn't take long for him to call me with the results. 
-1	I trust them but plan to do further research regarding conditions I visit the doctor for before completely trusting treatment options
1	I DO NOT KNOW IF MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN ALWAYS HAS MY BEST INTEREST AT HEART. I AM NEW TO HIS PRACTICE AND HAVE NOT FULLY MADE UP MY MIND ON HIM. 
1	I trust my Dr because he is very experienced and he knows what he is talking about. I am confident that he has my best interest at heart.
-1	Just started going to this doctor and haven't established a relationship between us yet.Therefore I need to get a feel for my new primary care physician
-1	My doctor does not always take time when I see him.  He hardly spends time with me. That is all I have to say.
1	I have been told by another doctor that my doctor is one of the best in his field, which is a great complement. When one course of action comes to a halt, he always has another course of action to take.
-1	I don't have any reason not to trust them. I haven't had any issues come up because I've trusted and taken their advice in the past. I don't think they would tell me false information.
-1	well Trust is, of course, essential to both physician and patient. Without trust, how could a physician expect patients to reveal the full extent of their medically relevant history, expose themselves to the physical exam, or act on recommendations for tests or treatments? Trust promotes efficient use of both the patient's and the physician's time. Without trust, the process of informed consent for the most minor of interventions, even a prescribed antibiotic, would become as time consuming as that needed for major surgery.rust may even have therapeutic value, enhancing the efficacy of prescribed treatment.22 Most importantly, trust in the doctor caring for them is of great importance to patients. Patients who trust their doctors rate their care more favorably, as demonstrated by Keating et al.23 in this issue, as well as by others.20,24 Numerous open-ended studies of patients' views about their care, in a variety of contexts, most of which did not include specific hypotheses about trust, have found that patients spontaneously discuss trust and its importance, adding
1	He has been there every step of the way. He make me feel comfortable about dealing with my illness. 
1	She is knowledgeable about medical issues in general and thorough in individual treatment plans. She also very caring and personable which puts me at ease.
-1	My doctor was going to give Zoloft to my husband for anxiety knowing that he has heart problems. She also wants me on pain management and I don't want to do that. 
1	Doctor  John Smith in Springfield is my doctor. He is the kindest and considerate person I have ever had as a doctor. The one I had before was Jane Doe, she was mean rude and could care less about me. She should never have become a doctor. She hates people, I was not the only person that she mistreated.
-1	I have moved to colo. So I have not found a primary doctor yet. The doctor I had in Michigan I completely trusted. They helped me control my asthma. 
-1	Doctors are human and as such are not above making mistakes and missing things that should have been observed and so we have to remember this and question things along the way.
1	I'm neutral about some docters and physicians. They can tell you what they think is goo for you but then things can turn out to be bad for you. For instant my wife had high blood pressure. Her blood pressure is always high and she is on medication. They have switched her medicine about 4 times saying that the next one will help, which neither one has helped. I don't that everything they say and everything they supply to you. 
1	He just makes me feel like he cares a lot about me.  He is very caring and attentive to any of my concerns.
-1	I don't have a regular doctor at all I don't have health insurance so if I get sick or something I have to go to the emergency room
1	I have had the same primary care physician for somewhere between 10-15 years.  Moreover, I have gone to the same practice for more than 25 years, so there is a good file built up of my records.
-1	I believe sometimes a doctor will persuade you into what they think should happen or their beliefs. They don't always look at it as your way of thinking just what they've been taught and learned. They also aren't alway as compassionate about and undertanding about the way you feel they do things every day and some doctors loose their passion for their work and it becomes just a pay check.
-1	I trust my doctor to give me the best advice about my health. I also feel most doctors are somewhat out to make a extra buck.
-1	I  LIKED THE PRIMARY ATTENTION OF MY DOCTOR BECAUSE IS GOD, THE INFORMATION THE HE LET ME KNOW IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND
-1	most doctors like to load their patients up on lots of medications. for example, when i was 17 i went to my doctor with stomach pain. it turns out i have acid reflux, my doctor gave me medication for it instead of giving me a list of foods to avoid.
-1	I trust my primary doctor because I feel she went to doctor school and she should have learned something about the human body. She specialize in a special field of practice. I trust in God and believe in her to take care of my health and give me advice about it.
-1	I feel that too many doctors are influenced by pharmaceutical companies and only want to promote  the taking of drugs instead of determing the underlining root causes of illness. 
-1	I think my doctor is a good one.  I think she's very busy.  I trust her, I just think she's busy. She makes recommendations and ask me lots of questions.
-1	My doctor seems very stern and I am uncertain whether she truly knows what is best for my body. For instance, she strongly recommended that I take birth control. However, I am not open to the effects that it will have on my body and at this point and time in my relationship, a child would not be such a bad thing. She did not care for my feelings and was only concerned about the medical aspect of the situation. 
1	I trust my doctor because of his track record and because of my own research into my condition. When  we meet, he seems to genuinely care about me and my conditions, and does not judge me. 
-1	Doctors are there to help figure out what is wrong with you with the information you give them the more correct information they have the better the results. Most of the time they just give the brugs that is design to help the problem that you have 
1	I trust my doctor because they never beat around the bush to tell me the truth, and make sure that I'm feeling as good as possible. They always have a way to cheer me up, and lessen painful experiences. 
1	My Doctor, OBGYN, has been my doctor for over 15 years and he's the best. He diagnosed my cancer and re moved it as well. I've been cancer free for 5 years. 
-1	The medical field as a whole is unreliable and the drug industry is completely untrustworthy which makes the doc harder to trust because drug reps coerce them into pushing their drugs even tho another drug would be much bettet
-1	Have many years of experience. Have been in the community for decades. Will take the time to listen to my questions and concerns
1	My doctor takes her time during my appointment to answer all of my questions and concerns. She seems concerned about my health concerns as well.
1	well i trust my doctor and all that he do for me.they take very good care of me. ther is nothing i dislike
-1	I want to say that I completely agree with my doctor but some of the things that he says I find it to be true
1	I am between doctors right now, but my last doctor was very patient, knowledgeable and concerned about any problems or conditions I brought to him.  He would  asked question about my symptoms and suggest remedies for me to consider.  
-1	At times, their mane concern is to make money through my insurance or even through me. I would rather look up my illness and take care of it in my only unless it is really savvier, then I would go in and have the doctor take a look. 
1	My doctor cares about my condition and makes sure I understand what she's saying, about the different meds that I take on a daily basis. If I don't understand something, she'll explain until I completely understand it. 
1	i have been using the same doctor for 18 years she delivered my son. also was a mentor to my daughter. she also treats her medically
-1	I trust my physician because they have all the resources to handle my situations but they are not perfect so I do not completely depend on them to be honest and correct about everything.
-1	She seems to care more about squeezing the most money out of the insurance company as possible and doesn't seem to care if I can make up the difference
1	My PCP is very caring and thorough. She never rushes through my appointments/exams and we go over each of my conditions and monitor my process.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She is trustworthy and knows what she is doing most of the time of my visits
-1	When a doctor shows interest in what I have to say and gives advices relevant to my needs, it helps build trust.
-1	my doctor only cares about stupid things and not actual issues. I do not get the help that I need. they only throw drugs at the problems and send me on my way
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he will refer me to a specialist if he is unaware of anything. I trust my ob gyn because he is knowledgeable, easy to talk to, respectful, he listens, he gives me options. Both my physicians listen and do research. 
-1	Medications, Test,  Availability  My doctor explains the reason for the medications he prescribes for me. My doctor tell me about the possible side effects of medications. The medical test that my doctor recommends for me, he explains why they are necessary. Finally my doctor makes himself available on short notice, if I need to see him.
-1	I had one that I know that I couldn't trust but all the rest are good people and they make sure that I have all of the information that I need
1	I trust my doctor because i have been seeing her for over 2 years now.  I feel that she knows me and my diagnosis very well so most things she suggest such as treatments and medicines i believe is always in my best interest. 
-1	I trust my primary care physicians because they have experience with medical issues that I do not understand.
-1	I trust my physician because he seems knowledgeable about health care. Not only that he seems to generally care about his patients. He never rushes through my appointments and answer any question I may have.
1	I've known them for years and they've always had my best interests. My doctor always gives me ways to treat what's ever wrong with me, they let me know which treatment is beat but they let me choose which one I prefer
1	I've had the same Doctor for about 15 years and she's never steered me wrong , she's always had my best interest at heart . She is Really good at her job and it's not JUST A job to her
1	My doctor is honest and gives me options. She listens and is patient. My doctor informs me of everything.
-1	I JUST SAID NEUTRAL THAT DOESN'T MEAN  NOTHING.I DO TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. I DO HAVE A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR
-1	My doctors are great and listens sometimes, but sometime looks over some of the problems I am experiences.  I have been having a shooting pain in my foot and all she says is its your nerve but haven't checked it out.
-1	I don't have a regular doctor's but the doctor's I've been to has be really trusting.They all ways tell me what I need to know.
1	I have many doctors and i view them as a team. There are 10 doctors i see and i trust them to get it right. I listen and i ask quesrions. 
-1	well I think the doctor does his job as he was trained to do but he isn't god and doesn't always know what illness is present  right away
1	My doctor has been with me throughout three pregnancies. I was sooo sick that I was hospitalized each time.  She was always upfront with me. She and all the doctors in the practice had excellent bedside manners.
-1	I trust no one, so therefore I  will ask alot of questions.  I think everyone should get a second opinion; or ask questions until you get all questions answered .
1	My doctor presents me with options when it comes to my health. He is always available to me.  I can reach him on the phone or via email.  He responds promptly to my requests
-1	I trust my primary doctor because, have no reason to tell me a lie! Don't trust because might be wrong!!
1	My doctor has always been proactive in my care and scheduled any tests that I may need. I would recommend my doctor to all my friends and family 
-1	She doesn't act like she is too concerned about my problems. She speaks over top of me. She doesn't do proper testing or know about the specific diagnosis, so smuts hard for her to recommend me to the proper specialist.
-1	I feel that today's doctors are trained to see people as numbers rather than people so it is hard to trust whether or not they really care
-1	I trust my doctor because I've been with her a few years, and she helps me with everything, all my health needs. She's very thorough and asks me questions to really understand my concerns. I do feel like all doctors push medications and sometimes I feel like some of the medications I'm supposed to take can make situations worst or the misunderstand my needs prior to providing me with a medication. 
-1	My doctor's seem to be laid back and more concerned with quantity than quality, coming up with treatment's before even fully diagnosing a situation
-1	I neither trust or distrust my current primary care physician because I currently do not have a primary care physician
-1	She contradicts herself a lot. I'm actually in the process of looking for another doctor. She never gives clear cut answers. 
-1	I may not have the best relationship with my kids primary care doctor, but I do trust her. She is a very straight forward knowledgeable person that has practiced medicine for for 30 years.
1	He's always been honest and have had precise diagnosis on my health conditions.. He's also very careful knowing how to handle injurys.
1	I trust my doctor with my health decisions. They are always looking out for my well being. I can talk to them about anything that relates to my health.
-1	theres no way you can trust or distrust your primary care physician unless there was an appropriate plays going on

1	They have been my doctos for awhile I believe it was when they tell me things. They haven't steered me wrong thus far.
-1	 i trust my primary care physician because she takes my concerns seriously and runs through tests and exhaust all possibilities
1	No exact reason why. Doctors have saved me multiple times before in the past and also will be in the future.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because I've gotten second opinions and my doctor always  seem to take her time she knows everyone by name and takes her time with you
-1	I wont go back cant go back to the way things use to be today is the day I have to go home and cook dinner for my family and if I don't they will be really mad at me and will not talk to me at all for a week and I will be very sad
-1	Doctors are people too. they are practicing medicine, so they don't have all the answers to medical problems. I don't completely trust anyone. 
-1	Sometimes I feel as though doctors diagnose without actually running the necessary tests. It took two doctors to let me know that I had acid reflux and needed prescription medication. 
1	Any time that I have had medical issues, my doctor has taken the time to explain all options. I never feel rushed when I visit my doctor. My doctor has accurately diagnosed and treated several conditions I incurred.

It's best in my opinion to go out and do my own research before trying anything just because I feel like most doctors really at the end of the day care about making money more than their patients health
1	I have never had a problem with my doctor.  They explain my medications and recommend new ones if never.  To date they have been right on the button and I don't have mother negative about them.

If, a medication is producing ill effects or too much is given. When, I am in control, I stop immediately & I don't take. Once the wrong thing has been administered it maybe to late.

1	Whenever I have my yearly check up with my doctor I have trust in the outcome.  But if I were diagnosed with something I was not sure about I would get a second opinion.  I have a pretty good trust in doctors because before I go to a doctor I research him/her first so I know I have the best pretty much.

So I always trusted his judgment because I have pretty much known him my whole life.  I also trust my new doctor because he is a doctor and that is his job 
-1	I feel like all doctors are there first for the income and second for the health of the people. It's kind of hard to tell whether or not a doctor really cares about your well being or they just tell you anything to get you out of the way.
1	i trust mine because she knows her stuff and she has progressed my health much more than before. she has the knowledge to tell me truthfully whats right  from whats wrong

-1	In general all human beings (including physicians) share a margin of error potential.  Therefore, I do not blindly place explicit trust in any person.  It is important for all consumers who are able to act as their own advocate to assume this responsibility. Second opinions and thorough research should be considerations used to influence these personal decisions.

-1	They are honest and helpful. In a human level they give you tips on what is right for you.i feel they break down the good and the bad of your health situation in a way that makes you think.

-1	I don't fully trust one of my primary care doctors  because my bills are always really high. It's like she just orders every test she can possibly find even though it's not necessarily needed.

-1	It seems like they're always in a hurry to just prescribe me anything and get me out of there. They also don't really do thorough checks to figure out what is really wrong with me when I'm really sick. They just send me on my way to fast.

-1	Well it depends. Some doctors only group their patients in a certain category. They do not praise when the patient does well and cannot recognize the patients who are compliant 
1	It depends on the individual doctor. I have met some that are terrible, but most are as I rated them above.
-1	My distrust in my primary care DR is when they told me inserts in my meds was for lawyers and not for me to read, That was not right

-1	I generally trust my physicians, but I'm not afraid to ask questions or challenge their proposed approach if I'm aware of something they may not have considered. If my treatment isn't working, I'll do some research on my own and come back with questions the next time.

-1	I know my body better than my physicin and they dont always get things right pertaining my health. They always try to push some drug i dont need.

1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR COMPLETELY.   IT IS VERY EASY TO TALK TO HER AND TO SEE THAT SHE IS A VERY INTELLIGENT PERSON.  SHE HAS NEVER BEEN WRONG WITH ME AND I HAVE LEARNED VERY MUCH FROM DURING THE FEW YRS I HAVE BEEN SEEING HER ABOUT MY HEALTH ISSUES
-1	I generally do not completely trust doctors.  I had one that was totally honest and they could not fix the problem. Another could have fixed something and did not.  A lot of times it's medication. not doctors I don't trust.  My mother died from the nthe side effects of a med she was on.
-1	"i dont really distrust him, i've gotta bad bumpy past & he holds it against me, i really should go & find a new doctor, other than that he's a ""ok"" doctor"

-1	I trust my doctor because he helped me a lot with my past medical issues. He always explain everything to me.
1	The doctors that I have are all outstanding physicians in their fields.  They listen to me and we work as a team in coming up with my health care plan.

I trust her because she has shown that my health is of important concern to her.
1	i trust that my doctor knows what she's doing and if a problem arises, i know that she will diagnose and help me find the best possible treatment/medication for my needs
1	My doctor is always patient and thorough with me, even though most of my problems are mental and not physical and I have another doctor to handle the mental stuff. Even when she's running behind she spends the full time with me

Idon't feel comfortable around her.  Iavoid her and go to a separate clinic or straight to the hospital if I need care- such as when I just broke my shoulder.
-1	I know what is wrong with me but I try to tell my Doctor and he thinks nothing is wrong.  All my X-rays,  CT tells a different story.
-1	I guess that I trust my doctor. It really does no good not to. I don't know anything about it. I guess the only thing you can do is get a second opinion because someone else might have a different perspective.
-1	I trust him to a point because he's a doctor but I don't trust him in a way because doctors aren't always right
-1	Sometimes they seem to intentionally downplay the effects of a medication, in order to get me to agree to try it, even though I have tried it in the past with very negative results
1	She is very knowledgeable and experienced.  My Dr. is also very honest and open when she communicates with you. She treats you like a person.

1	I have been going to him for over 25 years, he is one of the most well known doctors in CA.  I trust him completely

-1	Thanks for Your time and consideration for any inconvenience caused and thank goodness for your loss or not but it will be a little more time to get my hands
-1	I do not think they spend enough time with me and listen to what I am saying.  Some times I leave my appointment feeling frustrated.
-1	I don't always believe that I can trust physicians in general. I believe that some of them care more about marketing certain products or services and they try to sell it to you, without being honest about the products and it's side effects etc. 
1	My doctor has always been honest and upfront with me and he shows he cares. I couldn't ask for more from him.
-1	I don't trust in chemical drugs ,I believe in Nature's cures but I just don't trust anyone knowledgeable to know but yet with the audacity gives you chemicals. 
-1	I currently don't have a primary physician. But the one I had was pretty good, caring and efficient.

1	My primary care doctor I trust because he test everything or look into everything have questions about 
-1	I trust my primary care physcian because we have a strong relationship when it comes down to my health.
-1	I've been going to the same doctor for several years. He's become a close family friend and keeps my best interest in mind always .
-1	Sometimes doctors does not explore all the options available and they sometimes treat people differently because of race or status
-1	I trust my doctor because he has known me since I was child. now that I am older its time for me to go to a another doctor it is hard for to trust people.
-1	Doctor now a days don't act concern I at all  always in s hurry and don't listen my doctor prescribed me meds and my other doctor asked why was I taking two meds that shouldn't go together. I was so mad.

1	I've known him for a number of years,and I trust his judgement he's caring and I think he gives me good advice that is good for me
1	I have had the same physician since birth he has always been honest and open with myself and my parents. When we need referrals to other Dr.'s he gives us the best one he knows and follows up with that Dr. to make sure they are all on the same page with my treatments if any are needed.
1	I trust their knowledge and that they will tell me what is good for me. I do not think they would lie.
-1	He's been my doctor for over 20 years. He's not the most organized and he makes mistakes but he has a good bedside manner and he cares about my health. 
-1	 I feel like it they can learn more about their  position  but like some just give you a quick answer  I feel like some doesn't listen to what you going  going through
-1	i trust it but sometimes i feel like they are like a mechanic , they tell you extra things that are wrong than what actually is. medicines are expensive and the doctor scares me
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been her patient for years and years and she hadn't let me down and don't think she will regrading my health. 
-1	They are guided by big pharma and their paychecks. Why else would there be advertisements on TV about something a doctor should be prescribing?
-1	Doctors in general I feel can be trusted. If anything, their reputation is on the line, and in any field, reputation is key.
-1	I feel that, similar to lawyers, medical professionals will sometimes look to profit instead of wanting the best service for their customer. For example, a few years ago my dentist suggested braces, which would've been an extra 4,000 dollars. I refused, and my teeth are still perfectly healthy.
-1	At this current time I do not have a primary doctor. The reason being is that there is nothing going on with me. As me trusting or distrusting a doctor that's neither here or there because I trust in a higher power 
1	it took me a while to find the right doctor, but after almost 3 year I think I have finally found a doctor that I can truly trust.

-1	I trust my physician because they just wants what is best for me. They are honest to me about my options. 
-1	i trust my primary care because she always is there for me and helps me and has given me no reason not to trust her 
-1	I feel like doctors are just in and out of the room so fast and I don't feel like they actually care about your situation they just need to hurry and get to the next patient.
1	My docotor is an amazing woman and she helps me all the time when I'm sick and also gives me advise to walk in her shoes 
-1	He doesn't always look into what is wrong with me.  He just assumes. I'll tell him what it wrong with me and he will say oh well it sounds like this and that but doesn't do any kid of tests at all. Thats not OK to hold someone's life in their hands
1	Our family physician has been our physician for over 30 years. He has interest in our family relations. He, at times, is more of a friend then he is a doctor.
-1	They don't really go over every possible option that could be wrong. They don't consider everything and are not thorough 
-1	I feel that they don't totally tell me.everything honestly. They are more worried bout money and the pharmaceutical company.  
-1	I feel they just want to hurry me out of the office. And although I ask the questions they cliup through them without full explanation or simple yes and no as opposed to futher explanation.
-1	I only have a mild distrust of doctors because of some experiences my mother has had working with them, but on the whole I have had extremely kind and patient primary care physicians. My GYN doctor, especially, is extremely trustworthy. She gives her patients her personal cell number to call at anytime in case of an emergency. 
-1	I don't have a primary doctor because the ones I went to weren't that great and I feel that they didn't understand me or didn't believe me and my condition and made me feel like I was lying
1	What ever she tells me always works. I have never had any problems trusting my Doctor and any of the other Doctors I have ever seen.
1	I believe my doctor is taking care of my needs and is there when I need them. I have trust in my doctor.
-1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR THAT SHE WILL ALWAYS GIVE ME THE CORRECT INFORMATION EVEN IF I DON'T WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE IS SAYING.
1	For one, doctors go through many years of education; they strive and work hard to gain the knowledge needed solely to help others. This career is a selfless one. Also, any health and medical situation I've been in, the advice and/or medicine prescribed has worked efficiently to fix the issues. I've no reason to not trust doctors. 
-1	They seem kind and I have never had any issues with them. They come highly recommended. I have be given accurate diagnostics, advice, and medication for any illness I have had. 
-1	I do care about my primary care physician because i have a close relationship with him and he knows me for years
-1	I don't trust ANY physician. They're in the pockets of big pharma and push possibly harmful or unnecessary drugs for personal gain. Money is their bottom line.
-1	I don't feel like it is intellegant to trust any one 100 percent with your health because of so much malpractice 
1	he always takes his time with me, gives me advice and then leaves it up to me.  Great be side matter.
-1	I trust her education and experience, but she and other doctors spends so little time with patients that I feel it's hard for them to know each patient.
1	he takes good care of me and if any thing is wrong with me he will sit and explain my options to me and we can decide what form of actions to take
-1	Sometimes when I'm sick, I go in and they give me one medication. My condition sometimes stays the same and sometimes gets worse, so I go back in and they give me a different medication. I understand that medicine practice can be experimental, but I hope that isn't regularly the case AND it should definitely not be the case when messing with things like antibiotics. 
1	I finally found a PCP who listens to me and knows I know more about my condition than he does. I will listen to his advice about other medical issues that I know little about 
1	I'd be dead without her. Always having my best of interest and making sure I'm fine, physically and mentally 
1	my personal physician has known me for 50 years and has never steered me wrong. He doesn't over medicate and I have total confidence that anything he suggests is worth listening to.
1	My doctor is a very good and honest man.  He is about 35 and has a modern view about many things.  He explains everything in detail and ask many questions about me and my conditions.  He is very knowledgeable about family medicine because that is what he studied in medical school.  I could not ask for a better doctor.  He also treats my entire family the same way.

-1	I trust the doctor to run blood work that is needed and shots that are needed. I trust the doctor will give me the right medications with the right dose.
1	I've been to doctors in the past that didn't listen, didn't ask questions, didn't explain conditions or medications thoroughly, and always acted like they were in a rush and had something more important to do. My current doctor is the exact opposite of what I've described.
-1	Sometimes doctors omit information because I did not ask them directly about it. They also tend to rush the process of care and are bound by hospital rules which may prohibit preventitive procedures without compelling evidence. 
1	highly trained professional that knows their jobs.always put,s their patients first,and provide high quality care
-1	I trust them because my family uses them and have used them before I was here. I feel like that is the biggest thing that makes me feel like I am taken care of.
1	He has never let me down after many years and has always gone to extreme length s to assure my treatment
-1	I do not have complete trust in my doctor as they need to make money first, and care about people less than they should. They want to help others but also can't do the cheapest options.
-1	I trust them, it's there job to make sure people like me are OK. I'm sure you don't go to school for 10 years and not learn anything there.
-1	I feel my doctor is not concerned about me I have health insurance and he is getting paid. I get feel he does not want to touch me.  I am just another number he is rushing out to see the next person

-1	i dont even understand that question either. i am tired of these people over here. they are out of control. i dont think they have any original thoughts in their head.
-1	In the past my pharmaceutical care has been top-notch in most of the issues that I've had I've been able to receive helpful and cheap help that while inexpensive was still effective to the point where I could get what I needed without having to lose half of my bank account. As well as the fact that when I'm in the care of my dr. I feel as if I can address issues that I have and concerns that I have while still being able to see honest feedback with proper support and help

-1	Dr has been around for years and tries to make me understand what's going on with my health and inform me

1	this is general-doctors have been nice to me and let me know what to expect in way of treatment or if it was something that would take time to heal-they have been right more often than not
-1	I'm not sure they always have my best interest at heart. On the other hand they are willing to give their medical opion.

-1	I do not currently have a primary care physician, and although I am confident in the abilities and knowledge of doctors in general, I am hesitant to put my complete trust into anyone.  I like to explore various options and opportunities, and I know that doctors do not always have the answer.
1	I believe in my doctor because when I need a doctor I go to them for help and I talk and explain everything and I listen to them  than I notice when they are listening to me.
1	Because not only do they care for me, they ask when the pain last occurred and to rate it on a scale. They have more than one way to solving from the most risky to the less.
-1	Well when I first met my doctor 2 years ago he is adding me head to toe tell me you don't things I need to do things I shouldn't do for the first month and now it's just pills pills pills pills to cure one paying the Cure that pain is almost like a pill Pusher and I don't like medicine all the time there's a lot of Earthly things that you can do besides taking medicine all the time so my concern with the doctor is maybe I should change doctors I don't know then I spend maybe a few minutes with you but I understand they have a lot of patience but it just in and out of the door when you want to ask a question it's like okay what else do you need not very concern so maybe I should change doctors that's

1	I completely without a shadow of a doubt have complete and total trust in my PHYSICIAN. He and She ate awesome in what they do
-1	"I believe that most doctors are educated in their field, but have their own expert ""opinion"" when it comes to certain topics. For example, I had an allergist suggest to me that I shouldn't nurse my daughter past a certain age due to her dairy and egg allergy."
