0.838900	I feel like I'm more than capable of understanding basic health information. If I don't understand some parts, I ask my doctor to explain in normal terms. If I'm still confused on it, I go home and study it.
0.733300	I can ask questions/ use the internet if I don't understand something. I don't feel like I don't have the ability to find things about my health.

0.583300	I have had to deal with hospitals in the past due to my father dying of lung cancer. So I had to deal with a lot of forms, documents, and medical speak. So I have experience dealing with them.
0.622200	Some of it is fine, but most is very hard to understand
0.872200	In person, I sometimes have issues because I'm not always able to process all the details.

0.394400	The drs just kind of talk over me and make it hard to know what they are talking about. they quote numbers of this and cognitive that and things that I don't understand. I sometimes have my mom to help me but we are just simple folk who don't know what they mean most of the time. it's frustrating
0.783300	I feel like I can ask the right questions, however some doctors seem to lack social skills and have an issue relating to their patients. They give answers that don't mean anything to a normal patient.
0.833300	I know different terminologies related to different conditions. I also know what a Doctor means when they explain something that causes whatever health condition I may have.
0.794400	I think I can process and understand basic health information.  My parents have had a lot of health issues, so I grew up learning a lot about hospitals.
0.888900	I am already a medical student. I have extensive experience understanding more than just basic health information. I am trained to do so.

0.777800	I think overall I am able to understand the process. But if something rare comes out up, or it could be a variety of different possibilities that need to be tested for, it can be difficult to keep all the info straight. 
0.916700	I know I can. if I have questions I will ask for more understanding

0.900000	I have an extremely good ability to process this sort of information. I have advanced degrees and process more complication information routinely.
0.605600	I think I am above average in my understanding of medical terminology.  However when I do not understand something I have a hard time getting a hold of someone.  Also I forget to ask the questions I have until after I leave.
0.888900	I feel like I do. I have learned through the years to be very direct with people in the medical profession. I frankly don't trust anyone but the doctors and the nurses, and they start out as suspect. Any civilian working for the hospital is to be treated with zero trust whatsoever.
0.744400	I do understand all of the basics. When a doctor goes into detail, sometimes I have a hard time understanding. I always ask questions to clarify if I do not understand.

0.527800	I have some ability to gain access to the basic health information I need, however most doctors make things vague or do not know enough about my own health to advise me. I feel like most doctors look for the easiest answer possible and then go with that, explaining the bare minimum about how to take care of myself after this.
0.916700	I feel that I am fully capable to do this.  I am a reasobly intelligent adult so I have the ability to understand things and to ask questions if I do not understand something
0.872200	I am quite confident in my ability to do so. I studied medicine in college and am usually quite capable of learning and understanding basic health information.

0.777800	Very well. If it's broken down in layman's terms I understand
0.872200	I feel I can process and understand health information with ease. I've yet to have any significant difficulty. 
0.705600	Yes, I do, however, I don't think Doctors care so much anymore. My grandfather was a radiologist. In those days everyone had a good Doctor and they could afford to see him. My grandfather says his father was a doctor in the depression. People paid him with chickens, eggs and milk. I think barter might be a better way to have a doctor. Now when you say you have no insurance or state insurance they won't even make an appointment to see you.
0.916700	I feel confident about my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. This leads to confidence in making appropriate health decisions. 
0.916700	With my background in medical terminology, I have no problems.
0.827800	I feel like I know a lot about health sciences because of going to school for occupational therapy and understanding many of the basic medical terms and understanding the basic health needs we should possess. If I am ever confused by something, what I usually do is repeat what they said to get a confirmation of that topic or what I need to follow. I generally am pretty good and understanding how to document everything I need to for my medical history and what not.
0.855600	I feel I am well equipped to obtain and understand health information. I think I am an informed patient and I can make decisions with the help of my doctor.
0.455600	I feel like I can make decisions confidently.  I just have trouble with all the stuff you got to deal with when you are sick.
0.872200	Overall I feel that I can obtain and understand basic health information. I can get the information I need out of them, and in writing. I also am able to follow up on that information with my own research. I am also able to make appropriate choices based upon this material. 
0.833300	I'm still mentally aware. It's my body that's falling apart.
0.705600	I think I have an average ability to comprehend everything. I went to school for medical assisting and worked in health insurance claims for years.

0.516700	I feel that I have the ability to obtain it, but I have less of an ability to process and understand it.

I think there should be guides for some of these things.
0.816700	I am confident in my ability to process and understand the information. I always ask questions when I'm not sure
0.866700	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information because I have a degree in English Language Arts.

0.883300	I feel that I have a good understanding of what is being said to me by a doctor or nurse, but I have a difficult time trusting them.
0.861100	i FEEL LIKE i AM VERY QUALIFIED. i HAVE A GOOD KNWLEDE OF MEDICAL THINGS AND MEDICATION
0.461100	I think it is hard because there are so many different factors and what if this choice isn't the best one you don't really know all the health information to make an informed decision
0.794400	i feel like i am able to understand all the info that is given to me. I have the knowledge and ability to understand and use this info to help me

0.872200	I am well educated enough to understand almost all medical information and to process what information is provided to me. My main issue is making sure I advocate for myself in asking questions, especially if it's with a provider I don't know well.
0.916700	I am intelligent enough to understand medical discussions. I can read and understand printed material.
0.755600	"I feel I have the capacity to do these things but I don't always have the resources or the confidence to do them. So, it isn't a certainty that I can find a specialist who can provide me the ""right"" answers to my questions. I don't always ask enough follow-up questions, in my opinion, as I don't want to take up too much of the health provider's time."
0.872200	I do completely. I am smart, educated, good with words and basic science. I understand quick
0.850000	I can obtain and process all basic health information without assistance. If I have any questions I am always sure to ask, and seek clarification until I am sure I understand what I am being told.

0.866700	I am confident in answering all questions concerning my health. Also in reading medical papers.
0.811100	I feel like it isn't that hard to get clear information on what I need. Even if I don't bother asking someone, Google is right there to provide additiol information.
0.633300	Sometimes I do. When they start giving probabilities and percentages, I start to lose them though. I prefer black and white explations. 
0.833300	I believe that I have the capacity to understand health information. I rarely need clarification on health terms and feel I have a good grasp of basic health information.
0.833300	I have great capacity to obtain this information. I am in medical school, my mother is a doctor, and my brother is also in medical school.

If I have enough time, I can alyze the date given to me and find satisfactory information in it.
0.850000	I have had some medical training (EMT) so I understand a lot of what I'm told.  If I have any confusion, I simply ask.
0.800000	After seeing a doctor for a condition, I am comfortable to look up more information on my own to help me understand it. sometime it feels rushed when I see a doctor, there's only so much time you have to ask questions.

0.916700	I think that I can understand the information pretty well, I've never needed help filling out forms or anything regarding healthcare before.  The only time I've been confused about something was when I got insurance (for the first time) and wasn't sure where to put the information on a form.
0.816700	I think that I would, somewhat competently. I would probably need a little help parsing written information and organizing it all in my help, but I'd probably be able to do most of it myself.
0.766700	I feel like I can understand 90% of what is being told and explain.  One in a while  I have NO IDEA what they are talking about.

0.916700	I AM VERY WELL READ AND HAVE NO PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING MEDICAL OR LEGAL FORMS
0.655600	I always feel comfortable when speaking to a medical professiol because they have seen many cases of my case. Whether I have allergies or anxiety, I talk to my doctor and tell him every step of pain or exhaustion I feel. I leave no stone un turned as I want the doctor's trust and help. 
0.916700	I have complete ability to understand all basic health information.
0.477800	Most of that stuff goes over my head. I don't even read it half the time. The United States health care system is designed to screw us over. Who cares if I miss the fine print? It's all the same to me. Nobody cares.

0.872200	I feel I am better than average.
0.738900	With the power of the internet, I can find most medical information. Understanding it is a bit more difficult but it can be done if I really want to put the time in.

0.844400	The only thing I have issue with is knowing my family history, and my immunization record - if it's really needed, I have to talk to my mom.  But I have excellent reading comprehension, know how to search for and then synthesize information I want, and know my own preferences well enough to be confident in my judgments.
0.783300	I feel good about it. I've also gotten better at asking questions that I need answered in a way that helps me understand better. It's very important that I know what's going on with my body.
0.916700	I feel that I have full capacity to get the information that I need and to understand it.  If I ever feel that I don't understand something I ask for it to be explained.  Also, I always ask questions.

0.888900	I have a higher capacity than the general population but not as much as a healthcare professiol of any sort (nurses, MA, doctors, etc) because my son was in the hospital for a time and I have to help my mom understand forms about her and my grandmother. I know the questions to ask.
0.777800	I think I'm pretty competent to make my own health decisions. I usually ask questions when I need to and tell them what they need to know.

0.705600	I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I am usually hesitant about health related things and I like to double check my information and sources to make sure I am doing everything the right way. 
0.738900	I feel that this very needed.  It is hard to understand some of the information they tell you because I feel they need to dumb it down for me. 
0.722200	For the most part I feel like the information is available. But often the medical staff or doctor is rushed and they seem impatient and rushed.
0.833300	I feel that I am fully capable of getting and understanding the information.  I also know how to ask the right questions and to ask for help if need be
0.811100	I think I am as (or more) capable as most people. I always assume that I will need to do my own research because I don't trust that my doctors (and certainly not the insurance co) have my best interests as their first priority. 
0.916700	I feel very confident that I have to capacity to understand basic health information. It is my health, after all, and I refuse to not have any and all information regarding any medical situations.
0.722200	I am pretty compentant at understanding what a lot of the words mean, but sometimes it is hard to understand certain implications of different aspects of my health.  I think it is better when a doctor can beak it down into terms more relateable rather than heavily coded in medical and scientific jargon  
0.644400	I feel like I sometimes am able to obtain, process, and understand health information and services to make appropriate health decisions, but not all the time. For example, when it's busy at the pharmacy, the pharmacist isn't always available to answer my questions about prescriptions. And when I visit the doctor for an acute problem, I can rarely get my chronic issue questions answered without having to schedule another visit.
0.916700	I am capable of understanding my diagnoses and seek the medical help I may need
0.761100	I can understand most of the information but sometimes the way it is phrased or written leaves me feeling confused or lost. In the past I have struggled with reading some details. Sometimes I have just skimmed the material and signed even when I don't understand it.
0.855600	I believe I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I research online or talk to trusted friends/family who are knowledgable in healthcare in order to ask the right questions.
0.522200	I believe that I am able to moderately understand the things presented to me
0.827800	I do feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information.  There might be times when I feel uncomfortable asking follow up questions or forget or don't think to ask something when I am in the office with the nurse/doctor
0.594400	I believe I do have the ability to access the information but often it comes from outside sources. I often feel rushed or intimidated by my medical staff and do not speak up to ask the proper questions, or I become so overwhelmed by the dismissive or hurried mood they have that I sit quietly instead of taking up more of their time.  Sometimes things don't make sense and I am too passive to speak up and say anything, and then often have to research it at home myself, which leaves me wondering if I am finding the correct information or not. 
0.866700	I understand it for the most part. Sometimes I do not understand what certain words mean, but usually can find a definition online or ask someone who is in the medical profession. I feel like I have pretty good access due to my insurance.

0.677800	I feel that I have a basic understanding generally of what the doctor or nurse is telling me. Sometimes I misunderstand what they are saying, or take the information out of context and miss vital information. When I get confused I feel kind of stupid and rarely ask for clarification.
0.744400	I think that I understand basic health information when its given by health care professiols. Sometimes I can forget things related to nutrition after I am told, but for the most part I think I have a pretty good grasp on this type of information. 
0.716700	I think if the problem is just basic health, I have no problems. I am old enough to have life experiences that make me understand the basics. It is anything above that level that creates problems.
0.883300	I am from a medical family and have a ton of information, and I know how to communicate with health professiols. I have everything I need to get all the information I need.
0.838900	I have a good amount of ability to understand basic health information. I have relatives in the medical field that teaches me things occasiolly. I have also taken some courses in high school and college that gave me the basic terminology and understanding.
0.755600	I can read and understand most of the information and questions, sometimes I have questions about what it says, and how to deal and live with it.
0.866700	I am someone who is comfortable overall in handling my own health decisions as I have been studying healthcare and lifestyle for a long time.  I may not be a professiol but I can definitely handle myself in a conversation with more experienced healthcare professiols as I have a well above average grasp on human health.
0.733300	There are plenty of ways thourgh the internet to get information or direct contact from the nurse or doctor while its asked. 
0.855600	I speak American English as a tive. I have a college degree. Thus I am able to understand fairly complex and technical material.
0.888900	I know exactly what a medical professiol is asking me. I'm fully capable of understanding the English language.
0.538900	i do not feel i have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision because it is impossible to see a doctor these days. Moreover, once you actually see a doctor, they charge you out the wazoo. So there's this incentive not to go see a doctor. If i can't see a doctor, because i can't afford it. Then it's impossible to obtain/process/understand basic health information. Health care in the US is so broken. And trump is making it worse.
0.538900	It all depends on the circumstances. Some things are just harder than others to understand. I don't like doctors to begin with, they seem to cause a denial for me if something is wrong.
0.900000	My health is important to me, so I always ask doctors and nurses to explain anything I don't understand and I know the importance of letting them know everything so they can diagnose me better.
0.800000	I feel I have the capacity to a decent degree. I was sheltered for most of my life, so I don't understand certain things, but if I need help, it's typically fairly easy for me to get it.

0.911100	I am fully capable of taking care of my health needs.  I only need assistance when I do not understand some of the medical terms or procedures we are discussing.   The only help I need then is for the doctor to explain in non-medical terms.

0.866700	Usually when I visit my primary care doctor, everything is pretty well laid out.  I generally can understand everything on the forms that they have, and they are good about explaining things to me.  I've had a bit of issues at emergency doctors, since they don't know me as well.  However, most of the time I'm good to go.
0.844400	I feel confident. I have an understanding of the condition and the medical staff is helpful.
0.794400	Pretty good. I have medical training, so I can understand a lot of terms and what diagnosises are in treatments, etc. It helps a lot when you know and understand what a doctor is talking about.
0.783300	I can easily see that I am able to obtain health information from my doctor. I would be able to process the information that I was given and if I'm not able to understand it all, then I can ask the doctor to explain it more simpler.
0.783300	I definitely think I have the ability to understand basic health information and services. I have pretty high comprehension levels so I find new information pretty easy to understand. I am also a good listener and absorb information well.

0.761100	I have the ability to obtain and process. The harder part is when doctor's explain things in technical terms. When my wife gave birth, we had a very hard time understanding our OBGYN bill because it was explained in very technical terms that almost seemed intentiolly confusing. Understanding a medical bill should be a basic decency in medicine.
0.844400	I feel quite confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information given to me by my care provider or found online or elsewhere.

0.744400	I feel like my level of health literacy is fairly high. I've spent little time in the hospital as a patient, and much more time in the hospital as a research assisant working in social medicine. UChicago is a great resource to have.
0.883300	I feel I have a great understanding of things when I read them or see the doctor.  I am not afraid to ask for further explation.  Sometimes I record what the doc says so my sister can hear it.  I look things up.  If I don't get it, I ask.
0.761100	For the most part I feel that I do have that capacity, but it honestly depends on the doctor or nurse that I am dealing with. I feel that many doctors and nurses are so strapped for time that they are not as willing to listen to whatever questions I have, and therefore many things end up getting lost through the cracks. 
0.538900	I feel that if needed I can do this. It would be no problem

0.872200	I think I'm perfectly capable of handling basic health information. I don't need any assistance dealing with it. I know how to get answers if I have any questions.
0.544400	I feel I do well to understand, but there's times where a doctor or nurse doesn't give me much information and then bolts off  to the next patient.  When this hapepns, I have to call friends who are nurses, or go online to get info.
0.900000	I feel that I have an above average understanding of basic health information and services.

0.611100	I have no issues comprehending my medical issues.  If a health care provider can't answer my question the internet usually can.
0.672200	I usually feel I have the capacity. As a woman I sometimes feel talked down to/not listened to by health professiols, which can frustrate me and make me less likely to be open to talking with doctors, because I feel like they aren't taking me seriously anyway.
0.916700	I understand it because I ask my doctor many questions. If I feel like I need more information than they said, I will Google it to see what's out there. Between those two, I am usually very sure of myself.
0.711100	I have taken several medical classes as well as have a degree in Psychology so I tend to understand what I'm being told pretty well. However, I am quite capable of asking questions if I don't understand to ensure I fully understand. I usually annoy doctors because I ask them more medical questions than they typically expect.

0.811100	I have strong capacity to understand what I'm being told, but I often lack the confidence to ask appropriate questions, thinking that they're either silly questions or that I already understand the information. More often than not, I'll think of a question as soon as I get in the car to get home. My mother worked in health care for a long time, so she is a valuable source of information for me if I need some help better understanding things. My wife is also there to answer questions and process information, though she is similar to me in that it takes some time to process questions.
0.527800	I think I am generally capable of making decisions on my basic health information because if there is something that I don't understand I ask my doctor and she will explain it to me.

0.900000	I fully have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I am educated, fully aware, and proactive in my health care.
0.616700	I think it is a low capacity- mainly because I am usually very intimidated and do not realize all the questions and confusion I have until after the doctor leaves. I don't feel confident enough to question them, or to disagree if I think they might be making incorrect assumptions. 
0.694400	I feel like sometimes I get a little overwhelmed and I either forget to ask pertinent questions or I don't quite understand what's happening, so I pick out the things I think are important and try to understand those. Sometimes this results in me missing important things.

0.588900	I am just as smart as others. I understand just fine.
0.600000	i feel like i'm able to ask questions but oftentimes i don't know what questions i need to be asking. it's hard to know where to start if you know nothing at all to begin with. sometimes doctors seem to assume you know more than you know.

0.861100	I feel based on my history and knowledge that I am very confident in my ability to process health information. I have a chronic disease so I have spent numerous hours in hospitals and doctor's offices. I have also spent a lot of my spare time researching medical information on my own. With that experience I am pretty knowledgeable about most medical information. 
0.872200	I am capable of looking up information that I do not understand and ask questions. I always tell my doctors to give it to me straight. I don't want to hear the doctor mumble I want to know the English version of my condition.

0.816700	I feel that I have good capacity to process basic health information.

I feel that doctors are sometimes not great in gauging how much understanding patients have, but that does not bother me.
0.855600	I feel comfortable understanding basic health information and services. Occasiolly I don't think to ask a follow-up question as it pertains to medications though.
0.883300	I usually understand things. I have a lot of experience with reading and understanding medical things.
0.777800	I feel I know just as much as the regular ordiry person does in regard to medical questions, and paperwork. I know sometimes questions aren't asked due to worrying about feeling dumb about something.

I usually carry a list with me of things I need to talk to my health care providers about, if there are several things I need to discuss. 
0.688900	It really depends on the situation, some information like insurance is hard for me to understand so I usually need help evaluating it. Medical information I can usually understand better than the information regarding insurance.
0.794400	I feel like I am maybe 75% capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services to make my own health decisions. I think the hardest thing is understanding complex medical terms used to describe conditions/mes. For the most part, I am comfortable with what I know already and am confident in my own skills to deduce the rest.
0.722200	If I can read information, I have a better time than when someone explains it. More than once, I've left a consultation, and in processing what I just heard I realize there's something that doesn't make sense or something I've simply forgotten because I'd just been given a lot of information to retain. I often don't the right questions to ask either, simply because I don't know what to ask.

I come prepared with specific questions and understand the responses. 
0.883300	I feel as if I do possess the capacity to obtain all the information that I need. Not only can I refer to the internet, but when I do make trips to the doctor, I have the ability to ask questions and I'm not shy about feeling potentially stupid. After all, this is my health we're talking about here! 
0.827800	I'm understand the terminology well enough, and I'm capable of using logic and reasoning under stress. It also helps look at it from the doctor's point of view as it helps me realize what exactly is going on.
0.883300	I feel like I can. And if I don't I ask my doctor or nurse and if I have anything else I search online.
0.861100	I feel that I am competent enough to understand information given to me by a doctor or nurse, and that I can further research topics if my doctor does not explain it to me fully.  I feel I can make my own medical decisions based on information given to me, and make appropriate followup decisions to handle these situations.
0.738900	In flu season, I will ask doctor if it is necessary to take the flu shot.  What happen if I don't take it and what is the side effect if I take it.
0.900000	To the full degree.  That is assuming the doctor is giving me all of the information.

0.800000	I think that I am smart enough to figure most things out but insurance and medical speak is not the easiest thing to understand.

0.883300	I feel that I'm pretty well equipped to understand and process information presented to me about my health. If I don't understand something, I'm comfortable asking for clarification until I feel that I do understand.

0.805600	I think I have a relatively high capacity to get the information I need.  Without the proper information, I can not proceed with my end of responsibility for my health, so it is best to get and clarify as much information as possible.

Even though I don't have access to healthcare services, I always felt like I had such an option when I did have access to enough information to make sound health-related decisions. I was able to ask questions about my health and get adequate answers.
0.527800	Sometimes its just hard to understand completely what they are trying to communicate and they make the forms so complicated to fill out it hinders my ability to express what is wrong or get the necessary information I'm going to need.
0.644400	I can certainly make important decisions if my doctor can give me details on it as I like to research about a medical condition myself also before I make a decision. Also I consult my family and friends.
0.888900	I have the capacity to understand and process everything because being healthy is part of my lifestyle so I like to know what's going on and what to do.
0.661100	I feel I have a average degree on my ability to understand, process, and obtain the medical help I need to make the best decisions. I ask questions when I do not understand something which is the biggest factor. Not knowing will only hurt someone when making decisions.
0.722200	I am not dumb. However, sometimes medical terms are used that are hard to understand. And I don't know how to apply them to what I or a family member has. So it's hard to translate those to a question I can make the doctor.
0.916700	I'm confident in my ability to both obtain and understand basic health information. With a simple call to my doctor I can gain solid answers and thanks to the internet I can also research specific things that I may be wary of or unsure of.
0.777800	I feel as if I am comprehending the medical terminology just fine to understand my own conditions, I find there is little to no ambiguity in the information given to me. 
0.688900	I think I can mostly get a grasp of it.  But sometimes I don't know the medical language so I have to have it clarified for me.  The doctors don't usually have a problem going over it with me.
0.744400	i can understand basic health pretty easily, once it gets into the more detailed stuff i might need a more basic way of understanding it.
0.688900	I think I have the ability to communicate with my doctor and explain to him the things that are going on. Whether it is headaches or some other problem, I can give him the symptoms and he takes it from there. I can then listen to what he says and ask follow up questions. 
0.888900	I feel like that I am competent enough in my abilities to understand medical information. If there is something that I do not understand I will ask for an explation. However I typically feel that I have enough knowledge to grasp medical jargon.

0.883300	Although I haven't been to the doctor in years, I'm fairly confident that I'll be able to understand and assess any information about my health that my doctor would provide me if I were to go see one right now. I have my smartphone that I can use to find any information that I don't have any knowledge of right there in the office. I can also take notes and listen to my doctor's advice. I'm a healthy individual and I'm certain that any issues that I might have are minor and easy to take care of.
0.722200	Well, I did major in neuroscience in college so I do have somewhat of a scientific background.  And health knowledge as I was a premedical student.  Still, there are many terms and things that I am not aware of today and can always use the help/guidance of professiols in explaining some of these current health issues today.  It never hurts to get more information I feel.
0.700000	I feel like I can understand some things. However, some basic things might not be basic to me and I may need assistance.
0.861100	I have full confidence in my capability to obtain, process and understand the basic health information and services I receive.

0.866700	I believe I can understand enough to make appropriate health decisions. If I do not understand something, I can use either person or electronic (internet) resources to research what I need to know. 
0.794400	"I am the type of person that likes to know all the details about any given situation.  So when I am told I ""have something""  always ask a lot of questions and can find answers when needed.  I run into issues when I am told I have the symptoms of something but may not have it.  I have trouble understanding some of this info and how it relates to me: re how can we make this a known situation vs. a maybe.  So I can make decisions quite well when the information I have is concrete but have more issue when doctors start trying to diagnose me using exclusion tactics."
0.816700	I have the ability to understand all the information given to me by doctors and nurses.  Sometimes doctors do move quickly and so obtaining all the information can be tricky, I sometimes have to keep a running list in my head of things to circle back to and sometimes I forget before I have time to circle back to them.
0.916700	I feel that I know everything that I need to know basically about any medical conditions that may arise. If there is something that I do not know then I can always go to Google and find out more about it.

0.883300	I haven't encountered many serious health related issues in my life but I had an appendectomy at the age of 23 and I have had three kids so I have had some experience with hospitals.  Also, I have had one of my children be briefly hospitalized.  I felt like a competent adult in these situations.  I am an educated person with a law degree so my reading comprehension is good.  
0.900000	I feel that I can adequately process and understand anything that has to do with with my health. If I need help my daughter is a registered nurse and available to answer my questions. I also have a regular physician who is very good at listening and explaining health related issues.
0.916700	I have total capacity and understanding of health related matters and services and need no one to help me with making decisions. I am a fully functioning and sane adult that can make decisions for myself. 
0.916700	I have family in the medical field, so I grew up with a bare if not necessarily educated understanding of the health sciences. So I've never really had any trouble comprehending physicians have told me.
0.822200	I can read all the information myself. Sometimes I need to ask the right professiol for help in understanding parts of it. I am capable of doing all of this for myself.

0.916700	I am very capable. I have worked in the medical field as an MRI technologist for the past 22 years. I am very knowledgeable about medical issues. 
0.916700	i am pretty confident I have complete capacity to understand all of the above.
0.783300	I FEEL THAT I HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICES.  I AM EDUCATED WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE IN SPORTS MAGEMENT.  I HAVE BEEN IN THE HEALTH/WELLNESS INDUSTRY FOR 20 YEARS
0.872200	I consider myself to be an intelligent individual and I haven't had any trouble understanding any medical information I've been given. Things have been explained well enough for me to understand.
0.916700	I feel I have a great ability to obtain, process, and understand these things. My mother was an RN (now head of a health department), my grandmother was a PA, and I've grown up around doctors all my life. That's probably a bit of a unique position. I would say that it's much more difficult for the average person. 
0.572200	I don't feel that I'm directly qualified. But I ask my doctor lots of questions and make sure that I understand correctly.
0.916700	I feel that it is very easy for me to get the information I need to understand the health services  and options I am being offered. I have never encountered difficulty understanding what my physician or nurse is saying to me. If I ever need questions answered or clarified I have always received satisfying answers that I can understand.
0.844400	I feel that I have the capacity to understand better than the average person, given my educatiol background. I have a masters degree in biochemistry and molecular biology so I think in a scientific way. I am also interested in the medical field and so I think that helps. 
0.916700	I feel I have full capacity to read basic health information because I am learned enough to understand it.
0.650000	I have had to seek out people to help me make informed medical decisions. A family friend who is a doctor as well as my brother in law who is a malpractice lawyer help me make these decisions. After consulting these people ad well as my assigned doctors and nurses make me feel confident in my decisions. 
0.866700	I have the assertiveness to make sure a doctor explains what I don't understand. I have the internet aptitude to research medical issues thoroughly. I have the humility to admit when I don't understand something.
0.850000	I feel like I have a great deal of capacity towards understanding, obtaining, and processing health info. I'm fairly well educated, well read, and I have a great doctor who takes the time to actually listen and explain. Additiolly, I can always look on the internet for information (from official sources, of course).
0.777800	I feel I can make basic decisions because I do not have a health background or a lot of medical problems.  A lot of confusion I have relates to the medical insurance and how and what to do to get coverage or obtain pre auth if needed.
0.805600	I feel that I am fully able to understand and process health information and services.  I make my own health decisions based on the information that I have obtained.  I use my doctor as a resource if I do not understand something.  I also ask for recommendations so that I am able to have a choice of what is going on with my health treatment.
0.550000	I think I have the capacity to understand medical information but much of it goes over my head and I would need to ask for help (after which I should retain that information)
0.888900	i feel my capacity for that is pretty good, because i went to college and i know how to understand concepts. also, i know how to google things i don't know.
0.844400	I think I have an above average ability to understand and process basic health information. This is due to my schooling in the biological sciences, in addition to my mother being a nurse with whom I may ask questions and have her explain the complex medical jargon that I may not understand. I also have the ability to google terms/conditions I do not know about and glean understanding about them from reputable sites.
0.600000	I feel that I have a good support network through my insurance and doctors. I have access to my medical information via my insurance website and I am able to contact my health professiols easily through message. I find that this is the easiest method. Writing often helps me clarify what it actually is that I am asking. 
0.900000	I think I am capable of making the decisions and asking the questions that I need to ask about medical subjects.
0.900000	I feel like I have the complete capacity to obtain any information I need. I feel this way because anytime I have had questions or issues I have always gotten an answer to my satifaction 
0.800000	I have a pretty good grasp of it.  If there's something I don't understand, I make sure to ask someone at the doctor's office before I leave, or I call later if I have a question.
0.916700	I have complete capacity to understand and process all the information that I need to make appropriate health decisions.  I am a fully competent individual.
0.672200	I feel like once I listen to what my doctor or nurse tells me, I need a few minutes to process it and by that point, they have left and I have been pushed out of the room and I now have a million questions I wanted to ask. On my last doctor's visit I left feeling confused and I realized in the parking lot I had no idea what I was supposed to do after my blood work results were going to be messaged to me. I then contacted my doctor, she was uble to respond to me, so I talked to a nurse who read the results and scared me to death thinking I had a disease and then hours later my doctor messaged me saying it's no big deal. 
0.838900	I think if the problems and information are simplified to a degree where it is easy enough to understand for someone who did not go to med school, I can understand pretty well all the information given to me. 
0.788900	I feel like I have a good capacity to do so. I fill out the doctor's forms when I go get a physical and I schedule a physical yearly. If anything came up on a physical I'm sure I'd be able to check it out.
0.800000	I feel I could obtain basic health info and services pretty well except for my social anxiety that gets in the way. I am often too shy to call to make an appointment, when I'm in an appointment I often just want it over as fast as possible so I might not bring up all my concerns.
0.916700	I am able to completely understand written and spoken information regarding my health. I am fully able to make health decisions on my own. 
0.883300	I feel like i always have all the information i need to understand my health situations and make good decisions regarding my health. 
0.694400	Because of my anxiety, sometimes its hard for me to further questions professiols to properly convey what's wrong or to get the full instructions that I need. Especially if they seem annoyed or like they're stuck up it increases this. 
0.516700	I feel that my Docotor just fills out a prescription form and doesn't really invegistgate if the problem I have still exsists or not. He doesn't ask me questions and makes me feel uncomfortable asking him anything. 
0.705600	I can understand most basic health information. The more complicated manners I sometimes need some assistance in explaining what the condition is, side effects, and possible treatments.
0.800000	I feel I can handle most things. If I don't understand something, I will ask the doctor or nurse until I figure out what is necessary.
0.738900	I feel alone what confident in knowing medical conditions but sometimes what is explained still doesn't make sense. Also I think of questions to ask after the appointment is already over. Sometimes I feel like doctors make up explations and doing really look into what is going on.
0.883300	Fot the most part. I try to ask the right questions in the room but sometimes find myself having to do my own research online when I get home
0.616700	For the most part, however, sometimes I am not really sure of what they are trying to convey. I usually have my daughter with me so she can ask questions I am not thinking of.
0.711100	I know that I have the capacity to understand basic health information. Sometimes I just need a little bit of help to understand medical terminology.
0.866700	I think I mostly understand what I read and am told but there is not always an effort to make things easily understandable. If there are a lot of technical terms I may have questions or need things explained to me. I want to make sure I'm understanding completely when it comes to my health.
0.916700	I am reasobly informed about health issues I encounter from time to time. It makes easy for me to act on medical advice I get from my doctors. 
0.833300	I feel I have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.861100	Full capacity to understand most anything presented to me. 
0.816700	I feel like I have most of the information I need. I can usually find more specific information, or explations in layman's terms, regarding my health information online.

0.916700	I do feel that I can fill out any forms regarding health and ask doctors/nurses to explain health information so that I completely understand and am able to make decisions.
0.572200	I am somewhat in the middle. I think my problem is I don't know how to ask the right question and don't know how to process the information correctly. I think I should be more active in asking questions. Usually the visits are less than 10-20 minutes and I forget to ask every important question.
0.772200	I usually am able to follow what I am being told in regards to the medical information given to me, however, there have been times when I needed more information and did not ask for it. I would get flustered by them trying to hurry me up or hurry me out of the office that I forget what I wanted or needed to ask. 
0.600000	I feel that I have a basic ability to obtain and process basic health information. At times I need help reading about conditions or help explaining what medications that I am on. But when I have a question or need assistance I always find the help that I need from my family.
0.816700	I feel like I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. Unless, the doctor or nurse is rushing to get me out of the office, I usually ask questions whenever I don't know something. This way, I can always be sure that I can make the best decision for my health.
0.811100	I think I've very capable of understanding basic health information. I can read just fine, and have a good understanding of most medical terms, unless it's something very abstract and rare. I ask questions when I think it's needed, and understand the answers given just fine. Between my understanding of things and other explations given (if needed), I feel I make good health decisions for myself.
0.733300	The Internet is full of useful information. There are plenty of official medical sites to read through if I don't get all the information I need from a medical professiol. But, honestly, I haven't even had a cold or flu in the 14 years I've been a vegan, so I don't go to the doctor. I'm a very healthy person.
0.772200	While I do believe I can read all the information given to me by medical professiols, It is sometimes difficult to understand exactly what they mean. I also don't know if I'm asking the right questions or what to even ask when I am given new information. 
0.688900	Once I receive all of the information, I am usually able to understand it. Most of my problems come from understanding the fincial parts of my condition. Also my condition affects everyone differently, so that always causes distress.
0.750000	I have a good capacity to do all that because I have done it in the past and plan on in the future.
0.916700	I am entirely capable of understanding basic health information and am confident in my abilities to make health decisions for myself. I am a mentally and emotiolly stable woman in her early 30s. 
0.805600	I understand basic heath information as I have had issues before and make sure I know and understand what I need to know.
0.616700	I have few knowledge about the medical and health.  And I also use the help of internet to get the information about the health decision also.
0.916700	Its very easy. All you have to do is ask and they will answer. You can also go online and find anything that you need to know. Getting information is very easy.
0.688900	I feel I am pretty competent in obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services. I feel that if there is something I don't understand I make sure to ask for clarification from either my health professiol or family member.
0.916700	Fortutely, I have a good understanding of medical terms and I'm not afraid to ask questions.  Many people are reluctant to question doctors but I'm not one of them. I feel that the patient has to be proactive and take responsibility for getting good medical care.  Doctors aren't mind readers and cannot help a patient if they don't provide all the necessary information.
0.844400	I feel that I have a moderate capacity to obtain, process and understand this information. It's easy to understand information about simple concerns -- like if I go to the doctor with an infection, and she diagnoses it and sends me home with a prescription for antibiotics, that's easy. No problem. But when I get into harder-to-diagnose issues (like the vertigo I've had for more than a decade), doctors tend to under-explain things and make a lot of assumptions that can make it hard to get useful information from them. My vertigo was never diagnosed by my then-doctor despite him running a bunch of tests I couldn't afford that all came back fine; I filly figured out the issue for myself (badly-adjusted new glasses that caused chronic eyestrain I still struggle with). Doctors also tend to brush off my concerns because I'm overweight, even when my concerns have nothing to do with my weight. Behavior like that from professiols can make it difficult and intimidating to make the right decisions for myself.
0.838900	I feel like I am very capable of understanding basic health information. I am a smart person so I am able to understand things that doctors tell me as long as they keep it relatively simple. I am also able to do some research on issues if I need more information to make a fil decision. 
0.727800	I feel that I can obtain and process all the basic health information that I need. I have a very general understanding of what most medical and health information means. As long as it isn't something too complicated, I can understand it very well.
0.900000	I think I have the ability to understand basic health information. My degree in college required a lot of biology and medical related courses so I feel that I have more than a very basic understanding of medical conditions, and so I would be able to understand what was going on and what the treatments would do to me. 
0.888900	I feel that I have the capacity to understand obtain, process, and understand basic health information relatively fully. I have no issues understanding written or spoken word regarding my health decisions.
0.900000	Having congestive heart failure has given me much knowledge on this disease. I have been in the hospital multiple times and see doctors quite frequently that I know understand this condition. I have a full understanding of what the disease is, does and what treatment options there are. of the treatment options I understand the ones my doctors use, why they use them.
0.861100	I can read, think, write, and otherwise communicate clearly.  Any issues I have are pretty straightforward, though I imagine an elderly person would face greater challenges.
0.722200	For the most part I think I'm pretty capable. If I don't understand something, I'm not afraid to ask. Also, I tend to search for help online quite a bit and often find my answers there. I have enough experience with doctors' appointments such that I think I am comfortable getting and processing information and figuring out how to get help if I need it.
0.866700	I have no problem asking questions, and I have asked doctors to explain in layman's terms.  I also go online a lot to look up information.  I prefer it coming from the doctor though.  I also have a brother who is a doctor and a sister in law who is a nurse.  I have asked them questions before.
0.900000	I can understand the medical forms and processes quite well. I can also process the information given to me by my physician. 
0.572200	It depends on the health condition I may have if I can fully understand it. Things like having a cold or a sprained ankle are somewhat simple to understand as oppose to a stomach condition like an ulcer. I would research online and ask for advice from family if I don't fully understand.
0.872200	"I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I usually feel comfortable asking questions when I am unsure of the answer, and whenever a doctor is explaining an issue, I am always thinking ""what's our next step,"" and will not leave until I get an answer to that question."
0.855600	Although I am not a tive english speaker, I've been here since I was 5, so my English is pretty good. I watch a lot of medical documentaries and I am familiar with a lot of the equipment and procedures that some doctors go through, so I am very confident making medical decisions for the most part. If not, I can always go online and Google things. I am pretty tech savvy and know where to get my information from.
0.900000	I have a high capacity. I choose my providers, to the extent possible, with communicativity as one of the criteria. I am highly intelligent and possess good alytical and communication skills, and am not afraid to research on my own and/or ask questions.
0.916700	I feel that to a great extent I can mage everything in order to understand health info. I ask necessary questions, and pay close attention to any information either written or stated. I have no issues at all.
0.850000	I have pretty good health insurance through my company so I have access to any kind of doctor I need to see. I try to read as much as possible so I know what questions to ask. If I have questions, I also go to my mother. She used to work in the medical field, and she also has the same thyroid condition that I have. She has had it way longer then me, so she points me on the right direction.
0.850000	With medical conditions pertaining to myself or the ones I care for I make sure to answer any questions I may have about anything that may confuse me. Since it is my body I want to know exactly what is or will be done to it.
0.900000	none
0.633300	I am pretty confident in my ability to comprehend medical information when it comes to conditions and medications and things like that. However, if it involves hospital procedures or insurance or technical information like that, I need either assistance or to read up information from several sources in order to make sure I actually understand what I'm reading.
0.883300	I feel I have the ability and comprehension skill to understand medical terminology due to my education as a scientist and my tive comprehension of english. As such, I can comprehend the information well, and subsequently synthesize data from it and fill in the blanks with questions that are necessary to ask. Its a process in medical terms, but I feel I have the tive skill set to be very good at understanding information provided to me. 
0.916700	I feel that I have no issues understanding health information and services. If I feel that the doctor is rushed or otherwise not totally available, I feel comfortable researching online to resolve any questions.
0.794400	I can understand most basic health information, I might have an issue once in a while not understanding some concept. I try to ask questions to doctors and nurses but most of the time I think of additiol questions when it is too late because I already left the doctor's office. 
0.605600	At the present time, when people need medical health they don't worry about understanding the information that is provided to them.

0.794400	I feel that I am very able to obtain, process, and understand health information. If I do not have pamphlets or instruction papers that come with the service or product I am receiving, I will generally easily call my doctor or perform a web search about whatever it is that I need to know. I feel that I am fairly competent and literate in the medical literature and am able to understand what I read and what I am told. 
0.844400	i feel like i have the tools to process basic medical knowledge without any real help. Unless the medical problem is super specific to things i know nothing about.
0.666700	i always ask questions and i am very vocal and proactive about my healthcare. i want to know every option i have and a full diagnosis and outcome .i watch and observe everything that goes on during my treatment.
0.655600	well i think i understand most of what the doctor says.Sometimes i have to ask in more detail like break it down a bit.
0.605600	I've had some major, very rare medical problems in the very recent past that I had trouble with. Their rarity of the conditions hindered me, I think I can do the basic things health wise pretty easily though.

0.816700	I feel like I have the ability to ask questions and get clarifications, but I always feel like they want me out of there as quickly as possible and as if they don't really care about me. I feel like I'm being patronized and as if they think I'm stupid for not understanding the first time. I also kinda feel like I'm whining when I say something hurts, because it seems like there are other people that hurt way worse and so I'm just being too sensitive.
0.883300	i have full capacity to do this. i'm not afraid to ask questions and am proactive.

0.872200	I will always be slightly unsure, and will always go talk to a friend for their opinion, but I feel like I can get the general gist of it. I am very confident that I would understand 90% of it and make decisions based off that. My biggest issue is I don't like making decisions in general.

0.694400	I think I can understand mostly everything. However sometimes medicine information can come off as hard to understand in which case I will ask a doctor or nurse for more information on it. Sometimes doctors and nurses seem annoyed by questions. However I think they should never be annoyed because it's their job to inform us on this kind of information. Overall, I understand most of it but I wish when I didn't nurses and doctors wouldn't act so annoyed like I'm wasting their time with questions.

0.883300	I feel I understand the information properly most of the time. I can use the information to make a decision.
0.677800	I have a high capacity to read, understand, and comprehend health info and services, but sometimes I just don't take the time or put in the effort to do so.

The only time I don't understand health care information is when I am reading something that is overly technical.
0.916700	I believe I have a high capacity to understand all basic medical information that's necessary. As long as I ask a lot of questions and make certain that the professiols explain things to me in simple words, I don't have any problems at all.

0.883300	Being a laymen, but having alot of information at hand, i would put myself at about 80 percent.
0.900000	I feel like most of the resources i need are readily available.  I usually will look up info on the internet and if i sems serious, I will go to the doctor.  Once At the doctor, i'm usually informed of what i need and if i don't understand the information I'll ask for clarification.  After I get diagnosed, I might look up more information online, to further my knowledge.
0.916700	I pick up on new material easily.  I am also good at retaining information.  I have epilepsy and I feel like I have researched the topic a great deal.  I am confident that I am prepared to ask any questions that people may have about it.
0.544400	I feel like I can only understand the most basic results that my doctors can give me. Once they get into how much medication I need to take, what effects it will have in the long term the information just phases out of my head. I really don't know much about my health, so I usually have a parent help me fill it out. I also ask a lot of questions after the doctor is done seeing me, which doesn't help the situation.
0.772200	I believe I can alyze and weigh decisions about my health information.  I have the basic understanding of things related to it.
0.811100	I feel that I have more than enough capacity in regards to make health decisions. Where I don't understand, I can usually come up with questions to ask the health professiols. I have no problem when it comes to anything else. 
0.722200	I think I am mostly fine to understand and obtain the materials from my doctor office, anyway sometimes I am not sure some process like the billing system
0.738900	I do not often have to read, fill out or ask about medical conditions. However, in the limited experience I have, my physicians, doctors, and nurses have been very informative and helpful, and  I am usually able to fill out any forms I need to with no problems.
0.916700	I was in the health care field for about 7 years. I understand the need for transparency with the doctors. Also, I am sickly, so I fill out paperwork regularly. i see no point in making the medical staff work harder, so I am very forthcoming, and ask lots of questions if something kind of confuses me.
0.811100	I feel very qualified to do this as I was the caregiver for two termil parents and, due to the urgency and obvious passiote interest in their welfare, made a concerted effort to become highly involved in their medical care and procedures. Taking care of someone you love who is ill is like taking a crash course in medicine. And out of necessity, I developed the necessary courage and stami to talk to health care professiols irregardless of their taciturn or uncooperative tures.
0.872200	I am an educated person that reads and has a high comprehension level.I do not believe that I have begun to experience Alzheimer's, yet.  When I do not understand a topic by my PCP and Cardiologist, I ask them to explain their thought processes to me, and they are always glad to share their knowledge with me.  
0.711100	I feel that I have the capacity almost entirely. Everythime I have gone to the Doctor I have left feeling confident that I understood what was going on.
0.872200	I feel like I have the means necessary to understand basic health info. I have a background in health services so I feel I am slightly above the curve. I also have a group of friends who are involved in the medical community that I can ask questions if I need to.
0.694400	I feel that it is very important to provide the dr with as much information as possible so the can effectively diagnos you issue correctlyrics.  I also think it is important to ask questions so I can understand what my issue may be
0.866700	I am able to do all that stuff sufficiently.  I do have tremors in my right hand so at times I do ask for help writing stuff.  But all in all I have sufficient amount of help and understanding.
0.827800	I do not think that I have any issues obtaining, processing or understanding basic health information and services.
0.850000	Yes, I believe I can understand basic health information and make good decisions about them. I search google for information on things I don't understand. It's pretty easy to clarify things through asking dr./nurse questions and the use of google.
0.833300	i have a great capacity for asking and understanding questions and answers i might have for medical information from a dr. i usually google everything first. so i basically know what i have, i tell him. he checks says yup your right. i always carry a list of notes if i need to, like for more complicated situations  
0.850000	I feel like my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information is above average. I say that with full confidence because I have a B.S degree in Health Sciences. This degree covered a broad range of medical terminology, medicil therapies, and chemistry and biological sciences. 
0.811100	I feel like I have an average layman's understanding of health information. I don't think I have more knowledge or anything, but I do think that I can process and understand the information I am given, or information I am searching for sufficiently. Sometimes, though, things are out of my ability to understand, and I will either ask someone who I think is knowledgeable or just look it up myself.
0.888900	I am able to read and understand my medical information.  I can listen to the Doctors and comprehend and set up follow up care. I someitmes forget to mention everything that I am supposed to about my condition to them 
0.811100	I think that I have a decent understanding.  If I don't completely understand it I won't ask a ton of questions because I can turn to Google to look up the information.  Most of the time I do this when they step out of the room.  If looking it up leads me to be confused I will then ask questions when they step back into the room.
0.872200	I have a large capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information when making health-related decisions. I am highly educated. I do find it more difficult to understand more advanced information such as articles from medical jourls (occasiolly provided by my doctor) mostly due to the industry specific language that I am unfamiliar with. 
0.800000	I regularly research online about health problems and conditions so I am fairly knowledgeable on these matters and feel confident in my ability and capacity to obtain, process, and understand this info.
0.916700	I guess I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision. First, I had MA, so I guess I'm well educated. Second, I have some experience to read and understand such materials. Third, I can fin any information I need in Internet.
0.855600	I have plenty of access to medical professiols and trusted advisors to obtain, process and understand basic health information as needed. 
0.511100	my mom is a nurse and i grew up with her talking about medical stuff and I was never able to have it all click in my mind.  I don't have the capacity to obtain, process and understand it.  Its like when people talk medical my brain shuts down.  I let my husband explain it to me...or my mom or my niece who is also a nurse
0.866700	I think most of the time, I can handle the information. If I am very ill, or uncomfortable, that affects how much attention I can pay to new medical information.I have, in the past, had doctors repeat things as many times as I needed fr me to understand.
0.788900	I feel as though I have the capacity to obtain information, but the part where I may need help most is interpreting the information in a way that I understand it. A medical diagnosis is great, but unless my doctor can explain it to me in a way that I can understand, and also understand everything that accompanies it, then the diagnosis itself is useless to me. In my current health care system, if you speak to enough people, eventually you will be directed to the person who can help answer your question. 
0.777800	I feel I have a good capacity to understand basic health information.  I have had a preexisting condition my entire life and need to be able to understand this type of information.
0.883300	I feel that I have a very high capacity at obtaining these things. My doctors and nurses are very helpful and informative, especially if I don't understand something.
0.883300	In the past I have always been able to understand the information that I have been given relating to my medical concerns. I have made good enough decisions and have not had any problems due to my reading comprehension.
0.838900	I have a lifetime experience of dealing with a variety of medical problems. I feel confident in my general knowledge. I come across things I do not understand sometimes. I am not a medical professiol so I expect to be confused sometimes.
0.711100	I think I have an adequate understanding of basic medical terminology to understand 90% of all trips to clinics or the hospital. However, if the terminology gets too technical, I need to get help either from a doctor or a friend help me explain what is going on. Overall, I think I have good capacity to make educated health decisions regarding my health. 
0.916700	"Most of the health information I have had to deal with has been very well explained to me, and I don't mind asking followup questions.  The doctor's are the experts after all.  One of my favorite quotes/phrases to use is ""Help me understand.""  When I am truly confused or stuck with something, that is what I go to, and I let the doctor know that they can break it down and treat it as if they are telling a five year old.  Most of it I understand, but don't mind letting them know I may have follow up questions."
0.638900	It depends on the condition. For instance when I have a cold, medical care is easier to understand than when I am being seen for my thyroid.
0.900000	I believe I can make appropriate health choices. I have worked in healthcare for the last four years, and I actually do administrative work where I review health information forms. I am confident that I understand what I am filling out on my persol health forms.
0.888900	I have good health insurance and therefore have access to the professiol opinions I need to make a decision about my health. I am a young, intelligent professiol and I am able to take the information provided by health care professiols and make the best decision. 
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and understand the basic health information that I need.  I can easily understand the decisions I need to make.  I have infrequently gone online to get extra clarity when needed.
0.883300	I try to get a firm understanding of what's going on. I tell the doctor or nurse everything because I feel it's the one profession you should never lie to. I then listen to what they say and if I have a question I ask it. If I don't understand, I will try to have them explain it further or better. I then get other information on my condition and then I feel I am comfortable making a decision with the information I have received.
0.866700	I feel confident when reading health information and making proper decisions. I am aware of changing medical field and i try to keep myself updated. when ever i need help i am not afraid to ask.
0.916700	I feel that I am knowledgeable enough to about my health and have the ability to effectively relay my health information to health care providers. Also, if  I did need help I know where to get it.
0.816700	I think that with technology now a days its easier to obtain and understand the information provided. 
0.705600	Medical information can be overwhelming, especially when you receive less than positive news. I have a hard time digesting all the information given by doctors and medical professiols and wish there was a better way to capture this info so I could better research at home.
0.677800	I think i do ok with everything . But there are times i need help 
0.733300	I think I am very capable in understanding health information.
0.722200	Im open minded, and feel the need to question things, so I think I can usually dig as deep as i need to
0.794400	I feel confident that I am able to comprehend health information provided by my doctors. If there is anything I don't understand, I feel comfortable asking my healthcare providers for an explation. Availability and ease of communication is one of the things I look for when choosing a doctor. 
0.761100	I feel like I have a good knowledge base to work from.  It is sometimes complex when working with this kind of information, but there are plenty of outlets to help.
0.705600	I can understand basic health information if I have the time to research it, but I often feel that they're rushed and would rather not go into it so I don't ask them. Only in rare cases where it's very important do I ask for clarification then and there.
0.672200	I believe I have the full capacity, I know how to use the internet very well and I have a big hospital 5min away from where I currently live where I can obtain information
0.622200	I work at a hospital so I feel like I kind of get it, but when it comes to major issues I still feel confused when getting the information told to me. I don't think that it is due to stupidity as much as it is due to being confused on what to do. You feel trapped with one real choice and in many cases you want more options to choose from. 
0.850000	I feel that my primary care physician goes above and beyond when it comes to me understanding what is going on, if I do have any questions. They take the time at the end of the visit just to address any questions or concerns I may have.
0.666700	I think I may not understand everything on forms or what a doctor says, but I try to ask questions if I don't understand. I don't mind asking questions to understand better. I want to understand and will ask. 
0.883300	I have no trouble obtaining and understanding health information, generally. The exception to that is if a doctor starts rattling off scientific medical terminology that I'm not familiar with, or if they reference drug mes I don't know. Reading material isn't an issue because I can always look something up if I don't understand it.
0.733300	I understand written and spoken English very well, but when I encounter a field-specific jargon I am not familiar with it can become difficult. I don't feel like being that tedious patient who wants every word defined like a verbal test from their college days. I do, however, ask for more information when I feel their explation is based on the assumption that I already know something. 
0.916700	I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information about myself and what services I would need to make well thought out, appropriate health decisions for the better of myself. 
0.916700	I am confident in my capacity to effectively obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  
0.672200	i think i am okay at it, but i do not always understand some of the big words.
0.883300	I feel that the doctors who I go to are very informative and have provided me with both the pros and cons of the treatments they recommend. They usually also provide me with an adequate understanding of consequences that come with the treatment.
0.794400	I usually try to understand most of the basic things about my condition or diagnosis. I will ask some questions occasiolly. But sometimes if the doctor or nurse seems to be in a hurry, I won't ask everything that I really want to know and end up looking things up on the internet.
0.833300	When given when told about a condition or issue the doctors and nurses give me all the needed information and if I need more I will ask for it in writing or do further research on my own.
0.866700	I have the ability to fill out, read ask questions and anything else I need to do by myself or with minimal help. I can usually understand what a dr is explaining to me and if I don't I ask more questions until I understand it.
0.872200	Due to my employment in health care, I feel that I have a decent grasp of medical terminology and pathology. I usually understand what a doctor or nurse is explaining, and if I don't I feel very comfortable asking questions. However, I do also feel somewhat complacent when being treated and tend to trust what they are doing and not question their decisions.
0.827800	I am able to understand written and spoken health information and make decisions based on this information. There has been a time or two when I received lab work that I asked for more information on to better understand it.
0.688900	I feel like that I have the general capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. If I don't understand, I will ask the doctor or nurse until I do, unless they seemed rushed. If they seemed rushed and unhelpful, I will not ask too many questions. If there is any more help I need, I usually turn to my friend who is a nurse or my sister, who is a doctor. I also turn to Google to find out more information if they are not available right away. 
0.916700	I have no problem understanding written information or directions. I have never had a doctor (or nurse) use terminology I didn't explain--at least not without explaining what it means.  I am capable of calling my medical provider to ask follow up questions if I need to, and have done so.
0.688900	I believe that although the system can be complicated, I am capable of making appropriate health decisions. I can ask for clarification and help with forms and acquire more information about topics and conditions being discussed.
0.850000	Somewhat a little from a doctor. I recently went to see a doctor and their diagnosed wasn't very helpful. They spent less than 5 minutes for a $100 charge. 
0.655600	I think I understand written information much better than what a practitioner says to me. I miss SO much when I'm at a doctor's appointment - I forget what I'm told and forget what questions I wanted to ask, even when they're written down.
0.916700	I am very health conscious, and I am very pro-active about health-related topics. I know a lot of terminology, and I usually have a higher understanding of the information on the forms and on health topics than the nurses. I often have a higher understanding than the doctors on the topics as they relate to lifestyle choices (i.e., food), and have a reasoble level of knowledge about how the various systems in the body work. I am able to understand what the doctor tells me, and I know what I don't know, so I can ask questions on the fly and often come prepared with questions. I usually know enough to begin with to understand the answers, but I certainly don't mind clarifying questions. 
0.855600	If I do have any questions about the information I make sure to ask until I do understand the material.  Otherwise I read over the material and look at it closely until I understand what it says if I did not the first time I read it over.
0.716700	I am fairly intelligent about certain things, but i could use more help understanding medical info.  I am not comfortable filling out forms for medical purposes.
0.833300	I think I am easily able to understand information given to me by health practitioners. I am rather reserved, though, and do sometimes have trouble asking extra questions while at an appointment. 
0.872200	I feel like I am as capable as the average person of understanding what a medical professiol tells me. I'm not a doctor, so of course there are some things that require further explation, but I can usually quickly grasp the gist of the situation if the doctor uses layman's terms. I usually ask all the questions I can think of at the time when I'm in the appointment, but every once in a while I'll be too embarrassed to bring myself to ask about something.
0.900000	I am fully capable of making informed medical decisions.  I have the knowledge and experience to understand what I'm being told and to do research on my own.  I am also capable of finding resources and/or people to ask when I need help.
0.672200	I feel I have a pretty good degree of understanding and capability of getting help in understanding health information. These days, I can just go online and find information pretty quickly, if someone I know isn't available to help.
0.711100	I feel that when I have the opportunity, I am able to ask relevant medical questions and to assert myself if I feel that there is a mistaken diagnosis or if I am not well understood by my physician.
0.872200	I have a high level of reading comprehension so I am very confident that I can understand any information that is given to me.
0.694400	I have a good ability to understand basic health information. But there are times that I do have a little trouble that is when I will ask the doctor to explain and help me. They usually do as long as they are a good doctors tho I've had a bad one or 2 and if that happens I find a new one.
0.777800	I feel I have the adequate resources to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am knowledgeable and am concerned about my health to make sure I get the correct information and pass on information to my care givers.
0.605600	I can find a good amount of the information I need regarding basic health information and services, though there are times when I am not able to find it. There was once a time when I needed information on why I was bleeding in between periods and to an extent it was helpful but then there was contradictory information and some information was unclear. I ended up asking my doctor directly and he explained it just fine. There was another time I needed to find out if my insurance covers a test I needed and no one could tell me. I called the health insurance company, I am not kidding, they did not know the answer. But for the most part, it's easy to obtain most answers to my health questions and to understand what I am being told.
0.916700	I have high capacity to understand basic health information.  I am well read and know a lot of medical terms and how related things work.
0.827800	I do have some background (college, scribe/EMT experience) in medical language and knowledge that helps me understand at least the basics of conditions that may affect me. Likewise, I feel like I am able to critically read relevant informatiol materials and interact with health professiols to address unswered questions.
0.888900	I feel my ability to read and process issues concerning my health are better than average as I once started school to become a nurse. 
0.811100	I believe I am capable of understanding basic medical concepts.  I do get confused when medical professiols use jargon that I am not familiar with.  I do have a little more experience than some because my daughter had a major illness that required extensive medical attention for almost 3 years.  I do admit that when I am confused, I am sometime too embarrassed to ask for clarification.  
0.816700	I feel I have the ability to understand all information given to me. I do feel there is a small barrier between me and direct information from the doctor, because they can be tricky to get ahold of sometimes.
0.855600	I'm told I ask many questions.  I research the internet and I always ask questions.  
0.883300	i can read, if i dont understand i always ask for more information
0.783300	I feel even though my mom never took me to doctors, unless the schools made her, that I have a fair understanding of medical information. This is partially because health classes in school and getting pregnt as a teeger. When I was pregnt I did all the doctor stuff alone. Plus in my crappy college I took atomy and microbiology. 
0.866700	I fell I have a high capacity to obtain and understand health information and services. If there is something I do not understand , I have no problem speaking up and asking for an explation . I feel that most people do not understand everything they are told when seeking medical advice and that medical professiols are happy to explain it when asked. 
0.694400	I feel that I am capable fo understanding most of what medical professiols tell me. Sometimes, though I feel they do not speak in layman's terms. If they did, it would make me feel better.
0.761100	The internet has made it easier to look up information about many minor health conditions.  It is the life threatening ones as well as the proper procedure to recuperate from treatment for these diseases and conditions (ie avoid infections) that I would need to ask questions to the professiols.  
0.883300	I feel that I am quite able to handle the processing of the information given to me. That makes me feel good about the choices that I have to make with my health and needed treatments. 
0.883300	I feel my capacity is fine - I'm fortute enough to have a lot of formal education including a background in biological science, so it's not a problem for me generally. Also, my father has had serious health problems most of my life, and I've spent a lot of time in hospitals and dealing with cardiology/diabetic/etc terms - I'm more familiar with them than I would like. 
0.833300	I am able to understand most documentation I am given, and I have the knowledge and experience to find any information or get any questions I have answered.
0.855600	I feel like I am capable of taking control of my health decisions given the right explation of questions I might have. Without any further council from my doctor or nurses, I would feel comfortable making health decisions. I need to know all the information, and have things explained to me in detail. 
0.761100	I'm pretty good in everything mentioned before because I had quite a few relatives and friends whom I have helped in the past with medical issues.
0.866700	Some complex medical jargon can be difficult to interpret for someone outside the business, but overall I'm very confident I can understand what's relayed to me, especially if I'm able to ask for clarification in layman's terms. 
0.838900	I took atomy and physiology and a handful of healthcare related science classes as an undergraduate as they tied into my mathematics modeling work. So I feel reasobly well educated about my body and the diseases that impact it. Enough that I can understand the basics and then go research any gaps in knowledge myself or ask the right questions to have a professiol explain it to me.
0.661100	At times I feel that the abbreviations on medical forms are what really mess me up.  Sometimes it takes time to really evaluate what the abbreviations mean, but I usually have the ability to figure it out, if not as my mother who works in the medical field.
0.822200	I think I have basic understanding of these topics. Anything I do not understand I will try to learn. 
0.766700	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain and understand health information. I am very shy and sometimes do not ask questions of health personnel that I sometimes should, but if it were absolutely a necessity I would be more than willing to ask these important questions. I usually take what is given me and process it and do extra research myself if necessary.
0.833300	I am perfectly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding health information. My only issue is that I may not ask appropriate questions at times or withhold information that I don't think is relevant. 
0.688900	I could process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions quite easily.Sometimes I asked for help. But not always.
0.655600	I feel that I have an average capacity. My dad was a pharmacist so growing up I could easily go to him with any health issues or questions and he always had an answer or directed me where I needed to go for the answer. Because of that I feel I have a strong knowledge of how to understand basic health information. I struggle a but with services needed to make appropriate health decisions because I hate going to the doctor. I avoid it at all costs so in that area I have little capacity for obtaining services and health information.
0.861100	I am confident that I can understand a condition and instructions given to me by a doctor. I will then do a lot of research on my own to further understand something. There is a lot of people that you can find on the internet through forums that may be going through something similar and they can have more information and tips about making certain decisions.
0.794400	I usually think I can understand. However, sometimes it's overwhelming to get unexpected medical information. At those times I never ask the right questions and always leave without pressing the issue.
0.683300	I think I have a decent understanding. I think it's hard for a lot of people. 
0.916700	I have a very good capacity to do all of this. I am a smart adult and in college I majored in biology so it is easy for me to figure out and understand most things.
0.822200	I feel like I have the basic understanding that is needed when seeking health attention or to make health decisions. I make sure I ask all the appropriate questions and if there is something I am not sure about I will see out additiol information from health care providers to make sure that I understand it.
0.844400	I am knowledgeable in the terms and words used so I can answer and understand what they ask or am able to comprehend the material. The doctors and nurses usually let me know of the situation in an easy to understand fashion so I am not confused. 
0.572200	I feel like I have a really hard understand a lot of the health information and services. They use a lot of medical terms that I'm just not familiar with at all, and I  have a pretty difficult time compregending them.I also have a hard time finding out where to get this information, or who to talk to, or how to get something specific done. A lot of the time I just don't know where to look.
0.816700	I feel very comfortable with the skills above. Also I am experienced in researching diverse topics on the internet for a better background knowledge.
0.811100	I feel hat I have adequate capacity because I ask enough questions.  I feel that I am able to get the information I need because I do not let the practitioner be in charge.
0.850000	I listen to whatever my doctor recommends. I feel like I understand everything most of the time, but if i need help they always explain it so I understand.
0.688900	I think I am competent enough. Some things can be confusing but I get clarification on the confusing stuff either from the doctor or someone I know that works in the medical field.
0.872200	I feel I have a high degree to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. If I don't understand something, I can ask the doctor or nurse. I could also look for information online for the basic information.
0.661100	I can usually get most of the information that I need. whether or not I fully understand is another matter. but I would say that on average I can get enough information to base a good opinion to make a decision. 
0.866700	I am fully capable of understanding and obtaining my basic health information. I can do so in person and also online with my healthcare account. It shows my lab results and general health information.
0.777800	I feel like I have the tools available to understand what I need to know, however those tools are not always connected. For instance, when I am with the dr. I do not always think of the question I need to ask. When the dr gives me information to read at home, the questions prompted would be better asked in the office. When I look up information on-line, I rarely print the information to take in and discuss. 
0.811100	I have a relatively high level of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. When I don't understand something it's usually because I didn't ask my health care provider. I can always ask a family member in the health care industry when I don't understand something or do research on my own to better understand.

0.777800	As someone with an interest in health, I can understand and process basic information. However, health is rarely basic. Therefore, I sometimes need help from professiols to understand. With a basic understanding of the more easily understandable concepts, I am more prepared to tackle the difficult scerios. 
0.872200	I feel I am capable due to life experience as well as a background in medical processes through the military, family experience and my significant other is a RN at a major hospital in a major city so though these experiences, i believe I am quite capable of understanding basic medical terminology and processes that go with them.

0.883300	Yes, I believe I can. I am able to process almost all of the information I am given in health situations, and I have people I can ask if there is something I don't understand. I regularly call my insurance company with questions about coverage, and I am comfortable speaking to my doctor about more persol issues. When I have general medical questions, I also sometimes call my brother, who is an internist.
0.655600	I always question everything, i do this so that i can learn. Whether it is about a recipe or a law or my own health care. I get the information from the doctor and than will do my own research. I research every pill that is given me because i want to know exactly what i'm taking and the effects from it.
0.916700	I have a pretty good understanding of the human atomy and have quite a few health complications that have required emergency medical services. Over time I've just read up about more and more just so I didn't feel stupid at the hospital or doctors. 
0.827800	I think that I am able to understand my medical issues more because I have studied biological sciences in college.

0.883300	I am cogent enough and doctor savvy enough to get the information I need and ask the questions I need to ask so that I have a full understanding of any procedure and process 
0.811100	For many reasons, I believe I am considerably qualified to understand even the most complex of medical issues.  For over 30 years, I served as a volunteer Paramedic and took advantage of every learning situation possible.  Also, due to significant health issues, (Lyme Disease and Cancer), I was further compelled to be more edified in the entire healthcare process.  And, in my current profession with a dental office, the didactic issues have become paramount when dealing with our patients.
0.916700	I think I am quite good at deciphering medical information and understanding medical terminologies. I have a few medical professiols in my family, so I've been hearing about insurance, procedures, and diagnoses since I was a child. Though I find medicine fasciting, I never went into the field myself. 
0.616700	I think I have enough capacity to process most of what I need to know, but on occasion, I can get a little confused. I don't ask questions sometimes, even when I need to know more to fully understand necessary health information. Some of the information seems pretty daunting to me.
0.916700	i am a retired paramedic so health information is not a problem nor is asking questions and understanding answers
0.900000	I am very confident in my ability to successfully vigate all steps involved in being treated medically. However, as I do not have any medical conditions and have only dealt with health care via a check up every few years, I would say that if I did have a health issue I could imagine not being as confident in dealing with the process.
0.672200	I feel I can get most of the information I need if they're brought up. I worry that I may, or the staff may forget to check or mention something that will help my health. I also worry that some of the information is too complicated to understand and the meds prescribed have side effects that are glossed over.
0.805600	At this point in my life. I am in control of my own health. And I hope I will NEVER have to depend on medical officials ever again.
0.811100	I think I definitely have the ability to understand and process basic health information. I grew up in a family of nurses, so I am pretty comfortable with medical stuff.
0.727800	I think I have decent knowledge. I would like to have an extra opinion though just to make sure I'm making the right decision. 
0.766700	For the most part I feel I can make the appropriate decisions.  I would ask questions on things that I needed clarified.  I would also use the internet to search for answers that I still was unsure of.
0.827800	I think I have a good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I can ask questions to the doctor or nurse if there is something that I need clarified.
0.916700	I feel that I am fully capable of understanding the directives given by my doctor, along with all paperwork given to me. I am capable of understanding almost all information in written form. On the rare occasion I will ask a nurse in the office for some assistance in understanding information or obtaining advice on taking steps to move forward.
0.916700	I feel like I can do all of these things.  I don't have a hard time understanding things that are explained to me, especially if they involve my health.
0.866700	I am ale to understand most information provided by providers. I am a professiol health care provider.
0.883300	I always try to find doctors, PAs, and nurses who are willing to explain things using non-medical terminology when necessary.  I have switched doctors, as well as asked for different nursing staff, when I felt them to be too condescending, or unwilling to take additiol time to explain things to me.
0.916700	I understand everything. I could be a damn doctor if I wanted to go to medical school. I understand it all. 
0.827800	I'm pretty confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand information. My largest issues would be that I am generally reluctant to go to the doctor unless I absolutely need to, and that I often don't ask too many questions especially when I'm afraid of the answer. I will generally accept instructions from doctor without asking for explations, which probably also limits my ability to make decisions well. To this point, none of this has ever had a negative effect on me.
0.655600	if i dont understand things i always ask many quistions until i do understand
0.833300	I have a working knowledge of several general medical practices and back office procedures in the field. I know what rights I have as a patient and obligations of doctors and nurses.
0.855600	I believe I have the full capacity. I've never had problems before.
0.844400	I believe the hospitals and doctor's offices try to make things as easy as possible. I'm able to understand what they feel is important for me to know about a medical condition, which is usually more than I know. They treat everyone the same though, and I wish more time and attention would be given to taking my particular circumstances into consideration. My particular questions could help them treat others like me more specifically, but they don't seem to see it that way. 
0.855600	I feel fairly confident that I have the skills to understand what is needed to make health decisions. To do this I use the help of my doctor and the help of the internet to research information.
0.805600	I think I'm capable to process and obtain basic health information. I do have problems when I am not definitively diagnosed with an ailment, but rather given a group of things that it could be. 
0.605600	I am good at reading and comprehension. This means I am good at being able read these types of materials to make decisions.
0.811100	I believe I am extremely capable of obtaining the information needed, and I am more than capable of understanding the information. Those concepts aren't beyond my reach, because I've always had an affinity for scientific studies, and that includes medical related fields. Making those decisions, however, is difficult for me, because decisions in general are difficult for me to make and motivation is even harder to come by.
0.872200	I feel pretty confident, but mostly because I have done my own research. Honestly doctors seem to fly through visits any more. Over scheduled and over worked. I don't blame them, I know it is but a clog in the system. 
0.827800	I feel that I am able to get adequate health information from doctors, nurses as well as through other resources.
0.505600	I usually feel nervous at the doctors. I dont like not knowing information and i hate sounding dumb so I am nervous about asking further questions in an effort to avoid sounding dumb.
0.816700	I am literate and intelligent. I keep myself informed about health issues in general and specific to me. I therefore feel I have the capacity to process and understand health information.
0.811100	For the most part, I can understand information given to me by medical professiols. There may be more specific terms that I don't follow, but doctors and nurses are pretty good about explaining those things.
0.850000	I think that I possess the intellect to understand most basic information when it comes to medical information. Of course their are occasions when I am completing a form and I may have a question or not understand exactly what is being asked. Likewise the same may occur when speaking with a health professing, but I am fine with asking them for clarification. 
0.838900	I feel like i am intelligent enough to either understand and ask questions or go and do research on my own to educate myself on things i don't understand. i have been on my own since i was 16 and have had to do these things alone. when you don't have someone to turn to while you are young you learn quick to utilize resources available to you.
0.916700	I have full capacity and competency to obtain, process and comprehend health information. I ask doctors and nurses all the questions I can think of relating to my health issues. I feel I need to be proactive.
0.855600	I have great capacity to obtain process and understand basic health info to make appropriate decisions. I ask a lot of questions and make sure the Dr. understands what issues I am having so that I get the best care. I also follow up with the Dr. if I forget to say something about my issues etc. It gets a little murky when the Dr. decides to go down one path and I am not totally clear why, or if I received different info from the same Dr.
0.555600	If I know I am going to the doctor for a specific reason, I will make sure to create a written list of the information I need to relay, as well as the information I need to acquire in order to best b informed.
0.783300	I feel like I am able to make good health decisions however I rarely feel like I have all the information. It feels like there is information my doctor isn't telling me. I would rather they gave it to me straight with all the information so I could really make an informed decision.
0.916700	I have full confidence in my ability to read and comprehend medical information because English is my tive language. Aside from my fluency in English, I have been unfortute to spend a significant amount of time around doctors and hospitals because of the health of my immediate family. Therefore, I am competent when speaking with doctors and reviewing medical information.
0.866700	I make sure to ask questins of anything that is not clear, and I don't stop until I am satisfied with the clarification.  I also will obtain more information on my own to confirm that what I've been told is true.  If there is any discrepancy, and if it is important enough to me, I have not reservations about seeking second opinion.
0.861100	I currently work for a regiol medical center in the IT department so I am not unfamiliar with terminology used in paper work or diagnosis.  Before this I had a huge interest in the medical field to begin with, just not enough to be a doctor. 
0.700000	I'm pretty confident that I can understand, as long as I have someone available if I have questions about the details.
0.916700	I grew up with both of my parents working in a hospital and was often surrounded by doctors. I am very familiar with medical terminology and human atomy.

0.788900	I feel like I have a good handle on it as long as I have very good explations from my doctor. I won't just let the doctor tell me what to do, I read up on options and come prepared. I have some knowledge of biological process, so I'm good in that way. The only thing that gets me is medical language--it's sometimes hard to understand. 
0.688900	I feel I am capable in making decisions regarding my health, and often fully understand what my doctors tell me. The only times when I am in need of assistance, like from my parents, is with matters related to insurance plans and making appointments. 
0.855600	I am very clear when describing any symptoms. I am also very clear in my understanding of what the doctor tells me. i am also very clear in my understanding of what to ask the doctor. I am also very clear in my understanding that the doctors may also be incompetent.
0.411100	I can defiantly understand the concept of hospital services and health decisions.But,somebody has to help me out a little bit. 
0.744400	Sometimes they don't speak clearly enough to me where I can understand. They will tell me a lot of things I need to do, and most the time I forget. And it's hard to read their hand writing.
0.672200	I BELIEVE I GET ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED WHEN I AM AT THE DOCTOR OR AT THE PHARMACY.  I CAN ALWAYS LOOK UP MORE INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET.  SOMETIMES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND MY DOCTOR WHETHER IT IS HER ENGLISH OR HER BIG WORDS THAT I DO NOT HAVE A DEGREE TO COMPREHEND.

0.916700	I am capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.
0.633300	I think it's difficult to gauge. I mean they have things written out with complicated language that only doctors understand I mean there's a reason they have to go to college for like 8 years. Then when you have a doctor in front of you, you don't know exactly what to ask whether it's relevant or just a stupid question. 
0.855600	I feel I know a lot about finding information to make health decisions.  If I don't understand something, I can ask my doctor.  If I think of a question later, I can normally find my answer online or call.

0.716700	I sometimes have difficulty trying to explain where pain is to doctors, and have had a condition that no one seems to know what it is after a few tests. I still don't know. I am always perplexed by some of the explaitions that I am given and often times go away from an appointment more confused that I was when I went in. I never feel like I have had enough time with the health care providor.

0.916700	I have a high degree of understanding as both my father and sister are doctors.  I worked many years in their office while in school.
0.872200	I have been dealing withe the same health problems for a very long time, so I have looked into the conditions to keep myself informed.
0.483300	I feel there are a lot of different options and they are overwhelming. I have trouble deciding how I should go about my healthcare options. The forms I have to fill out are often very long and tedious.
0.816700	I have a medical background so, I am usually able to understand the information given either in writing or verbally. I also will look for information on the internet especially to see what other patients have experienced. 
0.833300	I feel I am knowledgeable enough to understand what the doctors are telling me about my health. I also do research on various medical issues to learn more about them.
0.833300	I think that I do pretty good. There is always webmd and the mayo clinic websites.
0.794400	i think i have about the same level of medical understanding as the average person. i don't think that i have all the answers so i like to ask medical professiols the questions that i have. when it comes to filling out forms, sometimes i get bored and skip parts that i should have paid more attention to.
0.833300	I think I know a lot because I've been helping out others for years and I feel comfortable with what I do. Also when I fill out mine and if I need help to make sure it's right, it normally is and I'm just making sure its right.
0.538900	Persolly I feel that I usually have to head online and check a few medical websites or forums for answered questions for a better explation that i can understand. 
0.900000	I feel as though I am educated enough to understand medical information given to me. I also ask questions to make sure I completely understand what is being told to me. I am fully capable of making appropriate health decisions for myself.
0.861100	This is all just basic common sense and intelligence which most people have the capacity to perform, unless mentally challenged due to age or a mental defect, or if a small child.
0.883300	My doctors are really informative.  They explain everything to me really well.  When I have questions, they always take the time to answer them and them never seem like they are in a hurry with me.
0.838900	I have a science background so I am able to understand the terminology.  I ask questions to verify what I have been told.  However, I feel doctors don't always tell a patient everything that would help in the treatment of certain conditions.
0.811100	I think I generally have the capacity I need. I had a traumatic experience last year that required profession mental health care, though, and at that time I was struggling to obtain the government assistance I was eligible for. It was too difficult at that time for me to keep on top of all the forms they kept sending me - I became overwhelmed and gave up even though I was eligible and really needed help.
0.733300	I feel that I have a tendency to take longer to process such matters.  This is not surprising as I am autistic.  I mage to make appropriate health decisions out of sheer persistence more than immediate aptitude.  If I have forgotten a question at an appointment I contact the doctor later, all over again, etc.
0.827800	I feel like I can obtain the info I need. Sometimes I feel rushed at the doctor's office, like they don't have the time to answer everything. But if I can get most of the info, I can usually find the rest online. 
0.916700	My mother was diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic colon cancer in November of 2015. At this point, I spend three days a week in some kind of hospital setting. I run a blog for OTHER people who have difficulties with the same kind of situations you mentioned. I have learned to advocate for my mother and myself within the medical community. I've found that if you don't, you basically get brushed aside.
0.900000	I believe I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health and services needed to make appropriate health decisions due to the fact that I have had health problems since birth and those have continued into early childhood and adulthood along with other conditions so it has always been imperative that I be aware of my health, related terminology and altertive methods of treatment in order to maintain the best quality of life. 
0.827800	I feel that overwhelmingly in such situations that I'm able to take in and understand what I need to know to make decisions about my health. On the very rare occasion I'll ask for help from family and friends, but I can mage on my own.
0.850000	I am an educated consumer of health services. 
0.883300	I feel confident that I make the correct decisions for my health because I typically understand what the doctor is telling me. I know what questions to ask if I don't understand them. I typically understand the brochures and my doctor is really helpful explaining things in lay men terms.
0.738900	I can pretty much communicate in medical terms with healthcare professiols because I am a medical interpreter. Yet, I would not say that I understand everything about different health conditions and tests. There is a lot to learn even for the doctors and nurses. 
0.800000	I feel like I am able to understand what doctors and nurses tell me, especially my normal doctor. The only time I have had difficulty is when English is not the doctors first language.
0.883300	I definitely have the ability to obtain those things with ease. I am great at asking what I need to ask of anyone whop is helping me in any way. I can also do research on my own on the web and call who I need to if needed. 
0.783300	"I feel comfortable in my ability. I don't believe in a lot of the western concept idea of ""diseases"" and have been focusing more on getting my health back without pharmaceuticals by eating clean, vegan whole foods diet. And it's working. I don't need doctors to tell me about shill information or services that we'll find out 50 years later was all wrong, like how doctors recommended cigarettes. Only time I'd need a doctor is in an emergency."
0.827800	I can understand basic health information and how to obtain it and rarely need someone else to explain it to me.

0.538900	After reading all the material and information, I do believe that I could understand all the basic health information needed to make appropriate health decisions.  If not, I would ask my son to help me out.
0.900000	I feel like I have a fairly good basis of medical knowledge.  I am in school to be a PTA at the moment.  I have at least a semblance of knowledge in regards to the human body and how it functions. As far as forms and things. They can be a bit tricky once in a great while.  Otherwise I find them fairly straightforward. 
0.833300	Yes. Everything is usually pretty straightforward whenever you go to get health care. My only issue is health insurance not being as transparent as it needs to be.
0.672200	I feel I pretty good understanding when I talk to a doctor about 90% of the time.
0.761100	I generally feel like I understand, but sometimes the medical terminology is difficult to understand. Sometimes the doctor assumes I understand, and sometimes it's hard to know exactly what to ask. Some doctors are better than others.
0.705600	Forms I can do. That's the type of work I do for a living. But when I get with the doctor, first I become very nervous, so I may not always be forthcoming with information. Then the medical talk becomes a blur. I usually nod my head yes yes yes, thinking I can process it all later. 
0.588900	I think i have the capacity, if i dont fully understand i can lern.
0.811100	For the most part I can understand what information I am given and can make my own decisions.  Occasiolly there are things I don't understand and will have to ask for them to explain.  If there is anything I don't understand, I usually try to look it up so I have an idea of what its about so I can ask better questions.
0.833300	Yes I understand the basic information needed to make appropriate health decisions, If I have questions doctors usually explain things in a way I can understand even though I am not in the medical field. 
0.866700	I can understand what they tell me most of the time. When I'm in doubt, I ask till they give me an answer I can use. The medical\dental profession have a bad habit of obfuscation...they call it 'not scaring their patients(a direct quote). When did informing people at a level they can use become scarey???
0.900000	I believe I have a high capacity to understand everything being told to me. Not only was I a science major in my undergraduate studies. But I am currently in a doctoral of physical therapy program and therefore have a high level of knowledge in the functioning of the human body.
0.883300	I can usually understand all of the information that is given to me. If there is something that I don't understand, I have a family member who used to work as a nurse that can help me. I can also research information if I need to.
0.916700	 believe I have an above average capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions in comparison to the average individual. I say this because I have a academic background in social and health sciences, and I have acquired a great deal of knowledge about health, and medical issues.
0.861100	I feel I have enough capacity to understand all but the most complicated of medical information. I'm talking stuff that wouldnt be understandable unless read by a medical student or doctor though. I have  a good enough understanding of many medical things to understand them. 
0.900000	As long as they keep information simple to understand, I am fine.  I have a basic understanding of medical terminology and certainly have access to the internet to supplement the information they give me.  
0.866700	I feel competent to research any medical issue and find results. If the results are confussing I can find explation and gain understanding.

0.722200	I feel with today's technology and access to excellent doctors in my area, I can always access the important information I need from diagnoses to treatment plans. Sometimes I may have to look a little harder for information if I don't understand how to deal with a given problem, but I don't hesitate to ask questions since such information is readily available. 
0.794400	I think I understand most forms and information pretty well, though some is written in such a medical-professiol way I'm not sure 100% what to do or what it means. Doctors aren't always helpful either. 
0.833300	I feel I am competent in regards to basic health information and services. If I ever have any questions, I would go out of my way to ask them until I fully understand my questions and their answers.
0.916700	When I am at the doctor I ask any questions regarding what I'm going through.  If theirs anything I don't understand I ask the nurse and/or doctor to explain it in further detail.  I make sure they have all the pertinent information so they can make a proper diagnosis.  I always make sure that I have or can obtain all the information I need in order to take care of myself.
0.650000	I am usually very capable of understanding basic health information by myself. If I have any lingering doubts or questions I might keep them to myself and find answers on my own later. 
0.500000	I feel like I don't have the capacity to process basic health information because it was never explained to me in detail about the meaning of each medical word.If I was explained some medical terms I would better understand them
0.572200	"I have the capacity to process the information but many health providers do not provide much information regarding health issues and seem ""bothered"" by questions. Most of the time I have to request a print off of the info and just use google to answer my questions."
0.900000	I feel I have the needed information. If not, I ask.  I don't mind asking doctors and/or nurses or anyone else on staff questions regarding my health, paperwork or procedures.
0.727800	Because of the doctor I have found most recently, I feel pretty good about it.  He is very nice and explains things very well.  I do not hesitate to ask him questions and I feel like he answers to the very best of his ability.  I also feel pretty good about getting relevant information online, I think I am o.k. at deciding what is good information and what isn't.  Of course there are probably exceptions.
0.916700	I feel that I have the ability, through my doctor, physician's assistant and the internet, to ask any questions I may have about basic health information. If I need services I can ask my doctor or research them online to see if they are available to me. As pertains to making healthy decisions I have online resources, my doctor and my family to discuss these things with.
0.883300	I am good at understanding most things. I can normally read health forms and answer questions on my  own. I can usually understand what my doctor tells me.
0.794400	I am extremely confident in my capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information, however there are times when I may not ask questions right away as  I may not think of them right way.  I often need time to process information.
0.833300	I have a very good capacity in regards to both basic health information and services for my own health and other people I help.  I do my best to use resources to have gotten to this level as I know a doctor and a nurse persolly who are good friends of mine and I am also good at doing my own research online and in textbooks if need be.
0.811100	I often feel uncomfortable asking or talking about some problems I'm having because I'm afraid I will ask in a way that will have them not take me seriously. Sometimes I don't have all the questions I want to ask right then,  they come later as I mull things over. 
0.916700	I feel I am very capable to fill out forms, understand my doctors information and I feel very comfortable asking when I don't understand something.
0.777800	I think that I am pretty confident with asking for clarifications or at the very least in writing key words down so I can research them and understand them better 
0.883300	I feel that I can adequately make appropriate health decisions because I don't always take what the doctor says as word. I look into it deeper, myself. I look things up that they say and ask around to see other people's experiences for the same or a similar situation to cross-examine things.  If something sounds too far-fetched to me, I get a second opinion.
0.855600	I feel fairly confident about my ability to obtain and understand basic health information. The medical provider with which I have insurance offers a lot of information on their web sites.

If I don't understand something, she is good about providing more information and making sure I understand it before I leave.
0.722200	I like to think that I have basic medical knowledge to understand simple medical diagnosis. I can understand simple medical terms and when explained to me I usually capture the first concept of what s being told to me. The times I've been to the doctor, I am able to understand what I'm being told and I am a fast learner to understand what I don't know.
0.783300	I am good at researching on my own, but I don't always speak up to doctors and nurses when I don't understand something.  I'd rather do my own private research to figure it out myself.  I think I fill out forms pretty well, but I'm always afraid I'm messing something up.
0.705600	I sometimes having trouble with reading medication. When I receive any medication, I always make sure they are right for me. I often ask my physician about my health condition and why I have to use this or that medication. I think I am overthinking people but I want to know some basic about health information

0.916700	I am fully capable of understanding basic health information to make appropriate health decisions. I don't go to doctors unless there is an emergency, but I have never had any trouble understanding information regarding health that I received from a doctor or nurse. 
0.900000	I believe that I understand most of what my health providers tell me. When I'm uncertain, I search for more information. I have sought out a second medical opinion in the past.

0.888900	I feel like I can stay calm and ratiol and make these sorts of decisions. I have no trouble reading written material or understanding instructions. I feel confident that I can be reasoble and communicate with health professiols with ease and accuracy.
0.822200	I'm confident that I can understand how my health is going and what do I have to do to improve when I'm sick or I have some kind of problem. If there are terms I don't understand I google for them, but I understood that's better to not replace a doctor or a nurse with google and that it's better to ask all the questions and explations right away to them.
0.916700	I am fully capable of making appropriate health decisions for myself. I understand basic health information and feel confident that I would understand anything a doctor was explaining regarding my health.
0.900000	I feel that I am in tune with myself, I can absorb information and have the capability to understand difficult concepts and processes. I can also describe what is going on with myself very well.
0.883300	I have complete confidence in my own understanding of healthcare.  I have the highest degree of capacity, in my opinion, to understand and make my own healthcare decisions.  My understanding goes beyond basic health information and services.  I have cared for sick family members.  I have worked in the healthcare field.  I ask questions and look up information as necessary.
0.900000	I feel have the ability to understand most basic health information. If I have an issue understanding or I need to know more, I will ask a health professiol or perform additiol research by myself. I like to make an informed decision with my Doctor from all the treatment options that are available to me.
0.916700	I think I understand the basic things. I can fill out forms. I can understand if they explain to me what is wrong.
0.944400	To the upmost degree. I have no issues. Whatever isn't explained I can research for myself.
0.544400	I have a basic understanding but many medical documents are confusing. This especially applies to insurance documents and co-pay amounts, deductibles etc. Many times I have been left with large Medical bills because I did not understand paperwork so it has lowered my confidence in my ability to fill out correctly on my own.
0.772200	Having worked in the medical field for many years I am comfortable with it.  It can always be looked up on the Internet if I need questions answered.
0.777800	I feel that I'm capable of generally understanding the information that is given to me, and also to do some extra research on it later on. If I have questions, I'll ask them there, but probably not if questions pop up in my head later on when I'm no longer meeting with the medical professiol. At that point I'll do my own research or ask a family member for help. I am capable of filling out my own forms and doing my own paperwork, but I don't like asking for help when there's something I'm not sure about.
0.883300	I consider myself to be a highly competent individual. When conversing with anyone regarding an important matter (I.E. health), I am always sure to listen and ask questions to make sure that I understand what is being discussed. It is very rare for me to leave a conversation without knowing all of the implications.
0.755600	my ability to understand the language is moderate.  However such medical encounters are rare, because I am in excellent health.
0.916700	I used to work in the healthcare field, so I feel I am pretty well informed about a variety of medical conditions.  If I don't understand something I feel comfortable asking my doctor questions.
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information to the highest extent possible. I can make health decisions for myself better than anyone else can. I can do these things to the highest degree.
0.600000	I feel like I'm generally good at processing the health information I need, but only if somebody explains it clearly enough to me. I do often need somebody to explain even the most slightly complicated terminology that may or may not pop up, but once I get something, I really feel like I GET it! I'm not stupid by any stretch of the imagition, and while I can be kinda dense at first, I'll almost always get everything down by the end.
0.883300	I feel that I am very capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have a science background and work experience in the pharmaceutical industry and my father is a pharmacist so I have always been around healthcare people and industry. I like reading about anything that is pertinent to me or my family and learn everything I can to make me more intelligent and able to handle our needs.
0.750000	I feel I have the capacity to understand written and oral information from hospitals/nurses/doctors, but when they start using big word medical conditions I do ask for an explation.  I feel comfortable asking questions and I will even write down what they say so I can look it up later or make sure I have it right.
0.838900	I feel like I fully understand basic health information. Sometime I do have questions, but I make sure to address them. I also use online resources as needed.
0.811100	I feel relatively able to a certain extent.  However, it's hard to say, because I don't know what I don't know.  But basic information, I should be able to understand it very well, I think. 
0.833300	I feel information is very available with the internet but not all information is correct. I always check with my doctor if I have questions. I have called the pharmacist a few times to ask questions.
0.705600	I definitely feel I have the capacity.  I might not know basic health information right off the bat,  but if it's explained to me in a nice, easy way i'll catch on fairly quickly and grasp what is being told to me.
0.866700	I believe I have full capacity to fully obtain and understand health information. I am confident I could make the appropriate decisions about my healthcare based on the information that is readily available online or through the doctor.

0.816700	I've never felt that I lacked the information I needed to a great extent. I feel like whatever I learn from a doctor is a jumping off point. I trust doctors fully, but I also like to do my own research.
0.777800	I think I'm capable of understanding most of the information but if I don't understand something I can always look up online.
0.616700	I feel as if I could use more help understanding basic health information and services. I don't know how to fill out certain health documents and having someone to help me id easier. There for I feel like I don't have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services so I'm not able to make an appropriate health decision for my self unless I have some help.
0.900000	I feel confident in my ability to request and understand information about my health.  It is very important, so I would make sure I understand this information if I had questions.

0.916700	I feel that I understand basic health information and services well enough to make informed and appropriate health decisions for myself. I don't have any trouble asking questions or standing up for myself and I can generally grasp abstract and complicated concepts.
0.811100	I am 49 years old. I have filled out forms for everything from health care to fincial. Legal issues make the wording on most 'serious' documents more difficult then they need to be but over time you do develop a sense of understanding. I do my best and when I get confused I will typically go  online and look for my answer which is almost always available. Just like fince, medical industry is powered by legal staff and they go out of the way to make a simple form complicated for various reasons. 
0.844400	Regardless of my tendency to try to not make any waves I am an intelligent person and am able to grasp and understand things quickly.  Sometimes I do not think to ask questions while at the Doctors or I can not think of any questions to ask. But overall I feel that I am capable of getting and understanding any information I need to make informed health decisions.
0.855600	I think that to a high degree I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia when I was 16, so I am very familiar with doctors.
0.805600	I believe that I am capable of doing so to a relatively high degree.   I have never had any complex medical problems, and have been lucky to have medical professiols that are great at explaining issues in an understandable and simplified way.  I sometimes worry that I am not being told enough about a condition, but then I reach out to resources on the internet to supplement my knowledge. 
0.833300	I am a turally inquisitive person, so I often ask every question I can think of at the time. I usually ask for best/ worst case scerios so that I feel I have a good grasp on the entire situation.
0.916700	I feel that I'm fully capable of doing that.  I understand the information health professiols give me and can do whatever research I feel necessary to make good heath care decisions.  I'm scientifically literate to a reasoble degree and have no reading or comprehension problems that would be a obstacle to that goal.
0.833300	I feel that I am very capable of processing the information needed to make the right health decisions. I am someone who is attentive to instructions and I do not shy away from asking questions when there is something that I don't understand. I also have a mother who has worked in the medical field who is able to provide me with assistance. I feel that I have all the tools at my disposal to make informed decisions when it comes to matters of health.
0.883300	I think I have a pretty good grasp on medical jargon since my old brother is a doctor. If I ever need to ask any questions I can just reach out to him and he usually has an answer.
0.572200	I think I have a better than average capability, because of my education and demographic and being a tive English speaker, but the information is still extremely confusing. It's hard to know if I'm asking the right questions or answering them in the best way possible to allow the doctors to help me.
0.700000	I do a lot of research, so I am pretty confident in knowing and understanding what a doctor or nurse has to tell me. If I do not understand, I will ask them  to clarify. If I still do not understand or have any additiol questions, I will go home and research the issue myself. 
0.900000	I feel I am educated enough to either know what the doctor is saying to me upfront or I could research the topic on my own. I feel confident in the health staff to properly explain things to me.
0.883300	I am pretty good at understanding basic health information. If I don't think of a question while I'm at a doctor's appointment, I usually either email or call the doctor, or look up the information online. 
0.883300	I feel that I am capable of doing so. I have trust in the skill and discretion of medical professiols that I'm not worried about interacting with them. If I need help I am sure I can get it, but I am generally comfortable with forms.
0.833300	I feel like I have a pretty good understanding and capability.  First and foremost, I am going to listen to what my doctor says.  I am also the type of person that has no trouble asking for help when I don't understand something.
0.888900	I'm a 48 year old high school educated male, tive speaker and reader of the English language.  I have the internet at my fingertips.  Anything I do not understand, I have the ability to research on my own.  I am very comfortable doing this.
0.883300	Based on the questions I just answered I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and to make the appropriate health decisions. The fact that I can understand spoken and written language along with an interest in making health decisions gives me confidence.
0.855600	I think I'm decently capable of learning more about health information to make informed decisions concerning my own health. I think I have a bit of an advantage as I'm currently enrolled in a pre-pharmacy track at my university, but I've always been able to understand my health information without much confusion. That said, when I do feel the need to ask for clarification, I've always been able to get a more thorough explation.
0.588900	I'm usually not shy when it comes to talking to doctors so I typically question them pretty thoroughly. The problem is that I have bad anxiety and so I'll rehearse the questions I want to ask at home beforehand and then freeze up and forget to ask them when I'm there (due to my anxiety and nervousness). But I haven't had to make any life-changing decisions to a doctor's visit (thankfully) so typically I just do what they tell me to do and not question it much further.
0.855600	At age 67, my experience comes in handy.  I feel fully capable to make health decisions.
0.866700	I am currently uninsured. I have Graves Disease so, have seen many doctors in the past. The disease itself is a little hard to understand but I ask all of the questions I have and usually get fairly clear answers.
0.866700	I feel I have basic knowledge of these things so I have a basic capacity to process these things. There is so much information available online sometimes I feel I can never learn enough. 
0.900000	I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services neded to make all appropriate health decisions. I always do this.
0.916700	I feel I have this ability to a great extent. I find that most documents are understandable and I have no problem speaking up and asking questions if something is unclear. I also feel confident about doing further research on any topic and finding sources to add to the basic information from doctors.
0.872200	Since I have not had experiences with uncommon disease or sickness, except from regular health check and common cold, I do not really have much more experience with health information and services.  In fact, aside from some emergencies in my teege and younger years visit to hospital due to injury, accident, the past 8 years, the only time I have to stop by the doctor was to drive someone else close to me for health check up.  Because of this, as far as health information and services needed for me, I am up to date on most of them, plus I am rather good at internet when I need to do research on something peculiar related to health
0.650000	Sometimes i have a hard time understanding certain medical procedures or whenever a doctor is explaining things to me. I do ask questions but i do not always understand the answers and sometimes i need help filling out forms because i don't know what to put.
0.861100	I feel confident that I can understand the information given to me by the doctor and pharamcy. I am confident when I read over the instructions on how to take medications and the possible side effects. I have no problem with asking my doctor questions if I don't understand what they are telling me. I may not ask all the questions that I need to at the time of the appointment. The questions might not come to me until later. I feel confident filling out medical forms. 
0.916700	I am quite capable of reading and understanding health information and services.  I used to work in the insurance industry for 15 years in a variety of positions and I had the opportunity to learn many things about health, medical, insurance, etc. and have no trouble with forms. 
0.850000	I feel fairly confident. I have access to the internet which helps quite a bit, and I'm not shy about asking questions or asking for clarifications if there's something I don't understand.
0.800000	I feel like I have the language skills to obtain information relevant to my health.  The barrier (if any) seems to be my discomfort with asking certain questions, or not knowing the right questions to ask.
0.650000	I mostly have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I feel like sometimes the information is written in a way that it is difficult to understand if you don't have experience or training in the medical field.  I usually ask questions or Google information if I am not sure or don't understand.  I do feel I am able to make appropriate health decisions for the most part.
0.916700	I feel I have the necessary capacity to make appropriate health decisions. Is this survey intended for disabled persons, hillbillies, the elderly or just incredibly patronizing?
0.800000	Filling out basic health information is not a problem for me. My weakest area is asking questions so that I understand exactly what the doctor/nurse is saying. Sometimes I just don't know the right questions to ask.
0.738900	I think I ask all the question I want answers to. But I don't asks questions I don't want to know the answers to. Such as smoking.
0.844400	I don't feel like I have any trouble understanding and processing the information I receive.  Even if I don't understand something right away, I know where to go to get help figuring it all out.
0.744400	I think that on average I am moderately knowledgeable when it comes to health issues, however I comfortable and feel it is within my rights to ask the healthcare professiols any questions that helps me clarify any information, procedures or recommendations they may have.
0.722200	I feel like I definitely have the capacity to process and understand health information. Sometimes if there are too many technical terms being used I might have to ask either my doctor or someone else (my sister is an RN so I can call her and ask for her help) to explain in more plain language. But most of the time I don't have a problem. As far as obtaining services and information, that's a little bit trickier. There's the issue of services being available or not available in my area, long waits to see a doctor, and the massive cost of seeing a doctor. And I've had a few issues where I've gone to the ER or the walk-in clinic in my town and ended up seeing a doctor who doesn't seem to care about explaining what's going on to me. But overall I feel like I can probably make appropriate health decisions. Not 100% confident, but at least 70-80%.
0.916700	I've had a few operations and have taken care of a parent with Alzheimer's. While I have a pretty severe phobia of all things medical, I've had enough urgent care to know the ropes and even a lot about interl organs/functions as well as pharma and tural medicine. 
0.900000	I am pretty familiar with medical terminology and how things work.  I am able to successfully google any information I don't know.  I never just take a doctor on their word and do ask questions and do my own research.  Doctors are not always right, whether they are new, stuck in a prescribing rut or have chosen not to be reeducated on current practices for a particular symptom/illness.
0.900000	I know how to fill out forms and ask and answer questions when dealing with doctors and nurses. I don't think it takes multiple sentences to impart that information.
0.850000	I feel like I am have general understanding of most of the important health decisions I make based some of my previous professions. 
0.811100	I feel like i have a great ability to obtain and understand basic health information because i am confident with my research and communication abilities. For something i do not understand or need clarification i usually try to research it before hand , get an idea of what it is before consulting a health professiol. By the time i consult a health professiol, i usually have a general understanding of whatever it is i need clarification on.
0.727800	I think for the most part I have the ability to make appropriate decisions.  Sometimes I wish I had more information about how to do some things that I'm not used to doing.
0.883300	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I feel this way because I do not hesitate to request more information and clarification.  I also feel comfortable seeking out information on my own.
0.855600	My mother was a nurse and my father was an EMT so I grew up around medical terminology. I am used to hearing medical words and I feel like I am highly capable of processing and understanding basic health information. I often have an idea of what is wrong with me even before the doctor's diagnosis.
0.916700	I am cognizant of my health condition and fully able to make my own decisions. I easily understand the options available to me and what course of medical treatment offers the best outcomes.  
0.838900	I think I would be able to obtain what I needed in order to get a general understanding of a condition.
0.888900	I can almost always understand and remember what a doctor or nurse tells me. I understand all basic medical terminology as well as some more advanced terms.
0.783300	I feel pretty confident in my ability to receive information that will allow me to make appropriate health decisions. I realize a lot of other people lie or omit information when dealing with health care professions and this seems completely counter-intuitive me so I try my best to be open and honest in my communications.
0.783300	Pretty good. Not illiterate. Can read.
0.783300	I think I have a very good ability to understand and process basic health information and make decisions. I was taught by my parents to ask doctors the necessary questions and to understand all diagnosis given to me by doctors before leaving the office.  
0.827800	i believe i can understand what my healthcare professiols tell me about my health. i rarely need anyone to explain things to me. if i don't understand something, i search the internet to find out more information. the internet is very helpful in finding out information.
0.900000	I am very capable of processing and understanding basic health information. First we have the lovely world wide web and there are A LOT of reputable sources to get information. Just need to make sure it is indeed reputable, like Web MD. I also do not have issues getting information from health professiols when I need it, that's what they are there for.
0.900000	I understand basic health information very well. If I need to I can always go to a reputable medical organization on the internet. I have worked in a Dr's.  office and familiar with basic medical terminology. 
0.883300	I have the knowledge and ability to be forthright and ask questions when I don't understand something.   Even if I was really scared of a diagnosis, I would not be afraid to find out any of the info I was looking for.     It goes across the board and would involve information, services, and billing.
0.883300	Almost perfectly. I am a good reader, have good reading comprehension,and frequently refer to Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins when I need more or expanded information on my or a friends medical concern.. 
0.794400	I feel like I have a higher degree of understanding about basic health information than the average person and my family.  Because health interests me, I like to read about conditions I have experienced or those around me have had on my own as well as speak to friends who have medical degrees.  I think I absorb what I hear about basic health information really well and retain it because I am so fascited by it.  Also, I have had some family members with serious medical issues so have had a lot of practice having to make choices and ask questions.
0.805600	I believe I understand well enough what questions I should ask pertaining to my ailment. I am sometimes hesitant to ask some questions I deem embarrassing, though.
0.622200	Confident. I feel confident in making my health decisions. I'm still fairly young and healthy. I know yo ask questions when something is important. I forget information, but I know what to do and say to function and survive. 
0.883300	I feel like I have a decent ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  If I don't understand something I ask questions and I usually end up doing research on health related maters online so that I can better understand anything I may not understand.
0.811100	I feel like, given my individual circumstances, I can easily obtain and understand basic health information and services. This is likely due to the fact that I enjoy reading and learning and have taken an interest in the medical/scientific fields in general (particularly in psychiatry, as I have mental health issues). One area that does cause problems for me, though, is that I am a drug addict and I am generally reluctant to tell healthcare professiols exactly what drugs I may or may not be on, due to the stigma attached to my habits.
0.827800	I think I can process most of the information the doctors tell me. The usually also give me written information for me to take home and read. So the written information helps as well.
0.916700	I never have too much of a problem understanding what they tell me, and when I do, I always ask questions until I know I understand completely what's going on. Other times I'll research on my own time what they tell me if I'm still not completely satisfied, or if I just want to know a little extra about something.
0.516700	I generally feel that I can understand the basics but dont fully grasp the overall picture. Sometimes I dont get how some aspects relate to other things but I am slowly learning to ask more questions or to ask family and friends for further clarification. But I generally feel I  can understand the basics.
0.900000	I have a high degree of being able to understand health information. My doctor is excellent with explaining and making sure I understand. I have also used Google to search for health knowledge.
0.672200	I feel like I can get by fairly well. I always ask my doctor questions, and when there are things on forms I don't understand (or I have a nurse help me). I don't understand everything on medical papers, but I think I know enough to gauge health decisions.
0.738900	I think I have a good capacity to obtain help when I need to make decisions concerning my health. I have family members who are able to help me fill out forms when I don't understand certain questions. The doctors and nurses are pretty helpful as well when I don't understand something, whether that deals with information I'm filling out or the information they give me concerning their judgement on my health. All in all, I haven't had too much trouble in this area. 
0.833300	I do understand the process of decisions for my health care, and if I am confused I then ask my doctor or nurse
0.788900	I mainly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services, although I do have difficulty with communication due to having high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder. I tend to not ask questions that I should ask because of being uncomfortable with communication.
0.850000	i think i am about average, i have had some but limited experience 
0.888900	I think I have a good knowledge base and am confident that, for the most part, I understand the directions my doctor and nurses give me, along with the materials and directions given to me afterward. I make sure to ask questions, but I will be honest and say that I often forget some of the things I want to ask before I go in during the exam. I
0.827800	I have a pretty good grasp on my health and health issues. I do a lot of research on the chronic conditions I have as well as the treatments and medications. Most of the information I obtain comes from trusted sources on the Internet rather than my health professiols. Many times I feel like just a number to my health care providers.
0.900000	I am pretty certain that I am capable to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make appropriate decisions. I mostly do not need help in understanding any information given to me. On rare occasions that I do need to as a few questions to better understand the information, I was always given clear answers by my doctors or nurses.
0.744400	I think it can be difficult because they are just trying to push the protocols on you and not necessarily do what is helpful to you or what you want. Especially in the case of my pregncies. I also do not understand the labs and stuff like that and I always have to ask and usually they dont even give you a copy, only when you go to a specialist or something then you see. I have heard that you can ask for a copy of your medical information the same day of your appointment and they give it for free but I feel intimidated because they make it seem like they charge you and they know better like why would you be asking questions. 
0.916700	I have a lot of confidence in myself to be able to understand and process basic health information. If I had questions after leaving a doctor's office, I would search for information on my prior before calling back. Anytime anyone I've known has had a medical condition, I always research it as well. I have never worked in the medical field, but I do learn quickly and comprehend what I do find on my own.
0.777800	I feel as if I can understand the basics of what is said, but occasiolly the use of the technical terms can get confusing compared to what most people would call a condition. Most forms are very simple to fill out though. 
0.761100	I have the capacity to process basic health information when it is provided. But recent experience indicates I seldom get all information such as consequences and other options, nor repercussions of all options. 
0.705600	At least decent in the form of if I do not know I will ask and I do follow my Doctors instructions. 
0.872200	I can understand all information provided to me in order to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.583300	I think that I will need to some research before making a decision. 
0.638900	I feel like I know a lot of the information given to me. Many times, however, I only understand the basics.  When doctors start going into the science of the problem I get confused. I usually don't have a problem obtaining my patient information. 
0.883300	I think I have the capability to understand my health concerns. I am not afraid to ask doctors any questions about any concerns I may have and I'm also not worried about appearing ignorant if I need any clarification or explation of different medical terms.  Also, the internet allows me to do further research into any health topic I want to learn about.
0.816700	I feel like I have a medium capacity to get and understand basic health information. I can fully comprehend health information as I am in school for a healthcare field. It is somewhat difficult for me to ask doctors or other healthcare providers questions or give them all my concerns because I feel like they will think I am a hypochondriac. 
0.633300	I think I am smart enough to realize when I need to seek health care. I also know what questions to ask normally. I think I have good judgement when it comes to my healthcare and my families as well. I definitely do not know everything though.
0.900000	As I am tive to English and I usually speak to English speaking doctors - I have a fairly easy time of understanding what they tell me. Most doctors know how to speak in layman's terms which makes it all easier. Otherwise, I can look up the term and can basically always understand what it says online.
0.866700	I feel I vouch for myself and give enough info to the doctors and nurses when it is time for intake. I feel I am a competent person who is not afraid to ask questions to call the doctor if I feel something is not right health wise. If i did not understand something on a form I always ask for help.
0.794400	I feel pretty confident in my ability. However, sometimes when new information is given it's hard to process it on the spot and know which questions to ask. I often think of questions after I have left the doctor's office. 
0.777800	I think I'm smart enough to understand most medical information. I find for me on thing that does not help is on the internet you can almost find contradictions to any medical recommendation. Diet, supplements, vaccitions all have opposing views for the general medical advice given.
0.777800	For the most part, the services I receive are superb, the only trick is waiting to get a appointment, which can sometimes take a month or longer. I feel that for the most part I understand the health system and the information provided me as well as the services, but sometimes I ask for help or opinions and explation when necessary.
0.916700	I feel very capable of doing these things. I feel confidednt in my ability to obtain and understand information about my health care. I feel that I am able to trust my own reasoning and decision making. 
0.855600	I am extremely confident in my ability to understand what was told to me. And if I had not understood, I'm confident in being able to understand through research or consulting others.  I would usually go with my mother and significant other to their doctor visits in order to explain to them what the doctors and nurses mean.
0.755600	I feel I am able to understand most things related to my healthcare if they are explained to me. I am able to understand most simple medical terms. However I do not always feel that I have access to the explations I sometimes need to make informed decisions. Often times I get very little time to speak with my doctors because they have to be with another patient. 
0.622200	I feel that I have a basic understanding of information and to process everything to make appropriate medical decisions, but sometimes there is a depth to these processes that require a deeper understanding.
0.872200	I feel confident in my ability to understand basic health information and make decisions. My doctors are very clear and helpful and always explain in detail if I need further clarification. They also lay out the options clearly so I can make an appropriate decision.
0.883300	I've worked in the healthcare field for most of my life in one way or another. I feel like I can understand just about anything thrown my way and I can make the right decisions regarding my health and treatment.
0.566700	I need it broken down better into easy to process words that i am familiar with to understand better. I feel sometimes the information is jus thrown at me and i would like it written down on papers so i can refer back to what i have and need todo for it and the medications.
0.811100	I persolly feel I am fully capable of obtaining and understanding the basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision. I am able to accomplish this by questioning my healthcare providers and also reading through materials or seeking additiol information online if necessary.
0.833300	I feel like I have enough of an understanding of health issues that may arise that I can discuss options with my doctor or doctors. I also only go to doctors that I trust to help me make the right decisions. I have a couple close friends who are nurses so I can always talk to them if there's something I'm not completely sure of.
0.688900	I worked in a hospital as their accounting staff, that may be the reason why I can understand easily their given information to me. But, I always ask them to read it for me to clarify that my understanding to my medical record is really what it seems to be.
0.916700	I have no problem asking a health professiol any questions to clarify anything I don't understand. Some Drs speak in medical terms and I often have to ask them to explain in layman's terms. My current Dr is extremely good about explaining everything and is more than willing to answer any and all questions.
0.866700	I feel that I am able to achieve this to a pretty high degree. Most times my health provider will provide a good enough verbal description of what I need to know and is available to answer any questions. I think what helps me the most, is that prior to going in and seeing someone, I research and look into my issue myself which gives me that ability to have some prepared questions or address any concerns. I have never had a problem following up with my provider with a phone call or email with a question and them not explaining what I need to know.
0.761100	I feel it to a moderate degree. When in doubt, I usually consult with my sister, who is a nurse practitioner. 
0.783300	I usually feel like I'm able to get enough information. Certain situations can make me flustered and uncomfortable, which sometimes limits how I interact. I do feel like there are more chances these days to get the information you need beyond the actual care interactions.
0.794400	I think I have a reasobly high capacity of health information.
0.850000	I  do not have any medical training but I can always pick up the phone and  call my doctor and  ask questions 
0.727800	For the most part I feel confident in my ability to understand basic health information, as long as it's just basic. Once medical jargon and terminology starts to be used, I get a little lost. Whatever I do have trouble processing, I can just turn to the internet for answers.
0.777800	Sometimes it can be difficult to obtain your health records due to the office being too busy. It can also be difficult to have them explain in detail what is going on with you because they have so many patients and not a lot of time.
0.661100	I think i have a decent capability. I can go out and try and find any info i am missing.
0.916700	I feel that I perfectly competent to make basic health decisions. I am a tive English speaker and routinely complete medical information forms by myself without help.
0.761100	With all the doctors and nurses help I feel like I can make adequate decisions in my Healthcare.  Doctors and nurses are always really helpful and I feel like I can rely on them  
0.838900	To a certain degree. I can understand most of the basic health information but decisions are a little bit difficult to make.
0.916700	I feel I have a good doctor and am able to openly communicate and discuss issues with them. I am open about my health issues which I think you need to be in order to get the help you need. I understand for the most part what the Dr says and what I am not sure of I ask questions. My husband will also ask questions which further helps with any questions that may arise or answers we may need. My husband and I share the same Doctor and we typically schedule appointments at the same time so the Doctor sees us together in an hour block.  This also helps us communicate better as we are both there and can both ask questions we may have
0.822200	I feel pretty confident. I have taken some medical classes in the past and that has really helped with explaining and being able to break down medical terminology  I also have a nurse for a mother so it makes it really easy to get answers to questions or if I don't understand something.
0.866700	I think it is really important that if you are being seen by a health care professiol that you understand what you are being told. If you do not understand then you MUST ask questions so that you are clear on what may be wrong or any instructions that they may give you. I think that I completely capable of asking questions and understanding what I am being told so that I can understand and make appropriate decisions as I do ask questions if I don't understand.  
0.883300	I feel as though I can understand everything a doctor tells me in order to make decisions. If there is something that I don't understand, I have no problem asking the doctor to explain.
0.738900	I feel like I'm pretty god at understanding my medical conditions and history. I'm young enough that I don't have a ton to deal with.  I will ask the doctor when I visit if I don't understand something.
0.883300	I feel i have a high capacity to understand and process information that's been given to me. I feel this way because i consider myself intelligent.  In addition , or maybe it goes hand and hand, i do my research on any topic i have questions on. I will never blindly take the advice or recommendations of Doctors/Nurses without also doing my own due diligence. 
0.838900	I feel that I am able to comprehend what I am told by my doctors. While I sometimes have a hard time understanding the insurance benefits I do understand and am able to fill out all the necessary forms and documentation. I normally understand what I am told about my health and treatments.
0.838900	I have full capacity to process and understand basic health information to make health decisions
0.838900	I feel very comfortable. I have no issues talking to doctors. I will tell them anything. I don't worry about holding anything back. I usually understand everything they say, and if I don't I ask questions. 
0.855600	I feel like I have all appropriate knowledge and information. I can obtain all necessary info and feel good talking with medical professiols about my health.
0.916700	i can do research and ask questions
0.844400	I feel I do for the most part.  I know basic stuff
0.872200	I don't feel I'm lacking in any of these areas. Between what the medical practitioner I usually see (a PA) tells me and the ability to fill in the gaps with information I can find on the Internet, I feel like I'm able to keep myself pretty well informed with what I need to know. That said, I don't currently deal with anything overly complicated either. When my dad was diagnosed with a rarer form of blood cancer, the learning process they went through was not as simple.
0.805600	I feel like I am completely capable of understanding information given to me by health care workers.  Although I don't always ask questions like I should, I know that I am able to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.750000	I'm quite capable of understanding what doctors are telling and reading medical documents. I have a background reading in scientific research, so understanding the technical side of things is quite easy for me.
0.722200	I think I do have the capacity to deal with the health information that I get. I am always sure to not leave the doctor's office or hospital with unswered questions. I try to search on the web first and I make a list of all the things I would like to ask so I don't leave details without answer.
0.422200	Based on the questions I answered, I realized I don't understand much about health information. There are many terms used that I don't know and often I don't know where to start asking questions. If information were described to me in simple terms, I would be able to make appropriate health decisions.
0.916700	I understand everything any medical professiol can tell me and ask questions if I don't.
0.794400	if i don't understand something and i am not at the doctor's office, i can ask a family member to help me or go online for help. the answers are there, you just have to ask a person or online.
0.833300	I am a pretty smart guy with decent insurance and family in medical fields, so I wouldn't have much trouble obtaining this type of information.  I am also not afraid to ask as many questions as I need to in order to fully understand any medical questions.
0.711100	I feel fairly competent to obtain and understand health information that is given to me. I studied biology in college (it was my major) and was considering going into medicine, but decided on another field later on. I have accumulated a lot of knowledge on health issues and factors over the years, through reading online and keeping track of my own health. 
0.916700	While I lack medical expertise on any of its subjects, I in general have good reading comprehension and can at least partially understand things that I don't know about using context. I also know how to ask good questions, when necessary, and have good research skills to investigate a lot of things on my own. 
0.816700	"I think that the doctors who I am a patient under are generally capable of explaining my problems to me. The forms are also easy enough to understand. The problem starts with me and my disconnect between doctors. I don't speak the language of medicine, and I don't know how to properly express symptoms. So there is a moment when the doctor asks me if I have any questions, but I say I do not. I only come to find out days or weeks later that I should have asked certain questions when I run into problems. For instance, I never used to consider the side effects of medications until I started suffering them, and when I did start to talk to doctors about them I could not just say ""tell me about the side effects,"" because they would only discuss the most common ones. If not for the fact that I suffered rare side effects, I would not have known that you have to push the issue in order to learn about the effects doctors feel aren't worth mentioning."
0.916700	I have no problem processing health or health related information . I am a retired Paramedic and my wife is a nurse
0.794400	I feel that I am fully capable of asking questions surrounding my own healthcare. The problem is I can become embarrassed or shy while I'm trying to advocate for my needs and make sure that I get all the information that I need to.

Sometimes, though, there are things that I don't know and I don't know the right questions to ask to figure it out, so I'm left in the dark. 
0.755600	I am not shy and a fairly good talker so I usually talk with nurse s and I can usually get whatever information is needed.

0.755600	I feel like I know enough to make most decisions properly or at least enough to know when I'm out of my element. The internet is a valuable tool in this regard as long as I use it carefully and always defer to the judgement of my healthcare professiols.
0.700000	I really don't have problems.  When asking for help with forms, it is sort of an ocd thing (self diagnosed).  I just need to be sure.  I rely a large amount on info from the web.  I fully realize that the source must be reputable.
0.783300	I feel very much confident that I have the capacity to comprehend basic health information. I rarely have to ask for clarification from my health care providers. There have been a couple times where I was a bit puzzled and I didn't ask for clarification. 
0.722200	I feel like when I am actually at the doctors office there is pressure from the doctor to end the discussion as quickly as possible so he or she can go see other patients.

0.866700	Most of the material I receive regarding health information has been at a reading comprehension level that is quite easy to understand and retain. Which has allowed me to fully optimize all choices available for the successful maintece of all health issues.
0.633300	I feel that I can make decisions regarding my own health to a greater degree than professiols. It is somewhat insulting that I have to go to a dermatologist for acne medication that has never heard of tea tree oil.

0.450000	very few. its very hard for me to understand most of what the docters says i need him to repeat it serval times to me and also i need him to to expain it in better terms and simpler terms to.

0.827800	I feel pretty confident researching my health conditions, evaluating study abstracts, and staying on top of new information. Sometimes I have a hard time talking with health care professiols, though. I think they're used to doing the same thing for everyone with a particular health condition and don't understand how my multiple conditions interact with each other. 
0.916700	I feel like anything I don't understand that's given to me by a doctor or nurse would be easily understood after they explain it to me. If I didn't understand it then I would simply ask and that should be enough.
0.811100	I believe I am intelligent and knowledgeable enough to understand most of the medical information that is given to me. I also tried to stay informed and if need will research things I do not understand.
0.772200	I believe my capacity for these actions is adequate. Although I feel literate in health-related topics, my history of medical care has not received much of my attention.
0.794400	I believe that I am confident enough to get through acquiring a health service. I do not have a ton of experience and sometimes the wording gets confusing. I think that usually though I will eventually get through it successfully. I've never had help filing my taxes and that usually goes pretty well.
0.900000	I think I get the information I need but I can't say for certain because I don't know what I don't know.  In general, when I'm visiting with my physician I feel free to ask questions and will often paraphrase what I've been told and repeat it back to the doctor or nurse to make sure I've understood it correctly.
0.822200	I have a basic knowledge of some of the medical jargon that has been used around me when it comes to my body. I have had diagnoses thrown at me occasiolly that I haven't been able to understand until someone has explained them in a language that I understood. When I was in my twenties, I was told that I was Septic. I didn't understand. they gave me paperwork to read over, but with the infection of that magnitude, I couldn't read.  I have had diagnoses with my mental health as well, I wasn't sure what the treatment meant, until someone explained it to me. There was a time where I was taking Lithium. (2011) I took it for two years, I lost joy, and my ability to comprehend written or read information. Once I was switched to a different medication, it took two years for me to even be able to comprehend a page long news article. I am doing much better now, but there are still moments that i feel foggy, or loose memory of certain words. I will have to google things to remember what the words mean. 
0.916700	We live in the internet age so I have all the information. Really, I have the exact same information any doctor on the planet would have. If I don't feel like spending a lot of time looking into a specific issue myself, I have no problem with asking the professiols.
0.727800	I think I can for the most part. I can understand a problem and the possible solutions and strategies to treat the problem. I feel confident enough to share all of my concerns and ask all appropriate questions about my condition. 
0.555600	i think it is very hard to understand most of what they tell you. i can understand the basics to my problems like eat less to loose weight but when they go into more detail and reasoning behind things i get lost.
0.850000	I feel that I have a high capacity to make appropriate health decisions based on the information I receive.  I always make sure to ask any questions I have no matter how small they seem.  I make sure I understand what I need to before I leave the office as I want to make sure I get better and don't do anything to make my condition worse.  I try not to use things like webMD or other things on the computer and just listen to my doctor.  I don't want to get any false information or confuse myself.  I trust my primary health physician as he has been right in the past and has helped me get over a few things with no complications and fairly quickly in all instances as well.  He goes over any documents or directions with me before I leave so I can ask questions and so he knows I understand everything.  
0.805600	I have no problem keeping my medical appointments, however I write a list of things to ask when I meet with my Dr. and I forget to take my list with me. I'm married to a retired RN and she is a big help with my understanding my health care. I'm seeing 5 specialists so it's hard to keep on top of it. It's almost a full time job but easier thanks to the internet.
0.844400	"I depend entirely on myself to research my health conditions and my options because I am ethically and philosophically opposed to the techniques used by ""modern"" medicine. I refuse invasive procedures (surgeries) and medications. Since this puts me in opposition to 99% of the physicians out there, I never visit a doctor and rely on myself to research what types of noninvasive, tural remedies are available to me."
0.866700	I feel like I can understand basic information because I try to ask as many questions as possible. I am a very anxious and paranoid person, so if I don't ask questions I'll regret it later and have to call or go back to get them answered. I'd rather look a little ignorant  by making someone reiterate something to me, then be completely in the dark. 
0.888900	While I don't know much about medical or health related information, I am generally a smart person. I can figure most things out myself with a little research. If there is something that I don't understand, I have family who I can ask to help me out.
0.872200	I believe I am fully capable of understanding health information given by to me by doctors, and I am also fully capable of providing accurate health information.  I believe I am intelligent enough to comprehend and conduct independent research, and make decisions based on the information I am given.  I think I have a healthy dose of skepticism when given information as well.
0.838900	I believe I'm presented with everything I need about my health informatiob. When my doctor leaves out I normally have a nurse come in behind to make sure I understood everything about my visit
0.900000	I think I have a good grasp on everything I am told in my doctor visits and any other visits to a healthcare professiol. If I have any problems with reading information that I'm given, I feel confident that I can ask the doctor or other professiol and they will give me a good explation. I also do a lot of reading and research on my own about medical conditions I have and what I can expect in the future due to these medical conditions. I do reading and research online and I also ask people I know who have the same medical condition(s) as me about their experiences. Using all this information, I feel really good about the questions I need to ask my doctor or areas where I need further explation and information. All of this also makes me feel confident about any decisions I need to make about treatment options. 
0.750000	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information. Both of my parents are doctors so I can always go to them for my health questions since they are both very intelligent and knowledgable as well. I feel there are many other resources out there to get the information I need in order to be able to understand most health information.
0.750000	Every doctor or nurse I've been to has always explained things to me without me asking them.
0.727800	I feel I have all the capacity to understand my health decisions. Also I find doing more research on looking up on my computer more helpful.
0.805600	I'm involved in my healthcare and value having a doctor that communicates well. I've switched doctors in the past when I felt a disconnect with them. I generally understand what is going on; advanced medical specifics can be confusing. I aprpreciate having detailed explaitions written down, for my perusal when I'm not as stressed (if applicable).
0.755600	I think I ask a moderate amount of questions to clarify most of the information given to me by professiols, which I think is the whole key no matter what my mental capacity - you ask until they dumb it down for you to a more comfortable level.
0.827800	It seems that most medical professiols are really good at explaining things simply right from the start. At times, I really wish they would be more detailed but most are too rushed. In the few times I get any sort of information in writing, I will save it even after reading it to be sure I have a record. I think most information is pretty straight forward. 
0.883300	I think I have the ability to understand everything.  If there was something I didn't understand, I would ask the medical official for clarification, or seek out answers from friends or the internet.
0.900000	I self diagnosed my self as a hypochondriac. I often visit the doctor for every ache or bump despite having nothing wrong with me. My doctor knows me very well since I visit often and always explains to me why what I think I have, I do not actually have. I feel I have a lot of experience with going to the doctor and asking questions.  
0.661100	I think that I am well able to fend for myself on all the matters regarding my own health from forms to taking informed decisions to an extent. for instance as long as my faculties allow me to do so. 
0.883300	English is my first language and I'm of normal intelligence, so I don't see why I would have problems understanding basic health information and services. With respect to obtaining information, most doctors and staff I've met seem quite willing to provide whatever information is requested or needed.
0.855600	I have an excellent understanding of the basic health information to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.722200	Overall, I feel that I have a pretty good capacity for reading and understanding information in medical settings. I am a bit shy, however, so I have trouble with speaking up and asking all of the questions I should ask. Sometimes more technical information on forms confuses me and I get my husband to help me in that case.  Sometimes I also get him to call the doctor or pharmacist for me with my questions.
0.755600	I think I am able to obtain, process and understand basis heath information easily as I am in the medical field myself. I feel competent in understanding diagnosis as well as doctors orders. I Usually don't have any issues filling out medical forms. 
0.827800	I feel very capable of processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. However I struggle with obtaining information from my healthcare providers because I'm often intimidated by them and don't want to look stupid by asking too many questions. Or oftentimes, the provider will rush through our appointment so I feel as if I would be bothering them by any more detailed questions. 
0.672200	As I get older it is a little bit more difficult to understand certain things when they explain to me.  I usually have to ask twice or three times before I am able to fully understand what they are explaining to me.  Some of the medical terms they use are words I have never heard before in my life, so this is why I can get confused at times. 
0.872200	I feel as though I could get the information that I need and process it to a great degree. I tend to bring notebooks with me to the doctor to write down questions I have and what is said to reference in the future.
0.850000	If the issues that I have are basic I feel that I will have more than enough capacity to understand and obtain the information needed to make the correct decision(s) for my benefit. If the issue is something of higher significance I may than need more assistance. 
0.783300	I am very confident that I the ability to obtain proper medical and health decisions. If something isn't clear, I can always ask and find the information I need. I feel confident in my doctor to give me all the information I need.
0.783300	I believe I'm very capable of understanding most medical information. I feel with the doctors I have had explain much of what is going on with me in plain english. However when I have had doctors in the hospital particularly that were very unhelpful and didn't speak in plain english. So i find the more of the emergency i have been in the harder it has been to make a the high decisions I have to be very trusting. 
0.777800	I feel like I am capable of understanding basic health information. I have not had an experience where I did not understand most of the information given to me. I also am in college and planning on going into the medical field, so I would like to say that I should know more than the average person that takes this survey.
0.833300	Although I don't often understand the big words that are used and have had to come home and look some of them up on the internet, the doctors at the clinic I usually go to are pretty good about answering questions and putting it into terms that I can understand. The nurses at the clinic and the hospital are also willing to answer questions to help me understand. And even though I sometimes have felt that I am not sure about making the right decisions I trust the doctors to help me make an informed decision.
0.866700	I feel that I am perfectly capable of understanding most basic health information. But sometimes things can be a little convoluted or confusing and you want someone there with you who can confirm what you heard and understood it the same way that you did. It is also stressful when you are dealing with a health condition and you might miss something while you are worrying and thinking about your health, so it's helpful to have someone along with you to get any information that you might miss.
0.744400	I feel that overall I do OK. I do a lot of research on my own and try to prepare for appointments in advance. If I don't feel a doctor is helpful and really listens to me, I will switch to someone else. 
0.800000	I due tend to understand most medical information, and info presented to me, if I dont I can find a way to figure it out.
0.866700	I think that I am able to understand the instructions fairly well. If I have any questions I ask my doctor directly or I follow up with the office after I leave.
0.572200	I am very confident in getting all the information that is needed. The reason is very simple I do not trust anyone or anything. By having that believe I always make sure  thing goes smoothly.
0.755600	I have the capacity to obtain and process but the problem is, in my opinion, that there are so many conflicting claims about treatment, about the quality and efficacy of medication, and then loss in meaning when dealing with doctors/nurses who don't speak your language as a first language, that getting through the health care system these days is almost an active minefield.  Or a crapshoot.
0.761100	I know I have the resources to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I may not be able to do so immediately, but with the help of the internet and my wife who is a nurse, I am confident I can understand just about anything I may need to go over with a doctor (non-specialist). Most people can't answer all their own medical questions and I don't think it's fair for anyone to be able to answer medical questions without being given adequate time to look into the questions.
0.855600	I'm not in the medical profession, so I can honestly say that I do need to have some medical information explained to me. I do believe that I'm capable of looking up information about a treatment, diagnosis or medication. I do ask a lot of questions to people providing medical care to make sure I fully understand what is happening and how the treatment options affect me persolly.
0.883300	I feel comfortable seeking medical information and discussing health topics with professiols. Usually can read in office information, talk to health professiols, and/or research information independently.
0.733300	WHEN I GET THE MEDICAL ANTTENTION
0.872200	I believe that I can understand basic health information well enough to be able to make appropriate decisions.  I believe this because I have the ability to comprehend what the health professiols are telling me, and if I have questions I will ask them to obtain the answer.
0.550000	It all depends on the wording. If it is placed in simple english then it is easily understood if they attempt to use many weird medical terms then it is different
0.811100	I have a university education so I'm not too concerned about not being able to process or understand basic health information and services needed to make health decisions. With ease of access to information online through a smartphone and being open with medical assistants and practitioners, I believe I am able to understand everything being presented to me. Excessive legalese or use of scientific mes/terminology may give me pause, but I am confident I will be able to find a means of getting layman's definitions for them or convince medical personnel to simplify anything that I might find confusing.
0.716700	I feel like I have the knowledge and resources to typically find out what I need to know if I have any questions. Understanding and comprehending medical conditions isn't very difficult for me, however many of my issues during my life time have been fairly basic. If i were to leave the doctor's office with questions, I would probably do research online.
0.833300	I feel that I have superior capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions. I tend to do my own research before making decisions, sometimes compiling positives and negatives and balancing them to make the most optimal decision.
0.777800	I have a basic understanding due to a few courses in school. I took emt training etc
0.811100	I feel I have a high capacity for understanding health information. I am college educated and have worked in health care for over six years. This gives me an understanding of some basic health knowledge and knowing how the process works.
0.572200	It would help with making sure that it would have a lot of health info, while people are able to have good decisions
0.916700	From the various tests I've taken in my life I've been judged to be in the upper levels of intelligence. I'm aware of nothing in my experience which do not support those results. Overall, my reading and understanding of English and the ability to comprehend all types of information is more than adequate. 
0.850000	I am responsible for my own medical appointments and decisions.  I have learned to be self sufficient in that regard and learn the necessary steps to take care of myself.  I believe I have good health insurance, doctors and a pharmacy that willing to take the time to educate me or answer any questions I have.
0.916700	I have always been proactive regarding my responsibilities as a patient.  A nurse once told me that doctor's don't remember everything so keep them on their toes.
0.916700	I am the son of a doctor so I am very aware of my health needs and how to read documents. I know what is good for myself and my body and I am able to understand how different procedures affect different outcomes and make a ratiol decision based upon the facts. 
0.888900	I believe that I have a large capacity to obtain all the information and understand it, as I am a person that asks questions of the doctor's so that I know what is going on with my health. I also am one to do my own research on medical conditions by going on health websites. 
0.850000	Well, I have the good fortune to be a fluent speaker of English in a largely English-speaking country and, while I am a pretty low-key individual, I am not afraid to ask a question about something I don't understand.  I am not afraid of looking foolish- it is much better to be properly informed.  While I have a bad tendency to not think of a question fast enough while I'm at the doctor's office, my main physician lets me e-mail him and has answered many of my belated questions that way.
0.777800	I feel pretty confident in my abilities to obtain and process medical information given to me. Occasiolly I will come up with questions after I've already left the office and I'll need to get in contact with them again.. sometimes that causes me anxiety but I can push through it to get the information I need.
0.661100	I have a good capacity to get the information and services I need.  I have enough insurance coverage to get health services.  I have good doctors who provide me with the information I need.  I can also use the internet to get some information.
0.872200	I feel that I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Just based on my prior experience in dealing with doctors, nurses and other healthcare providers, I am confident in my abilities. Since I am ufraid to ask questions and have helped other individuals become more informed of their healthcare situations, I would not doubt my skills to acquire the information and assistance needed.
0.844400	Completely comfortable with understanding health information and making an informed decision based on it. 
0.911100	I used to sell health insurance so I do not have problems filling out the forms. I understand most of the paperwork. When a doctor is talking to me, they sometimes us terminology that I do not understand but I do not have a problem asking them what that means.
0.600000	Mostly I can figure stuff out, but there are still a lot of questions that go unswered sometimes.  Although they try to explain things to me I still sometimes have a hard time remembering or understanding them.  Doctor information to me is often complicated.
0.444400	I always ask my husband to accompany me to my doctor's appointment because most of the time I can't remember everything the doctor tells me and I can' understand most of the medical terms.  My husband is a nurse so he always go with me in my appointments.
0.855600	I believe that I am quite confident in understanding basic health information and services about my health decisions and other medical conditions that I experience.  I like to do research online and read articles, if not even medical jourls about specific conditions that I experience, or at high-risk for.
0.827800	There is nothing that prevents me from understanding basic health information. I have enough experience with the medical system that I can understand the common terms used in writing and expressed by my doctor.
0.900000	I feel that I am completely capable of obtaining, processing and understanding health information if I need to. I have no defects of vision, education, memory or any other disability that would impair my capability to acquire any information or to understand it.
0.883300	I feel confident enough to make health decisions.  I have been hospitalized numerous times for Crohn's Disease and partial bowel obstructions along with several surgeries to make me comfortable enough to understand what the health providers have told me.  I also do a lot of research online to understand my conditions and what will happen and what kind of treatment regimen I will take along with the post hospitalization recovery period.
0.794400	I think that I understand and am capable of understanding most of what a doctor or nurse is explaining and if I don't I can ask them to go a little more detail. I feel comfortable asking about things that I'm not quite certain about without feeling dumb.
0.883300	I usually have a good understanding of what is being told to me.  I ask questions when needed and also may look up something about it on the Internet. Then I can make the best decision based on what I have learned about my condition.
0.900000	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic information from my doctors. I generally feel like most doctors want their patients to understand what is happening and they speak in a way that things are clear and when they don't I don't mind letting them know.
0.583300	I have to ask questions again if I do not understand.I often have a family member come with me so I do not miss anything.
0.861100	I am highly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have a strong educatiol background in health and medicine so I understand what I need and expectations for the services should receive. 
0.916700	I feel like I have the capacity to understand health information.  If I ever have any trouble in understanding, I am not ashamed or bashful to ask for further information or a more clear explation from the doctor or nurse.  My husband can look over my paperwork and if he has any questions he will ask me or even call the healthcare professiol.
0.805600	I don't have any trouble understanding materials that are given to me regarding healthcare, but I don't always read everything. I'll read the parts I think are most important. Face-to-face communication with any healthcare provider is difficult because they are usually in a hurry. If I have questions I know I'll want to ask, I'll write them down ahead of time, but there's not time during appointments to discuss anything.
0.916700	I feel that I am of sound mind and body and am more than capable of making decision in regards to my health. I usually don't have issues with taking medications as prescribed, always have a good understanding of what I should and shouldn't do for my ailments, and have the capability of seeking out information I don't have. 
0.511100	It's hard to say. It often depends on what it's about--if it's psychological, I can understand things a bit better, but with most GPs and such it's not something I'm well versed in
0.916700	I think I have a good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I've never had a problem understanding my doctors or forms before. I do not think I need help with this.
0.916700	I am fully capable of processing information from a health professiol.  I am also good at looking up symptoms and I usually am good at figuring out what is wrong.  (For example, my husband had a blood clot in his leg, but I looked it up before he went to the doctor and told him it looked as if it was a superficial clot, and it turned out that is what the doctor said.)  I know that I can go to the doctor for more information when necessary and I know I can get second opinions with serious health concerns. 
0.833300	i feel fairly confident, most persol information is straight forward. Most questions can be asked and understood in the office and i can always do some research on the internet.
0.916700	I have no mental problems that prevent me from understanding the written or spoken word.  I am nearly completely deaf, but my doc speaks louder and it is not hard to hear him.  And if I do not understand something he or the nurse says, I ask them to repeat themselves.  Same goes with any form I am filling out.  If I do not understand the question, I ask.  So, I would say I have 100% capacity to understand information, get information, process said information and make the necessary medical decisions.
0.838900	I feel I have the skills required to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I have proficiency reading and writing in English, which all of my health information is presented in.  I work in the sciences, which helps me to understand more complex terminology as well as have the ability to look up what I don't understand.  I ask for help when needed, and am always open with my doctors even if it is about questioble or embarrassing issues. 
0.761100	I feel absolutely competent in understanding and processing basic health information to make decisions about my health. However, finding or obtaining information that will truly be helpful to my health is difficult. Intense research is often necessary for basic information. 
0.833300	I feel I'm able to follow and comprehend medical information farely well. Especially, since you can research much of the information online.  I'm pretty good at doing my due diligence.  
0.916700	I feel I have a full capability to process and understand any medical or health information given to me. I know the basics of how the body works, and anything beyond that is not too complicated for me to understand. I feel completely comfortable vigating the health care system.
0.916700	Im typically a detail and fine print person so I always read information thoroughly and if I have a question I ask and build on it if it doesn't make sense to me. An example would be when I had 5 disk fusion surgery on my neck. The Surgeon had given me some pamplets to read that were essentially percentages of improvement. I may have a 20 percent full recovery or 12 percent full use of my right arm or 8 percent no change at all. The percentages made little sense since none left me with a 50 / 50 chance of improvement and I had to ask more questions as to whether this expensive surgery had any upside at all.
0.727800	I feel sort of confident to be able to process the information that I am given by the doctors. I do wish that I had a better way to understand the results  of the blood work and xr and mris.
0.883300	I believe that I am fully capable of understanding most health information that is given to me by any health professiol. I have the means to research things at home. If I don't understand anything, especially certain terms that I have not heard before, I make sure to ask my doctor exactly what that means.
0.866700	to a high degree, I guess.  I have no trouble understanding the information they present to me.  I also have no trouble looking it up.
0.772200	I am fully capable of understanding and processing basic and even advanced health information but sometimes I may need things to be explained fully to understand certain points.
0.855600	I feel strongly that I have the capacity to find the resources and ensure I understand basic health information and services with regards to myself. I feel I am able to find the information needed and reach a high level of understanding which ebles me to make the proper health decisions needed.
0.805600	For most basic issues, I feel very confident.  However, my experience helping my mother sort through terminology and different specialists for pancreatic cancer taught me that there are definitely areas that I struggle to understand.  Often the shock of whatever was just told to you shrouds your ability to even realize you're not understanding.
0.900000	I feel confident that I can understand what is being explained to me.  However, if there is something I don't understand, I ask them to explain it further.
0.866700	I have complete control over understand what is said or written to me. If I need help, then I ask. But that is rare.
0.622200	I understand basic of the medical term.  If I still not fully understand at the office, I will do more research or asked my sister for help. Because she is an nurse too. 
0.738900	Yes I feel that I do. I have dealt with hospitals and medical things quite a bit due to my children.
0.855600	I feel like I am pretty informed and do ask questions about health care options. There are times that my doctor is uble or unwilling to address certain questions (i.e. supplements versus prescription meds; treatment side effects, etc.) and questions go unswered.  But I generally understand information I am given or I am able to find competent online sources to read further and understand.
0.916700	I feel confident answering questions freely. When I ask enough questions I feel more trusting of the doctor or nurse. I also feel capable that if I felt unsure I could seek out other sources to come back to the doctor and further the discussion.
0.827800	I feel I am quite knowledgeable about my health problems and can understand what is said to me
0.805600	I feel like I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions. Regarding forms, I sometimes have difficulty remembering family history and accurately describing symptoms but I try my best. Regarding doctors/medical professiols, I try to prepare questions in advance and ask for explations for anything I don't understand. Generally the most difficult part is getting the doctor to answer some basic questions before rushing out. I don't think they're rude, just definitely in a hurry. If there's still things I don't understand, I'll use google or call and talk to a nurse. I might not fully understand everything, but I trust my capacity to make appropriate medical decisions.
0.722200	I think I have the ability to obtain a lot of information on the internet.  I can't obtain information from other people as much as from the internet because I'm not around people much especially medical people and because it's very difficult for me to think of everything if I'm talking to someone so sometimes I don't end up asking anything and sometimes I only ask one or two things that I've already thought a lot about.  I think I can usually understand information on the internet, though I think sometimes both the internet and doctors and nurses don't give much information because they don't think I need to know much.
0.722200	I feel like I know my health. I ask what I need in order to understand. I feel adequate enough to explain any problems or deficiencies that I may have.
0.916700	I can understand the materials that are given to me by a  doctor and I fully understand what they tell me about any problems that I may have. If I don't understand something, I always ask the doctor to explain it to me. Any forms that I need to fill out I can usually fill them out all by myself without any help. If I have a question about a field to fill out on a form I will ask the receptionist about it. I will then fill out the form completely. I don't make any decisions without knowing the consequences of those decisions first.I always ask the doctor of my options, so I can fully understand what I need to do.
0.833300	i feel that i am very capable to make my own health decisions. i only have a difficult time when the paperwork gets into legal matters. that's when it gets a little confusing for me. i am quite knowledgeable about medical terminology and procedures. but if i have a question i always ask and if i feel that i need a second opnion i will go and get it.
0.783300	I have full capacity to process, understand and obtain basic health information and services. I do a lot of reading and research and am comfortable learning and processing information.
0.572200	well fortutely there is the internet,and i can search for more information about the things i dont know enough about.without that i doubt i could find the info easily.
0.900000	I am a fluent English writer and speaker and I can read very well.  I am very aware of what the Doctor or Nurse is telling me and I clearly understand what they are saying. 
0.883300	I feel like I am well prepared for interactions with health professiols. I can understand most that is to,d to me, and I am not afraid to ask questions or request clarification regarding the items I don't fully comprehend. 
0.777800	My doctors and nurses tell me what to do, give me the phone number and explain to me what will be done and when it needs to be done.
0.916700	I have an understanding of my medical problems, so I feel that what the doctors recommend, I am able to make a decision.  If there is an option that I am not aware of, I will have the doctor explain it to me.
0.594400	I'm not too well versed on medical conditions and what causes them so I always get a little worried. Insurance and how it relates to health throws a wrench in things 
0.883300	I am very confident about my abilities to read and understand health information. Sometimes I may need help to understand some of the medical jargon used but overall I can do it by myself.
0.644400	I feel I have a basic understanding of health information that is provided to me by my doctor.  If I am confused by information I will look it up on the Internet for clarification. I believe with my knowledge and the Internet I came make informed decisions. 
0.883300	I feel pretty confident in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I believe I have a pretty good idea of how to keep myself fit and healthy. If I have any questions for my doctor, I'll ask them. I'm always careful to follow my doctor's advice/orders very carefully. 
0.838900	As far as past experiences go I have always had the capacity to understand.  I feel somewhat confident that I would always be able to do so, however, if I developed something that was out of the ordiry, I might find myself uble to understand.
0.833300	It takes me some effort to get a grasp of medical information provided by my doctors. Some of it is quite confusing. So, I have to trust them blindly without my informed input in the medical decision they make.
0.661100	I can do as well as the next person i think But when they start talking to fast it can go over my head. I feel I am smart enough to understand most subjects and health care is no different.
0.822200	I feel that I have a good grasp of the terminology often used, and if I don't I feel confident enough to ask questions of my doctor or to search for the definitions of the terminology on the internet.
0.705600	I feel that I have enough knowledge to understand basic health information.  I am able to review and understand all the information that is given to me by healthcare professiols.
0.538900	I feel that some doctors could be better at explaining medical conditions in a way that normal people can understand it. Sometimes it's difficult to understand what they mean, but occasiolly I am too embarrassed to ask what they mean exactly. In that case I will look it up myself later. I realize that it would be better to actually ask the doctor, because the internet is not always the most reliable place to find information. So I feel that I do have the capacity to get the information, but I don't always do it because I feel intimidated by some doctors.
0.844400	I feel quite confident in being able to understand basic health services and information. If there is anything I'm unsure about I ask my doctor. If it's after I've left the doctor's office, the internet can be a helpful tool in better understand certain services or diagnosis.
0.755600	I don't need accommodations or help to obtain or process basic health information. However, when I need some specific information usually I find it difficult to obtain it.  Medical pamphlets are general and vague, doctors and nurses are busy.
0.850000	Overall I am confident in my abilities here. The greatest worries come in areas where there is a great deal of conflicting information in circulation, such as on appropriate macronutrient balance for diet. Then I feel I have to fall back on my own judgment rather than that of my own doctor, which is risky.
0.916700	I feel like I have a great understanding of getting and processing the information I need regarding my health. I have no issues.
0.816700	I feel that I do have the capacity to process and understand the information needed on my health issues. My concerns are that the health care professiols are not providing me the true information that I need to get the proper treatment. 
0.916700	I am a fully confident in my ability to understand basic health information. I can rely on online resources like Google to help me obtain the information I am interested in.
0.611100	YES BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T ASK YOU WILL NEVER KNOW ARE UNDERSTAND 
0.716700	I feel that I have the ability to process and understand my health information by speaking with my doctors and their office assistants, including visits to specialists and labs. Details I may want to investigate are very often found online.  But when it comes to the fincial aspect of healthcare and health insurance I have often been confused and intimidated. The past several years have been much better with the help of the ACA and Covered California; but I am extremely worried that Republican legislation will end all that and allow insurance companies to focus on their profits instead of getting healthcare to those that need it.
0.850000	"I have the capability to do all of the above.  The problem comes in understanding the always changing process, being told one thing by one nurse/doctor and being told something else by another.  Sometimes the information presented to read and understand at times reads like its meant for professiols in the field, not the non-medical educated.  I do a lot of asking when big medical words are used ""what does that mean"".  Sometimes I feel like I'm just supposed to understand and process what they want me to!  My health is good enough and I'm educated enough to understand most, but people like my mom have no clue and just go on whatever doctors want to do and trust."
0.838900	I can understand health information and make health decision as long as it's not made obtuse by using technical terms or covering pages with legal talk. I can process medical info about as well as any other info. It's just in the medical field they often talk about things that need to be expanded on to fully understand, the mes of medicines and illnesses are not easily understood by regular people, so given a more thorough explation, I'm very confident in my ability to make health decisions.

Also if i still find it hard to understand i ask my doctor when i see him or consult my friends who are doctors.
0.761100	I am confident that I can process most of the health information. Before I make an appropriate health decision I usually ask at least two different doctors for opinion. I am really confident that I can make an appropriate health decision because I process the information carefully and with help of specialists.
0.688900	Whenever u go to the doctor,  i make sure to ask questions.  If there is anything I don't understand or papers i don't understand  i always ask for help to make sure i receive the help needed.
0.733300	I think that my understanding of medical terminology is better than average.  I try to do a good deal of research before a doctor visit, and I will ask appropriate questions when there.  
0.866700	I have no problem with asking questions which make me feel comfortable about understanding basic health issues.  Sometimes I get uncomfortable with trying to process information becasue some types of ambiguities are usually involved.  I don't try to understand too much of what I am told because I trust the health professiols that I am dealing with.
0.822200	I feel I have a high capacity in general regarding those questions. I ask so many questions of my Doctor he gets irritated, but I get my answers. :) I believe I understand basic health information, and if I don't there are people I can ask - and an entire internet to search - for answers. Sometimes the official forms are intimidating. I try to take all forms slow and question what I don't understand.
0.500000	To a very high degree
0.861100	I am quite able to process medical info if it is free of medical jargon, chemical mes, latin mes, and what i call medicalese which is like legalese.I don't retain info when in pain so well, that is when I bring an extra pair of ears so to speak.
0.844400	i feel i have am very capable obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. if i have a question, i will ask someone knowledgeable or google it. i feel very comfortable in this aspect and am not worried about it at all.
0.766700	I have the capacity to understand and convey my basic health information
0.844400	I think have a better than average understanding of medical information and general medical knowledge. When it comes to advanced information I can figure out the important things although I sometimes don't understand the technical details. Dealing with basic health information is no problem for me.
0.727800	I feel that with the internet I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions- but that is done on my own time outside of the doctors office. I do not feel that health officials play a key role as more often than not they are rushed and not listening to concerns. If I or another family member are seeking diagnosis, I will give as much information as I know to have but can't say that I have the details or knowledge to know which specific questions to ask. As for documents pertaining to medical procedures or medical information they are often confusing and difficult to understand in the short time allotted. 
0.716700	I feel I have the full capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.

0.827800	I feel have an average capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to help me make appropriate decisions.

0.844400	I feel as if I have the capacity to obtain or understand most basic health information and services needed to make my own health decisions.
0.650000	I feel comfortable enough understanding health situations where I have to make a choice on behalf of either myself or my kids. Our doctors are generally pretty good about explaining things, which makes us feel comfortable asking questions. I think that a person's capacity to process and obtain health info like this does largely depend on the doctor's ability to explain things in a way that makes sense to a patient/caregiver, and our doctors are very solid in this area.
0.944400	I think i hav no problem with any of that
0.727800	For me sometime, it is difficult to understand the hand written explation of health and i need to check with doctor / nurse to clarify again about it. I always ask question if i am unsure about the health situation to my doctor during the visit.
0.666700	I think I can understand the basic health information and services for the most part.  But sometimes the language used I will need some help with.  I don't need help all the time just some of the time.  I think that for most of the time I can do it myself.
0.766700	I feel that overall I can make a good decisions. Sometimes things confuse me but I try and ask questions if they do. 
0.777800	I think I do have the capacity to understand all the basic health information needed, whenever I don't understand something am not afraid to ask the medical personnel and with the help of all these free online resources, life has been made much easier, I can google something for further clarification.

0.688900	I read and re-read all the information.  If I don't understand, I will discuss it with my spouse or other family members.  Then I will ask my Doctor.
0.883300	I feel that I can certainly obtain, process and understand basic health information and services when I need to make health decisions. At anytime I don't understand something, I will ask a knowledgeable person about what they think, ask them to explain it to me in a better manner or point me in the direction of the information that I'm needed to make an informed decision. I haven't ran into too many instances where I needed additiol assistance in understand and making health issues.
0.633300	I think i do a little bit with some help.Some terminology is difficult to understands with wording.With help I can understand it better with help.
0.783300	Yes, I can understand all of thec forms I need to fill out.  I can understand and ask questions about information told to me verbally.  Some complicated written material in medical language, I cannot understand.
0.916700	I feel very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.

0.916700	I believe that I have a relatively good understanding of many medical terms and conditions and the ones I don't I know how to search the internet to find the information that I need.
0.900000	I majored in biology so it's easy for me to understand health information. And on the rare occasions when I am uble to process information, I ask a lot of questions to make sure I understood the information I was given. And I also search online for information that furthers my understanding. 
0.900000	I have never experienced problems understanding health questions.I have been successful researching any conditions I need to seek medical attention for and have a large support group in the medical community 
0.916700	I feel confident reading and understanding written medical information.  I feel confident that I can understand verbal information a doctor or nurse tells me. I feel confident understanding information a pharmacist tells me. I feel confident that I ask important questions of a doctor or nurse if I am given time.  However, with some doctors and nurses I feel rushed and don't get to ask all the questions I would like to.  This happens more than I would like.
0.855600	I can usually understand most information given me and I am determined enough to make sure that doctors listen to me and that they explain things I am uncertain about. My biggest concern is that I don't always know what questions to ask. 
0.861100	I feel I am pretty competent to fill out forms and make basic decisions regarding health issues. I feel like I have enough experience in making these decisions that I would trust my judgment. 
0.900000	Given that I recently had to do research to write a paper on mR and learn lots of interesting new things about how R and D are used in cellular structures and that, in standardized testing, my written communication skills were ranked in the 96th percentile I'd have to say that the previous questions hardly apply to me. There is very little that I read aside from articles on physics that I have difficulty understanding.
0.777800	I feel a higher than normal degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information because I had to function as my own healthcare advocate when getting a cancer and precancer diagnosis. I was referred from one doctor to another so I learned really quickly to come into the office with a list of questions to ask.
0.733300	Sometimes when i see a doctor, i have a hard time processing the info. i can't ask the questions necessary to understand what is being told to me, my spouse has to be with me in the room. I believe it is because i am nervous being there, not because i don't understand them.
0.688900	I usually have no problem understanding common terms but there are sometimes foreign concepts that need explaining. Usually, the staff at hand answers all of my questions in a satisfactory manner.
0.866700	I am currently cogent and intellectually capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information.  I used to work in the health insurance industry and that work gave me some good insights into medical jargon and the red tape in getting medical care.  I also helped both my parents in the last years of their lives with vigating medical information.
0.833300	I think I understand any written material and forms I am given.  Occasiolly I have trouble asking doctors questions because I usually recall them after its too late and the appointment is over.  At that point I usually try to find the answer on the internet. 
0.833300	I feel that I have an adequate degree of confidence in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make the best decisions regarding my own health. Ive had medical problems since I was 13 so the hospital literature was what I read many many times over.
0.883300	Because of a disease I was diagnosed with over 20 years ago, I've learned a lot of terminology related to medical health.  I'm not afraid to ask my doctors questions or for thorough explations if necessary.  It's been my experience that doctors are always very willing to take the time to explain. My husband has EMT training and his knowledge helps sometimes.
0.900000	I feel i have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand my health information and services needed to make the correct health decisions. i am fully capable of reading and understanding the things about my health that are important and i am full capable of explaining my problems to a physician.
0.811100	I feel like I have the capacity to understand the information.  I feel that it is extremely difficult to either ask the right questions or get the doctor to take time to explain things in-depth.  I usually leave frustrated that I don't have the information I need to make a good decision.
0.705600	I believe I have quite the capacity to obtain. I can use the people around me, the internet, and the doctor/nurses to explain the rest. I'm not going to leave with questions still on my mind.
0.900000	I can talk to my doctor about anything that is related to my health and I know how to ask my doctor questions.
0.722200	I'm a smart guy so I have A basic grasp of what's happening but it's always better to be completely sure and not make any foolish mistakes.
0.866700	I have the ability to do so, and usually feel at ease enough with the process. I sometimes am confused, but do my best to seek answers.
0.883300	I feel that I have the general medical understanding to be able to accurately decipher health forms and information. If it is, for some reason, very complicated I do have resources to assist me. I am not afraid to ask questions of my health professiols if needed. 
0.916700	I think it's all pretty standard stuff that doesn't need too much help understanding. They usually do a good job of explaining the important details to you. If I have any issues I'll speak with them to clear it up right away.
0.872200	I have the capacity to do all of that, as long as it's out there on the internet. Medical office people usually are rushed or too busy to answer all questions or at least not to the detail I want.
0.650000	I'm kind of confident about my capacity to obtain, process and understand the basic health information and services. Based on the basic medical knowledge that I have, with the help from online searching, self-learning and the help from family members, I can understand the majority of health info, if I still have questions, I will ask the doctors/nurses until I understand it completely. 
0.800000	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information. When I have doubts I some times go online and do some research.
0.766700	I think I have a moderate ability to obtain medical information. I usually have problems that are clear cut. Except for one instance where the doctor was guessing of what the problem was.
0.722200	i will ask a doctor for anything that i need to know regarding documents that i need to sign and anything else that is needed to know or explain. 
0.916700	I am of sound mind and well researched. I know how to read and write and I can understand information or find answers on my own. But I'm not afraid to ask for help if I need it because my health is important. 
0.883300	I persolly believe that I have a high capacity of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services needed.   I do read them all and ask questions if needed be.  Seemingly when I do ask questions, I rarely get an answer to my questions.   
0.866700	I think I have a very good capacity to understand. I have studied medical terminology and I'm comfortable researching on the Internet.
0.833300	Reading and understanding health information and services is a full time job!. have trouble understanding words used in health care. In some instances, a word may be totally unfamiliar. In other cases, a word may be familiar, but the i may not understand it in a health care context. For example, upon hearing âkeep your glucose in a normal range,â people know what normal means about a person, and they may have a range in their kitchen, but they may miss the intended concept in terms of health care. Even people who understand the concept may need more information than the phrase provides. They need to be told what glucose measurements are considered normal.
0.866700	I like to think I have excellent reading and comprehension skills.  Most problems regarding the subject at hand have to do with the fact that much, if not most, of the material available is written for those who do not.
0.644400	I will do more research and ask the questions next time when I visit them.  Therefore, I will be fully understand. 
0.916700	I feel completely able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. The language of health information material tends to be in the simplest form possible while still accurately conveying the necessary information. The great majority of health care professiols that I have dealt with make a point of assuring themselves that I understand the information necessary for decision making. They also invite questions. 
0.583300	When I do not get all the information that I need I usually go to the internet for any missing or additiol information I might need. The health industry has gotten a lot more complicated in all levels of health. From making simple appointments to diagnosing, to the right health care needs and all of the complications with insurance , how to pay and how much health care cost. The healthcare industry is overwhelming and that is an understatement. If someone needs an example of a broken system all they need to do is look at the healthcare industry. 
0.811100	I feel like I can handle health information  pretty well.  I have been to hospitals before though with others  mostly, and am usually the one who reads all the paperwork.  I also know where to look for more information.
0.800000	I've only got a college education, but despite my setback, I DO understand basic health questions that I'm asked, and can explain what I'm feeling to a medical professiol. The only real problem lies in actually communicating my issues, instead of just passively letting them go unmentioned. However, I certainly know how to fill out forms and talk to doctors and nurses, and I can read the abbreviations on my prescription labels. 
0.511100	I do not have the full capacity to do those things. I have a caretaker that helps me with these things. 
0.850000	I feel that most of the time I'm aware of what's going on with my medical issues and can communicate that to the medical personnel that I interact with. I do research online to supplement what I learn during appointments as well as to find more information on issues that may not be significant enough to take up a lot of appointment time. Occasiolly I have to interact with a medical professiol who seems to not be paying attention (or seems to dislike me), and I do find that frustrating and tend to not communicate very well in those situations. But overall, I feel pretty confident in my ability to understand and communicate about my medical issues.
0.700000	I have basic knowledge of health issues, but I have difficulty understanding complex concepts and advanced language about health issues
0.883300	Fortutely, I have very few to no health issues. However, I'm very web knowledgeable, and also have friends / relations in the health industry. I have no reservations about finding any needed material.
0.844400	I've worked in healthcare related fields for most of my life so my medical terminology is pretty good. I'd say I understand what's being told to me more than the average person. 
0.766700	I think I'm perfectly capable of understanding anything a doctor tells me, but sometimes I need to have them clarify the information for me.
0.900000	I have capacity mentally as there is nothing hindering my thinking and reasoning  ability. Moreover, I have great capacity to obtain, process and understanding the information that the doctor or nurse provides me, since the doctors and nurses answer any questions I have for them. Thy also provide any information I need.  They will go into as much detail as necessary until I understand.
0.855600	I feel like I am about as well equipped to handle medical information as anyone who is educated but not in the field of medicine. I am a college graduate so I understand complex things. I think I can pay attention, and of course it's important so I value knowing things about my medical condition.
0.716700	I feel I have a decent capacity to make health decisions. If I need help or advice, I can ask friends or family. I can also look up information on the internet, search through forums, and research what others have done when in similar situations.
0.783300	I am confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information when making health decisions. The doctors I see are very helpful and competent in explaining things when I do have questions.
0.788900	I feel almost always I can understand the core concept. Usually, when I'm reading on my conditions and come across a word or phrase I don't fully grasp, I break it down to the basic components piece by piece until I understand it. From doing this awhile ago, It has become easier to pick up on things about my health.
0.850000	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision. It is very likely that resort to more than one opinion and seek out someone to consult with before filizing a decision. 
0.916700	If I don't understand something, I will seek out an answer, preferably from the doctor directly if involving medical situations. I may seek out a second opinion, do independent research, and talk to others. 
0.838900	I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make an appropriate decisions because the information I receive from my physician/nurse, I usually take that information and do my research. I not only research information that is pertaining to my condition in the US, but in other countries.
0.916700	I always prepare ahead of time before seeing my PCP. I take my notes with me and she always asks me, at the end of our time together, if I have asked all the questions I want to ask. I feel secure in my ability to understand my doctors instructions, her answers to my questions, and I feel secure in making health decisions for myself. However, If I have any doubts, and certainly before I make any major decisions such as possible surgery, I always consult my oldest daughter, and if necessary, my other children as well. 
0.888900	I understand the basic terms health professiols use. Whenever they use a term that I'm not familiar with, I feel capable of asking them to clarify it in terms that I understand.
0.850000	I feel I have a good understanding of medical terminology, and when in doubt I always ask my medical practitioner, or do some online research. 
0.655600	i just need  Basic or simple consent entails letting the me know what i would like to do; giving basic information about the procedure; and ensuring that i patient assents or consents to the intervention.
0.594400	I think as long as the information is simple I can understand it. I hate when doctors give you the medical term that I cannot pronounce or spell. I try to ask as many questions as possible.
0.883300	Basic health information is easy. Some of it is common sense. The technical stuff I can get from the internet. The doctor's recommendation is just opinion until I can get it verified. 
0.916700	I feel I am excellent at obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. If I have a question after I leave the office I know who to call for answers. I always ask questions of the nurse or doctor while in the office if I feel I do not understand what is part of the treatment or medication. I read medication leaflets and call the doctor with questions.
0.777800	I choose a doctor after going through online reviews. I make sure that the doctor is an expert in the corresponding field of medicine and has many years of experience. When the doctor prescribes a medicine, I make sure to understand the purpose of the medicine. Also, I go through the leaflet that arrives with each medicine to understand the side-effects of the medicine. I also ask the doctor whether I can heal without the medicine or whether it is mandatory that I take medicine to recover from an illness. If I feel that the doctor is being dishonest, I don't bother to buy the medicines prescribed.
0.827800	I think I have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. My medical practitioner often explain any health reviews or concerns to me in a simpler form. Anything I truly don't understand, I would ask for an explation right away. Sometimes there's medical information that I don't mentally process until later, which leaves me with many unswered questions. When that happens, I can utilize the internet, speak to my mother or best friend (they're both nurses), or call the clinic the following day to gain more information. I have many options to help me feel secure.
0.788900	I think I can understand most things if they are presented in layman's terms.  If I can't I know I can research things on the internet to get a better idea.
0.883300	100%. I'm completely comfortable in these areas. 
0.916700	I believe I have a well developed capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information, and to take advantage of services, where applicable, to make appropriate health decisions.  The problem for me is not one of being able to understand materials, issues, and choices, it is about making the best choice with the available information, which is sometimes lacking, ambiguous, disjointed, incomplete, or even biased and perhaps incorrect.   I frequently consult with other health professiols when forming judgments about health decisions, and almost always benefit in the long term from doing so.
0.850000	I can do some things on my own, some others I need help with. It's not always that I could understand medical terms and instructions but I try my best. I access websites, contact my doctor, ask my family, and I just try to be patient when dealing with information.
0.900000	I have the capacity to obtain & understand the information unless there are some medical jargons or procedures that need further explation from them.
0.900000	I believe that I have a high degree of ability to obtain, process, and understand the information that I need to make the best health decisions for myself. I read a lot and have a great interest in the subject of health, so doing this is nothing new for me.
0.888900	I have a bachelors degree in Clinical Laboratory Science and I currently work in a genetics laboratory so I feel very confident that I can understand basic health information. Before working here, I worked at a hospital for 10 years and then at a physician's office for a couple of years. I also take yearly courses in the laboratory science to satisfy my CEU requirements for my state laboratory license.   I also feel very confident that I can make appropriate decisions about what services I may need.  If there is anything I don't understand about a condition I have the knowledge to search for the appropriate information and the mental capacity to sift through to gather correct information.  
0.727800	I feel in most situations I am able to understand and process the information that I am given in regards to my health.  There are times though when I do have to ask the doctor or nurse to explain what they are saying to me again to make sure that I understand exactly.
0.777800	these days I feel that I am more educated about health information, as I am seeking the information before and after I visit a doctor to get a better understanding of my case and to integrate the information I get from the doctor with what I can do to help myself as well.
0.766700	I am a graduate student, so I think I have a fairly high level of comprehension and am able to quickly research answers whenever I am unsure of something. However, as I come from a family with a lot of medical professiols, I often second guess things way too much and have difficulty actually making decisions without consulting others.
0.883300	I think I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions completely. I rarely have any issues when filling out health documents or understanding a medical condition or forms. If I do have any questions, they are always answered and I understand them before leaving.
0.600000	I understand the basic medical conditions and the basic forms provided for medical purpose but when not explained clearly make it difficult for me to understand. I need to discuss then with someone who clearly has the knowledge of it to make me feel better about what was expressed. 
0.916700	I have no doubts in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed.  I make all of the decisions regarding my health.
0.866700	im young and i have the patience and the knowledge to be able to deal with anything medical related 
0.888900	I have a family doctor whom we go to for any health issues and medical checkup. I will consult her if I need help in understanding the information. If the information is not too complicated, I will google and read more about it to get further information.
0.661100	I feel I'm well versed and educated enough to ask the questions necessary to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  The issue that comes up most often is an unwillingness to ask the necessary questions; or at times it is difficult to recall all the details of my own medical history given that I do not hold all of the relevant records and information.  My medical history is either held by my doctors or in some instances by my mother. 
0.844400	I think that I have the full capacity to understand basic health information. If there is anything that I don't, I know that I can ask my doctor or nurse, or do my own research to further clarify anything.
0.900000	I have access to  most if not all the information I need .. my health care  providers have always answered my questions.
0.672200	I think that I can understand basic health decisions but more info on advantage illnesses when they occur or am told about them. I can gain more knowledge through them and the internet
0.900000	I feel I understand it quite well. If I have a question I don't hesitate to ask someone. Some of it can be confusing at times, always ask if uncertain. So far in me life I have had no problems understanding and processing health information.
0.761100	It depends on the nurse/doctor helping me, some explain things in a hard way to understand. I feel that I have the capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, although it can be a complicated subject to understand the basics are pretty understandable.
0.900000	I believe I have a good degree of competency to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services as to making quality decisions. Having had some prior medical conditions, I am somewhat experienced to the scerios described in the prior questions. Overall, I am pretty confident dealing with various sources of health information and services but will certainly ask or research myself for better clarity/understanding if something is unclear or I need information about how something should be properly done. 
0.588900	I can do my best.  I know english obviously however there are ideas and concepts I may be missing out on.  An experts time and input is appreciated.
0.794400	There is an Internet to search for the information (i.e. medical terms, conditions, symptoms, ... etc..) and knowledge to read and learn. My physician will explain my illness and the treatments options when the tests results came out. Of course, I may ask any questions to my doctor. There are plenty of doctors to let you have the second opinion. I believe that most of people can make appropriate health decisions as long as you have a clear mind and know how to read and write because everyone concerns about their health conditions very much unless they give up.  
0.644400	I have limited capacity to obtain health information because it depends on others. I can process and understands basic health information especially if provided in layman's terms.
0.844400	I'm fairly confident that I have the capacity to understand basic health information. Sometimes I get anxiety when trying to talk to health professiols so I may not ask everything I want to or clearly explain things.
0.900000	I like to read about medical issues so I am used to the medical terms. I don't need any help.
0.855600	I feel fairly confident that when I see medical professiols, I am getting the information I need specific to my situation. If there are areas I am unclear on, I try to ask questions to help myself understand. Thankfully I have the ability to contact them after the fact if there is something I didn't have fully explained while at an appointment.
0.861100	I am only 30 so I am capable of reading and doing research on the internet of people with similar problems. I also am able to view the different literature and opinions to find the appropriate health decisions.
0.844400	With the internet, I have so much access to information that I feel like I could always find a source that made sense to me.  If one trusted website is a little over my head, I'm sure I could find another that made more sense to me.
0.855600	if i dont understand something i usually just pull it up on my phone. i dont try to look for anything other than what it means, i then if i dont know exactly i ask the doctor or look for more indepth info
0.705600	I ask anything I do not understand. My doctors and nurses are informative and helpful.
0.916700	I believe I have a high degree of ability in regard to basic health information. I understand quickly, feel comfortable asking for clarification and am able to research on my own if need be.
0.788900	I think I can do it just fine. I am a native English speaker and I also currently work for a company that provides health services anyway.
0.577800	I think I can process the information fairly well, I'm not a doctor but I do like to know the medication I'm receiving and I will do research about it online.
0.916700	I feel I have the adequate knowledge to understand what the doctors//nurses tell me. If I do not understand something, I have them elaborate more on it, so I do understand. Otherwise, I am pretty good at understanding the medical reports given to me.
0.883300	I am able to understand my condition because if I have any questions, I will ask them. I will look to a doctor's treatment plan as a recommendation but not as the only option. Once diagnosed with something, I will research the condition on my own and see all of the alternatives. I will search for cases very similar to my own and look for information about how others treated this condition most successfully. I will not just follow what a doctor says without researching for myself. 
0.916700	I have the capacity to listen carefully and to try my best to interpret what the information means to me personally. If I do not understand I will ask to have it explained in more detail. I also am in touch with reality and what is or is not possible as far as medical treatment. In other words I tend to keep unrealistic expectations in check.
0.883300	I have an environmental engineering background so am comfortable reading about technical issues.  I am also an inquisitive person so I am comfortable researching topics. 
0.650000	I am a person that tends to read a lot about health issues. Not only do I talk to octors but I also o my own research that way I can understand at least the basics when it comes to meical terms. That way I can make better decisions.
0.916700	I am an intelligent and discerning person capable of understanding medical explanations, I have a mature understanding of biology, physiology, and medicines, and am highly confident that I can learn and utilize my skills to obtain any pertinent knowledge that I should have regarding my own health and diseases.
0.827800	I think I have the basics pretty much down. I can understand most concepts, I am able to fill out forms without anyone else and I make sure to clarify with the doctor when I need to. I am confident in my ability to make appropriate health decisions
0.916700	I think I'm capable of understanding what my doctor says, reading provided information, and asking followup questions as needed. I'm also capable of doing internet research and asking my doctor questions about the relevance of what I found. Overall I feel I'm able to make appropriate health decisions.
0.866700	I think I can do this very well. I have done it in the past to great success. I think if I had any trouble grasping it, I could get clarification from a professional or online myself. It wouldn't be too hard to get obtain, process, and understand basic health info. 
0.833300	I think a have a good capacity to understand what health informations, I always ask my doctors to explain everything I want to know and I also do research.
0.883300	I know how to find the answers to my questions if I have any via web, medical professionals and friends. 
0.916700	At or above the level that a non medical professional can.
0.827800	I have all or most of the necessary abilities in terms of being able to understand what's being communicated to me. However, my issue is more that, sometimes, I do not seek medical advice because I have other priorities. Alternatively, I really value my privacy and might feel like I do not want others telling me how to act, regardless of their expertise. 
0.916700	I'm very confident. I worked as a surgical tech for 10 years and have a degree in biology so I'm well versed in medical research and how to understand it and comfortable with medical terminology.
0.872200	I feel very capable of locating any health-related information I desire. I have been using the internet since the mid-1980s (yes, it did exist at that time but was mostly available only to certain companies, government agencies and universities) so I have a lot of experience with it. I am also VERY willing to rely on my own research to question my doctor's advice or even disregard it in favor of something that I think makes more sense.
0.916700	I am positive I have the capacity to understand and process basic health information and even beyond that to make appropriate health decisions. I am a registered nurse working towards my master's and am confident I understand what my doctor tells me 100% of the time.
0.627800	I think I have just about average ability. Sometimes the information is overwhelming. Sometimes when I ask logical questions about things that do not make sense, the answer I get it medical science does not work logically. I question and read about what my health interests are but in the end chose to listen to the doctor even though I may not agree as they are the experts.
0.844400	I think I have access through friends, the internet, and acquaintances in the medical field, to get help understanding most situations I might encounter. I think that while some of this information might not be totally accurate it may give me some more context when seeking medical information.
0.827800	I feel I have quite a capacity. Ultimately, no matter how professionally trained a doctor is, your health is your own responsibility and no one will care about it as much as you. Given this motivation, it isn't hard to believe that I would do the requisite research. 
0.916700	I feel extremely capable of understanding basic health information because I have done a lot of research throughout my life about various health issues so most of the information is not foreign to me. They are things that I already have a small amount of knowledge on.
0.811100	I think that I have a good ability to do this. Both me and my wife are very good at doing research online. We are also very open and up front about asking questions and being very thorough. By using all of these traits and skill I feel that I am very equiped to get all the info I need to make health decisions.
0.916700	I know and am confident I can understand everything health related; if there is something I do not understand, I have no problem asking a health professional to explain it to me
0.916700	I think I have the intelligence to handle any medical terms. I'm also good at researching, so anything I don't understand I will look up. I don't hesitate to ask questions. I will also get a second opinion on whatever my GP tells me from a close friend who is a doctor in another state. I will also question him about anything I'm not clear about.
0.616700	If I am interested in a not very serious illness then I look for information in the internet, but I always seek advice from the doctor is the condition is somewhat more serious.
0.900000	The internet is a big factor in staying informed. People tend to overestimate a doctor's knowledge. Much information can be found on the internet about basic medical info.
0.833300	I can understand health information. I research anything I want to know on my own and I find that most doctors are just crap shooting and don't really know or care to help. I make decisions on my own based on what I feel is right for me. 
0.866700	Im well educated and smarter than the average bear.  Im also willing to ask for clarification (or do my own research) if something is unclear.
0.916700	I have been in situations where I needed to find out as much info as possible and I did. I have also been the person that was needed to get the info for someone else, so I know that I will ask about anything I am not sure of and that I can research and question the Dr's based on that research. 
0.883300	I have lots of resources to understand the health information I need. I simply ask my medical providers questions and they tend to answer them in depth. I tend to do research on the internet before a doctor's visit and I write down my question in advance. I also signed up to have access to my medical records/lab results online. I have researched my lab results (numbers) to get a better understanding of my health.
0.900000	I have a smartphone and a computer at my disposal. Any and everything that a Dr or nurse says is completely researchable and verifiable on the internet or in books.
0.850000	I am usually pretty good at keeping pace with medical forms. If I have a question I simply ask. If jargon is used I am not familiar with I just google it.
0.916700	I feel that my capacity/ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information/services to make appropriate health decisions is more than sufficient. I have no problem digesting even relatively complex information about health issues, symptoms, treatment. If I have any questions about information, I have no problem whatsoever communicating with the relevant health care provider in order to obtain any needed clarification. I am also rather vigilant about communicating any questions or concerns I may have when I don't understand information being relayed to me by a provider, as well as when informing them about my own issues or various respective symptoms. I don't know what else to say. The process is pretty clear to me & in the odd exception that it's not, the process of how to obtain clarification is clear. 
0.872200	I feel like I could understand and process any basic health information to make appropriate decisions involving my health. If for some reason I couldn't initially understand I am confident I can find resources or help that would enable me to properly understand health information and services. On some issues I would probably know more than any medical personnel I talk to.
0.738900	I have the internet. It can help me understand anything. 
0.633300	I feel like I am very capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information.
0.761100	based on prior research i think i can properly understand the basics.  i feel that my doctors and my own research helps me with this endeavor
0.827800	I feel like I have a high degree of capability to obtain and understand health information. There are an array of different resources available, in addition to being able to speak with my doctor or get a second opinion. 
0.883300	I think I have enough of a knowledge base to make informed opinions about my condition after doing some research and consulting with my doctor. If I have questions when my doctor is explaining something I make sure to ask them. I usually do my own research and ask the doctor what they think about my conclusions. 
0.655600	I feel like I have an above average capacity to understand basic health information but I need help occasionally with prescriptions. Lymphoma is more complicated than a google search, so I have to ask my doctor how to deal with it.
0.733300	I think I can process basic health information for basic health decisions. But more complicated stuff probably not, I'd just have to trust whatever the doctor said. 
0.638900	I feel that I have a medium capacity to obtain, understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel comfortable with my basic medical knowledge and problem solving skills to make the correct health decisions on my own.
0.644400	I have had a grandfather who had a lot of health issues and helped him with his forms and dealing with the doctor. I also have a couple of health related issues that I have had to deal with so I understand most of what I learn.
0.850000	Well, if anything is confusing to me, I can just ask a doctor or a nurse. I can also use the vast internet to find answers to my questions as well as find people online to discuss medical issues/decisions that I might be faced with -- people who face the same things. I can seek advice from those people. For the most part, I am confident I can and do understand information relevant to my health.
0.777800	I think I am pretty capable of understanding basic health information. There are many resources online that can help clear up and misconceptions with medical terminology.
0.900000	I can look up symptoms online and hazard a guess but I understand that I can't do much more than guess. Information given to me by doctors and nurses I tend to trust but if I'm still not certain I will look up further information for myself online. I wouldn't have access to any specialized machines to try to diagnose myself so for that at least I'm completely reliant on health professionals. Things like blood tests, urine flow test, cultures etc.
0.900000	I think I am able to obtain a good deal of information on my own.  Searching the internet can be scary when it comes to health topics, but I do feel it is useful in getting broad ideas.  I also am not afraid to ask questions of health professionals.  I do know that not being able/willing to ask questions has been an issue for others in my family.
0.916700	I feel like I have a basic understanding. If I don't get a basic understanding or if something is confusing I'm fine with asking questions. It I'm still unable to understand there's always Google and a billion people who have the same exact questions as I do so its fairly easy to figure out what something means if you have internet access.
0.711100	I think that I have what it takes to understand the information given to me by my doctor. But there are still times when it is a bit cloudy in trying to understand all the variables. When I don't completely understand the information, I either go to an online forum or ask a friend. 
0.866700	I feel I have a good ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information so I can make health decisions. I have never run into a problem at my doctor's office or medical facility where I was confused about any particular thing.
0.538900	It's pretty good, I don't think I need too much help. It's fine.
0.811100	I think I have a pretty good capacity to do this. I'm competent and can research things I'm not familiar with. 
0.844400	I understand most and if I don't, I will google it and look up information to be sure I get all in the information i need and want and make sure I understand it all.  I will always research any kind of medical issue I may have and will question my dr. if my research and their opinions differ.  I want to be sure I get the best medical care I can with all the information I can gather about medical/health issues.
0.888900	I feel that I am informed enough, and I feel in tune with how I feel with my body. I am always asking questions If I feel I don't understand something, or want to know more about a respective issue. I feel certain I can care for myself.
0.900000	I feel very confident in my ability to understand health information. The internet is a wonder resource to learn more about health information and services pertaining to my health decision. I still believe a doctor should be your number one source and you shouldn't believe or trust everything you read online.
0.916700	I'm fully competent in deciding what is best for me pertaining to my health 
0.888900	I think I'm educated and knowledgeable enough to understand the health information given to me generally. I'm health conscious, exercise and take supplements which I look into. I think my knowledge through experience and that I've picked up through life is sufficient.
0.900000	I have good ability
0.872200	I am mentally capable. I research more than the average person on medical care and medications.
0.916700	I have access to the internet and can look up information. I can ask doctors for a second opinion. I am very skeptical and cautious in general. I also believe that having a medical degree doesn't automatically make you any more intelligent than the average person and certainly doesn't make you the alpha and omega of medical knowledge. Like in all fields and occupations, there are mediocre people.
0.783300	I think I can obtain the most extensive information from my personal doctor. I fully trust him because he has been my doctor for my entire life. 
0.872200	I think I can make appropriate health decisions because I'm always willing to ask questions and if I don't personally agree with a treatment option, I challenge it or get a second opinion. It's my health, and I have the right to ensure I'm getting the best possible care. 
0.566700	I would consider so important information and some people advice 
0.900000	I have no problem understanding complex information.
0.900000	i feel confident about it. mostly because i also research my symptoms before going to the doctor, so i have a general understanding of what it might be.
0.900000	The internet is my main source of health information and tracking as I do not really have reliable health care. I feel I'm fairly lucky with my health, all things considered
0.844400	Health topics are something I research all the time on the internet. If it is something that directly affects me, I have a tendency to do a lot of research on the internet about the subject. I will consider alternative medical treatments along with what the medical establishment recommends.
0.755600	I am very capable of understanding. I like to ask questions and know what is going on. I don't go to the doctor often, but when I do I find out everything that I possibly can. I like to ask about medications and if I should take them all the time or not. I like to go for physicals and have my blood drawn and tested. I like knowing the results of my blood work and if something is wrong I ask questions.
0.844400	I eel that I am very well capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information. Perhaps it's a mix of my intelligence and the knowledge I already have mixed with having good luck in the information being explained to me in an easy way. 
0.650000	I can make basic decisions on my own. However, it is good to get reassurance from the nurse and doctors. Basically being able to use common sense is how I would approach it. 
0.916700	I feel that all of the forms that you have to fill out are pretty self-descriptive. I've never had any kind of problems understanding anything - they almost over explain things on the forms so you know exactly what you are getting into or what you are diagnosed with.
0.694400	I believe I understand most things, sometimes I get frustrated when filling out forms regarding insurance information because I don't fully understand that sort of thing.
0.794400	I think I'm okay at it. I am sometimes quite distracted because children come with me to several appointments and my main focus is usually on them. Beyond that, I'm confident enough to ask questions to make sure I understand things. 
0.916700	I know that I can ask questions of my health care provider and that they will answer me. If I am unsure if something I will ask them to clRify. I also know the terminology in medical papers enough to understand what I am agreeing to. I am in control but I must ask the questions.
0.550000	My parents raised me to understand things that I read. I am very educated and I can learn to do things on my own without other peoples help.
0.866700	I feel like I have all the tools for my basic health information. I can call to obtain, and I can also go online and access a lot of my medical information. I think it's so easy to access this information.
0.572200	I feel I am still young and healthy, and my health problems are not yet complicated or severe that would be hard to understand. I am also very smart even though im not overly familiar with medical topics so that helps 
0.672200	I feel I have the capacity to understand and retain most basic health information. It is harder to retain services as I live in America where health is expensive and hard for anyone that is not rich.
0.811100	"I would give myself a ""B+"".  I understand just about everything, but when they start using very medicals terms / lingo I may start to not understand as well.  Sometimes I do not like to ask because I think it may make me look stupid, but I should not care because it is my health we are discussing."
0.466700	I feel like with the terms and complicated medical lingo, I am not exactly sure what some of the meanings entail. Such as If I am diagnosed with a certain condition and need medication X, I don't know what that medication does, what the alternatives are, I don't even know how to pronounce some of these names. I feel like I am able to ask the doctors but can not fully grasp the magnitude of the situation without looking at the whole picture which is difficult to have someone explain to me in one visit. I feel like I need  a step by step diagnostic, of why this happened, what I can do, what the consequences are, what some definitions of the disease are, etc. 
0.788900	I have worked on the administration side of healthcare for about 10 years. I work with medical terminology on a daily basis so I feel quite comfortable and have people to ask. 
0.916700	"I've been with my doctor for about 10 years and I trust him completely. I feel very open and honest with him. I tell him everything and do not fear judgment when I ask a ""stupid"" question."
0.861100	I've never felt like it's been a problem. I haven't had a lot of issues filling out paperwork for various things, but I haven't needed to all that often (knock on wood). When I did, it was pretty straightforward. I'd leave things blank if I had to.
0.883300	The doctor I visit is clear in anything he tells me. Any questions about medications or symptoms are answered in a way that I can understand.  I have not run in to a situation where left the office being confused about something.
0.605600	I believe that I have the capabilities to make health decisions for many reasons. First off, the internet is so big today and full of information that anybody can go there to get valuable information on any topic.
0.827800	I think that I have the capacity to understand health information and services. The doctors I see are helpful and informative, and so are their staff members. I usually find health information pretty clear and easy to understand, but if I do need help, I know there is someone I can go to.
0.888900	I feel like I am able to understand everything that I need in order to make informed decisions about my health and whatever choices or options I need to make related to them. I don't require assistance from others to understand.
0.488900	I feel very unconfident. It's an unfamiliar environment and unfamiliar forms to me. Often I'm nervous anyways about being sick and my health declining so I do not think of questions I should ask at that time. I would want a friend or family member to accompany me or have assistance from personnel in filling out forms and documents before seeing the doctor. Often I'm in a rush to get in and get out so I don't take time to ask questions
0.916700	I think I have a fine capacity.  I am able to coherently explain my concerns, and ask for aid if I need it.  I am native in English, and know all my health issues and past surgeries and such.  It isn't hard for me to do anything medical, and I am confident in making whatever medical decisions I need to make.
0.850000	I feel I have a pretty good grasp on understanding the various aspects of healthcare. I make sure to read materials thoroughly and, like with contracts, I always make sure to read fine print and ask questions about things I do not understand. The internet allows me to do basic research on things I might need to ask or clarify. I trust my doctors to provide me with the proper information and I trust them to explain things to me in terms that I can understand.
0.866700	I feel like a have a high degree ob ability to obtain and understand the necessary information. Occasionally my memory and reading comprehension will be much lower than average, and I require some help to get through things.
0.833300	With the internet these days it's usually not too hard to figure something out if the front desk is too busy. I had testicular cancer a few years back and practically lived at the Urologists. I figured out what most of their doctor words meant pretty quickly. 
0.850000	I feel very comfortable when dealing with my own medical concerns and obtaining the correct information. I have studied Exercise Science in college and spent a lot of my time during college going to the doctors on my own so I learned quickly what was expected of me and of the doctors to make sure I understood everything and took care of my health properly.
0.705600	i think that i do. i graduated college and i have known english all my life. i have taken many english courses
0.866700	Well, I have the internet available as a tool if I find myself in any confusion regarding a diagnosis, medicine dosage, symptoms, side-effects, etc.  My sister-in-law is in the medical field as well, and can explain things.
0.850000	I think I am able to get all of the information that I need, although sometimes I can not think of what to ask until after the fact. Also at times, I may not completely understand what the doctor or nurse is saying, but I trust their diagnosis and directions for the most part. 
0.794400	I feel completely sure of being able to carry out a success with these approaches, without a doubt I can do it with all certainty
0.888900	I've been in and out of hospitals my entire life, having numerous medical conditions since I was young. I've been filling out and reading medical forms ever since I was able to do so (around 16 or 17, I believe) If I ever don't understand something, I simply ask until I do.
0.722200	When it comes to just myself I am confident that I can make the right decisions. Sometimes I may forget my insurance plan numbers or something else but I can definitely ask questions without issue. So even if I am unsure or confused I have no problem making sure I understand before I leave. 
0.900000	I believe I am able to understand the health information I need to to make appropriate decisions. I can read well and have an educational background in health sciences. I also know how to use the Internet to look up information.
0.883300	I feel I have all the options and services I need to make appropriate health decisions.  I often ignore going to the doctor because they don't value my time and make we wait too long in the waiting room
0.900000	I feel that I am above average at processing health information.  I know what to ask when I am unsure about something.  I have a degree in nursing, so I understand almost everything that I encounter related to my health.
0.827800	I am pretty confident that I am capable of understanding and processing basic health information and services. I tend to do my research on my own to better understand medication conditions, which helps me with make the necessary decisions.
0.716700	I think with technology the way it is now, I have much better access to information that can help me understand what i need to make decisions.
0.738900	I feel I know enough to assess my health. I do a lot of research, and I seek info on things I don't understand. Any sudden changes to my help usually prompts a call to my doctor. I have a great doctor; she explains everything in great detail for me. Usually it's no big deal, but she appreciates the concern I have for my health.
0.672200	I feel that If I am unable to figure something out than either my wife or possibly a close friend who is a registered nurse is always there if I have questions or flat out just don't understand what I am looking at
0.888900	I am able to understand most health information and am confident that I can research and learn things that I do not already know when it comes to health information. It is all well within my ability to know.
0.527800	In order to get the good health it would be very good and nice of it.It would be very good getting a good health is very important one it would be very important in life fo it
0.772200	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand health information to a significant degree. This confidence comes from the availability of almost anything I need to understand health conditions via the Internet. I can read about health information through my insurer, my care provider, and third-party sites. 
0.883300	I feel like I am adequately prepared to understand and assess all of the information that I am presented with. I am not afraid to ask questions or to let people know that I don't understand what I am being presented with. In order to ensure that I get the best possible health care, it is essential for me to ask questions and have things explained to me so that I can properly care for myself and make decisions about my life. 
0.777800	I believe I have a good understanding of health information. Sometimes, doctors try to give a lot of information at one point, but I believe I can understand what they are saying. This is helped by having written material as well. 
0.438900	Health literacy includes numeracy skills. For example, calculating cholesterol and blood sugar levels, measuring medications, and understanding nutrition labels all require math skills. Choosing between health plans or comparing prescription drug coverage requires calculating premiums, copays, and deductibles.

0.805600	I feel that I have the same level of understanding of the medical system as the average person. A lot of things that are written or said by doctors are in their own language, and they sometimes forget that they need to put things in normal terms for people to understand them. Forms can be confusing, mostly it is just the way some questions are worded and you have to get clarification on what they are exactly wanting from you.
0.872200	I am a literate, college educated adult. I believe I am fully capable of completing health forms, communicating with health professionals and making decisions about my health care. Of course there are always those times where I leave an appointment and realize I forgot to ask a question or when I think of a question after I have left an appointment. 
0.600000	Average, I think. If there's something I don't understand, I'll research it myself or ask someone with the medical knowledge I need. Sometimes there's a need for a second opinion, and I generally go with gut-instinct about which advice to follow.
0.633300	Regarding all the questions you just answer to whether you feel you have the capacity to obtain process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions - To some degree I feel like I can do that and usually it just requires knowledge of language and information.

I have access to the internet and to people who can help me when needed.

0.794400	I believe I can adequately obtain help understanding,  and processing basic health information and services.  I've had an injury in the past where if something wasn't clear to me there was an employee explaining anything needed.

0.872200	I am fully capable of making decisions and processing health related information. I am clear with what my problems are and ask questions when needed. I understand all health information given to me, so there is no need for me to ask for assistance.

0.577800	I feel I have a fairly good ability to obtain information and process it however at times it is really not that easy to do so.

0.638900	I think I have a decent grasp on how to navigate the health industry. The Terminology is confusing at times but I think I can understand for the most part. 
0.916700	I believe I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services. I have maintained a healthy lifestyle and do not have any health problems. I have done so by listening to my doctor when I have been sick or had complications with certain things.
0.638900	I think I can handle it with a little help, there is always the option to ask for help, specially from the doctors and nurses, and based on all the info I can take an appropriate health decision.

0.916700	I feel I am 100% capable to obtain, process and understand basic health information. my career is part of the healthcare field and therefore I feel I have a very good base knowledge that others may not possess. I think in most cases I am able to ask appropriate questions in order to make good health deciions
0.916700	I think I have as much capacity as anyone could have.  I hardly ever get sick and have never had a major illness luckily.  Neither has my daughter.  I can easily fill out forms for myself or my daughter when needed.  We are very fortunate to be extremely healthy and very rarely do we need the services of a doctor.

I am able to most fully understand what forms say and the information that is provided to me when talking about any problems that I may be having with my health. Although sometimes I am unable to fully understand or fill out forms, when explained to, I generally end up understanding everything after I get some help. 
0.655600	As long as there is someone around who can help me if needed, even if everything seems very simple, I will usually have the confidence to understand and correctly fill out forms. The approachability of the nurse or doctor helps with the ability to ask questions that are needed.
0.488900	In general, I know some information and details about the health related services. It could be improve my knowledge. I want seen many information about the health related service. I take more time in google search for this kind of information. 
0.555600	I always feel when I go to my doctor that they really do not seem to care about what is going on with me, therefore they do not really explain all the details on what I need to do t make my condition better. Or they just give me the run of the mill answer, not really getting to the root of the problem.
0.827800	I feel like I am more than capable of understanding health information myself, but doctors and nurses often underestimate me or don't give me all the information. I frequently find myself googling conditions or medications to get more information. Many doctors and nurses I've seen have been condescending to me, which has made me feel uncomfortable asking questions, so I have to seek out the information myself.
0.861100	For myself, I feel fully capable of understanding all basic health information at all times. If I do not udnerstand something, I make it a point to get in contact with the most appropriate professional who is qualified to answer my questions; it is not difficult to do so.

0.544400	I feel very comfortable that I am able to understand basic health services.  Although sometimes services may be unclear, and the doctors diagnoses may bring about some confusion, I am generally able to understand and comprehend my illness and how to work other health services.  A lot of the times instructions are not entirely clear which also causes confusion.  This is probably my biggest issue.  Also, the handwriting of physicians is awful and makes it really hard to understand what they are trying to tell you.  Overall, I am confident in my ability to understand basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.888900	Yes, I am a capable adult human being that can understand medical procedures and issues.I am also very confident in my abilities to google anything I am unsure of.
0.750000	I feel as if I have the capacity, but sometimes not the time to look up certain terms. I am still occasionally shy as well about interacting with healthcare professionals because I am not used to it which makes me hesitant to sometimes clarify things on the spot.
0.600000	For the most part I have the necessary skills and means to understand and process information that is told or presented to me. Depending on my mental state I might need someone else to look over it or ask important questions for me.
0.900000	I feel like I do. In August I was diagnosed with epilepsy, so in the past 6 months I have visited a neurologist, as well as had an MRI/ Cat Scan performed. I had no issues regarding the info I was given. If I do not understand something, I will ask questions.
0.861100	I think that my father did a pretty good job in all of my doctor's visits as a child to be able to understand what to do during visits so that I'd be able to go by myself when I got old enough. In general, I know my family's history and some of the specific issues that I want to double check with my doctor to make sure there are no issues there (cancer and heart issues). I know enough about services for the one issue I have with colitis and can adequately ask about that. I know where to go on the internet to get more information if something is unclear to me.
0.900000	I feel I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.916700	I have grown up around doctors and hospitals. My mother was very sick when I was a child. It makes it where I am use to the lingo and feel very confident in my ability to understand what doctors are saying.
0.883300	As long as I am clear and understand what they are telling me I'm okay.  If I have questions I am not afraid to ask because if I do not I can not make an enducated decision.
0.811100	I definitely have the capacity. I have a moderately high level of understanding of what I'm read and am told, and I have the agency to be able to make my own decisions about my health.
0.872200	I feel like I am very well equipped to gather and process all of the information that I need regarding health issues and services.  I have a fair amount of doing it for issues I myself or family members have encountered, and I've been quite successful.
0.827800	I can understand basic health information very well. I sometimes need to do further reading on my own at home to get a full understanding. I don't make the doctor explain everything in detail, I can easily find the information on my own via the internet. 
0.900000	I feel I have a good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make appropriate health decisions. If I do not understand I ask so I do understand how to make an appropriate decision.
0.655600	I think I have a pretty good idea about it, but with the issue of insurance, it makes the whole process a lot more harrowing. I understand what doctors tell me and have a general idea of what to fill out on health forms, but there are times when that intersects with insurance and I'm at a complete loss
0.622200	I think i have a pretty good understaning of how to translate medical materials from a dr point of view to that of an average joes point of veiw without much of an issue.
0.600000	I believe I tell them enough. I do have some regrets after the appointment where I forget to tell them some detail but that results in little consequence.
0.705600	"I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions - but not always immediately.  I will often need time to ""research"" the information myself prior to making a decision.  Sometimes this results in me having to call the doctor back."
0.722200	i like the doctors that i go do. if there is anything that is in writing and i am not understanding they are willing to sit down and explain things no matter how long it is going to take then to explain. If the doctor is there and the nurse needs further help he is going to do the same thing to assist. the hospital always wants to make sure the patient is well aware of their diagnosis the medicine was was given and the amout of what needs to be taken. 
0.622200	I should probably ask more questions when interacting with my doctor. Often they seem busy and I don't want to take time away from another patient with perhaps a more urgent condition.
0.883300	I feel I have a great understanding of what I need to know, after an appointment with a medical professional. If I do not understand something, I have no problem asking for more explanation. I never leave with unanswered questions or not understanding the information given to me.
0.755600	I feel that I am very capable of processing health info and filling out the necessary forms to do so. I have no problem with the language, so I manage perfectly fine. It's important for people to communicate their health needs with their doctors at all times.
0.722200	I feel like I have the capability to understand and ask the appropriate question to ensure that I understand health information and services.

0.677800	I feel like i am able to understand most of what they tell me. If i have questions about what is happening i will ask them. Sometimes I get confused by medical terms i dont understand and will have to get them to clarify for me. If im having a procedure done i make sure i fully understand what is happening and what is suppose to happen. 
0.794400	Throughout my life, I have had some negative experiences with doctors and in hospitals, especially as regards feeling listened to, respected, and having my questions fully answered. As a result, I have become less confident over time in medical settings and often choose to look up information later on my own rather than have a dismissive or confrontational interaction, which can sometimes add more stress to an existing medical problem for me. Once I have information from trusted sources, I do feel confident exploring, understanding, and responding to it. I appreciate the expanding information available online, especially that increasingly provided by insurers.
0.666700	I feel like I'm no better than the average person at doing these things. I don't have a ton of knowledge about the medical world, but, with modern technology and customer service, I feel like I can easily solve any problems or misunderstandings.

0.838900	Sometimes I don't always ask a question for fear of sounding a bit stupid but the older I get, the more information I want regarding my health. I think I am fairly healthy except for the fact that since the age of 17 I found out I have NF1
0.766700	I feel as though I have a very good understanding of medical processes and health decisions because I do my research and know the general jargon that these professionals use. I tend to do research on things I don't understand so that I know what decisions to make.

0.633300	I feel that I my ability to understand basic health information is a 100%. I often feel that my doctors don't spend enough time explaining to me, what my condition is which makes me feel that they don't understand my condition very well at all.
0.511100	I don't really understand anything related to health information, because I have trouble understanding technical words and I rarely make healthcare decisions.
0.916700	As a retired RN, I am well versed in the field of healthcare.  I am able to research any topics or findings I am unfamiliar with and, I hold health care providers accountable for the quality of care they provide.
0.816700	I feel fully capable of obtaining the information I need to make informed decisions on my health. Having worked in the medical software profession has helped me quite a bit with it.
0.827800	I feel quite confident in my ability to understand basic health information and then use it to make health decisions.  I'm not shy about asking doctors or nurses to explain something if I want more information or feel I don't understand it.  Sometimes I might not ask all the important questions, or think of them at the appropriate time, but usually I'm okay about that.  And I find that doctors and nurses typically do a good job of explaining things anyway, which makes my role easier.
0.677800	I do have the capacity to obtain and process the information that is given to me to make appropriate health decisions. It can be sometimes confusing if the doctor doesn't explain it or uses words I do not know which makes me confused about the topic.

0.766700	When I go to the doctor I always make sure that I give and get all the information that I need.  I am able to read and understand everything that I am given and if I canât then I ask enough questions so that I am no in the dark when I get home.  If I do need help I am able to contact the doctor to have then further explain what I need.

0.811100	I feel like in general I do have that capacity. Sometimes I don't understand technical details though, which can lead to misunderstandings. I usually ask questions or for help but sometimes I am too embarrassed to do so.
0.744400	I have access to all services needed to understand my health. My doctor will answer all question and for anything i dont understand&lt; i can do a web search and there are a plethora of articles that will help me
0.577800	If you are like most people, you have opportunities to initiate difficult conversations on a frequent basis, but they probably donât really feel like âopportunitiesâ,  we are using the term âdifficult conversationsâ to convey a situation where both parties in the conversation need to stay in a relationship, the stakes are high, opinions vary and emotions may run strong. At work, situations may arise between you and your supervisor that call for you to initiate a difficult conversation. Your supervisor may be many things, but it is doubtful s/he is a mind-reader. 
0.822200	I feel like it is completely within my capacity to obtain basic health information and services. However, it is a bit more difficult to always process and understand that information. I feel like the last few times I saw a doctor, the appointment was extremely rushed, and did not allow me the time to ask all of the questions I had about the information I'd received at those appointments. My doctor gave me print-outs, which were a little helpful, but felt like a lazy way of ensuring that I was provided with the information I needed. I ended up having to do online searches at home to fully understand everything that was discussed at my appointments.
0.672200	I feel like I am adequate enough to understand health information that I receive from the hospital or a doctor. The health professional usually dumbs it down enough for me to understand it.
0.661100	Iâm the type of person who asks a lot of questions and will openly say âI donât understand any of thisâ, so assuming health professionals can answer my questions, Iâll get all the information I need. 
0.866700	I think I have the full capacity to understand basic health information. I've done a lot of reading over the years, and I'm also capable of looking things up online or on my phone if I need to understand it in plain talk and can't get my doctor to explain it.
0.666700	I feel over all I understand most of everything but when I don't feel well it's harder for me to understand things. I mean I could be tired, sick and sore. It's hard to process information at that point. It's at that point I need my wife or a nurse to help me out and explain some information to me. 
0.627800	I would say so. Doctors sometimes talk in hard to understand ways.It is some times hard to tell if it is on purpose or not. Sometimes you wonder if doctors are about numbers
0.827800	I feel confident in my ability to understand most health materials I'm given, as well as my ability to articulate concerns and ask questions.
0.855600	I feel pretty confident that I am able to understand most of what my doctors and nurses tell me in the office; If I don't , I ask, or I look it up myself
0.916700	I have no underlying issues with reading comprehension, with memory retention or with medical terminology that would preclude me from understanding basic health information provided to me by a doctor or hospital. I recently went for a physical with my doctor and was able to fully understand all her questions to me and instructions given to me. 
0.794400	As a former Nurses Assistant and Med Tech i feel i have an above average understanding of medical terminology and practices.
0.600000	I believe that nowdays we have a lot of information provided for our health. It is possible to check every symptom and to get to know if there is something wrong with your health and the ways to stop it. I think that medical advice is however very neccessary and very useful.
0.850000	Although I don't know much about the medical profession, I am typically able to grasp articulate explanations regarding the medical aspects pertinent to my well-being. If I don't understand something, I either ask for clarification or research it myself. I'm pretty bright most of the time.
0.783300	I have no problem answering or asking questions regarding my health. Growing up, my mother was a nurse so I was often around medical jargon. Even when in college, though I am not in the medical field, I enjoyed taking health and nutrition and anatomy classes. I also feel that I have the resources that if I have questions, I can speak up and find someone to help me make the most appropriated decision for my well being.
0.838900	I feel that I have enough basic knowledge to understand my health.  When I don't I either ask questions or I google information.  This lets me get more information for the next time I visit the doctor.
0.916700	I feel fairly confident in my abilities regarding health and medical information.  I ask any and all questions I need to in order to understand the information being given to me and I'm not afraid to question a doctor or nurse regarding their information.  I am eager to learn and the health and medical fields have always interested me.
0.827800	I believe that I have the mental and physical capacity to obtain, process, and understand the information and services for health decisions. However, emotionally, I often feel that I don't have the capacity, as I am often stressed when visiting a doctor's office and either forget questions or feel ashamed to ask them. Financially I also avoid going to the doctor's, so when I do go it is usually for something unrelated to the questions I have been having in my day-to-day life. 
0.794400	I feel like for the most part I can read and figure something out. Now when it comes to not knowing something I have a awesome doctor who is willing to put it in terms that I understand and who will explain it to me. Sometimes I might not understand something but I am the type of person who will research until I am able to figure it out. I feel I am probably able to process everything about 80% of the time.
0.633300	I think in the event that I interact with health professionals that I have a fairly good capacity to obtain and process basic health information. I regularly independently research from respected sources, but I tend to prefer getting information directly from health professionals I'm working with since they will have better perspective on my individual health condition.
0.872200	I feel I can get and obtain basic health information with no problem. My go to would being doing research online if I really didn't understand anything and there was not a doctor or nurse to ask questions of.

0.811100	I feel confident that I can understand basic health information I've read and heard. As for making appropriate health decisions, I feel mostly confident. If I have any questions, I feel confident in asking health practitioners questions. And I also have my mom, who is a nurse, to ask for advice.
0.916700	I don't have any problems understanding health information that is provided to me either in written form or verbally, and I can fill out my own medical forms. Also, I always ask as many questions as I need to of my health care providers.
0.594400	I feel I have an understanding of how to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. The issue I face is extracting that information from the healthcare professionals. I am very often left to google information on my own.

0.750000	I think that I have the knowledge to understand and make the correct health decisions. I am confident in the choices that I will choose to choose.
0.844400	I feel like I have the ability to understand the information provided to me by medical professionals. Sometimes, I don't give doctors all of the information or ask the questions that I want to ask. I've dealt with anxiety but am unsure of whether or not I want to get it treated. Other than that, I try to be forthcoming. I also try to be easy to deal with so as to not seem like a bother.
0.844400	I generally understand what is said to me. If I need extra help afterwards I search on the internet to find information.
0.588900	I feel like the material I read or are given are sometimes a little hard to understand. There is a lot of conflicting information on the internet that makes it hard to decipher.
0.566700	There are several resources that I rely on regarding the health related information. First, I usually do a web search when I encounter some pieces of information that I do not understand. Second, I have some friends who work in the health care domain that I can talk to. Third, I do not hesitate to ask for help from doctors or others when needed.
0.916700	Yes, I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. If there is something that I do not understand I will ask the nurse or doctor or Google the information.
0.855600	I am completely capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information in able to make appropriate decisions.  The only problem I have is when Doctors or Nurses have trouble communicating or just don't want to spend the time to answer relevant questions.  I have changed doctors for this reason.
0.872200	I try to read about health concerns I have and always ask questions of any medical professional I encounter.  I don't have problems understanding basic medical information or services that may be offered.  At this time I believe i can make all appropriate health decisions presented to me.
0.688900	I feel as though I can understand basic health information pretty well. I have some background in the medical setting so I do sometimes completely understand what they are talking about. I am more likely to look something up after I leave than ask the doctor or nurse then. 
0.605600	I usually have no difficulty at all understanding health information and health forms. Every now and then I need assistance to understand a term I have never seen before
0.727800	I believe that I have the capacity to understand basic health information quite well. In the instance that I do not understand something fully, it is usually easy to get clarification from a doctor or nurse that is working on the issue. Sometimes, it is a situation that is not cut and dry and they may not HAVE a definite answer. 
0.850000	I feel like I have the proper amount of capacity to fill out and obtain any and all health information and services that I need to make appropriate health decisions. I make sure that I'm always asking my doctors questions about my health and trying to understand completely what it is that's going on with me or what it is that I'm being diagnosed with. I always make sure that the doctors are explaining things thoroughly and if I feel like I need more information about something, I'll make sure that I'm asking them to try and explain things a little bit better to me.
0.738900	For the most part, I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I prefer to have my husband with me at all times to help fill out paperwork and digest information. This is just because it is better to have two sets of ears hearing what is going on and processing the information. We are then able to talk through the information later to make sure we both understood everything. My husband is also a lot better at thinking of questions to ask in the moment, whereas I need to process information before I can think of questions.
0.822200	After eleven years of life with type one diabetes and various other endocrine fuckery, yes, I feel I have the capacity to look information up, verify it by checking the references, and ask my pharmacist and doctor for help. I've had a lot of practice. Unfortunately at this point most of my questions are beyond my doctor and I dislike the endocrinologist available to me, so I depend on my own research skills and online communities of people with my conditions to do further research -- but that's a point beyond 'basic health information'.
0.844400	I feel pretty confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have been living with an auto-immune disease for almost 14 years and needed to do a lot of research on my own because the doctor who I was seeing when I was first diagnosed did not tell me anything about the disease. After I did some research on my own, six months after being diagnosed, I found a doctor who explained everything to me and knew how to treat my disease. 
0.855600	I am intelligent person, so I am aware of all avenues that are available in order to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. If there is not a licensed doctor or other medical person physically present where I am, any information I would need to find can easily be found on the internet.
0.916700	I believe that every person should have at least basic knowledge in health related field. Of course doctors and nurses would know more, but the final decision is always up to You, so You have to make an informed decision. If i need to learn something - i do it, no matter how hard it would be
0.916700	I feel 99 percent confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information given to me to make the right health decisions for myself. I feel comfortable communicating with my doctors and always ask them to clarify anything I'm unsure of. They're always reachable by phone. And anything I want to know more about is always online and I definitely do my due diligence in researching health related issues to give myself as much information as I can find to grasp what's going on. 
0.838900	I can completely understand and process any basic health information that I am given. My only issue is that sometimes doctors do not plainly discuss information and seem to be guessing, or at least being noncommittal to their answers to my questions. Doctors also do not seem to like to admit that they do not know something to be certain, in my experiences. 
0.916700	I feel I have a good capacity to obtain and understand the information given to me. I always explain everything that bothers me, and answer questions honestly. If a question comes up later, or I need clarification of something that was said, I call the doctor back to discuss the matter. My doctors are very good at explaining things in terms that people without a medical background can understand.
0.811100	I feel like I understand most of what doctors or nurses tell me. I feel there is enough time for to me have them clarify anything I don't understand, or I can go online afterwards to find out more details myself.
0.827800	I feel I'm intelligent enough to understand most information provided to me by my doctor. If I have a hard time understanding information, I'll rephrase my question or simply tell him I don't understand what he means. I sometimes think of additional questions after my appointment. If so, I'll usually look on the internet for answers. If I'm not confident in the information I find online, I'll call my doctor's office and ask to speak with him over the phone.
0.533300	I think I have enough information processing ability, but sometimes health information can be pretty complicated so I am not confident enough in my ability to understand complicated information. I think I will need things put into simpler terms so that I may not only understand them better, but also commit them to memory and actually learn about the information. I also have trouble making decisions for myself so I need help filling out forms and deciding how to proceed with medical decisions.
0.855600	My doctors are always to me by phone throughout the week and they do not mind answering any questions or concerns that I have. I also have a local pharmacy with knowledgeable pharmacists who are willing to answer questions and concerns about my medications. 
0.788900	I think I can do proper research online  to those decisions and also have the support for peers.  I have a great doctor to go over anything that I dont understnad.
0.916700	I am a Registered Nurse. So I am more than familiar with most things I would run into. I would not have any problems understanding
0.833300	I was involved in my mothers healthcare. Dealt with doctors and nurses and hospice. I had power of attorney over her healthcare. The american Cancer Society was very helpful. Still have lots of information, pamphlets and newsletters.
0.916700	I feel 100% confident I can get the information and services I need since I grew up always fending for myself and when I didn't know something I'd goto the library and figure out myself or look it up online. I have no problem asking for help or more information if I can't figure it out for myself.
0.622200	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to a good degree. The basic amount I would assume is average.

If there's something I don't know or understand, I have a large support group willing to explain or describe things to me so I am informed.
0.916700	I'm extremely confident. I've got a background in both clinical psychology and i'm a certified professional educator in the state of Florida with certifications in teaching Biology and General Science on the high school level.
0.916700	I feel that I can understand what they tell me without additional help, because I have a pretty good memory. Also, if I wanted to find more information, I would trust the internet more than a single doctor to tell me specifics.
0.866700	I feel I am fully capable of understanding basic health information whether it be something I read or what questions to ask. If I am unsure I will ask or look up online if need be.
0.600000	I can understand some information, but the finer details are hard. I don't know some of the terminology and body processes.
0.527800	I lack confidence when trying to process information related to health and wellness. I find that the words and techniques are in a language that only people in the medical field can understand fully. There is a lot of technical jargon contained in the materials that average people usually cannot understand. I usually have to rely on speaking directly to my doctor or nurse to make sure that I understand what is being said. There are only a few websites that are dedicated to explaining medical terminology and even these can be complicated to understand.
0.883300	I am very confident in my abilities to help myself and to help others. I have no issue standing up to medical professionals and advocating for myself and others. I research things quite a bit on my own. 
0.916700	i have a very high degree to obtain, process, and understand basic health information in order to make health decisions.  Through  my employer, i have a very good health care plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield.  I can see a personal care physician or a specialist if i have any problems.  I can also visit the emergency room should it ever be necessary.  I process the information given to me well as i speak english fluently and tend to pick up on things easily.  I have a master's degree in economics which has helped me process new and somewhat complex information.  I can also use internet websites in order to verify information.
0.722200	I 5ink I am pretty compitant when it comes to medical matters.  Sometimes I donât understand some of the wording and I ask for help. I sometimes ask my dad who has a medical degree or my cousin who is a medical reassearcher.  I also sometimes have questions about prescriptions and I ask my cousin who is a pharmacist to help with any questions or concerns that I may have. 
0.811100	I feel mostly competent in the basic health information interactions, but once in a while may ask family for advice/help.
0.644400	I feel slightly capable to do asses the information and services needed to make health decisions because of the access to the internet and access to nurses that can explain difficult medical terms or other bits words that I canât understand, So on my own I canât understand too much because of the medical terms but thanks to the internet and nurses they help me understand 
0.883300	i feel that i have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. if i do not understand then i make sure that i ask enough questions until i do understand. i have never had a problem with getting the information that i need regarding my health.
0.538900	Most of the time I feel like doctors and nurses are too rushed and I don't want to bother them with things that they seem to think I should already know. Many test results are too complicated to understand anyway and I feel like I could just look them up later instead of wasting their time. 
0.811100	I feel I have an above average capacity to obtain, process and comprehend basic health information because my significant other has worked in the medical industry all of her life (her father is a doctor, she is a nurse) so I have been exposed to and actively consulted medical professionals throughout my adult life.
0.811100	I work for a health insurance company so I have a little knowledge on how to complete forms and probably have an above average idea of what information is needed to complete forms.  My major in college before I changed my mind was pre med so that also puts me at an advantage over most people.  I feel that I can either complete most forms and understand basic health information at a reasonable comfort level or I know which questions I need to ask to be able to.  I am not afraid to ask if I do not understand something because this is my health and I am not taking any chances when it comes to my health and my livelihood.
0.605600	I am pretty sure I have the basic knowledge to understand health information. There are times when I need to go to the internet to look things up further but then when I do that, I still have a hard time understanding at times.
0.772200	I feel that I am able to comprehend most medical information, however I feel my anxiety and fear of judgment at times keep me from asking questions.
0.688900	Generally speaking, I can process what the doctor or nurse give me, after a consultation. If there is something I can't grasp, I ask additional questions.  Most of the times, the health professionals speak in plain English, so there is usually no ambiguity. 
0.716700	I do feel that I am capable to obtain, process and understand basic health information, but not always. There is a good amount of health jargon which I do not understand. I think me asking questions allows me to have a better grasp of this information. With this I am able to make the appropriate health decisions. If I was not the type of person to ask questions, I would most definitely have a more difficult time. 
0.661100	If I get confused by what the doctor or nurse is telling me I research my condition online. This can be a little exhausting but it's worth it. I go to Web MD and other sites like it; there's a lot of valuable information there. Younger doctors communicate better than older doctors; they care more.
0.622200	I have had GERD and issues with my stomach for the past 5 years and have seen a number of different stomach doctors who have conducted a lot of different tests and tried a lot of different pills on me. This survey is really hitting home because I think doctors and their staff need to do a better job of using normal terms and explaining things better to non-doctors. I ask a lot of questions but a lot of times think of them after I have left the office and am forced to google the terms and wind up on webmd!
0.861100	I believe that I have all the resources that I would possibly need for healthcare questions and information. I have a solid healthcare team who have helped me every step of the way.

When I don't understand something, I will usually ask questions but a majority of the time, I am able to process the information given. I feel that if I don't understand then I definitely need to know. That's very important and should not be overlooked. 
0.744400	I understand written material very well, but I sometimes get confused when I am given a lot of information and especially if I  have to cross-reference it with one or more other bits of new information. I don't retain new information relatively well either. Also I have a nurse in my family and have her further explain issues sometimes.
0.688900	Because medicine is a complex area, it is sometimes very difficult to understand exactly what they are saying since it is all comprised of jargon. The doctor or nurse could try and explain it in layman's terms, but sometimes it can be lost in translation. 
0.916700	I think that I have complete capacity when it comes to basic health information and am able to get the health services I need. I can fill out forms and communicate with healthcare workers without any assistance.
0.722200	I feel like there have been times when I have planned ahead what to ask my doctors so I can be informed about my health.   But there have also been times that I feel like I have not asked enough questions and things were not explained thoroughly enough to me.   Luckily I have friends and family I can turn to in order to help me understand. 
0.872200	I studied a lot of science in college so I have some general knowledge of many of the medical terms so it's not so hard for me to process everything.
0.866700	I feel that I completely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself.

0.777800	I have a high degree of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information. I have worked in the healthcare industry for years. In addition, I have a large network of clinical professionals who I can reach out to. My network includes physicians, nurses, medical staff, and clerical staff. I think after years of working in the healthcare industry and working with patients, diagnoses, services, CPT codes, etc. I have more confident in understanding the materials that are presented to me. I also understand what is being told to me by a medical professional. I sometimes still struggle to ask specific questions. 
0.916700	At this point in my life, I feel that I am capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make decisions appropriate to my health care.  As I am currently alone, I hope that should the need for help arise, that I am able to find such assistance.
0.866700	IM VERY CONFIDENT THAT I UNDERSTAND WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL STUFF. I DONT KNOW EVERYTHING BUT I KNOW AND IF I DONT KNOW I ASK OR LOOK IT UP.

I'm also confident in my ability to do my own research regarding health information and services.
0.872200	As a college educated individual, I feel I am competent enough to understand basic medical information to make the correct decision. Even though my major has nothing to do with medicine, I have had to read and understand a lot difficult material to be able to obtain my degree, understanding basic medical information would be no different.
0.750000	I possess the capacity to process, and obtain, basic health information through understanding. I also am capable of services needed to make the appropriate health decisions necessary.
0.872200	I feel that I can express myself in such a manner that health professionals will understand my condition. I think I can describe my symptoms well enough such that a doctor or a nurse will be able to recommend ways to help me feel better. I also think that I understand what I need to do when a doctor gives me instructions on how to treat my symptoms.
0.822200	Usually, when I have difficulty understanding certain health information,  I search online for answers.  If I still couldn't make a decision or have difficulty understanding the situation,  I make sure to ask my doctor the next time I visit him.  My doctor is a very nice person and would explain everything in simple terms. 
0.916700	I feel I have a high capacity to obtain and understand basic health information.  I ask my doctor when I am concerned about a health issue.  I look-up information on the Internet to supplement information from medical providers.

0.611100	The main issue is that medical documents and also doctors speak/read in a very scientific medical manner. They use confusing words that not many people understand. I feel that these things should be simplified to ensure understanding on the patient's part.

0.850000	I believe that I have the mental capacity to obtain process and understand the health information and services needed to make any necessary health decisions.
0.883300	Currently, I'm an RN and went to nursing school, so I have a pretty good idea understanding medical conditions and knowing what to do. If I ever have questions, I ask whoever I need to, such as the doctor or nurse at the doctor's office. Because of my health background, I often don't have too much trouble understanding things. 
0.683300	I sometimes find it difficult to to comprehend of grasp the terminology used but I either can do further research myself and sometimes ask for better explanations.  My capacity to understand basic health information is probably better than I think. 
0.916700	I'm pretty well read when it comes to health concerns and procedures.  I will inquire from multiple sources to make sure I understand everything about the information.  I ask a lot of questions as well.
0.777800	I feel like for the most part, I am capable of handling my own information and understanding it in the medial field. But there are times that I have had some pretty confusing paperwork. And I don't know if it's because I'm stupid, young, or sheltered that I have a hard time comprehending some of these things. Usually its just things like medication contradictions, or confusing information about test results.  But I certainly know how to call my own doctor and obtain my own health records, and to get help, etc.
0.850000	I have good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make decisions about health.  I also ask questions if I do not understand something.
0.855600	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information if it is given to me in a way that I can understand. Some doctors are not very good at relaying things in layman's terms which can cause some confusion at time. If this happens, I try to remember to ask any pertinent questions that I do not feel were addressed adequately. Overall, I feel that I am very capable of processing health information given to me. It can at time, however, be overwhelming.  
0.844400	I feel I can understand most if not all of the material I receive from doctors and pharmacists. I do find that I sometimes forget to give doctors important information about my condition, and I sometimes forget or don't quite understand the information they tell me and feel like I don't want to waste their time by asking follow up questions. I do feel I have someone to help me or go with me if I am confused.
0.844400	I have college degree, a lot of biology and science classes.  I have access to internet if have some doubt about any topic.  I always ask the doctor if I don't understand some term or procedure.

0.750000	For the most part I think I have the full capacity. If its something that is really in depth I probably miss things and need someone to kinda help walk me thru it. That's why I always make my wife go with me just in case. I know when my twins were born at 32 weeks all the technical jargon was so hard to understand.
0.500000	im not the best when it comes to health information it really confuses me and im not sure what im looking at as far as numbers they can be everywhere with the numbers

0.583300	I feel I slightly have a good capacity to understand basic health information, as well as to obtain and process it. I've had to figure it out on my own and family hasn't been that helpful. When I go to my health insurance page, it doesn't explain things that well, so I have to make a decision on my own again. And when I do go to the doctor, which is rare, they intimidate me and I don't ask questions. I also don't bring up medical things due to worry over extra tests costing money.
0.916700	I feel confident in obtaining and processing basic health information. I try to research as much as possible prior to going into the doctors office. 
0.838900	To a great degree, I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel this way because I have the capacity to think for myself, comprehend information, and ask (when necessary) if I don't understand something that is not clear to me. I also feel like I have the capacity to step back and not make irrational and immediate decisions and the ability to ask if there are alternative options. In addition, I am capable of researching any issues online to learn more about my medical conditions.
0.738900	I have the full ability to answer, process, and obtain basic health information. I sometimes get confused because the medical jargon can be such that it's difficult to process, especially be pregnant - there are a lot of terms I'm unfamiliar with.
0.866700	I feel confident about my ability to obtain and understand any medical information that is presented to me. If there is anything that I am unsure of, I would be sure to ask my doctor or nurse. I am usually apprehensive about medications, so I would be sure to ask my doctor every question that I might have about side effects or alternative treatments. If anything seems to complicated about the information, I would use internet resources in order to answer any questions that I might have. I am confident in my ability to locate accurate medical information from sites such as WebMD.
0.833300	I feel like I am a well educated person, so that even if I don't understand something, I can research it for myself and come up with useful questions to help me understand it better.  
0.638900	I am able to understand all information that is told to me or discussed with me.  I love brochures or printouts that they give me to help me understand further.  Finally, I absolutely prefer to see nurse practitioners and other providers who take the time to explain things to me.
0.827800	I am intelligent enough to understand basic medical terms and do not have any problem asking for things to be repeated or explained again using more basic terminology and vocabulary. I have seen a specialist once who didnât wish to explain things in an understandable way, and actually seemed to enjoy talking over my understanding, I didnât go back to that doctor and found another instead.
0.783300	I believe the mix of my regular doctor appointments, reading up on ailments I have/have had, watching my nutrition and being proactive in setting up appointments creates an environment where I meet my health needs. I feel like I get a holistic and encompassing medical review and am well-informed. 
0.738900	Sometime I do and sometime I not do to how they words thing after we talk about it. With the changing of words it can sound differ from before
0.677800	I feel like the services are out there. However I also feel constricted because the processes can be complicated. When several organizations are involved it can be hard to get everything sorted out. This is even more difficult when you got a lot of stuff going on in your life. This makes it a tendency to procrastinate instead of getting help sooner.
0.616700	I broke my humeru last year and the doctor recommended surgery, but I declined because I don't have insurance.  I basically kept my doctors visits to a minimum to keep medical costs at a minimum.  Because of this I do feel that I missed out on a lot of feedback that would have been helpful.
0.777800	I think i have sufficient enough intuitiveness to understand most relevant health questions posed to be by my medical health professional and pharmacists.
0.900000	I feel as though I am mostly competent concerning medical conditions. However if i'm unsure I have no problem getting verification, and then following up with my own research.
0.777800	I think i do pretty good understanding these things. At times, I do need my husband's help when I do not understand a question or cant remember the answer to it. 
0.883300	I believe I have fared just fine in understanding health information. I generally don't need any help filling out forms. If I do run into an issue then I asked either the doctor or the nurses for clarification. 
0.805600	I feel that I can make the right health decisions because I listen closely to the doctor. If I can't understand what he said I ask him to repeat it. If I don't know what to do about something then I ask questions. I fill out all of my medical forms myself and if there is anything that I can't understand I get a nurse to help me.  
0.505600	I do not have a the capacity always to get all the help and information I need.  I bring someone with me to all doctor visits or hospital visits so they can help me to fully understand.  I get nervous on the spot so having a trusted person with me helps a lot.  I want to ask questions and get all the information but when I am alone I usually do not.  It is important to bring someone along.
0.900000	I have a background in science and engineering and I've taken courses about health and stuff so I feel very confident about my understanding. Doctors are people who are very considerate and can explain things in ways that I can understand anyway.
0.883300	I feel that I fully have the capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information.  I have been going to the doctors for a condition for over 20 years and have had to do all of my paperwork and question asking.  I have no one else to depend on.  I have to also do my husbands information.
0.738900	In some regards I feel like I can ask my doctors questions.  However, to access second opinions and where to go for my children and what the waiting lists are like are very difficult to understand.  Especially for mental health care and education for children with disabilities and mental giftedness.  I've had a very hard time to get any information out of anyone as to where you can get adequate mental healthcare for an extremely gifted child without compromising their education and future career options.  This is extremely frustrating.  As well, wait times in ER's for children's mental health access is very discouraging as we've waiting 24 hours to get transferred to a mental health facility with a gravely ill child having mental health problems.  Why is there the disconnect? Why isn't mental health acknowledged and it passed off as a non-medical issue and labelled a behavioral issue as well.  Who can explain that to me?
0.827800	I think overall I have a good capacity to get and understand the information I need. I'm not scared to ask questions but I do sometimes worry I might forget to ask something important. I also sometimes wonder if my doctor gives me enough information. 
0.777800	I believe I have the capability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions. I am educated in a healthcare field and I also have had many health issues which have given me experience in understanding information given to me by my doctors and when I was in the hospital. I am a breast cancer survivor and I have had ten surgeries, so I believe that is a lot of experience. I also have worked in medical offices and centers for 12 years which has also given me a lot of exposure.
0.866700	I feel have good capacity to obtain and understand such information.  When there is something that requires further clarification I find it easy to get additional information from a number of different sources.
0.583300	i have a pretty good knowledge base and i am fully able to undersand the basics of health information and services .  So i all in all i feel i am pretty good at this. 
0.900000	I feel I have a strong capacity to understand what I am being told and the information I am given. If I do not quite understand something I will make sure I get more information from the health professional. It is my health and I don't want to be unsure about these things. I always like to ask about best courses to take, or alternate methods of treatments available. I would not want to engage in anything I don't fully understand.
0.916700	I feel it's relatively easy for me to understand everything in medical documents. Usually the only things that I need clarification on are technical medical terms. If it's all in plain English I can understand it fully.
0.916700	I have no problems understanding health information.  I read and process information at what I would consider to be a normal rate of competence.  I haven't had any problems so far that I know of. 
0.866700	I can comprehend almost all written instructions unless their are way too technical. I can hear very well and can drive to various medical facilities to have tests performed when necessary. I have ongoing back issues and have had numerous test performed and everything has always been explained very clearly. I deal with the VA for health care so one can imagine the red tape and mumbo jumbo that is associated with them.
0.555600	I need help understanding medical terms and diagnosis most of the time before I can make an informed decision. Sometimes it takes asking repetitive questions to understand.
0.844400	I feel rather confident in my ability to gather and interpret health information. I am mostly confident in making the right decision, although at times I gather too much information, and often that information contracdicts one another ad then I feel like I am in a spat where I feel less confident. 
0.755600	I feel I have the neccessary capacity to understand what I am reading in order to fill out paperwork properly.  If I am not well during an Doctor's visit, however, I may not be able to retain everything that was said by that doctor and sometimes will bring someone to the visit with me to help listen.
0.916700	I am very capable of understanding. If not, will ask or research on my own. All easy to do. Webmd is a great backup for this.
0.850000	I feel like I have complete capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Most of the time, when I ask for help with understanding a condition, it is only because the condition is new to me and I would like further explanation. Most of the time the doctors are glad to offer additional information. Only when I run across the rare statement in paperwork that I do not understand completely do I ask for clarification and it is usually received promptly.
0.900000	Overall I believe I can get the proper answers.  While I haven't gone to the doctor often for myself, I have to go regularly for my children for many different conditions including multiple medicines with different doses and times.  I've been able to read the instructions given and understand what I need to do. Furthermore I tend to doublecheck by asking the medical specialist for confirmation.
0.827800	I feel that I am somewhat able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I think that it depends on how technical the information that is provided is. I think that it also depends on how open my medical provider is to answering questions and how well I understand initially to be able to think of questions to ask the provider for clarification. If the information is simple or very basic, I am completely able to obtain, process, and understand the information.
0.916700	I'm well educated on health and medicine via my schooling, having looked things up online regularly, and having discussed health issues on a regular basis with my friends, family, and doctors. Since my mother is a doctor, I can also ask her for help with any medical-related issues I may have. 
0.850000	I feel competent when it comes to obtaining, processing, and understanding health information and I feel competent to make the appropriate decisions for me. I am quite well informed on a multitude of health information, and I spend time online doing my own research. General Practitioners are very useful, but I feel responsible for understanding my own health problems and researching them as much as I can. I have disagreed with a prognosis before and ended up being right. It pays to be vigilant. 
0.700000	I usually go online and look for further explanation on things the doctor or nurse covered that I didn't understand. This helps a lot in determining what the best route for care is for me.
0.883300	I think that I can obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I make a point to either ask questions when I am at the doctor's office or I research the information myself on the computer. 
0.872200	I'm fairly confident and capable about talking to doctors and filling forms. I know they are  there to help and appreciate good questions and thorough statements. Some paperwork can be a bit tricky, but not overly so.

0.916700	I absolutely feel I have my full faculties when I am making health decisions. I am able to fully understand basic health information. If I don't understand the doctor's jargon, I ask them to explain it in layman's terms.
0.855600	I think that I am generally well equipped to handle the information I am provided. I have solid reading skills, but my greatest strength is in my ability to ask questions. I am good at asking for information and paraphrasing what the physician says. My biggest complaint with my previous doctor is that he was in and out of the office so fast that it did not give me time to process information and formulate questions. My current doctor is much better about that and is excellent at communicating information.
0.866700	I absolutely have the knowledge and ability to understand and process medical information. I am 24 and I unfortunately have enough experience with health and wellness.
0.800000	I feel that I have the basic skills to understand health information. I just need to learn to ask more questions when speaking with health care professionals. 
0.744400	"The problem is a lot of information is put into pamphlets to look good or really be read by people who already have a good understanding of medical lingo. I dont need a word that uses every letter in the alphabet twice. A lot of stuff uses too much lingo and can make you feel inadequate. Makes you not want to ask the question because ohh this person doesnt know what ""dnkfnepehdnlopidkodnghineocian"" means. Why are you wasting my time if you dont know that. If I cant pronounce or read the word then I am not going to ask about it at the office."
0.888900	Whenever I need to communicate with physicians, nurses, or other healthcare professionals, I make sure that they explain everything to me so I understand and know what is going on. I don't have any issues with my ability to comprehend or process information at all.

0.844400	I have a general understanding of all of the information that I am given or asked to provide.  They usually will highlight everything that needs to be filled out. 
0.916700	As long as they don't use technobable only understandable by nurses and doctors I don't have problems understanding what is told to me (or read about it). The problem is (for me) to get them to give me the information (that seems to be something they don't want to give).
0.855600	I'm fairly highly educated and have an okay grasp on some entry-level medical jargon. I don't have any trouble reading information given to me. I can easily get ahold of my primary care doctor when I have questions.
0.805600	I feel pretty confident that I have the ability to understand basic health information that's given to me and to make decisions for myself. I don't always feel confident that doctors are giving me the right information though or that they have taken the time to understand my issues.
0.872200	I am confident that I have the capacity to obtain and understand health information. I am also confident that I can make appropriate health decisions.
0.783300	I feel I have the capacity to understand most things I receive, my issue is that medical professionals either don't listen when I ask a question or if they hear it, they half answer it or rush through the explanation. A lot of the time, I find myself going to Web MD after a visit to try and get more detailed information. Medical professionals are often too busy to take the time and answer you thoroughly and I can tell they are trying to hurry me through the appointment. Some written material I don't read, as it's repetitive and the font is like 1/2 point.  
0.866700	I have some medical issues, and I am a caregiver for my mother. I have NO problem asking questions and giving information to make sure all needs are understood and met. Sometimes I give more information than necessary. 
0.833300	I definitely am able to make my health decisions appropriately. I mostly understand the medical information. And when I donât I know how to find the answer online or ask a medical proffesional
0.850000	I generally keep a healthy lifestyle, and through others I've become familiar with health related illnesses, helping them to understand the medication directions, and other such things. I feel to a reasonable degree, I can obtain, process and understand basic health information/services necessary to make the appropriate decisions regarding my health. A good bit of this is due to me knowing exactly what I would want, healthwise, and decisions surrounding it.
0.561100	I feel ok about what I am doing when I read through it several times. It can be a bit nerve wracking though because I feel like from time to time there are several medical or big words that may be difficult understanding for people who do not talk that lingo. I feel like I get enough from it though that I have minimum questions.
0.850000	I feel that after having spoken with my doctor and reviewed any materials provided to me I have the capacity to fully understand health information and make informed and appropriate decisions. 
0.638900	I feel that I have capacity to understand health information, but it is often difficult to obtain it because doctors are always busy and difficult to get information from. After after procedures when my consciousness is still altered, it is very difficult to understand and remember information at the pace they provide it.
0.783300	I have a great capability to read and understand. Now if it is a medical condition I never heard of I would need a lot of additional information
0.838900	I feel that I don't have a problem with understanding or comprehending the medical information.  I have had to deal with a lot over the years and I feel that I have learned from that.
0.661100	I feel the for the most part I have the capacity and understanding to fully grasp what is going on. Still, there are many medical terms that I just don't understand and it's very difficult for me to know 100% what's going on.

0.794400	I make sure I get every single piece of information that I need. I ask every important question so I make sure I understand 100% of what I am told or given. I don't want to do or understand anything wrong. I want to make sure everything is on the same level. Once I am sure I get all the information that I need then I feel I can go on. Everything would be based on what my doctor or health care provider tells me. That is all I feel that is needed to make the appropriate health decisions in my life.
0.811100	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain any type of health information that I need whether I have to ask a doctor about a question I have or I can always look up info on the internet if I think of a question after I see the doctor.
0.750000	I feel that I have all the tools and the ability to If I really wanted to. I would know where to look and if I didnt I would know where to look to find out where to find the information I was missing. 
0.594400	I am a very good reader. I read a lot of information a day on eating healthy and some diseases and the ways to get rid of them. I always try to spread as many information and help as I can.
0.866700	i work in the medical field and took some courses so I have some knowledge about health information.  I ask questions when i don't understand things because i need clarity
0.655600	I think I have the capacity. Sometimes I don't understand everything that is given to me, however, my father is a nurse and can usually explain these things to me. I do usually get shy about asking further. Sometimes I don't realize I misunderstood until I get home and will just inquire to my father.

0.916700	I'm pretty knowledgeable about health and medicine, although it is not my field. It is a science field, and I am interested in pretty much all of the sciences, especially physics and computer science. I have very high academic proficiency, so I don't need people to help me to understand things.
0.833300	I feel i have this capacity to a great degree. I can ask family or my personal doctor if i have questions and there is also help to be obtained online, all i have to do is google the right keywords for what i want to know about.

I'm not shy about asking about certain topics or health language that I may not understand at the moment and then later on understanding it and seeing what impact it has on me.

0.866700	I believe I have enough knowledge to understand health information, but I of course I need help from medical people sometimes to understand what the best option is and seek their advise. Dealing with a regular health care provider is pretty easy. But when my husband has been very ill and in the hospital I found getting information was excessively hard. If you did not aggressively ask you would not get an answer. And sometimes I had to persistantly ask for help about various solutions to his problems. There was no one person to talk to about someone in the hospital. It
0.833300	I have had a diagnosis of Anxiety and Depression for over 20 years so I pretty much understand all that is related to that. I have only in the past 3 years finally been diagnosed correctly with Bipolar Disorder and started treatment. I have had to learn a lot about the diagnosis as well as the new medications, and side effects associated, in these last few years. I am at a point where I understand the basic information regarding the disorder and the medications and have no problem asking my psychiatrist questions about such.
0.916700	I work in the health field so I feel like I am better prepared than the average person to deal with practitioners.
0.861100	I am confident in my ability to understand written information. Information communicated to me verbally is sometimes lost because I have an auditory processing disorder. In addition to this, I sometimes have a difficult time asking for help due to social anxiety.
0.677800	"in the age of internet, where information is abundant if not excessive, I don't see why one couldn't find any ""unclassified"" information on the world wide web, simply google it and one would find anything related they want"
0.916700	I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions?, I would make sure I have enough information from the doctor and follow up literature. Also, I would research online to further my understanding and to get a solid support for my decision.
0.844400	I have the benefit of working at a hospital so i have ample resources available for me, especially on our internal systems. However, if I didn't have tat access, I'd feel like the amount of information I had access too is limited, unless I google everything. 
0.561100	I feel that I have a moderate grasp on obtaining and understanding health information but sometimes the forms and doctors make me feel very overwhelmed.

0.883300	I don't have difficulty with anything.  Doctors and nurses are very good at explaining things in a way that I can understand.  They also provide ample opportunity for me to ask questions.
0.844400	I have a BA in a medical related field so when I am unfamiliar with a diagnosis I am given in regards to my health I usually know what to ask. Anything I am unfamiliar with and did not ask while in the presence of the health professional I usually research online to get a better understanding. Although I often call pharmacist with questions about prescriptions. 
0.777800	I feel I have the knowledge to understand health information to make good decisions. Sometimes if a lot of medical jargon is used, I do require assistance most often with web searches.
0.844400	I believe that I am fully capable of  understanding ,processing, and obtaining basic health information necessary to make appropriate health decisions.
0.783300	I feel like most the time I don't know what is going on with regards to my health and sometimes it's hard to ask nurses or doctors about specific problems
0.866700	I have been sick for many years with CKD, and have had many experiences with doctors and hospitals therefore I believe I have a broader understanding of medicine than your average person.
0.855600	I am confident that I can understand any health information I am given.  I have never had a problem in the past understanding information.  I know how to get more information if needed, so if there was something I didn't understand I'd be able to learn more.
0.916700	I haven't had any issues obtaining or understanding any of my health information or issues.  I asked appropriate questions to medical staff.  I research online to ensure I ask questions that I may not have thought to ask if I did not read about the subject and educate myself.
0.822200	I believe I have the resources to do so. I can always ask my doctor important questions concerning my health. I feel like I can go on the internet to obtain certain information.
0.672200	When it comes to basic health questions. I struggle with trying to remember past concerns and history of previous diagnosis'. When it comes to the first time asking about my health and reviewing any diagnosis, I ask questions. And them it become easier with clear understanding of my health issues.
0.827800	I do feel i would understand most discussions in regards to my health condition, if i needed an explanation on why or how i'm certain i could call the doctor or the assistant that works him to ask what i don't understand. That is if i was for some reason afraid or unable to ask during a visit.
0.761100	I usually don't have trouble with the paperwork but when it comes to talking to medical professionals I feel that they are always in such a rush and ask the same brief questions repeatedly so there's little time for me to ask my own questions. I had an experience where I was given a prescription and I wasn't even able to see what the name of the medication was until I was at the check out so I couldn't ask the doctor at all about it, only the receptionist.
0.900000	Yes I feel that I am able to hear what my doctor says and understand their recommendations. There are times when I forget to ask them specific questions or give them details I had planned to mention. I usually ask them to clarify instructions just in case I misunderstood. Sometimes they do not give details and I have to ask them for instructions.
0.916700	I'm completely capable of understanding all of the required information. If I have any questions, I am not ashamed or embarrassed to ask. If there is still something I do not understand, I am capable of looking up the information online.
0.744400	I think sometimes I struggle to communicate verbally---like in person, I don't do a good job of explaining things. I also tend to panic and forget everything I was going to say, which means that sometimes I have follow up questions and stuff, that just don't get answered if I didn't write them down before hand. 
0.738900	I feel like I am able to understand most of what they tell me. I think the hard part is remembering it later. 
0.761100	i usually understand what is being told to me by doctors or nurses. sometimes though i just need an afirmentation of what is being told to me. sometimes think they said one thing but they mean something else because i do not pay attention, because i am nervous 
0.666700	I feel that I have the capacity to understand basic health information and to process it.  If I don't understand, I have no problem asking questions until I do understand.  
0.605600	Sometimes I think doctors don't explain everything outright like they should in laments terms. They don't always give adequate resources and it feels like you're taking up too much of their valuable time if you ask too many questions. 
0.594400	I truly enjoy working at Health Decisions. The atmosphere is very casual, friendly, and has a good work life balance. I love how management has an open-door policy and are great in communicating and providing support. 
0.772200	I am fully capable of understanding most health related information. I have nothing to prevent me from visiting a medical center if I decide that I need medical attention. I am also fully capable to decide what is the best health decision for me, regardless of what medical advice is given to me by the hospital staff.
0.900000	I always fill out medical information by myself and rarely need help.  I always ask questions if I need to and I try to be as honest as possible when speaking with a doctorl
0.716700	I generally find that I am able to understand the basic concepts regarding health decisions. Sometimes I do need to clarify and get more information on things like, for example, diabetes and what needs to be done to control that given my risk factors. The one thing that completely flies over my head though is insurance. I can never tell if something is covered or not and it's a pain to have to try and figure that out so you don't end up paying a fortune if there is a generic that's cheaper somewhere. In my experience the Doctors and staff I've seen have always been kind, patient, and attuned to my concerns and willing to take a few minutes to explain what they suggest and why. That's really an important part because they don't need to go into all the technical details...just give me an idea of my options and a basic understanding of what they're trying to solve.
0.777800	I feel like I can review my health records well enough. When I was in the military, I used to review my records occasionally since they were available online. Sometimes, I didn't understand things and would ask. My sister is a nurse so I am able to ask her about anything I need. My best friend's father is also a Neuro-surgeon. If I have questions about anything, I ask them.
0.794400	I think that I'm perfectly capable of understanding any basic health information. If I had any questions I'd probably just look them up online so that I could get answers from multiple sources so I don't really ask that many questions.
0.783300	Asking many questions help me understand most health information. I also often check what I heard with research on internet. And most of the time when I have a certain condition I research the symptoms on internet even before I go and see a health care person so that I already know what questions I should be asking.
0.800000	I think I have good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. For some complex information, I may need advice from an experienced professional, but I am a curious person and I like learning about things. I think that I have slightly above-average intelligence, with an average amount of experience, but no expert knowledge of the medical field.
0.772200	I BELIEVE I HAVE A GOOD CAPACITY TO MAKE APPROPRIATE HEALTH DECISION. HOWEVER, SOMETIME I NEED A CLEAR EXPLANATION FROM THE DOCTOR.
0.644400	Being in the medical system can be difficult and confusing. There are quite a lot of forms to fill out and its difficult when you are sick. I feel like i need more resources and information in order to make the appropriate decisions with my healthcare. The standards of care vary and some medical professionals recommend things that others do not.
0.866700	My sister is a doctor of medicine, so in the rare occurrence where I have any lingering questions or doubts that my doctor wasn't able to answer adequately,  I ask for her input. For the most part I am able to understand basic health info, due to asking my doctor questions, reading the health info pamphlets or researching it online. 
0.850000	I think that I am pretty capable. It helps that I have a very good primary care physician who explains things very well. My network also allows me to email my doctor, in case I think of questions later or have anything that I do not understand. But, most of the time, I fully understand what my doctor is telling me and what I need to do before I leave his office.
0.777800	I feel like I am pretty capable however there are somethings that can be confusing which I need help with. I can usually find this help from family or on the internet
0.766700	I believe I have the capacity to obtain and process health information and services needed to make health decisions.  Sometimes it is a matter of understanding the language and complexities of health care that makes making decisions difficult.
0.855600	I feel that I can fill out paper work with no problem. If I am at the doctors and they are explaining things to me it's somewhat easy to process the information that is given to me. Sometimes I ask follow up questions to make sure that I am hearing the correct information. I feel sometimes doctors give you information in a way that is hard to understand so I feel like I have no other choice then to make sure that I am hearing everything correctly to make the right decision for myself. Once I hear the information at least twice I can be confident that I know what i need to know.
0.916700	I feel fairly confident that I can ultimately get the relevant information I need   through any necessary direct questioning of the medical professional. Further, I will ask if have I questions about any written material that I might be given. I am not averse to seeking help from close friends nor researching an issue on the internet (though I rarely do this.)
0.855600	I feel that I do have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health info and services that are needed for the right health decisions. I do feel that some of the answers given to me by doctors is very ambiguous and vague. I feel it's becoming more and more difficult to get a definitive answer and treatment plan by many doctors. In this way, I do find it difficult, because there seems to be a lack of concern in what I'm asking about in certain situations. I often have to rely on doing a lot of research myself, which can be difficult when trying to discern certain medical journals. 
0.900000	I feel that I am quite capable since I consider the scientific research method to be the basis for my reasoning. When I receive information from a medical professional, if I do not possess a complete understanding of the information, then I research the information that I require to understand it. I, then, discuss any concerns I may have with the medical professional.  I find that this methodology works for me.
0.916700	I feel I am fully able and competent to get the information I need, ask the questions I need answered, and understand the answers. I have never had a concern getting information, using it, filling out forms, or anything of that sort.
0.900000	I feel very confident in my ability to read and understand the paperwork regarding my medical conditions.  I am also confident in my ability to understand basic health information and I am not afraid to ask questions regarding my care.  
0.916700	I do not have a medical background other than basic first aid and cpr training but I have always been fascinated with health issues in general. I try to keep current on health topics. I have a fair amount of experience helping relatives with their medical information and decisions. I have learned a lot through helping others about what questions to ask and how to make the most of doctor visits. I feel very confident in my abilities to do the same for myself.
0.916700	My two passions when I was young were science and writing, which led me into journalism covering the sciences.  I have worked around scientists for years.  I am comfortable reading technical material and do not hold doctors or scientists on any type of plateau.  Yes, I do have the capacity to make decisions
0.666700	I feel that I can understand most of my health information.  I have a phobia of needles, so getting shots or having blood drawn is such a trauma for me, that my health has suffered.  I haven't been able to get a full picture of my gall bladder disease.  It's also been difficult learning what I can do to help myself without surgery because doctors don't want to let you try any other option.  They always want to remove your gall bladder. 
0.916700	Well, I am 65 now. Currently, I have the mental capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I go to the doctor when I need to or when I have a scheduled appointment. I get all my prescriptions filled. If the doctor tells me I need to have a test done, I will follow through and have the test. 
0.827800	I believe that I am capable of understanding health information that is given to me. I also feel comfortable looking for information online to help me understand better.
0.416700	Overall i find that obtaining, reading and processing the content of medical material is very difficult and challenging. Sadly it is difficult to find someone to help me understand what's being said.
0.916700	I am very capable of retrieving all the information I need. I can ask questions to the nurse and doctor when I am not clear on any issue. 
0.816700	It depends on the day. If I'm having a good day, with no cognitive impairment from various and sundry sources, I'm pretty confident in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information, so I can make appropriate health decisions. If I'm having a bad day, and I'm experiencing cognitive impairment, be it from a physical illness, a chronic condition, a mental illness, or one of the medications to treat everything, it's anybody's guess. That's why 99% of the time I'm dealing with medical personnel, I have my primary caregiver with me.
0.866700	i believe that i can reasonably understand information presented to me in clear terms, that i can ask questions to clarify what i do not understand, and that i can get help from family, friends or other professionals to read and decipher written information.
0.783300	I think that on the whole, I have a good ability to obtain and understand basic health information.  More of my personal barriers involve my comfort in communicating with doctors and nurses clearly and honestly.  There have been some occasions in the past where I have needed assistance in understanding medical information and have had to consult several sources to get the answers I needed, but this is the exception, nor the norm.
0.683300	"I don't feel that I have enough understanding on my own. When I visit the doctor or a hospital, I usually am worried that I haven't explained everything sufficiently. So I'll will ask the doctor or the nurse a ton of questions. I don't want to be driving away and then think ""Why didn't I remember to ask about that?""."
0.783300	I feel that I can understand basic health information just as well or better as most people. I think that I have a bit more understanding of health principles because I read a lot about health conditions. Therefore, I think I can make appropriate health decisions based on my base knowledge about health.
0.844400	I have, many times in the past, successfully read and understood numerous medical documents. This includes those that come from the emergency room, family doctor, specialists, nurses, and pharmacies. Sometimes I will even read about a condition on the internet to learn more. At one time I had to read things to my grandfather, but he has passed now.
0.677800	I feel that I sometimes understand basic health information. There are times when I am reading my online medical chart after I get a result in that I will need to call the doctor to understand what it is saying. Most of the time I will make an appointment after getting a result back, just so I have that one on one conversation with my doctor. It feel I understand better when they explain to me face to face. That is when I feel I process the information very well. Especially when they show me different examples of what is going on in my body. It helps when the doctor doesn't seemed rushed. I think when the doctor is rushed not a lot of information is obtained.
0.866700	I feel I have the ability to understand basic health information. I read a lot about health related issues. I have basic understanding of health related concerns I have. Also, I am good at asking questions. Based on this, I think I will be able to make informed decisions about my health.
0.916700	My mind is still perfectly sharp. If I don't know something, I can easily look it up online. I don't hesitate to ask medical professionals for more knowledge- it's their job. In another lifetime, I probably could've BEEN a medical professional..but oh well..
0.844400	I feel like I am able to understand the basics. I think having majored in Biology has also helped me understand the body as a whole more. 
0.788900	I think that I can do a pretty good job , I know that it's important to leave nothing on the table and ask any questions that I think are important. Also if I was ever going through a serious medical crisis then I would research online to make sure I'm getting the questions that I need to ask a doctor.
0.833300	I understand the majority of what doctors or nurses tell me. The only times I do not understand is when it is a subject that I know nothing about. I usually ask questions and when i do not fully understand I will try to learn about things from Google.
0.811100	I feel I can comprehend many of the basic health information given to me from doctors and nurses. Ive never had a problem with understanding any fallow up documents that were given to me either.
0.783300	I believe that overall I have a pretty good ability at obtaining and understanding basic health information and services. I have a doctor that I fully trust, and who I am always comfortable asking questions to. I also now have a pharmacy that I use, whose workers are also always willing to answer any slight questions that I may have. I have access to these physical people, as well as the Internet in order to gain information about anything else that I don't understand. I'll use it sometimes to check basic drug interactions that I can't remember, such as Tylenol and Aleve, or other such over the counter medications. I also have my parents that are always willing any questions I have concerning medical history when I have to fill out forms. I'm generally a nervous person, but when it comes to my health I do the best I can in order to receive all of the information I need, and not allow myself to feel bullied into making choices that may not be right for me.
0.805600	"I have a curious mind so anything I may not understand I will be sure to ask my doctor to explain. I have the capacity to understand much of what I'm told. My only barrier to understanding health information is anxiety which leads me to have a tendency toward ""burring my head in the sand."""
0.838900	I believe that I currently have the basic information I need regarding my overall health, but I am also confident that if I were to have a question or concern, there are databases and reference centers that would help me to understand.
0.755600	I feel pretty confident obtaining and understanding information as it pertains to making decisions about my health. For issues that I don't understand, I have no problem seeking and finding help. 
0.916700	My main hobby is reading, and I prefer thought-provoking non-fiction articles. I read all I can on exercise, nutrition and prevention, plus have kept myself as mentally sharp as possible. If I am sick or have any kind of health problem, in addition to seeking help for it, I read everything I can about it to self-educate.
0.772200	I believe that I have the capacity to understand basic health information and services if they are communicated to me by a health professional. Once they explain the service, and I have asked all my questions, I believe I have the information to make an informed decision.
0.916700	I understand everything I am told perfectly, and will take notes if need be. If anything, I ask more questions because I want to know exactly what I'm doing.
0.783300	I believe that I have sufficient skills an knowledge to accurately read and understand basic health information. I also know when I do not understand what I am being told and when to ask the questions I need to in order to fully convey what the practitioner is saying. Being able to do both of these things allows me to make appropriate health decisions.
0.605600	I understand my health questions quite a bit if not I tend to ask the doctor or dentist office as they told me not to check on internet as they said that information is not correct and to come to them only.
0.672200	I have general familiarity of general, basic medical terms, however, I don't feel great about filling out forms. I tend to overthink them and am always concerned that I'm going to fill something out wrong, and have it negatively impact me in the future. 
0.822200	I feel I'm well equipped to obtain and understand health information. That doesn't always mean I get it from the doctor or his staff though. Often they seem so rushed and impatient it's easier just to find out what the diagnosis is, and use the internet to obtain any additional information I need.
0.916700	I am totally capable of talking to doctors or nurses about my health conditions.  I research anything they tell me and on later visits I will have a list of things to ask and I even take notes if I need to.  I may ask them about more natural alternatives of care especially concerning medication.  Doctors and nurses are human and only the patient knows what is completely  best for them.  
0.838900	I think I can understand health informagion to a great extent, based on my previous answers and my experience in hospitals before I only miss the medical expressions otherwise everything is understandable 
0.844400	I feel I am very competent in understanding, obtaining, and processing basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. The main time I have difficulty would be with major health issues.
0.900000	I feel very confidant with my ability to obtain, process, and understand health information and services I receive. I ask a lot of questions if I want to know something or need more information. I have never had a problem understanding anything my doctor or nurses have said in the past, and I don't see any change in the future. I have done what they have wanted me to do for health reasons, and i have understood why I should do what they ask me to do.
0.722200	I feel like I can do an okay job at it. There are definitely times I dont understand certain medical terms but I usually just ask questions and that clears things up
0.872200	I believe i'm 75% capable of reading and processing it because i like to read up and ask questions so at this point i''m pretty up to date on medicinal info 
0.827800	I feel I have the capacity to learn and understand the basics when I visit any health professional. However, sometimes I leave the doctor feeling as if I didn't get as much information as I think I should have.
0.855600	I have no problem obtaining or understanding basic health information and services needed to make decisions regarding my health. I often do my own research to fill in what I didn't receive from the doctor
0.900000	I have a high  comprehension level when it comes to communicating with my health care provider or pharmacist.  They explain most things in basic terms and only used the big medical terms when there is no substitute.  I am extremely comfortable ask questions when i do not understand
0.822200	I feel confident in expressing my Symptoms to my doctors and nurses to get the necessary test and treatment needed. My doctors always make sure I have all the knowledge to understate my diagnosis and the proper medicines. They also make sure I understand the medicines and how to take properly and how to maintain my conditions at my house.
0.727800	I feel that for the most part I have the capacity to understand and comprehend health information. The doctors and nurses that I go to and interact with usually do a very good job explaining what means what and how conditions that I have or have had in the past work, and I am the type of person to always research medications and conditions so that I can have a better overall understanding as to what exactly I am dealing with or taking. The information that is usually shipped or tagged with medication is usually quite confusing, so having a doctor who is very good at explaining things, alongside the fact that I always ask questions and research information online keeps me informed.
0.916700	I do not feel that is a problem for me at all. If I don't feel like I understand completely what they are saying, I make it a point to ask for clarification. I also always make sure that they are understanding what I am trying to tell them as well.
0.861100	I feel I have the full capacity to do so. Understanding the scope of health problems is not an issue for me. i have one life and understanding my body and my health issues is important, and thus fully grapsing and listening to and comprehending doctors is something important and neccessary for me. 
0.900000	I believe I get all of the information I need from my doctor.  If there is something I'm later confused about or forgot to ask my doctor I usually turn to the internet and can find my answers there.
0.855600	I feel I have the complete capacity to to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am in no way physically or intellectually compromised in such a way as to hamper my decision making abilities. 
0.916700	I believe I am 100% capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I can read and understand written material more than competently and understand verbiage just as well. I anticipate no problems in my near future also. 
0.822200	I feel that I get the information that I need from either the doctors I see or their assistants.  If I have questions about prescriptions I talk to my pharmacist, I usually get more complete information from her than the doctor on medications.  The internet has also been helpful in making decisions about my health care, in knowing which questions to ask of the doctor or hospital personnel.  I try to be very informed when it comes to surgeries or medications that are prescribed to me.  I learn best by reading, our local health care professionals are good about asking the best way that a person learns things so that they can accommodate everyone.  we are very fortunate in our health care for the rural area that we live in.    
0.666700	I believe I can fairly easily obtain basic health information.  Processing and understanding the information is usually a little harder but with the help of the internet, friends, and family I can usually figure out what I need to.  
0.783300	I feel somewhat confident. At times, because I am afraid of the answers, I don't ask the questions I need to ask, and I terrify myself further by reading google. But, most times, I know what I need to know.
0.683300	Some papers are really to hard to understand.  They need to either simplify the forms are have someone readily available to speak to someone and make them feel more comfortable.
0.900000	I feel like I try to enter the situation with my medical provider with some pre researched information so that I have an idea of what to ask. I try to maintain a healthy level of dialogue without giving too much unneeded information so that I can naturally ask for more information should there be an instance where there's something they tell me that I don't understand. I rarely hesitate to ask for more information if needed and if I do, I try to get back with them via email or other forms of communication.
0.866700	As of now I've been able to understand and comprehend what has been told to me. I'm lucky in the sense I haven't had any serious issues that would make it difficult for me to not understand.
0.811100	I think I have a good understanding and capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needs to make appropriate health decisions. When I have questions about certain topics pertaining to making my appropriate health decisions, I ask questions to ensure I understand the situations between my situation and the health assistance that I am receiving. 
0.761100	I feel that I do have the capacity in that if something is unclear to me, I either ask for a simplified explanation or find a way to have it put in terms that are clear and that I can understand. If there are terms mentioned that I do not know, then I usually look them up so I can understand what they mean. 
0.755600	I have no problem reading basic health information.  I do sometimes have trouble filling out forms and generally have my wife help me with those since she's better with dates, doctor's addresses, etc.  I feel I sometimes don't get all the info I need since I'm somewhat shy and don't ask the doctors all the questions I probably should.
0.544400	I don't appreciate it when documents that I need to read are in medical jargon.  I need help understanding what is actually happening to me, and that frustrates me.  
0.677800	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I usually check on the web for information on health issues, and when I have questions, I will ask my Primary Care Physician. He is very good at explaining things so I understand them. My brother is also a Physician. I will occasionally ask him a medical question.
0.900000	I feel that I can understand pretty much everything that is explained to me  or that I try to find out. If I don't happen to understand everything, I am always sure to do my best to find out everything that I need to know before leaving or getting into a situation where I can no longer get help or assistance. 
0.838900	As far as basic information goes I'm fully confident I have the ability to understand what my doctors tell me. However if there's any serious issues I'll typically do my own research at home on the internet about the condition. Sometimes I'll have questions after I leave the doctor that I didn't think about while I was at the doctor, and I'll look up information online. This helps me fully understand it to a greater extent.
0.916700	I try and get all the information I can when I am facing, or if a loved one is facing, a health problem.  I read, I research, I listen to the doctor and nurses (especially to the nurses as they are hands-on,though my doctor explains things well). The written material is not too big a challenge normally, even when  not clearly written - I do ask when it's indecipherable because I need to understand things.
0.883300	As a young, intelligent woman who has no mental health issues that would preclude me from basic literary understanding (ex: dementia)  I feel that I have very good capability to read and understand basic health information.  When a medical professional gives me materials, I read and understand them just fine.  And when I have questions about my health or medical procedures, I can usually find the answers I need on the internet.  Then, if there is some question specific to only my situation, I can ask my doctor and receive a suitable response in a timely fashion.  
0.783300	It is someone difficult to ask questions to medical providers. I often feel rushed when I'm at doctor's appointments and it's hard to think about what I need to ask. I like getting written information at the end of the visit because it is easier to understand and remember the information. 
0.816700	I believe that, in general, I have the ability to obtain and understand health information and that I can be informed enough to make educated decisions. I feel that I am diligent when it comes to asking questions when I do not understand something.
0.672200	I am able to understand the medical information that is pertinent to me because I inquire what I do not fully understand from my doctors and nurses. Everything is simple enough to read and comprehend, but sometimes the medical jargon can be confusing to incorporate, so I would simply call them or setup a meeting to ask them face to face questions.
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to understand everything that is explained. I always ask follow up questions if I'm not sure that I understand something.
0.900000	I feel extremely confident in filling out medical forms or any forms for that matter.  If I don't understand something, I ask questions to both nurses and doctors.  I understand the importance of taking care of my body so I do the most I can do for myself and try to educate others also.  My husband drinks a lot of diet soda which I don't think is healthy since he is a diabetic.  I am currently not taking any medications and my blood work has been great.  I hope this information helps you in your research.
0.900000	I feel confident that I can understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I have never had a problem understanding information given to me by a doctor in the past. If I an unsure about anything I will ask questions until I fully understand. 
0.872200	I feel that I am quite literate enough to understand and process basic health info.  I am healthy and physically fit.  I have a science background so I do understand scientific jargon.
0.850000	I feel that when the doctor/nurse/health practice employee explains things in simple terms I clearly can undertstand my information.   Specifically, if they relate the information to my temperature, weight, blood pressure, air flow, and examine my blood for sugars, iron and cholesterol.   I start to have problems when things get explained through the technical terms since I have not been trained in the medical field.
0.888900	I believe I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. When I don't understand something completely, I am sure to ask, if not right away then later through email or a telephone call. Sometimes health professionals use abbreviations or jargon that makes sense to them, but not to the average healthcare consumer. So when I don't recognize a term or need explanation, I ask.
0.916700	I believe I am competent enough to process and understand health information and services needed. I have the capacity to make smart decisions regarding my healthcare. I know what is right and wrong when it comes to my health needs. 
0.838900	I am old enough and been through enough to feel comfortable with health information provided to me to make health decisions.  If there are questions that I am not comfortable asking at the time or just dont ask, the information is often readily available on the internet to find.  There is no reason I should not have all the necessary information when I make a health decision.
0.888900	I an very interested in alternative health treatments so I am very familiar with my health issues and possible treatments. I am constantly trying new herbal supplements and other nutritional supplements to see how they affect my body. I am well versed in how the human body works and what it needs. I constantly give health advice to relatives.
0.855600	I like to read up on conditions before I go to the doctor, so I like to think I'm pretty well informed.  I usually have some familiarity with things before I go in.
0.850000	I have basic knowledge and confidence to answer, process and obtain health information. If there's something I truly don't understand then I'll definitely ask questions to my nurse or doctors to get further explainations. 
0.833300	I think I have a fairly good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services I need to make the right health decisions.  My biggest concern is I am not always able to find the right information.
0.461100	I don't thin I am that good at it.I have major epilepsy and because of that I do not take new information on very well.It is very hard for me to understand new things that are told to me sometimes. Especially if they are in words I do not understand.I even have to wright down all of the medication I take & all of the questions I have a few days ahead of time to make sure I have everything I need to tell my Dr when I go in. 
0.883300	I believe I have above-average capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic information. My capacity to obtain services would improve if insurance did not impede the process.

0.777800	I think i am able to understand basic medical information. i generally am ok with asking questions when i don't understand something, but only if the nurse or doctor i am speaking with is approachable. Some doctors are not approachable or they talk down to you and make you feel stupid and intimidated. In those cases if i don't understand something i won't say anything, i will just try to find the information on the internet later.
0.861100	I feel I have a high degree of proficiency when it comes to the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. When situations arise in which this is not the case, I am not afraid to voice my concerns and questions and be persistent with medical staff until we can reach a mutual understanding of the information being presented.
0.722200	I always try to keep asking questions until I fully understand what is going on with a medical condition. The internet is also a great help to find additional information.
0.794400	I have a good degree to obtain and process basic health information. If I need help people with be around to assist me.
0.788900	Well my mom had many health issues and I never had a problem figuring out anything.  If need be I would get on the internet and find answers to what I do not know.  That is the same thing that I do now with my children say for example with their vaccines.
0.472200	I have a difficult time asking the doctor to clarify when I donât understand.  Sometimes I am intimidates or feel rushed.  It is hard to reach the office one I leave.  This has led to me discontinuing care and leaving the practice.  I can research basic information online, but when dealing with a complicated matter itâs not as easy. 
0.916700	I have a full understanding of the best way to take care of myself: be honest with health practitioners, ask the hard questions and answer ones given to me honestly, keep up with check-ups, maintain a healthy lifestyle. I do not need help taking care of myself when it comes to the medical aspect of my life because I'm mentally capable and emotionally capable of doing so on my own.

0.855600	I think I have the capacity to fully understand basic information and services. Sometimes I ask for better clarification when something is a bit more complicated, but it's not that often. I've also been lucky to have doctors and nurses that explain things in detail.

0.761100	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to a moderate degree.

I do have some difficulty in having a few options and making the best decision out of those and seek guidance from a health professional or online.

0.822200	I feel very confident that I can understand basic health information.

If I do have difficulty obtaining, process, or understanding any health information, I make sure to ask lots of questions and get my concerns addressed.

0.844400	I completely believe I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information! By using your brain to complete these tasks it becomes very easy!
0.638900	I Fell I have a good amount of capacity to to make appropriate health decisions but would not want to to so all by myself. Medical information, options, trust in some in the medical field and the overwhelming amount of information/misinformation available these days has me always questing and I find it difficult to make decisions that I am comfortable with 100%.
0.755600	I believe that I can understand most information and what I don't understand I look up on the internet. I use several different resources to make sure that the information is the same across the board. I also talk with the nurse at the clinic if I don't find the information I need.
0.844400	Well I believe getting the best care comes down to my ability to efficiently use Google. I mean nowadays that's just a default resume skill, but it's actually relaly good to have. Knowing what search terms to plug in and which links to follow to find the best information is extremely helpful in any situation, including finding medical help/info.
0.644400	I do feel like I can understand it all to a point. I went to school for biology and chemistry so I understand the deeper aspects but sometimes I just don't feel like my doctor understands. He is so busy. I haven't been to a doctor in a while. I do feel like I can understand information though to an extent and anything I don't, my mother will help me out with. I can make solid health decisions and have been. 
0.872200	I feel that I am well-enough informed to communicate what is needed. I always turn to reference materials if need be....especially on medications. I am rarely given new prescriptions but when they are filled there is ample information given at the time of purchase.
0.822200	I feel I am pretty good at understanding the information I have been given.  I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and have also had major ankle surgery so there are times when I am not sure on a specific topic or instructions.  
0.833300	I feel that I am more than capable when I need to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  If I am unable to understand something, I will ask for help whether it be from someone else or a medical profession.  Given the right circumstance, I may research it as well.
0.794400	I have filled out medical paperwork and also have had times when I didn't understand something.  In any circumstance that I do not understand, I ask my doctor questions and or someone more knowledgeable than myself.  I have only had to do this one time.  I definitely feel capable of understanding basic health information to make health decisions on my behalf.
0.872200	I'm usually able to fill out all forms without problems, but a term used might make the question a little ambiguous. When that happens, I'll ask someone at the desk what it is asking for to be sure I'm filling it out correctly. Usually when I see my doctor for a yearly checkup and lab tests, we can chat a little about results, whether I need to do anything, and if there is something I want to being up or ask about. My doctor is very busy, but she does seem to want to answer my questions and is a good listener. I know that most of what I might be concerned about isn't a problem, so I don't bring up everything because it would probably be a waste of time. If something happens where I am sick, I can just make another appointment. My doctor uses easy to understand language gives me options when the advice is appropriate. I feel like I am part of the process, but I trust her judgement when it comes to giving me good health advice.
0.794400	I think I do have the ability to ask and understand health information if I so do so. Sometimes I might opt out of asking question, purely because I would find it embarrassing to ask such a simple question.
0.777800	I believe I am capable of understanding the information that my doctors talk to me about. I always make sure to ask questions and sometimes I'll even write down questions ahead of time before the appt to make sure I don't forget.  There does always seem to be some things that are more difficult to understand just because some doctors do not take their time to make sure that we really know what he's saying to us. 
0.722200	I feel I have a pretty good capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I would say I am confident in this area about 85% of the time. Sometimes I need some assistance from other health care workers or more information before making a decision. Usually, in these cases, I am able to get the help I need.
0.766700	I am fairly confident in my ability to understand what I am told by medical professionals. However, sometimes I am bad at thinking of appropriate questions in the moment, such as clarifying questions about what I am told. I also need to put a lot of effort into being organized before an appointment in order to make sure I say everything I need to about my symptoms. When it comes to written documents I am giving after an appointment explaining my diagnosis, I am generally confident in my ability to understand, and that anything unclear is easily researched online if not.
0.777800	I feel I am capable of understanding the health information given to me by health professionals.  If I have questions I usually can ask a family member such as my brother or my wife.  Also, I see numerous doctors, I am sure they would assist me in understanding.
0.883300	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process & understand basic health info in order to make decisions about my heath care. In addition, I keep a list of questions or problems to bring up before each appointment. I sometimes do research on the Web, but always discuss the research with my doctors.
0.827800	Basic health information is pretty straight forward in my opinion. The doctors and nurses do their jobs perfectly well, and help me as a patient understand my options, and whatever else seems to be going on. There could be some ways that hospitals could improve upon their services such as having online forms in order to fill out information before hand which would make it much easier to get serviced quickly. Most of the time I can understand, and process the diagnoses that I have been given, and with the help of online resources the doctors job is not as necessary to explain in detail if I don't understand something or have questions I can quickly look it up and if I am still confused I can contact my doctor in order for he she to clear things up for me.
0.750000	I feel like I can communicate with a doctor about any health problems I might have, but my issue comes in with trying to understand everything.  Also sometimes you get materials that you can take home with you to read, and I feel like those materials just make me more confused.  So while, I may not understand everything, hopefully the doctor knows enough to properly evaluate and treat me.
0.777800	I have the utmost ability to do what I must to understand every facet of any health related issues I have, before I go to a medical professional I tend to make notations of questions I might have on my smartphone memo app for reference during consultations/visits. I also ask for any external resources online that I can review/read to help me understand, also I am not concerned about asking the same question to different specialists/medical professionals in order to ensure I have obtained accurate information. As well as needing help with forms/directions/instructions there are usually a myriad of staff members who are always read to help.
0.850000	I think I have a fairly decent understanding of basic health information and services to make appropriate decisions. If there is ever something that I do not understand someone is always around to get the correct information. 
0.872200	I feel like there are enough resources out there to gain the information needed if I don't know something. I can search something on the internet, or ask qualified staff in person. If it's basic health information, I feel like I should have no problem understanding it.
0.561100	I am not very proffesional when it comes to health issues. I am very sensitive to get included in this situations.
0.716700	I think I have an average understanding about basic health information and services when making health decisions.  For me, it depends on the doctor and whether they take the time to explain in layman's term the information they are trying to convey.  I usually ask questions if I am not sure or now I use the internet to get further information if I do not have someone I know who can explain it. 
0.633300	I feel I am capable of understanding basic health information, especially if the doctors take it down to layman's terms. I search the internet when I don't know certain things
0.888900	Understanding health information is no different than understanding anything.  Read thoroughly, and ask questions on areas that you do not fully understand.  And, in you free time, do some research.
0.727800	As a person who takes care and pays attention to my own health in general but specifically physical health, I am very confident that I can understand basic health information because of the research I have done throughout my years of living as a person who's very careful.
0.838900	For the most part, I feel like I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions based on the given information and external resources; however, the glut of resources available (between internet resources, studies, constant barrage of news, etc.) can make decisions more difficult. I feel this is further compounded by the general distrust of healthcare providers as of late due to news coverage, dealing with cost of services and insurance coverage, and the volume of patients versus the number of healthcare professionals to allow adequate time to get the information that one needs. These details increase the skepticism I have for specific diagnoses and treatments as it can be hard to tell if a course of action is necessary or if it is just a profit center for the doctor/hospital prescribing the treatments or diagnostics.
0.850000	I have a solid understanding of basic information needed to make good decisions. If there is something I don't understand, I ask or do research to make sure that I do understand or can at least form good questions to get the information I need. I have had 4 surgeries, 3 of them major, and my doctors were happy to answer the questions I had and explained everything in detail as I requested.
0.833300	I feel that I get the information I need to process the information the doctor or nurse gives me by asking questions.  I also take someone with me to aide me when having a really important appointment so that I don't forget anything the doctor says or any questions I had originally that I may have forgotten to ask.  But all in all, I feel like get the information I need to understand what the doctor or nurse has said.
0.833300	I feel that i am completely able to understand. I feel this wa because i never had a problem in the past
0.916700	I feel that I have the needed mental and emotional and physical capability to fully understand my health situations. I am comfortable with my doctor, ask needed questions and understand fully what I am told. If I don't fully understand something, I will ask until I do.
0.816700	I feel as though I have the capacity to understand basic health information. For the most part doctors I have been to speak in la miens terms so it is not difficult to understand.
0.794400	I feel like I am well prepared to pay attention to terms and read over documents and if and when there are things I do not understand I am good at knowing who or at the very least finding out who I need to talk to in order to make things clearer. I am not afraid to ask questions so that I too can completely understand my basic health information so I can then make an informative decision.
0.794400	I feel that I am able to get the information that I need about my health when I need it because my doctors are easy to talk to and understand me when I ask for  help. They make sure to talk to me in words that I understand and make sure that they ask me questions before I leave them so that I do know what is going on before I leave the room. 
0.794400	For the most part, I feel like I can obtain and understand the information. I do get overwhelmed by the decision making process.
0.655600	I am college educated and consider myself a smart person but lots of the medical information provided or asked to provide can be very confusing. I find myself turning to Google for feedback as it's generally easier and faster than reaching out to a medical provider.
0.916700	I am able to understand written or oral information without any trouble. I am able to search for information online, make appropriate judgments about the quality and reliability of the source, and understand what it says.

0.916700	I am able to understand just about all of the information I need to make appropriate medical decisions.  I ask a lot of questions if needed and also research information about any medical subject that I am interested in.  Again, if there is something that I don't understand I feel comfortable asking someone who I know will be able to answer my questions.  I read all information that is given to me regarding my health status.  
0.900000	I have full knowledge in basic health information. I have a degree in a healthcare field so I do not have to ask tons of questions at appointments.  
0.900000	I do believe that I have the capacity to understand everything. The key is to ask questions from the doctors and nurses and read everything carefully.

I have never had any issues gaining additional knowledge from these resources. 
0.844400	In general, I believe I have the capability of processing my health issues accurately. The only thing that needs to be worked on is my willingness to speak up if something is unclear, or if I just don't want to feel like I am talking too much. I may miss out on needed information that way.
0.627800	I have some issues understanding some things, hospitals and doctors give me bad anxiety so that makes the problem much worse. I can almost always get the information I need from a doctor or nurse and if I can't get it from them I use google or ask my mom. I feel I am very capable to get the information I need but I sometimes have a hard time understanding it, that is where I always make sure to have someone explain it to me.
0.861100	Being an adult of reasonable intelligence, I feel I'm able to comprehend much of the information I receive from health care providers and I'm fairly comfortable asking for clarification on concepts I'm unfamiliar with. I have a firm grasp of the English language and solid reading comprehension skills. This makes it relatively easy for me to understand written materials.
0.833300	I do feel i am capable of understanding basic medical information provided to me. Hospitals are very scary in my opinion but i believe doctors are really good at breaking down information and explaining things. Also refering you on topics to research to get further information.
0.811100	Before I visit my doctor, I usually call and tell them on the phone, why I need to make an appointment with them. When I get to the doctors office, they also give me a form to fill out. On the form, I have to fill in information regarding why I am there to see the doctor, what kind of symptoms I am experiencing, and for how long.

0.916700	I feel that i have all of the resources I need in order to obtain information regarding my health, and understand what is told to me. 
0.705600	Generally doctors just need enough information to know whats wrong with you so that they can help you as best they can, but it is pretty easy to know what is wrong with yourself and maybe a doctor isnt necessary. I have pretty easy access and I've been through lots of doctors, but I usually just use them as a second opinion.
0.916700	I feel I am 100% able to obtain, process, and understand the basic information and services I need to make appropriate decision on my health. I recognize that help is available should I not fully understand, and I reach out for that help when it is available and when I need it. 
0.855600	I've looked up most of the conditions I've had in the past, and the unfamiliar terminology. So when a doctor or a nurse is explaining things to me about it, I'm sort of familiar with what they're saying and if I'm not I ask my brother-in-law who is a doctor.
0.844400	I feel comfortable making these decisions because i ive been doing this since i started going to all my dentist and doctor appointments on my own since I was 18. After going by myself I've done research on my own and use recommendations from family and friends 
0.783300	I feel that I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make health decisions because I tend to use research online. When I have follow up questions I will look for scholarly websites and articles explaining what I need to know.

0.838900	I feel fairly confident in asking doctors, physicians, and nurses about anything that I'm unsure of when I'm receiving medical care.

0.900000	I grew up in a family where a large portion of the women in my family were nurses or had worked in the medical field. So this environment allows me to have a somewhat decent understanding of health information and understanding medical forms.
0.900000	I think to a high degree. Not only am I assertive about getting information from the health professionals that I deal with but I have the greatest library on earth, the internet, at my fingertips. In addition I am a very good reader, so I am rarely confused by written information.
0.605600	I have a bit of trouble understanding the terms of some health conditions and what certain things mean. Otherwise though I don't really find it to be too much of an issue and I typically can ask for help from someone whom works in the office and understands the process better.
0.916700	I do feel that I am capable of making any decision that needs to be made and processing any information given to me about my health care. I am actually a physical therapist and I feel that I am pretty intelligent so I think I am completely able to do anything that needs to be done regarding my health. If I have any questions, my wife is also a physical therapist and my parents are both doctors so I am confident I can get answers if I need them.

0.900000	I have been through some major surgeries, and have some chronic health conditions that I have been dealing with for many years.  When these conditions first arose, having no previous knowledge of most of the information that was given to me, it was somewhat daunting to try to understand everything presented to me. I had excellent providers then, and all the information that I needed was provided by someone in the process.  Currently, I feel that I am experienced in these situations now to know enough about my situation.  I  also remain very confident in the information provided to me by professionals.

0.800000	I ask many questions during the office visits. Then followup with phone calls to doctor or his staff if needed after doing additional research. I often will seek second opinions on more serious medical issues. 
0.722200	I make sure to ask the doctor as he is explaining it to me, there are times when I feel like I am asking dumb questions because of the face the doctor makes. So I will just give up and wait to ask the nurse just before I leave the appointment. 
0.900000	I have a biology background, so I can understand what is going on most of the time. In fact, I often feel like the doctor knows less about me than I do. I try to explain what is going on in detail so the doctor knows.

0.816700	Generally speaking, health documents are intimidating to approach but are understandable through repeated readings; furthermore, assistance is generally available if needed. I feel any decision related to health concerns are met with enough understanding to be properly accessed.
0.694400	If I go online and do my own research I feel that I can get answers. I don't feel like doctors, nurses, or pharmacist are able to answer questions. I have had many cases where I've been told things I have discovered to be inaccurate or simply not true. Doctors/nurses/pharmacist often repeat to you what they have read or been told. I can read it for myself online first hand.
0.900000	I have a scientific background and rarely have trouble understanding information or instructions given by medical professionals.   Hopefully this helps in asking the right questions.
0.722200	I feel I have a very good grasp on my capacity to understand my basic health information. I have always felt that I've made appropriate health decisions given my health status. My doctors and psychologist all agree that I should attempt the way i choose to treat myself and if I need further help, they have offered to be of assistance if I require it.
0.766700	 I think I can understand most of the required information. For the stuff I don't understand, even if a doctor or nurse fails to answer my question adequately I can look up information on the internet. So, overall, I think I have high capacity to comprehend such information.
0.794400	I feel that I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process, and understand different basic health information. Most of the hospital staff that have helped me in my lifetime have done a great job at explaining things to me. Almost all have been attentive and gone into further detail when I inquired about further explanation or detail. 
0.866700	I believe i can process almost all medical information that is relayed to me from medical professionals including doctors and nurses.  I can understand what is told to me, and I can give and solicit medical information during doctor visits.
0.661100	I think I can obtain the information I need. My issues are when they use medical terms that people outside of the field donât understand. Googling the term doesnât always work as some terms have contextual meaning. 
0.866700	I am always quite confident in my own ability to either find the necessary answers or ask for help when it comes to health. I have had to make doctors and nurses re-iterate things or clarify but there isn't anything more important than your health so I make sure to ask anything i need no matter how dumb i feel.
0.738900	I feel that as a college graduate with a biomedical degree I'd like to think I'm pretty capable of the above, obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services.

I have taken some basic health classes and have a good general idea of the medical field, including insurance, etc...
0.844400	I feel sometimes like I am not taken seriously by doctors. I suffer from chronic migraines and fatigue. Whenever I have brought this up with any doctor, the story is always the same: they write it off as just a lack of something in my lifestyle, maybe give me something which only barely helps, and send me on my way. I may not be the healthiest person, but I know when something's wrong with me. I wasn't always this way. I rarely ever had migraines before I went through puberty. Even then, I had more energy, but after I was in a car accident things got a lot worse for me.
0.916700	That stuff is pretty easy to understand and I make sure to ask my doctors or nurses everything I'm unsure about.  After I leave the office, like when I'm reading about any prescriptions, if there's anything I need help with, I just search for more information online.  I have no trouble understanding it.
0.861100	I have had a few medical issues since I was born, and am fairly accustomed to medical forms and medication instructions.  Also, my mother is a nurse and works interviewing patients, and I have learned a bit from her about how hospitals and the medical industry work.  I feel like this makes me capable of understanding most information presented to me by my doctor.
0.766700	I am not afraid to ask questions when I'm uncertain about a medical situation so while I may not understand right away, I will get answers. In addition to asking a medical professional, I go to as many resources as I can to find out about the condition. That said, I would say I'm slightly above average in terms of understanding basic health information.
0.811100	I feel I am capable to read and understand health informaton and if I cant understand the health information I can ask my husband doctor or pharmacist to help me understand the situation at hand. 
0.872200	I believe I have a higher capacity to get and understand basic health information and services because I have a degree in Health Information Management and I have worked in the medical insurance and billing fields for several years.  Some of the information can be hard to comprehend when dealing with foreign accents or the complexity of the issue, but can normally be understood after asking additional questions.
0.650000	I feel like things can be complicated on papers and forms, it can be hard for me to understand. I've come to realize that sometimes nurses will be able to give you better information than some doctors. 
0.916700	At age 35 and my comprehension I feel I have 100% capacity in how to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services that are for me and that are needed to make appropriate healthcare decisions. I am well versed in my care, health issues, medical issues, basic medicines and my insurance policies. If there is something I am unsure of I have no problems or difficulties in asking for an explanation.
0.688900	I feel like I understand most of what they are saying but sometimes the terminology they use or their writing is not able to be understood by most people including myself.  They sometimes need clarification.
0.688900	I feel that if it is explained to me simply I can easily understand what is being said. I can also ask all the questions that I need to ask in order to get the answers that I need. 
0.850000	I feel that I have a pretty good ability and capacity for these things. I can understand most of it and if I don't I can find someone who can. Sometimes it is a bit hard to find someone but I make sure that I do. 
0.666700	I think i have a fair degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions because I feel that i am old enough to make decisions on my own and i believe and trust in God in everything i do and decide.
0.688900	I would say I can understand the majority of the information given to me by my doctor and do occasionally need further explanations and advice when making a decision. Often times some forms aren't written well or are not as understandable as others and give me a hard time when filling them out. The use of medical jargon also confuses me sometimes when filling out paper work and when my doctor explains my results or condition.
0.838900	I feel like I have a great degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I regularly visit my doctor and they frequently explain any and all tests and treatments, as well as answer every question I have in an easy to understand way. I also know what websites to use for additional information.
0.844400	I feel fairly confident. Sometimes though I don't feel like I have enough of the doctor's time to ask all the questions I want or to receive all the explanations I need. Some things I need repeated because they're complex but I don't always feel like there's time for notes and repetitions.
0.816700	I have a good general knowledge of medical procedures, medications and facts.  However, there are occasionally topics that I'm sure I know something about that I'm wrong on.  Because of this, when I'm interacting with my doctors, nurses and pharmacists I will clarify by repeating what they said to me to make sure. If I'm unsure I'll ask for more information. If I'm not at the office or pharmacy and I'm unsure about info I've called the doctor's office (or pharmacy) and asked for clarification.  Just last week I called the nurse online to help me decide whether or not to take my son to urgent care.  It was very helpful. 
0.900000	I think that my skills in getting and processing this information is fairly good or at least as good as the average non-medical expert.
0.916700	I believe I have the full capacity to obtain, process and understand health information and services. I am able to search for information I don't understand or ask to assistance in having it explained to me.
0.838900	I believe overall I can understand what medical professionals tell me about my health. Sometimes though I need to get them to repeat information I didnât fully understand the first time they explained it, especially when a lot of medical terminology is used.
0.827800	I try to think logically when talking with my doctor. I ask myself what information will be most useful when explaining my problem and what I'm expecting to get from the doctor. I make sure to ask questions I have even if some questions might be common sense.
0.916700	When I have a medical issue, or even just during check-ups, I always speak to the nurse, aid, tech, and doctor about any issues that I've had (in the past) and recently/currently. I feel like since I have a background in both being around and studying medicine, I am aptly suited to have conversations about a large range of medical topics. Even at home, I can easily obtain basic outline information about symptoms I'm having. Due to my understanding of medical terminology, I feel I am able to process and understand many of the terms and even come to comprehensive conclusions about issues. If a doctor explains something to me, I am usually able to process quite a bit of the information, and if I don't quite understand or if it's new to me, I am willing to ask them to explain it to me more or in a different way. 
0.916700	I believe that I am capable of understanding basic health information. I am a pretty smart individual. If I need help with something, I will just ask. If nobody is available, I will check the internet.
0.866700	If I don't understand something I ask questions about it until I feel that I understand what they're saying. Sometimes they can get rude about it but for the most part doctors and nurses take the time to make me understand. 
0.766700	When I was insured, I generally felt like I did; I could ask my doctor to elaborate about particular health related concerns and follow his advice. Now, though, I can't afford insurance, and I cannot afford to see a doctor in any capacity, so any health information I need has to come from the Internet. I can't get anything from a face-to-face conversation with a medical professional.
0.888900	I feel that I can obtain, process and understand my basic health information very adequately. I ask questions if I am not sure what a doctor/nurse is saying, and I read through the materials they give me. I feel competent to make my health decisions. 
0.722200	I recently had surgery and I felt like after every appointment (which were significant, including MRIs, physical therapists, anesthesiologists) I had to Google everything that was told to me. I would forget what I should ask when I was in the room, because I was too busy trying to process what the doctor or nurse was telling me. I know they're busy people but I wish I had more time to process and then ask questions.
0.694400	I feel that I understand basic health information to a pretty good extent. I usually only go to the hospital when it is completely necessary. The only other times I go to the doctor is for my routine check-ups. Things like flus/stomach bugs/general sickness/etc I can handle on my own and do at my house with over the counter drugs. I have a good grasp of what makes my body sick and how to take care of it.
0.827800	I am a fairly intelligent person, becuase of this if I do not understand something, I ask a question.  No shame.  Medicine is not my chosen profession.

0.900000	I feel like I understand the information given to me very well. I want to be a lawyer, so I have no problem understanding official documents. Additionally, I have lots of doctors in my friends and family, so I have plenty of people to ask when I have problems understanding information.
0.833300	As a nurse I have a good understanding of heath information and this has helped me a lot when ever I have needed to seek help regarding my health. I usually understand what a doctor is telling me regarding any heath problems.
0.844400	I feel like for the most part I can obtain, process and understand information and services related to my health to make decisions. the only thing that would stand in my way is that sometimes there are details that you don't want to share with your doctor, that make you uncomfortable. Also sometimes the doctor makes you feel uncomfortable by asking questions, so it makes it hard to totally understand what they are saying.
0.844400	I have some medical training so I'm able to understand most things.  I don't really have any complicated health issues but even if I did, I think I would be okay.  If not, then I would ask my medical professional.
0.644400	A lot of the time I don't quite understand what doctors and nurses are saying about certain things. When it comes to basic health decisions, I can usually make the decision, but a lot of the time I just want the doctor to tell me what to do. If I'm unable to understand something and the doctor and nurses weren't helpful I usually ask my sister, who is a nurse.
0.688900	Often I find myself seeking medical attention for recurring issues. I often spend time on my own (out of curiosity) reading about these conditions I have been diagnosed with. I regards to basic health information I usually have enough knowledge to understand what is being relayed to me.  
0.838900	I feel confident in making decisions as well as asking questions of my doctors about any and all items related to my health.  I believe I feel this way due to the fact that I was caregiver for both my parents and had to learn what and how to ask questions early on.  Given that I had over 15 years of experience with my parents and their doctors it gives me the confidence that I need now to take care of myself when needed and to ask the questions that I feel I need to have answered.  
0.672200	I feel I have a very basic ability to understand basic health information, I find it easier to understand when layman's terms are used and not medical jargon, and if the writing is not very small, the fine print is too difficult to read.
0.866700	I think I have all the means necessary to get my questions answered. I can google anything and I'm not afraid to ask a million questions if that's what it takes to understand the condition or issue. 
0.811100	Somewhat. I generally know where to look and have some decent knowledge of it, but often it seems that the information requires you to already know quite a bit about medicine or human biology to be able to understand it.
0.766700	I'm confident that I can find the answers to things that I might not understand. The Mayo Clinic website provides a wealth of information that helps me understand anything that I have questions about.
0.888900	I am fully confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand health information about any condition I have in order to make appropriate health decisions. When I visit my doctor, I always make sure to mention any health problems I'm experiencing. Sometimes, I forget to mention something or ask questions that might be pertinent to my doctor, but recently I've begun writing down talking points I want to mention in the days leading up to my appointment.
0.872200	I feel that I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process, and understand information to make health decisions.  If I don't understand something, I usually ask the doctor to further explain, and if I have more questions after I leave the doctor, I will do further research on my own.  I have done this in regards to my children's and my husband's health as well as my parents health concerns to further understand their problems.

0.511100	as far as I'm concerned I have enough ability to ascertain and digest the medical information provided to me unless I am not as sharp as I think, but then I normally ask my wife for help on hard to understand information.
0.866700	I feel like I can obtain, process and understand basic health information. The health professionals I've always had ask me if I don't understand something. I can also call them if I have questions later on.

0.838900	I feel that I am competent when it comes to getting the appropriate amount of medical information. I often come up with questions to ask my doctors before my appointments, so that I don't forget. I'm comfortable with asking follow up questions, and reading and processing new information that's given to me. I also feel confident about researching and reading more information about concepts or diagnoses that are unfamiliar to me.
0.838900	I believe I am very capable to get and understand medical information. Although, I sometimes get overwhelmed due to anxiety and it makes it difficult to focus my thoughts and sometimes it affects my vision (blurred).
0.788900	I have a medical administrative background so i am familiar with most medical terms and situations. It is very rare that I need someone to explain basic health information to me because I have the resources to find any information I need.

0.916700	I feel like I am fully capable of reading and understanding what is being told to me about my health, but sometimes cost prevents me from getting all the treatment I feel I need or desire. I think I don't always have the funds to obtain the treatment and information I need.

I may look the information up online or contact the doctor's office to obtain any additional information I need or am unsure about. 
0.655600	I would say for most basic health related information and services, I can grasp it if I take time to read through it and have a way to ask questions if needed.
0.744400	I find myself more than adequately intelligent to understand most scientific/biological issues, but the problem lies in the paperwork. I'm never certain as to how to fill it out correctly. The only time I go to see a medical professional is in an emergency due to my lack of financial resources, so it's very intimidating to be VERY ill and be slammed with unfamiliar paperwork.
0.616700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, understand and process health information and services to a certain degree.  When they start using heavy medical jargon then I know it's time to get someone to assist me.   It's very important for me to understand what's going on as far as my diagnosis and treatment.  It's not difficult at all to get assistance but it is critical as far as making appropriate health decisions.
0.700000	i feel most timesi have the ability to comprehend and obtain information and services i need but like with anything there is those  situations and instances i do not have to ability to understand and pricess

0.866700	I believe I am able to do all of this.  I feel that I am fairly intelligent.  There have been times when I have been reviewing a medical report of mine where I didn't understand the language.  In that case I googled the information or asked my husband to review if the Dr. was not available.  I ask a lot of questions to my doctor in person, so I don't leave a lot to figure out for myself
0.761100	I believe that for the most part I can understand any basic health information so long as it is explained to be correctly. Anything I fail to fully understand I can look up the information myself until I get it correct.
0.561100	It really depends on who is speaking and how they are approaching me. If they are rushing I will miss everything. Sometimes when everything is translated in me it sounds like jargon. Mostly because I am anxious and cant think clearly. 
0.811100	I feel I am pretty capable of understanding the basic health information and services I may need to make appropriate health decisions.  If there is something that I don't understand, I am able to get the answers I need. I would be able to get further clarity if needed from family or friends.
0.705600	I feel like a lot of doctors don't listen and just brush you off. I understand basic information but if I need more detail, they act like they don't care or have time to explain. I am going to try to get pregnant soon and my OBGYN just brushed me aside when I had concerns about not having a period after being off the pill for 6 months.  That's a big deal! hello???
0.916700	At this point in my life, I believe that I have all the skills that I need to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I believe that having three kids has given me an advantage of being able to understand health information more. I was a stay at home mom for a long time so I was the main parent that was in charge of taking my kids to the doctor and taking care of them. If it's something basic, I know that there are resources online that I can easily access to find quick remedies to certain ailments or injuries. I also know that there are phone numbers that I can easily call for more serious conditions like being poisoned by some kind of liquid or being bit by a poisonous animal.
0.688900	I can understand and maintain most of the basic health information on my own. Although sometimes I need a little more explaining from the doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. If I donât understand things I will usually ask a question
0.766700	I think that I am able to obtain the information that I need the majority of the time. There have been times when I took my daughter to the doctor and they wanted to give her shots and they don't want to explain what they are really giving her. I ask questions and they don't really want to give me a detailed explanation about what is in the shot. I had to look it up on my phone one day because they didn't explain it well enough. 
0.844400	I think I am fully capable of understanding basic health information.  I often think of questions in advance so I remember to ask them. On occasion I think of a question after the fact that I wish I could know the answer to.

I sometimes feel a little nervous about asking doctors questions because I almost feel like I should know what something means if they tell me.
0.833300	I don't have problems reading or understanding the information given to me by health practitioners. Sometimes I may read up on a condition etc on the internet for a better understanding if I still need more answers. 
0.811100	I feel like overall I'm well equipped and capable of obtaining and understanding any basic health information I may encounter. I am a fairly healthy person and rarely visit the doctor, so my exposure has been minimal up until now. However I think I would overall be able to navigate what was thrown at me unless it was some crazy rare condition
0.772200	I think that I am fully equipped to understand my basic health information and services. Especially since I have many medical professionals in my family I can ask. However, how it pertains to insurance is where it becomes very complicated, because things like what is covered and what they pay and so on.
0.844400	I feel I am able to comprehend what doctors tell me. Although many times I forget some of the details because I always feel rushed. But I am able to look things up on my own.
0.583300	Talking to doctors is almost always beneficial to me. The typically find a way to explain medical terms to me in a simple way using common language. I do not have much of luck when talking to nurces.
0.900000	I'm quite able to ask questions that I might have about my medical needs and understand what is explained.  If there is any other questions that I have, I don't hesitate to ask.  Also when I get have time, I research online the information that I was given and if there is another option, I bring that up with my doctor.
0.794400	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information however my problem is I get extremely nervous at the doctors office.

0.688900	I am very capable to understand all that is properly explained to me.  I am not that familiar with many medical terms but if they are properly explained, I understand.
0.844400	I feel well within my ability to process medical and health information as I haven't stumbled on any step of the process yet. Getting to this point was fairly seamless from childhood, when my parents would fill out most of the documentation and so on.
0.766700	"I work in the healthcare industry so I feel that I have adequate knowledge on it. I work with patients and with doctors so I am that ""translator"" for patients that may be confused on medical terminology"

0.872200	I don't have much of a problem understanding medical terms and health information. If it is basic knowledge then I usually understand what my doctor is talking about. I also know more terms from taking college science classes in university. With obtaining the information I have no problem going to my doctor whenever I need questions answered about my health. Like asking why I get a pain in my chest occasionally. My doctor had no problems asking me more questions to be able to find out the cause of my problem. Now when I get that pain I worry less about what underlying illness it could be and now I know how I can get rid of it.
0.916700	I'm of sound mind, I understand everything that doctors tell me and don't have any problems comprehending any written material I'm given regarding medical conditions. The only problem I might have, and it's new, and a minor one, is trouble reading really tiny print that you might find on medication bottles, or pamphlets, without reading glasses.
0.833300	I have great capacity in obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I think that I am entirely capable in taking care of myself and communicating to my doctor the things that I need to do to maintain my health and safety. I am confident in my abilities.

0.866700	I have dementia but am still fairly high functioning.  I can think things through but have problems remembering so I try to go to appointments with notes that I type up in advance to make sure things don't fall through the cracks.   I can then make handwritten notes as the doctor or nurse answers the pre-typed questions.   The times I run into trouble is when I don't bring / take notes as I can easily forget some of what was said if I count on memory alone.  That is why I prefer to get written information that I can review slowly and refer back to as needed.
0.872200	I have never had a serious issue filling out medical paperwork or dealing with medical staff when I needed information. I don't always think of every relevant question when I'm at a doctor's visit, but if I do have questions after an appointment it is never a problem to phone my doctor's office and ask one of the nurses or have the doctor give me a call back. We also have access to an online interface for asking questions and viewing test results, etc.
0.838900	I feel greatly that I have the capacity to comprehend my health situation. I work in the medical field for a contract research organization and am a cancer survivor. I know what to ask and when, and I know how to translate when I receive.

Since I have completed this course, I have a much better understanding of the medical terminology used by doctors and nurses.  I am also more aware of what questions need to be asked so that any questions that you may have will be answered in a way that you can understand.  Typically, my family prefers me to be there with them during medical visits because of my better understanding of medical terminology.  
0.672200	I feel like its possible to find the information that I need online. When I go to the doctor, I always feel like it's rushed and they just make a diagnosis and then want to leave as soon as possible, not really having any concern for any questions that you may have. I don't like this part about it. 
0.694400	Both of my parents work in the medical profession and help explain medical terminology if i have a query. I also have google to help explain stuff to me when i'm confused on a certain subject.
0.816700	I think it depends on the reasons why i'm in the hospital. If it is just a regular check up i usually don't have any problems understanding basic health information.

0.583300	I am not fully qualified to analyze in depth about the medical topic, but I am able to understand and analyze many basic things about medicine.

0.816700	In general, I feel I have the capacity to obtain and process the info needed to maintain good health.  But I feel like I've had specific instances in my life where I had a medical condition and even after going to more than one doctor, I still didn't know what was wrong or how to solve it and researching things on my own online only added to my confusion.
0.794400	I think that I generally understand what I am told about my health and various health services, but sometimes there is fine print or things that I have some confusion about. Or things that are not written down and just told to me, so I forget. 
0.900000	I feel confident that I will understand basic health information, and ask questions to obtain clarification or additional information.

I felt comfortable asking questions and sharing information.  This in turn has helped me for any future health adventures I might face.
0.838900	I feel I have a pretty good grasp on doing all the mentioned above in regards to filling out medical information. I usually don't find myself getting stuck very often while filling out forms. There have been a few occasions where I did need assistance though.

0.744400	I feel like I do, but I get nervous when I talk to a doctor or nurse. When that happens, especially if they tell me that something is wrong, I get flustered and forget to ask what it is and all the questions. Then when i call I cant get them or they wont answer questions becuase they are too busy.
0.766700	I feel that for the most part i can understand what i am being told.  I have problems when it becomes too technical or sometimes when discussing how much insurance will cover vs my responsibility.

0.716700	I believe that I have the capacity to understand the majority of things given to me. If not, then I have family that would assist or even looking online for more information. What I find to be confusing is at times, one can get different recommendations or advice from the health field, as in getting a second opinion, etc. I do my best in making healthy choices in my life though.
0.827800	I think I am extremely competent to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I usually have no problem understanding what doctors and nurses are explaining to me and if I don't I will ask questions to make sure that I have a full understanding.
0.883300	To a large degree, I feel confident in my capacity to obtain, process, etc. health info. My wife is a registered nurse, and if I ever find myself at a crux, I can rely on her to aid me.
0.916700	I feel I have a great understanding of what I need to make good health decisions. I don't get shy or nervous about asking questions when I feel I don't understand something. Part of a doctors job is to educate and explain things that you may not understand or fully grasp.
0.766700	I think I have the basic knowledge and understanding to feel fairly competent in comprehending my health situations. I know where to find the resources to make decisions if I need. I could probably be more thorough in my discussion, explanations, and and questioning of health professionals to ensure the highest level of efficient care. I probably make too many assumptions.
0.800000	I feel that I am mostly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I have learned some information in high school and college about basic human health and over the years I have had encounters with government and health services.
0.872200	I feel that there is sufficient explanation and help sources when it comes to understanding basic health information. The key really is keep it simple. Avoid big medical terms. I will check the internet also before making a decision.
0.822200	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand my basic health information. I do utilize the internet to look up questions I may have about symptoms and diagnosis. I will also ask my doctors if I do not understand or if I have more questions. Also, I ask my doctors so I can confirm what I have read online.
0.844400	Regarding all the questions I just answered, I feel that I have a very high comprehension level to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate Health decisions
0.850000	I consider myself above average when it comes to understanding basic health information. I can read and comprehend, and have no qualms about asking for additional clarification when needed.
0.855600	I believe I can find most information on the internet. I think I can also ask for a second opinion from a professional if need be. I have had documents mailed to my house that explained my coverage very well. 
0.777800	I believe that in my experiences I have not needed much help with the entire experience of going to the doctor and anything related to it. I have been able to understand directions, fill out forms, and ask good questions. 
0.744400	I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions based on my own health curiosity and a detailed family tree of health issues. 
0.916700	I have the appropriate knowledge regarding my past health to be able to fill out any and all forms presented to me before and after any appointments. Should I ever have any questions, i do not hesitate to reach out to a nurse for assistance if there is any confusion. 
0.883300	I have the capacity  to understand this information and services on my own.  An example of a rare time when I would need help would be if I were in the hospital with a high fever or head injury that confuses me.  I would say that I am almost 100 percent capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding the given information alone.
0.916700	I like to think that I am easily able to comprehend a doctors diagnosis. If there was any obvious question that jumps out to me, I always ask it. If anything is unclear I will be sure to have any advice/instruction clarified. On the off chance that I think of a question afterwords, I can usually read up on the subject to gain further understanding. My wife is very often with me and behaves similarly. If I was in a position that I could not fill out paperwork, I am sure she could handle the task.  Lets hope that doesn't happen though.
0.844400	I'm no medical professional, but so far, I've never had to fill out more than basic forms, so I rarely need help with anything.  The only sticking point I've ever had was trying to remember the name of an antibiotic that I've taken before (I didn't know that there was more than one at the time).  When I did find out the name, I couldn't spell it.  Luckily, there was a co-worker with me who studied pharmacy and spelled it without a problem. For the most part, I don't have any problems, though.
0.800000	I feel relatively well versed in health related matters although I am not in the health profession. I read a lot about health and fitness.
0.527800	I would say that I do have a pretty decent understanding once something is explained to me. But if I have to make a decision without any knowledge of the subject I struggle. Health insurance especially is very difficult for me to understand.
0.872200	I feel like I am capable of getting the information necessary when visiting a medical professional. Depending on my current physical condition, I may be more prone to ask more questions compared to when I'm feeling very well.
0.794400	I can get easily overwhelmed with new information at appointments. I often forget to ask questions during appointments, and think of them later. This makes it difficult for me to make decisions when I am asked to make decisions while AT the appointment. Also, I don't always know that I am not being offered all possible options when being given options, and I don't always think to ask if I am being given all possible options. I think I have too much trust in my providers to actually do that. 
0.916700	I feel like I have the fullest capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make my own appropriate health decisions, as well as for my children. I know what to ask, where to go and how to figure out what I need to. My mom showed me how to fill out paperwork when I was younger when she would take me to the doctor and I feel quite confident relying on myself to take charge of health matters.
0.916700	I feel extremely capable of coming up with good questions, asking those questions, doing independent research, and understanding information I receive in order to make good health decisions for myself.
0.694400	I think I can understand basic health information. I probably can process health information if it is not too complicated, I ask the right questions, and the health provider is willing to give me thorough answers. Obtaining health information is something I can do by researching online, but obtaining health information from a doctor would be difficult without health insurance coverage.
0.883300	I believe I have a very thorough and deep capacity to obtain, process, and properly react to medical information. First, I rarely have difficulty making some connection with the medical professional (or professionals) with whom I am working. So, I can usually formulate a question in such a way as to permit the professional to make an intelligible, intelligent answer. Second, I believe that the internet and other library sources have material which can aid me in understanding medical situations (yes, there is also much misinformation out there, but there are also reliable sources).
0.838900	 I feel that I have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, probably better than average. I say this because I do have a scientific background and enjoy reading and learning about diseases and medical conditions, so if I am told something I don't completely understand, I feel capable of doing the research and filling in any gaps in my understanding. I will also ask a doctor or nurse to clarify what they tell me if something is unclear to me.
0.916700	I did not always have health insurance, but shortly after Obamacare passed, I went to the private market to get my first health insurance policy. From the information at the website and the documents they sent me after purchasing my policy, I was able to fully comprehend exactly what my policy covered, where I could use it, and more. I've only had to use it once in the 8 years or so since I've had, but I was sure to get my questions asked regarding my policy at my doctor's office and everything went smoothly.
0.883300	I'm an educated woman, and intelligent, so I have a good grasp of basic health and medicine issues and the ability to understand a doctor's explanations.
0.916700	I am confident that I am able to ask the necessary questions and have a good basic understanding of conditions I may have and services that may be recommended/required. I feel comfortable asking questions when unsure and can find resources whether it's my healthcare provider or elsewhere that will help me better understand the situation
0.705600	I believe my understanding of the English language helps me to understand most forms. If I do receive information that I cannot clearly comprehend then I ask the assistance of friends and family who work in the medical field to make sure I can get the language in a more simple form. Luckily most of the medical forms I have had to fill out are made so that people can for the most part understand them. I am usually 85 percent confident that I can fill out and understand most forms
0.900000	I have the capacity to process and understand the information needed to manage my own health.I know what services to access and the means to reach them. I do sometimes need assistance communicating since my hearing has gotten worse but I find ways to mitigate that situation when needed. 
0.727800	I think that for the most part I'm comfortable with making health decisions. I'm wary of doctors and I think people give them too much credit in their ability to diagnose people and prescribe the right medications. Mostly I like to have raw test results and with that I can research on my own and try to understand how to reverse engineer a physical problem I'm having and why it occurred. The body is very mechanical in nature and as such, most problem arises for very good reason. We're a product of evolution so it's best to look at our distant ancestors for clues on how to live healthily and without ailment.
0.811100	I am not always 100% confident that I understand everything I need to understand. However, I know enough that I trust I am making the right decisions for myself. Often, I lack 100% confidence simply because sometimes there is not a definite answer my physician can give me, and they cannot predict the future. Specifically I had a difficult pregnancy and really no one could give me an answer on why I had the problems I did. So I relied on my own research to try to get a better answer. 
0.661100	i believe that i can comprehend most of the medical documents i only have a problem when they require signatures and also when they use medical terminology to describe things that could be put simply. 
0.833300	I am able to read the information, or listen to the information.  I feel like I can speak up and ask questions about how my diagnosis is related to what I read.  I can fill out needed forms, with a few questions
0.827800	I feel like I am mostly able to understand basic health information that is given to me. I occasionally feel too intimidated or uncomfortable to ask my doctor certain questions about my health, depending on the provider and the situation. Besides that, I am usually able to obtain the information that I need about my health.
0.838900	I feel confident obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information. I do feel some hesitation regarding a specific diagnoses that I have because there doesn't seem to be much concrete information and my doctor has to ask me questions it to gather more info for other patients. 
0.866700	I think I have a good capacity to ensure I can understand the information, provide input to my healthcare professionals, and ask the questions I need to in order to make decisions and follow directions when needed. I often have a list of information when I go in, questions I want answered, and other ideas prior to walking in and try not to walk out without feeling comfortable with what I've learned.
0.900000	To the degree that I can reference to other available, public information sources regarding the health information presented to me by doctors and nurses. I'm best at processing and understanding written information when taking the time to perform more research on the information in question.  
0.633300	Health information is very hard to understand and needs to be simplified. They have to remember doctors are not the ones reading the information. Its the patient.
0.916700	I am adept at reading medical reports. I remember all the medicines that I take and their dosages.If I don't understand something, I can usually ask a receptionist or a curse. I am fully versed in all my diagnoses.
0.538900	I can understand basic health information regarding my diagnosis. I can obtain a basis understanding from pamphlets that I've received from the doctor regarding my specific medical condition. The dialogue between the doctor and I usually does not go further than this because of very limited time constraints. When they had my info over to a staff after a 3 minute discussion, it brings me to square one because the nurses usually aren't there during that part of the conversation.
0.888900	I feel very confident with everything involved with my health info and services. I have had a lot of experience with myself and my family. If I do not understand something I will research or ask a health professional to assist me. I have had to make health decisions for myself before.
0.872200	I feel like I have a decent enough grasp of medical terminology and my health conditions that I can make good decisions by myself in consultation with my medical team. I rarely ask for help understanding medical information given to me or filling out forms.
0.850000	I feel that I can make my own decisions up to certain appoint, until I might possibly receive some bad news about my health, then I will turn to my husband to help me make those difficult decisions as to where we go from there. 
0.900000	I feel that I understand most information about health conditions. Sometimes I need more clarification when it comes to the workings of health insurance policies and other related documents. Once it is explained to me semi thoroughly, I have no problem processing and understanding this information though.
0.794400	Generally I feel I can understand health information needed services.  I usually pester my doctor asking questions and even repeating them if I feel that is necessary.  Often, when I get home I will research information on medications and medical issues on the Internet if I do not fully understand them.  I will also ask my spouse as she is quite knowledgable about these things. 
0.672200	I can understand basic health information. Only what I do is have a reading of my blood pressure or oxygen. Then I will ask a nurse questions about my reading. What was my reading for my high blood pressure? Is that good or bad? I will ask if my oxygen level is go or not. If it is a little low I will ask what causes it to be low. I try to learn what is good and bad about my health. I also try to learn as much as I can online by looking what I am curious online.
0.811100	I feel I am great and have a lot of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. Normally the material is written simply and if I don't totally understand I will google for answers or ask my doctor/nurse.
0.844400	I feel that I have a basic understanding of health information.  I am well read and and always seek out more information to give me a better understanding of things.
0.644400	I believe I have the understanding to make basic health decisions. However, in the cases where there are specific issues (such as dermatology), they quickly explain the condition you are facing and prescribe some medications (trial and error). Often times, they expect you to remember everything they say in the office. In the slight chance they write something down, it is often only a few words.
0.866700	I make lists of symptoms I have when I'm not feeling well as well as a list of questions to ask the doctor or nurse. Very rarely am I unprepared going into an appointment for an ailment or sickness. Today with the internet makes it really easy to prepare as well. You can practically diagnose yourself and also make a list of possible problems to speak to a doctor about.
0.527800	I FEEL SOMEWHAT LIKELY REGARDING THE CAPACITY TO OBTAIN ,PROCESS, AND UNDERSTAND BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICES NEEDED TO MAKE APPROPRIATE HEALTH DECISIONS.
0.916700	I have had an interest in medicine since childhood, having grown up in my father's pharmacy.  I am the gatekeeper and knowledge authority for my family's healhcare and am fully informed on all their medical conditions.  I have a kong0-standing open relationship with my primary care physician and the specialists I see.  I have also been the primary caregiver for my mother when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and advocated aggressively for her care.
0.772200	I feel I am pretty competent at being able to understand basic health information. There are times where I run into things that i don't quite understand how they work or why the doctor has to do them. I think I can feel out a health form pretty well though. 
0.822200	I feel pretty confident that I have the ability to understand health information given to me. If I don't understand anything at all I ask until I get the answer I need. Sometimes I feel like a problem patient because the Dr or Nurse get a bit frustrated but that's their job and my job is to keep track and fully understand my own health as a bottom line. I learned this all the hard way by not asking questions in a previous situation and only became more ill. I think we pay for this information so we should understand it even if we have to go through many people to get it.
0.883300	pretty much completely. Prescription drug information that is written by the manufacture is needlessly complicated as well and the info about clinical trials though.
0.538900	I think I have a moderate capacity to do this. I think that they use a lot of difficult terms, and that is where the misunderstanding come from.
0.666700	I am educated and articulate, but I feel like dissemination of information is so provider-specific. For instance, I have a mild condition that was recently diagnosed, and what the doctor told me in terms of how common it is was not at all consistent with what his nurse told me, and what I had found anecdotally. So while I have the capacity to process quantitative information, sometimes it's more difficult when individual communication styles come into play.
0.838900	I feel confident that I am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  If I have questions, I could speak with my doctor or nursing staff to find answers.  If the answers were too technical, I would feel comfortable asking for clarification.
0.777800	I feel fairly confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand what I need to make appropriate health decisions,  Iâve utilized the Internet, my pharmacist and my nurse practitioner when needed.
0.794400	I feel that even though I am not a medical professional, I am able to ask questions until I feel confident that I understand the gist of the information about my medical needs and care. I do not always understand what is initially said to me or provided to me in writing but I feel confident that I am able to discuss with the medical provider the information until I understand it for the most part. I also have the ability to use an internet search engine to help me understand information as well.
0.750000	I feel like I am in a good position to do these things, but that is because I am somewhat intelligent. I feel like healthcare professionals are open to answering any questions that I may have and willing to do so in terms that I can understand. The only thing that I am not confident in is my ability to obtain all the information I need. Sometimes I am confused about where to go to obtain information.
0.788900	I think depending on the person explaining things, I can grasp the concept. And when I need more information I will ask for more.  I don't feel confident that I know the right questions to ask though.
0.861100	I feel that I have full capacity to recieve and comprehend health information that is given to me. I am able to clarify information if needed and usually ask questions if something is confusing.
0.766700	I used to work as a nurse, but it has been many years and a lot of health related treatments and information has changed since then. Many times I can research a topic online before visiting my doctor to find out questions I may need to ask. Often I find that times have changed and new information is available that I didn't know about.
0.705600	I feel that I have a good capacity to obtain and understand such information, but the problem is often how insistent I feel that I need to be in order to get it. Another problem arises when there is more information needed to properly understand certain medical situations including specific policies and practices, but if one is not aware of the extent to which such information exists and therefore demands it and insists on thoroughly reading it, one is not offered it.
0.916700	I believe I could interpret just about any health information given to me on my own and take actions based on my understanding and comprehension. I think if I had trouble understanding any of it, I would be able to ask appropriate questions of a provider and get answers I could use to understand it better.
0.916700	I feel I'm at full capacity to understand and comprehend any medical information provided to me.  I've had 100s of appointments throughout my lifetime with little to no misunderstandings.
0.794400	In regards to all of the questions that I just answered, I feel that I completely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, especially when I am presented with information and materials that explain health information and services in an accurate way and when I take the time necessary to read through the materials without being rushed.
0.916700	I feel that I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have always had an interest in the medical field and worked in a hospital for a brief time about 30 years ago. I read a lot of online sources and follow news about medical issues and advances so I consider myself to be competent enough about most medical issues to get and deal with any relevant health information or services I might need to make the right health choices.
0.688900	I think that what I would really need is a friend to help me.  I would probably have to repeat things back to the provider.  I'm not fully skilled.
0.677800	I believe I have a very good grasp on obtaining and understanding medical materials regarding my own health, whether I need help with it sometimes or not. In addition to having people around who could help me, I feel rather comfortable asking my doctor for help and if I still need help, I'll either research online or ask others.
0.811100	I am as capable as anyone at understanding health information provided to me, but health is very specific and individual and I believe often that doctors speak in generalities because to do more would require more time than they have to offer or I want to pay for.  So some specifics, or details that would make my situation different from the norm, get lost unless I continue to have a problem that warrants further specific attention.
0.711100	I believe that I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel that in most situations the information is easy for me to understand. There have been times when I needed more clarity on forms and medical terms or diagnosis. The times when I needed clarity I usually turn to the internet first before I turn to a doctor or nurse to get the information I need to make it more understandable. Getting a hold of a doctor or nurse on the phone usually is a long process that I like to avoid. I like to get my information rapidly and not have to wait for a call back from a doctor or nurse. I think in my case it really helps that I took courses in college dealing with anatomy and physiology and disease. This makes it far easier for me to understand the information the doctor is telling me. I know in my own family there is often a lot of confusion over understanding health information. So I think it is a matter of having had exposure to certain terms and subjects in healthcare.  
0.816700	I have experience in some areas of health because in college I participated in health studies and read a lot of literature.Nowadays is easier to get new information about a specific health-related topic on the internet. 
0.916700	I am able to read and understand most materials given to me by doctors. My primary care doctor is very willing to get me more printed information if I request it and sometimes does it on his own.
0.811100	Well I am pretty knowledgeable myself in medical field, as my wife is self taught health adviser. It is very easy for me to understand and process basic health information as well as services in order to make the right decision. I have hardly ever had any problems regarding the basic information about health.
0.866700	I feel pretty confident in myself. I am pretty young for an adult still, but I believe I am pretty competent and confident enough to understand what needs to be done pertaining to my doctor and my health.
0.883300	I have a science background, so the terminology is relatively easy for me to understand. In addition to communicating with health care professionals, I also do research on line with regard to my conditions.
0.816700	I often have to ask a few questions for clarification but generally understand everything ,my Dr. tells me. This includes written information and pamplets as well. I have also done online research regarding my lung disease to gain a better understanding overall. Generally my Dr. is very good about explaining things and answering questions I may have so I leave her office fully informed. If anything at times she is redundant and repetitive.
0.711100	I feel like I have good understanding of how to make an appropriate health decisions. I feel confident that I understand the basic process of obtaining the information I need to understand the health information and services.
0.888900	To a very high degree, I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I think it helps me a bit to work in the Healthcare industry. But even if I did not, I feel the forms are really straightforward and the paperwork after the doctor's visit is very informative and easy to read as well. Even the information that comes attached to the medication is not so bad. Although, the names of the medications can be difficult to pronounce the instructions and descriptions are pretty straight forward. 
0.855600	Even though I don't have a medical (or even remotely Science) background, I believe that I understand basic information and services to make suitable health decisions. The only time this gets confusing is when there is something new/totally unfamiliar.
0.666700	I believe that I am very capable of understanding my health information and services. I am able to make appropriate health decisions. I would prefer to have a second opinion or confirmation from someone I trust if possible, just to be sure that I understand correctly. 
0.861100	I believe I have a high degree of capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am able to read, discern, and listen to the information that is being provided to me by my doctors. Additionally, if I don't understand something I will tell my doctors my concerns and listen to their opinion in order to make the best decision.I would also read about it using reliable sources.
0.844400	I feel that I have the capacity to understand the information that my doctor gives me. I also have the capacity to fill out medical forms.
0.600000	Health information can be very confusing. They do not always write the information so that an average person can understand it. Many times, I have to ask what the long medical terms mean, then I feel stupid. It can get scary, causing even more questions that are hard to understand. Having the internet so handy now does help with searching, but then you find other information that is really scary. 
0.827800	The processing and understanding are rarely an issue, it's really about getting the information I need to do these things that is the problem.  Usually when I go to the doctor I am a bit stressed so I forget to ask pertinent questions.  Then realize it after leaving.  When I get home I often try to call them but rarely get a response right away.  I most often times find what I need on the internet. Days later I will get a response from the doctors nurse.
0.777800	I think I can comprehend all the basics I may need to know although I may need to ask to have some things clarified if they are told in terms that I do not understand.
0.888900	I feel very capable regarding all health related information. I do have a degree in Nursing, so that gives me a great advantage. There are still things that I have questions on at times, or do not understand.
0.844400	I feel like I can understand the services and basic health information without any issues. My reading comprehension has always been pretty high, so I've never needed any assistance. 
0.766700	I feel that I have a good grasp on the basics of how the human body works. As long as it pertains to one of the systems, IE respiratory, circulatory, it is fairly easy to understand. When the illness in question gets deeper than that, to the smaller functions of the body, is when it becomes difficult to understand.
0.883300	I am in the medical field so I have indepth knowledge about medicine. Because of this most of my professional that I see speak to me as equal and not dumb it down. 
0.916700	I feel I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself.  And if there is something I don't understand or am not clear on, I can either ask or get answers from a different source.  
0.705600	I feel as thought sometimes I understand the information 100% and other times I feel completely lost. When I feel as thought I understand everything that the doctor and nurses are telling me, it's because I did my own research before I even stepped foot into the doctors office. When I'm told something I know nothing about, it's hard for me to understand completely because I know nothing about the medical field.
0.916700	I am very capable of answering the questions that the medical doctors ask me. I am able to process what they say, and if I do not I'm not afraid to ask them questions. 
0.650000	I feel that I have a good capacity to understand health information and services with someone assisting me.  I think that it is always good to have someone look things over and help you through the way.  There is so much to consider and such complexity that I like guidance through someone who can help me clearly understand.  
0.633300	I have no medical background, however I have been to the doctor plenty of times. I feel I have the mental capacity to understand the basic information, some of it just confuses me. Thankfully, my wife is a nurse :)
0.694400	I usually understand everything that is in a medical document that I must review, understand and sign. However, occasionally I am in a situation (such as when I was diagnosed with prostate cancer where I did not totally understand some of the information I read or that was explained to me by the physician). In cases like these sometimes my wife does a better job of explaining the issue to me in clear terms that I understand. However, in general I usually am able to comprehend everything that is being discussed with me in the doctor's office.
0.916700	I've worked in the medical field and have a child with medical disabilities.  So, I am fully capable of understanding medical terminology and know what questions to ask if and when I do not understand.  I also know what websites provide the best answers to questions I may have if and when a medical professional is not available for me to ask personally.  I am never afraid to ask a professional when needed.
0.883300	I feel i am above average in my understanding of health care and health care related issues, also i have a decent understanding of some basic biology which makes understanding a lot of issues more intuitive. I like to ask pertinent questions and try to challenge the doctor when i am experiencing an illness, and usually by the time i am talking to a doctor i have a list of questions i have derived from my own research before the appointment, many times my guess to the diagnosis proves to match that of the doctor. Sometimes even when the doctor disagrees and offers his own diagnosis in the end my guess proves to be correct after some trial and error.  
0.800000	It it not the hard nowadays to understand medical advice or diagnosis. This is due to th wide ranging information available on the internet
0.855600	I AM CONFIDENT IN MY ABILITIES TO UNDERSTAND BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION. I AM 48 YEARS OLD AND HAVE HAD NOT ONLY MY OWN EXPERIENCES OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS BUT ALSO ABOUT 20 YEARS OF DEALING WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CONCERNING MY 3 CHILDREN.
0.916700	I feel completely capable of understanding basic health information, and I'm confident in my ability to make appropriate health decisions.  Health is my hobby.  I have spent countless hours reading information from a wide range of sources, from blogs to medical journals, to better understand my body and how it operates.  In terms of literature from medical professionals, I've never had a problem with it.
0.916700	I feel very confident of being able to fill out and understand basic health information forms and other things.  I am a pretty smart person and my health is very important to me.  If I need any help I can ask and get the help I need.  
0.816700	Plenty and what i don't know i would ask the appropriate people to help me out with it. Doctor, nurse etc. I feel confident though that i could do it on my own as i already have access to my health information through my drs. portal.
0.694400	I think that I am cable and understand basic health information and services. If I need help with anything I try to look online and then ask a professional for their opinion.
0.733300	 While I have some familiarity with medical terms from working in a hospital while going to college that was many years ago. Some of the new diagnostic terms are new to me and I must have them explained by a health worker or doctor. In particular tests present a challenge when I try to interpret the results. If a battery of tests are given to me I need an explanation, not just of the normal parameters but, of how the results as a whole relate to my health. I have very little difficulty taking my meds as directed but sometimes, if I miss a dose or take too much, I must call my medical practitioner for assistance as to what to do next. 
0.833300	I worked in a medical related field. Usually, i understand the terminology used by doctors or nurse. If i don't understand then i don't hesitate to ask them. Its my body i have to take care of it. If i still don't understand then i ask my closed friends or relatives. Most of them are in the medical field. For whatever reason i still need more explanation then i search on web and read about it, understand it and then make educated decison. Sometimes it does happend that i can't read doctors handwriting then i call their office and clarify it with their nursing staff, usually they are very helpful. 
0.900000	I feel I am more than capable to understand the information my doctor's give me as well as the ability to seek out any additional information I may want or need. if u don't fully understand anything I am confident that if u ask my doctor's will have answers for me.
0.916700	I think I can understand everything. I read it slowly and over again if I need to. Then I look up information that I don't quite get.
0.816700	Regarding all the questions I just answered, to what degree do you feel i have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is basically enough understanding some situations can be harder to process
0.688900	I believe that I have enough knowledge to answer my basic health questions. If I go to the doctor and it is for something that could be serious or something that is complicated that I might have a hard time understanding, I usually take my mother with me because she is a retired nurse and she can help ask questions to the doctor that I might not think of or know to ask.
0.672200	Iâm not a doctor and Iâd never like to be, it scares me just thinking about it, but I like to investigate everything thatâs concerns my health like how my body works, how it reacts to certain medications, what I need to be healthy, so I pay attention to all and try to learn about it so I know how to make future decisions.
0.777800	I know I have the ability to process and understand basic health information because I have a degree in Biology, so I've taken some classes that help with that. However, it's still hard to fully know what choice to make on some health decisions or what some things mean. I would say I have an above average ability but some people are significantly better at it.
0.900000	I absolutely have the capacity to make my own health decisions. I'm very familiar with medicine and healthcare and am very comfortable understanding jargon and no problems with the settings. Even if I wasn't, I'm well educated and more than equipped with handling what comes my way, including managing and understanding health information.
0.900000	I feel extremely confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information about my personal health, as well as services available to me. When I visit a doctor I make sure that all my questions are thoroughly answered and that I understand them before I leave. I also understand completely how to request visits for services, as well as fill out any information that may be needed. I also understand the importance of providing the most up to date and honest information in regards to my personal health, to the best of my knowledge, to my physician.
0.650000	Sometimes I feel the need to research information outside of what the nurse or doctor provides. They're not always thorough when they explain conditions or health concerns. They're especially vague about medications. I don't feel it is enough to just explain how and when to take medication. I should be thoroughly informed of possible side effects before it is prescribed. Once a medication is prescribed the doctor always seems reluctant to change the prescription regardless of the side effects. Many times I have to choose between continuing a medication that has terrible effects and is sometimes ineffective to treat a condition or discontinuing it altogether. When that happens the doctor thinks I am simply not following their recommendation when it is really due to bad side effects that I cannot live with. I am capable of understanding and following the doctor's instructions but sometimes they don't understand why I am unable to continue with their recommendations.
0.872200	I'm pretty insistent on getting questions answered. On the other hand, I have found doctors and nurses to be kind of vague sometimes and rushed. So on my end, I'm pretty confident in my ability to ask the right questions, but not always confident that I will get clear, decisive answers. 
0.816700	I am 41 years old, and also a parent to 2 children.  I have had to take myself and my children to the doctor many times, so I feel confident in understanding basic health information.  On top of that, I lost my mother to cancer, and have since had to accompany my father if necessary to some of his appointments.  My brother is a nurse, so sometimes I ask him for medical advice.  If I am not sure I ask our doctor to clarify anything I may not understand.
0.827800	I think my abilities are pretty adequate in regards to this scenario. I have a good vocabulary- and I know a smattering about many medical conditions. However, I am nervous in a medical setting- and just draw a blank on questions I should be asking during the course of an examination, or probable diagnosis.
0.833300	I feel I am 100% capable of understanding, obtaining, and processing basic health information and services. This is because of years of experience handling my own medical information with no help. 
0.677800	I feel I have a basic understanding to make positive decisions about my health.  I do however struggle with some of the insurance portions of health.  I also struggle with some of the terminology used in the medical industry.  I think overall I am average or slightly better at understanding health information.
0.816700	Every time I am finding myself interacting with the medical situations I make sure I ask the physician all the necessary questions. I listen carefully and make sure I have things written down. I also make sure to get everything what's needed from the front desk, such as follow-ups or appointments.
0.900000	I am always the one in my family (even with my husband) who goes over the medical information about each family member. I was there every step of the way and made all the decisions when my husband was in and out of the hospital two years ago. I think I have a pretty good understanding of how the health information and services work and how to make the appropriate health decisions for me and my family.
0.411100	It is very hard to obtain it all. With my condition I cannot remember a lot of things and cannot understand the terms that the doctor use. I get afraid to ask them for simple terms or written information so that I can go home and read lated
0.566700	I feel that I have the basic services needed to help me to understand health information that I may not necessarily understand on my own. Services in my hometown and well as my local hospital and pharmacy are always willing and available to ask for assistance when needed and are also friendly as to make asking for help as painless and easy as possible. 
0.822200	I feel like I am very well informed to be able to make my own decisions.  I may need my doctor to fill prescriptions but I am capable of doing my own research on my health.  I believe the best patient is a well informed patient.   While doctors might have the education, I know my body and how it reacts to medications.  I wish that Doctors listened to their patients more than just listening to what testing show them.  If doctors were taught listen to their patients I think they would have a better relationship with their patients. Those patients would also receive better care and would live a better and fuller life
0.811100	I believe that i am more than capable of obtaining and understanding information about conditions that i have had and basic information about medications that i need to take. I have in the past asked for additional information about prescriptions and uses and side effects of them at time
0.572200	I think I have basic understanding of my medical conditions but I wish I was more educated about how my body works, more importantly how and why my body has certain issues that negatively effect my life.  I often have to do my own internet research because medical professionals sugar coat things for me.
0.872200	I feel like I have all the capacity needed to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have not found any situations through any of my medical needs (a couple of surgeries, procedures, and just normal every day needs) when I could not clearly understand the information given to me or get my questions answered. 
0.872200	I feel very capable of obtaining and understanding my health information. I know how to find services to use to make health decisions when necessary. If I need help understanding something I use resources provided to find out the meaning.
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to understand basic health information and services as well as some advanced information. If I do not understand anything or need clarification I have no problem asking. I will avail myself of online learning as well if needed to make sure I understand a subject, not just for myself but for my family as well.
0.883300	I have a high degree because I am of sound health of mind and have resources to back me up. I have people close to me who are MDs and know how to find information by myself.
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have access to the information I need and can make informed decisions. Once in awhile I will have a hard time remembering some information I've been given or I'll forget to ask the doctor a question, but it's rare.
0.883300	I feel that while I am not a health expert I do have the ability to listen to what the doctors say and I can understand what I am told so that I am able to understand what I am being told by them.
0.672200	I feel that most of the time I can understand medical information if it is explained to me in broad basic terms that can be understood by a normal non medical person.  If the information is written in complex medical jargon I might need someone who understands it to explain it to me.  Generally when I am at the doctors office generally they will speak in basic terms I will understand them, but If I am presented with some medical terminology then I might ask the doctor or nurse to elaborate.
0.822200	"I am a relatively intelligent person so I'm confident in my ability to process information in general. The problem arises when medical terminology is used and not explained. This is particularly true of lab tests where I may be told ""X is high"", but not told why that is or what that means for my overall health. I have a chronic health condition that I had to read the medical literature on myself because doctors never explained things. "
0.888900	I feel that I can adequately understand and process the information I need. I usually don't need help with it wither.
0.838900	Yes, I understand the basic issues. I do know that I may not ask all the right questions. My wife does, though. I feel like I should just deal with things. I know that isn't the best way to handle health issues. But that is why my wife comes with me.
0.916700	I am capable to understand basic health information.  I have to deal with it with my parents, with someone I took care of and a friend.  I can also find out information on the computer when needed for basic health information.  I also have a cousin and a friend who are nurses but I did work in the medical field for about a year.
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information because I have a degree in the healthcare field. I also obtain knowledge by asking the important questions of my doctor. I also go a step further to research information provided to gain further understanding. I feel it is important to obtain a doctor that doesn't mind taking the extra time to make sure you understand the information they are providing. 
0.761100	I think there is a lot of information on the internet.  I also know enough people in the medical profession that I can get clarification on anything that I didn't understand.  
0.705600	I usually have little issue understanding most medical information my doctor or medical staff tries to pass on to me. On the occasions I do I have my wife explain everything to me in layman's terms as she is a medical assistant and can generally give me a good enough understanding to be able to launch further research if needed.
0.888900	I believe that I can understand health information when it comes to prescription drugs and I have some idea of a possible diagnosis because I always go online beforehand and do a search if I'm having symptoms that I'm not familiar with. I also feel that I'm competent enough understanding instructions on my own.
0.783300	I believe I can make appropriate health decisions if I ask the right questions and have good doctors and medical staff available. Sometimes doctors don't want to give direct answers because, I believe, they are afraid of lawsuits or my claiming they said something they did not. I would like it if they would put everything in simple language so that everyone could understand exactly what they're talking about. 
0.600000	I have been going to the doctor for my health issues for a while now and I feel I have gotten pretty good at filling out all the proper paper work but I do notice sometimes if I don't right down questions too ask I will become overwhelmed and forget to ask those questions the problem that I find id a lot of doctors and nurses are in such a hurry they make you feel very rushed and it feels like they are not listening to you that is why I always bring someone with me to help me remember everything
0.833300	i feel very confident in my ability to fill forms or read information about an illness, so this help me to make the appropiate decisions when are relate to my health
0.827800	I feel like I have decent capability to understand health information enough to make decisions about my own health. I try to ask my doctor about terms and diagnoses that I have difficulty understanding and see what he thinks it will mean to my future health decisions. I do research about about my health issues online as well, but mainly to help further understand medical terms and such, not as a primary source of information.
0.711100	I have an issue especially with most doctors hand writing. It's generally not legible. Secondly, medical staff are not always available to answer all the questions I may have. As such, I feel not very sufficiently equipped to understand basic health information.
0.766700	I feel that I am completely competent because I ask for insight regarding medical terminology that is confusing to me. I think it is important to ask the necessary questions with healthcare providers because they may feel that they are being understood. Thus, when I am in doubt I seek help from nurses, doctors, and pharmacists to provide me with information regarding any health concern. Additionally, my courses in speech and hearing and my medical terminology course have helped me to understand some basic health information. 
0.788900	I feel I have have a large ability to process basic health decisions. I am biased though, as I have a degree in human physiology, was an EMT, and am about to attend physician assistant school in May. However, before going to college, I did have a very hard time understanding what was being told to me by PCPs and felt what they told me was poorly explained. It seemed they did not care to explain conditions to me since they were in a hurry. This, in addition to complicated medical and insurance forms, made it very difficult to gain anything from visiting the doctor.
0.616700	I've never really had any confidence in dealing with this kind of stuff on my own. I've always been a rather sheltered and dependent person, so depending on the importance, I'd prefer it if someone were to go over it with me or walk me through it to minimize errors. I don't do anything like this that often either, so I'm sure if I had more practice, I'd be all right on my own.
0.816700	Iâm pretty confident of being able to do what was described above.  So far my medical issues have been minor and doctors have been able to explain the information to me.  If I ever need to deal for more complex information my father has had plenty of experience.  And I frequently look things up on the internet. 
0.733300	I feel like I have a decent understanding and comprehension of basic health information and services. I have gone to the doctor a handful of times as an adult on my own and thanks to a very helpful reception, I feel very capable of making choices and filling out health forms.
0.916700	I believe that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. My education is in Biomedical Science and I have some insight.
0.883300	I think when it comes to making decisions about my health, I feel that I'm fully capable of interpreting what the doctor's are saying and asking a lot of questions.  I tend to ask about alternatives to treatments depending on what the recommendations are.  I tend to trust what my doctor's say because I have a long standing history with them and they have a proven track record of having positive recommendations.  Any literary information I receive I'm fully capable of reading and understanding and usually do additional research myself.  The only thing I do is I have my husband take care of understanding the side effects of my medication so I don't get super anxious and dwell about the side effects.  I just let him know if I start feeling weird. I also make most of my decisions with my husband so that I have a support system.
0.916700	I don't have any difficulty in reading or processing or conveying any of the health information. I am at ease with it.
0.655600	I have a great capacity to obtain basic health information. There are many different sources that I can use to get an opinion. I have a good capacity to process and understand basic health information and services, but it could be better. I could ask more questions to have a better understanding but I sometimes do not ask when I should. 
0.850000	I think that most of the information I'm given is fairly easy to understand. If I don't understand something I will ask the Doctor or Nurse to explain it to me as easily as possible.
0.855600	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand issues regarding my basic health. I am able to read and understand documents and instructions given by my doctors. 
0.666700	It depends on the information, I need help understanding it sometimes when there is a emergency my mind just does not process the information and get confused on trhe details of it.
0.888900	Prior to my cancer diagnosis in 2012, I had a 10 year work history in the emergency department of our local hospital.  Also, in my 20's I worked for 5 years in the same hospital this time as a nursing assistant in the pediatric ward.  I do believe I have a substantial understanding of most health issues, not counting my own.  I also raised 4 daughters alone and the youngest has a history of severe asthma, so hospitals, dr's and nurses are second nature to me.
0.794400	I think I have a sufficient capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. Sometimes I feel the need to look online, ask a family member or contact the doctor for further information. However, I am usually confident in making health decisions myself. 
0.750000	I don't feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process the health information I need. I always feel rushed at the doctor's office. I get nervous and forget to ask the important questions I should ask. I get my blood taken every 3 months because I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I take medications to control these conditions and both are hereditary based. My understanding is just okay at best. Because it is hereditary and not based on foods I eat, it is difficult to get a full explanation of what I can do differently other than changing my eating habits and daily exercise. I want to know more about my risks and they really don't go into that. 
0.866700	I feel confident I have the capacity to understand, obtain and process basic health information and services needed regarding my health decisions.  I am able to focus and retain information and I when I don't understand something, I do not hesitate to ask the provider.
0.850000	I feel very capable. My husband handles all the paperwork for my family, though. So I don't really have any recent intricate experience with that.
0.916700	I have been reading about health my whole life. I am very interested in my health so I try to obtain as much as I can to make sure I stay healthy. When my doctor tells me something I listen to make sure that I stay healthy.
0.661100	I feel that I often have the capacity to understaind and obtain basic health information and services, but sometimes I feel rushed and leave not fully understanding what I need to do or what is going on.
0.650000	I feel I have the full ability to understand what ever medical problems I am dealing with. Any traditional diseases that I can come across I have learned about and am pretty sure that I will have the necessary knowledge to know what I'm dealing with
0.722200	Yes, I do think I could understand basic health information and services to make good health decisions. I know at my age now, I would not have a problem at this time. When I advance a little more in years, I might need more help.
0.733300	I think I can make appropriate decisions but I have lost faith in the health field as far as being understanding and taking the time to hear you and then fully explain diagnosis. I've had a specialist prescribe me medications with telling me the name of it and cut me off and walked out of the room when I had questions. I have to rely on the internet to get info I need
0.866700	I am disabled right now and have had health problems so I'm not working but I am a Registered Nurse.  The health care world has changed in the past 5 years so some of the questions have changed and it seems to be more difficult to get the time and answers needed from health care professionals. I usually have the knowledge to obtain, process and understand basic health information and usually am able to obtain services needed.

0.888900	I'm young and don't experience any significant mental impairment that would impede my ability to comprehend information presented to me, health-related or otherwise. I am in fact diagnosed with a mental/psychiatric condition, but it does not impact my capacity in that regard. I have always been able to independently seek out and obtain any necessary health-related services without an issue.
0.700000	I feel like I do a good job at asking enough questions to understand what is being told to me and if I have to do something to fix it. I usually do my research and would call back to talk to my doctor or a nurse and understand more if I have questions. For the most part I think I retain a lot of what they say to me. 
0.761100	I am an intelligent person who unfortunately has had to deal with health issues, info and services for many years. This required me to become a very pro active patient. I keep abreast of everything to do with my health issues and am up to date on everything including medication and treatment options and services available to me.  And when I have a question or concern I consult with my physician or my husband who was in the health care field for 30 years.
0.883300	I feel that I have a big ability to fill out required paperwork and if there is room questions about my health. I also feel that I can ask health personnel any questions to clarify anything I need clarification on.

0.844400	I think that i am quite capable in speaking with medical staff. I have to make decisons medically for an older relative and my sick children. I have a working knowledge of medicine and an interest. 
0.616700	When I go to the doctors or hospital, I feel there is a lot of red tape that we usually have to through with paperwork and our insurance information. Our health insurance cards sometimes are not updated in the system or our deductible is not what the card says. If you want to your chart or personal information, you always have ask like it is a big secret. We rely on the healthcare officials to assist us if we have questions.
0.850000	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information. I am an excellent reader and can comprehend most things I read. 
0.900000	I feel confident in my abilities to gather information regarding my health and ask appropriate questions of doctors if there are things I do not understand. 
0.783300	An average person does have difficulty filling out medical forms. I am only knowledgeable in this due to the fact that I have an associates degree in medical billing and coding. I often need to help patients fill out their forms on a regular basis. Some of the forms are very hard for a person to understand. I myself have not yet figured out why the forms can not be written in plain text that patients can easily understand. 
0.538900	Sometimes health questions and health forms are a little hard to understand. I feel as if i can fill out my own forms they are just sometimes hard to understand
0.883300	I feel very confident in my ability to understand basic health information. I make sure to ask questions if I don't know something and always hold my doctor accountable for the information they give me.
0.811100	I feel like I have a pretty good comprehension, and even if I don't know a term, I can read up and educate myself on a topic all on my own. I also feel that I do tell doctors my symptoms, but I tend to be pretty anxious, so I don't always ask all the questions that maybe I really should.
0.783300	I am fairly confident I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health info. Sometimes the info can be overwhelming and I may seek clarification or explanation from another source but after going over things a few times I am sure I can get the gist of it.
0.694400	I feel that I have the knowledge to understand about 75% of what is presented to me by doctors and nurses. They typically ask if I understand but to be honest typically when first presented with complex information it takes me a minute to process it.
0.616700	I have really bad anxiety, especially about my health. Unless my husband is in the room with me, or it's something routine like my psychiatrist appointments, I usually forget everything the doctor said right away. I'm always too scared to ask questions. 
0.916700	I think I'm able to process medical info fairly easily. I've had a lot of hospitalizations in my lifetime and I studied bio and psych in college so I can capably read my own cbcs and most of my test results without needing much explanation. 
0.783300	I believe I have the capacity to understand and process health information. However, I am reluctant to ask questions of some doctors and will do my own research later instead.
0.733300	I feel like I am able to handle myself at a clinic appointment.  At times I will need help on where to go and how to schedule folllow ups.
0.533300	I do understand somethings when it comes to the basic health information we receive, but donât really understand some terms they use for explaining what it really is. My wife is some what in that feels so she explains a lot to me.  Based off the little I know and my wife knowledge I feel that I will make the right decisions.
0.855600	I feel that I am quite able to understand, process or obtain what I need to make appropriate health decisions.  If I do not understand something or know what I need to do in situation I would ask the appropriate people or find the information needed.

0.811100	I feel pretty confident in my abilities to handle my care though some things are above my abilities to comprehend when it comes to medical care.
0.833300	I am certain I have a lot of the information. With the advent of the internet as a resource, I can always google for more information on specific terms. My main concern is what the doctor thinks and what, if anything I should be doing for preventative care. That's just as important as understanding the medicine I've been prescribed.
0.883300	I am an educated person with no mental deficiencies; at this point I feel capable of getting the information I need. However, I find it very difficult to navigate medical insurance issues, possibly because the industry seems to make it deliberately difficult for the consumer. And I am not confident that I will be able to function in the same way in my old age. 
0.583300	I feel  i have adequate skills to read and obtain my health information. Sometimes though it is hard to get access to my doctors when I need them. 
0.916700	I always pay attention to what I am told in regards to my health, so I feel that I have a great capacity to understand lots of information in regards to my health. I am competent to make quality decisions in regards to my health because of this.  
0.766700	I feel like I can understand most medical forms that I have to fill out at the doctor. I can understand the pamphlets that the makeup. But I don't feel like I get enough information to understand test results. Even if you ask for a copy, it is in jargon that normal people can't understand. When I ask to have the results interpreted, I just normally get a quick answer, like its normal or its high. But I don't understand it fully. Sometimes I get better more in-depth information on the internet. But then I worry that the source is maybe not accurate. 
0.883300	I really feel that most people have to rely on the information that their doctors present to them.  That is something that can lead to unfortunate circumstances when you consider that doctors are humans and some humans tend to take advantage of others.  
0.783300	I think I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. When I dont understand something I utilize resources to help me.
0.866700	I feel very competent in making decisions regarding my basic health services.  I have a chronic disease that requires constant utilization of health services.  I have gained a lot of experience in dealing with my insurance company and the health professionals that treat me.
0.916700	I feel  like I am well educated enough to fully understand everything I need to be able to obtain, process and understand all the basic health information that is provided to me by any medical practitioner that I would potentially visit. 
0.744400	I often re-read the medical forms to be sure I am answering them to the best of my ability but I find myself holding back questions for doctors because I don't feel comfortable in my own abilities in sounding educated. I am in constant pain from fibromyalgia and have had difficulty in finding a doctor that won't just give me some pills for depression and send me on my way. 
0.866700	I have the full degree and understanding to make health care decisions. I am fully understanding of my health care decisions. I have noone to help me overall and have no choice but to be fully understand my own healthcare choices.
0.811100	when ever i go to see the doctor, i ask questions over what i am not clear about and they take their time to explain to me and make me understand everything i need to know. so with that i can make all the decision i need.
0.916700	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain any information that I need. I'm not afraid to ask when I have questions and I have healthcare providers that are willing to explain things to me as many time as they need to.
0.455600	Im pretty good when i go see a doctor.  I usually alwaus have someone with me who can help me understand what is being said and what information is given to me.  I do not always understand medical terminology that is why someone is always with me.
0.783300	I feel like I am well-prepared to obtain, process and understand health information. Nothing in particular prevents me from understanding information and I do not mind asking questions if necessary. I don't really need help in this area but am confident I could find someone to assist me if needed.
0.916700	I feel that I have complete control over the health and Medical services I need. I have a primary doctor that I see several times a year and I am completely comfortable asking him any questions I may have concerning my medical condition.
0.827800	I think I have the the capacity to understand basic health information, but sometimes I don't think of the right questions to ask until I'm home and I realize I should have asked more questions while I was there.  Then it's too late and I search the web for information which is maybe not as good as getting information specific to my needs from my doctor.
0.888900	I feel as though I very much have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I understand a lot about my medical conditions and can read and understand information very well. 
0.916700	I think that I can comfortably ask all the questions that need to be asked and digest all the information presented to me. I think that it is easy enough to find the information you need online before talking to other medical health professionals.
0.427800	I know that I have the full capability to understand health information given to me by medical professionals, but I often don't take the time to process it, or ask questions so that I can gain the full understanding.
0.766700	I feel capable of understanding information provided to me. Sometimes I don't feel comfortable asking questions depending on the doctor or provider. That makes me concerned about making a decision about my health. 
0.833300	I feel as though I have the capacity, or ability to deal with my basic health information, services, etc. I have been able to do so for most of my adult life, with minimal difficulty. Occasionally, I need a hand understanding something technical, etc, but by and large, I get by just fine. I feel that I have, and will continue to make appropriate decisions regarding my health and well-being.
0.766700	I think that i cam reasonably understand what is being told to me by health care professionals.  My dr is very good about taking time to clearly explain things and make sure that i am understanding what is happening before moving on.  Occasionally if i have questions i need to call back in to talk to a nurse to clarify something but that doesnt happen too often.  I also have a biology degree so i can understand a bit more behind the concepts that he refers to than the average person might.
0.866700	I feel I do a good job asking for clarification on any points that I don't understand when it comes to basic health information. I try to make sure we cover all the bases and want to always do my best to provide a good informed decision when making a health decision. 
0.850000	I feel confident in getting information on most things at my healthcare providers location and over the phone. The biggest complaint that I have is with billing. My bills are never up to date (on their end) and so I never know what is going on.
0.844400	I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information and services.  The challenge comes in when the doctors assume that all is understood and speak/move quickly.  Most of the time I am assertive enough to stop them and ask my questions, but at times I don't even think of the questions until I am out of the office or the doctor has already left the room.  Bedside manner isn't always top notch either. 
0.838900	I think for the most part i understand well.  Sometimes the medical jargon is confusing and sometimes prescriptions are contradicting, but all in all i understand well enough to know what i am being told. 
0.855600	"I believe that I am 95% competent in regards to obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services when needed. I reside with a nurse so most questions I have can be filtered through her.  Anything she is unaware of she can research to gain a broader understanding of the information needed and I go from there. If there is anything that neither of us understand, then the problem is generally past the point of ""basic"" and a specialist needs to intervene.  The only time I ever had issues obtaining and processing information about my health and the services rendered was when I was in labor with my child. To be fair, I was a bit preoccupied with the pain to really understand what was going on around me at the time."
0.916700	I feel like I am competent enough to ask the questions that I have to the medical professionals. If I don't understand the answer I will ask them to explain it better.
0.788900	I feel somewhat confident i have the capacity to obtain,  process and understand basic information and services with regards to making appropriate health decisions due to the access of information provided by internet and other media outlet.
0.872200	I feel I have a good understanding for the most part when it comes to health information and services. I try to ask questions although sometimes I am uncomfortable and do not ask my Dr. them. If I don't ask the Dr. I always go home and look up further information online. I always read the info that the pharmacist gives me and feel pretty competent. 
0.855600	I feel like I have full capacity to grasp and obtain all of the needed information. I also have full ability to research on my own. The thing I struggle with sometimes is trying to absorb all of the information when the doctor is talking to me. If they rattle off a bunch of values from my bloodwork, for instance, sometimes I have trouble remembering what they said an hour later.
0.816700	I think that I am smart enough to grasp most concepts and information I to obtain in regards to me health.  More importantly though I know when to ask questions and seek information I do not know.  That means asking a nurse or a doctor, or seeking the information on-pine. I am not afraid to ask if I do not know.
0.705600	When im not sure about a medical term I go online and i get as much information as i can. Before i would go to a medical appointment without preparation . As soon as i was in front of my doctor i would forget everything. Now i take a notebook write down all the symptoms i have, in addition, i write down all the questions i have. Lastly, I believe my basic knowledge and what i can gather from online and what my doctor tells is what gives me the knowledge to make health decisions for myself.
0.916700	Yes I do believe that I can handle any information that I am given by any medical professional or any professional at this point in my life. I am intelligent and can grasp the content of any discussion.
0.677800	I feel that most of the time i am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information by myself. But sometimes i need the help of a medical assistant to help me.
0.650000	i have the basic knowledge and quite experience about all the stuff listed in the previous questions because i visit hospital ocassionaly and for checkups and treatments
0.866700	I feel like I've gone to the doctor enough that I understand how to communicate with them. I've had to present questions before or ask for clarification and I think gotten better at it/gotten more confidence as time goes on.
0.683300	I feel i need to ask around a little bit to really get the information, but it's usually very easy to obtain
0.888900	I feel that I am completely capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.  I may forget to ask a question at the doctor's office but I'll do the research to figure out an answer.  I'll research online, ask a friend with a medical license or call my doctor's office.  
0.838900	I have asthma and over the last 20 years I have learned to be an advocate. I read and learn and when I am with my doctor, I ask very concise and direct questions. I want to know about better medications and any side effects. 
0.811100	I feel that I absolutely have the capacity to obtain and understand health information.  My main issue is that I don't always ask clarifying questions because it takes me a while to process information.  
0.916700	I believe that I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding information regarding my health. I have a hearing loss and occasional difficulty understanding professionals with strong accents, but will make sure I have a thorough understanding before leaving the appointment. The internet is also a valuable tool and I have reached out to professionals by phone as needed. 
0.672200	I would begin with educating nurses about using a universal precaution approach. Always use plain language when speaking with patients. Nurses should use plain, jargon-free words when discussing medical information. Individualizing the teaching by using words the patient is familiar with will enhance a patientâs understanding. All patients benefit from the use of plain language. Assess patient's understanding of the information provided.
0.711100	Sometimes medical vocabulary is quite technical and only familiar to those within the field. I usually will refer to the internet or family members that work in healthcare professions to clarify any doubts. I do not trust myself 100% to understand and make decisions based on my knowledge only.
0.827800	I understand as long as it's explained in layman's language. I tend to think of questions after it's too late to ask them.
0.833300	Since I come from an applied science background (engineering), I feel that I am pretty good at sorting through actual medical literature, research, etc. regarding conditions and their treatment. However, I'm much less confident dealing with the administrative side of medicine and health - finding the best providers, ensuring that all billing and payment go smoothly, etc.
0.883300	I am almost always capable of understanding health information, but when I am not, I quickly resort to my smartphone to research any and all information necessary. I will also be sure to write down any questions I may need to ask.
0.883300	Quite good. I'm quite interested in and pretty knowledgeable about science and health. Even if I'm not familiar with the specific topic, I can usually grasp new things quickly. The internet is a great resource, and I'll usually do a lot of research there. I'll ask the doctor questions when needed as well, but I've learned that doctors are not as well-versed in all aspects of health as some people may assume, and I always look beyond the doctor's opinion into scientific research and other resources.
0.694400	I have an okay understanding of the human body and the mechanics that happen within.  I know how to google things to help that understanding where it's vacant. This helps partially illuminate for me some health information that other people when exposed to it would be oblivious to.  However I'm no doctor or nurse and I struggle to really get to the bottom of things that ail me.  Additionally I don't know what's the appropriate questions or information to ask a doctor or tell a doctor to help them better diagnose any health problems.  Some times my terminology might off and there's misunderstandings from using the wrong terminology.  I really suffer from also not understanding all the specialists such as neurologist ( i know that one, but don't know most of the other ones).
0.916700	I believe that I possesses an adequate ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I don't recall ever needing help understanding this information as an adult. 
0.916700	I feel totally confident in my capability to obtain ,process and understand basic health information.As someone who is highly educated, having obtained a Masters degree , though have never been in the labor force I do think I have the proficiency to the needful.
0.827800	Overall I would say that my capacity for understanding and processing basic health information is very good.  I find the reading material easy to understand, if I have questions I can usually ask the nurse or doctor at the time of my appointment.  I also can look online for questions regarding my condition.
0.822200	I think have the ability to access the information I need to make good decision about my health and the health of my family.
0.672200	I believe that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, especially when my daughter is with me to help me fill out certain forms and explain certain things to me. I have needed her help many times, especially with documents with small print.
0.916700	I feel like I am capable of understanding and communicating with health professionals about my healthcare.  I also feel confident about making appropriate health decisions for myself.
0.761100	I can understand different health conditions by reading about causes, symptoms, and different treatments online.  If the doctor told me something about a condition I had I would do my own research on my time.  I understand the risks when taking prescription medication.  I have also filled out forms applying for health insurance and have filled out other official forms online.
0.794400	I feel that I am very well equipped to handle these basic health information and  services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I always take my time reading the information presented for me and ask the right questions. 
0.900000	I completely understand what my medical professionals says to me because I am always asking questions throughout the whole process so I clearly understand what is been said and I generally go over the main points with the professionals at the end of the conversation so we are all on the same page when I  leave and if something is still not clear  when I get home I call and get it clarified
0.705600	I think that in general I am able to get the help that I need in understanding health information and services. At the hospitals that I go to, quite often the information that the doctor conveys is backed up by written reading material. My main trouble comes with pharmacy medications. It is not always clear how to go about taking it - for example, suppose I want to switch from taking something in the evening to taking it in the morning, can I do that? Additionally,  suppose I suspect something is a side effect of pill X, then i hate going online to figure it out because its just not the same as seeing a doctor. 
0.916700	I am absolutely confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself. I always ask my doctors all questions I feel I must ask in order to fully understand any information I was given during medical visits. 
0.783300	I feel that if I am presented with a medical situation that I do not understand by myself that I know where to go for help.  A family member, have the question ready for a nurse, the internet or my insurance call center help line.
0.661100	I think that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. This past year I have had to sign up for health care four times due to job changes and it really made me understand what I am getting and paying for. And how messed up our system really is. 
0.861100	The degree I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information is extremely well. Iâm a 2nd year medical student and have grown in knowledge as an upcoming physician. Of course I donât know everything, but when I myself need to go to the doctor Iâm not afraid to obtain information, understand it, and Iâm confused or have questions, my doctor is very well in explaining it. I sometimes consult with my family in important decisions, but other than that Iâm very good in making appropriate decisions when it comes to my health, and what is between me and my physician. 
0.916700	"Although I've made a few trips to the doctor, and my children were delivered in a hospital, I primarily manage my own health. After dealing with chronic, and ultimately fatal, illness in both my parents, I was motivated to educate myself on proactive means to maintain my health so I don't need to see health care professionals. This has worked very well for me for 30 years, and I hope it continues to do so. But yes, I have a lot of knowledge about the current western medicine, to the point I had one of my mother's doctors ask if I was a medical professional. I said , ""No, but I guess you could say I am a 'lay' professional. :-)"""
0.455600	I don't feel as if I have the capacity to obtain and understand basic health information greatly. I constantly need help in understanding basic health information. 
0.833300	The problem is with the fact that the basic health information itself that is so dumbed-down it gets in the way of making appropriate decisions.  Health services are then rendered based off of the inadequate information.   There's never any mainstream knowledge given to the public to help them understand how to implement knowledge to help themselves from the ground up; a perfect example of this is with nascent iodine, which helps the thyroid which is the master gland of the body responsible for balancing all other organs.   Without nascent iodine, fluoride, intentionally put in drinking water overwhelms EVERYONE'S thyroid.  But from an allopathic perspective, 'if ain't broke and the test doesn't say so, don't fix it'.  The Rockefellers taking over medicine in the 1940's and helping create the modern version of allopathic medicine is disgusting!
0.672200	I have zero difficulty understanding, processing, and obtaining appropriate health information that concerns myself. I have confidence in myself to figure out what I need to look up and how to go about obtaining the information or services .
0.516700	I think I am average when it comes to this kind of stuff. But there is some things that I just do not understand. So I ask for help when needed, even if that is often.
0.588900	I feel that I think I know what i am doing, but it is hard to be sure that what I think I know, is actually correct. I think this is done on purpose.  I think the forms should be written in a way a high school graduate could understand. Alot of the material on these forms are overly complex and does not make sense.  Help is hard to find . 
0.916700	Yes. I am confident in my ability to understand the information provided to me and then using that information in order to make healthy and well educated decisions. I also do follow up research myself, to verify any information given to me.
0.738900	I believe that I am perfectly capable of filling out documents or even asking the questions that I need. I typically write down things so I don't forget them, especially those that are important questions. My doctor is patient and provides answers in a thorough way. And if I don't quite understand things,  they will put it in less technical terms. Some things are easier to get than others.  If I still feel lost, I will Google terms. 
0.822200	I think that I would be able to retain as much information initially. If there was anything that seemed confusing I would then write it down for later so that I could research it myself to the best of my ability. However, before it would get to that point I would ask as many questions as I could.
0.761100	I believe that I am capable, perhaps not highly, to understand basic health information and to what degree I may not be I use the internet to seek further information and guidance. This has helped me greatly improve my knowledge of various health issue
0.855600	I feel like I am pretty good at obtaining and understanding health information. I have an English degree and teach high school reading, so I am more proficient at the English language than most people. When I do not understand something, I generally Google it to find the answer. I often know exactly what the doctor and/or nurses will tell me before I even go in because of my own research.
0.900000	I think I am very capable in this area.  I am not by any means a professional, but I do read a lot, and have seen many documentarys and educational materials about health related issues that I am quite comfortable with my ability to read and understand as much as I need to.
0.833300	I read a lot of content outside my field of expertise. I've also had experience interviewing various artists and technicians about subject I'm unfamiliar with. 
0.488900	I feel like I have a general knowledge of how to take care of myself, but I find doctor's visits awkward and tend to feel rushed and without time to ask questions or get explanations for what the doctor is doing.
0.811100	I feel that I am very capable of processing the information and making informed decisions.  However, I find that I often forget to ask pertinent questions that I later think of at home.  I may also do some more research at home and find that I have more questions.  There have also been times where my doctor was unable to provide me with a satisfactory answer to my questions.
0.827800	I believe I have a good capacity to obtain all of the information/services I need to make health decisions, because I constantly ask questions when something is unclear, or do my own research later (online or second opinion, etc.), and I have a fairly good ability to process this information as well. I have good listening and reading skills, and a passing knowledge of basic health information myself.
0.883300	I have no problem understanding my condition when I talk to my doctors or nurses. If they use a term I am not familiar with I would ask them to explain it to me in a way so that I could understand. When I am confused or unsure I always ask questions until I get a clear picture. I don't mess around when it comes to my health since it's one of the most important things I value.
0.777800	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information in a high degree, it's better when a doctor or nurse talks to me about the issue and tells me what should I do and medicines I should take, I rather to receive this information in a conversation, I can understand written prescriptions but not perfectly and sometimes I struggle with it.
0.677800	I am of sound body and mind right now so I don't need help supplying basic health information.  There are periods that sometimes my mind draw a blank and I might need just a little push in the right direction.
0.916700	I feel very confident in my ability to understand basic health information, and to obtain services if I do need help understanding what information is given to me.
0.688900	 I do not feel like I am adequately prepared to deal with a health issue. The facilities near me are very bad and most people I know refuse to go to them in anything short of an emergency. The one time I went they told me to drink some tea and use Nyquil. They charged me $350 for that information. I asked numerous questions and the doctor just didn't them and seemed more interested in getting me out of there. From that experience I took it upon myself to start researching  and learning what questions to ask and where to go that would provide adequate healthcare. The internet is great source of information and I feel I have benefited greatly from using it for answering some minor medical questions. 
0.883300	I believe I am pretty competent and intelligent and would be able to understand any basic health information I am given and any services I would need to have in the future.
0.883300	I feel that I am fully capable of making the appropriate health decisions. I make sure to ask the doctor any questions I have by making a list beforehand. If the doctor gives me information that I do not understand, I always have the doctor explain it to me. If there is a question with medication I do not hesitate to speak with the pharmacist. I will generally read a lot about anything that I have been diagnosed with as well. 
0.872200	i work in healthcare so i understand lots of medical terms and procedures and what i do not know or understand i simply ask for clarification on. when it comes to my health i always make sure i am 100% sure of all the information needed to avoid any situations.
0.438900	I feel like I have a basic understanding of most medical terms, but some of the jargon remains opaque to me.
0.827800	I feel I'm very capable of understanding documents in general because I read them frequently for work. Reading health documents is a little more complex but the basic idea is still the same. I can easily search online for credible information and get a variety of views on what is best for me.
0.833300	I definitely have a decent understanding of medical information that pertains to me when it's presented. Occasionally I'll need a little bit of help or extra information from the doctor, especially when it come to steps I have to take in order to control my condition.
0.866700	I feel that I am very capable of being able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services I need to make appropriate health decisions. I make sure there is clear communication between my health care providers, and do what I need to do to become literate as possible to maintain a healthy life.
0.794400	I obtain information most of the time, although I may have to study and ask questions to completely understand what I read or hear.  I usually need the doctor to take the time to explain everything and to take the time to answer my questions.
0.772200	I feel that I have the overall capacity to obtain and process my health information but the emotional and time pressured environment of healthcare appointments impedes my ability to do so. For routine care it doesn't matter so much, but when there is a problem with your health or someone you love and you only have 15 minutes to discuss it things can get overwhelming and confused.
0.888900	I have full faith in my abilities to understand my health information and what services I require. I am of sound mind and judgement to take care of myself in these issues and any concerns regarding my own health.
0.900000	I feel I have a full capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as I often do read all of my material from my provider. I also will ask questions if I am unsure of how to complete any forms. I also make sure to answer a health questions so that I have a better understanding with my health care provider. 
0.900000	I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Although I am not a medical professional, I am intelligent and educated. I'm pretty good at navigating difficult situations like the health area, even though I don't have an insider perspective.
0.900000	I have a degree in Health Information Management. This has provided me with a thorough understanding of medical terminology and concepts. If i encounter something that i am not familiar with i at least have the capacity to find the answers i need.
0.633300	I think that at least half of the time I can obtain all of the information I need to made appropriate health care decisions.
0.866700	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed. I am very adamant about understanding before I leave and if for some reason I don't or forget a question I meant to ask, I will call to ask it.
0.766700	I feel like I've got a good degree of understanding but medical literature can be confusing and a lot of times I forget what I want to ask the doctor or I feel too nervous to ask him
0.688900	I am fortunate enough to have a father who was a paramedic, one brother who is a nurse anesthetist, another brother who is a physicians assistant, and a fiance who is attending medical school. I have opportunities to constantly get in contact, ask questions, and have multiple opinions on a single matter. This being said, I utilize this perk often, as many times I do not understand or get proper answers from medical professionals at offices, hospitals, and urgent care centers. There are times that I feel as though words are purposely being used to go over my head about things, to avoid detection of a unsure opinion. I don't normally have problems understanding material and pill descriptions, just on occasion, problems with the professionals themselves, and their explanations. 
0.772200	I feel like I am decently well-informed at the basic level about health information and services and I do feel reasonably confident in my ability ask my PCP or other doctors I've seen to clarify instructions for my care. I'm also somewhat of an outlier in that I have several medical professionals in my family (physicians assistants, registered dietitians) so they are always available to help me understand anything my doctor may miss.
0.755600	I feel I need to ask most of the time about a small part of the forms when filling them out but most seems fairly easy. If I have questions they are always helpful in answering but I do feel at time I need to ask. I also have others I can ask and do research for myself. 
0.916700	I feel I have a high degree in understanding these things myself. Ive had to make important medical choices by myself including surgery
0.838900	I am generally able to understand information that is given to me, but sometimes there is a lot of information given all at once, and verbally, and it is hard to process it all at the time, particularly under the stress of being ill, so questions may not occur to me until later, or I might forget some of the details when there is a lot of information given at once.
0.900000	I feel like I can read and understand basic medical information.  I feel that I can do this on my own, without any assistance.  And, I believe that I understand what is told to me or give to me to read well enough to make my own medical decisions.
0.900000	I'm young enough, reasonably smart, and have an internet connection so, yes, I certainly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.
0.866700	I feel I have a very good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  When things get beyond basic and into more complicated subjects, I may need a medical professional to help simplify things for me.  If I read things enough times, I generally catch on to things.
0.805600	I feel that I am completely able to read and understand basic, moderate, and even challenging health information. I can say that I am not good at asking questions or probing further for fear of wasting time. But, I have never had an issue with the explanations or information given me. I also have no problem understanding or filling out medical forms. I have the awareness and knowledge to make health decisions regarding myself that I understand and am comfortable with. In fact, I don't find most health forms, diagnosises, or health information that complex actually. So, to answer the question I am completely comfortable in this regard. 
0.900000	I do understand my health record because I do write and speak English. I am also a nurse so I can understand my record with no problem. I understand when the doctor talk to me about my health issue.
0.916700	My mind is sound and I have a B.A. degree in English (literature), so I can easily read and understand medical instructions and information about health services. If I need to know more about a health condition, I ask my doctor or nurse, and research the topic online.
0.916700	I consider myself to be intelligent, inquisitive and self-aware.  I always did well in science and was in advanced placement classes in biology in high school.  I research any and all health conditions that I've had, as well as those health issues my family and friends have experienced. Once, a medical professional commented to me that he thought I worked in the health field.
0.805600	Most of the time I get enough information to make informed decisions regarding mine or my loved ones care. I feel that I'm at a good level of understanding. 
0.677800	I'm somewhat good at get the information i need to make a right or appropriate decision .i used the internet and my family doctor when something arise and try to understand the possible course or  treatment and to know which is best suited for my need and necessity and i seek help from my family member that have medical experience 
0.738900	I feel like for the most part I am able to make the appropriate decisions . If there is something that I do not understand I make sure to ask questions to fully understand it . If it is a bigger decision I take all the information I can from the doctor . I then go home and google and read as much as I can about the problem . I also talk to any and everyone who has went through the same thing . If I am still lost on what is going on I go back and talk with the doctor . If something doesn't click for me I keep asking till I fully understand it all . 
0.777800	I feel that i have a basic understanding of medical knowledge. A lot of times I will need help understanding things regarding medical terms if it's something that I'm really unfamiliar with. It can be hard remembering all the information they throw at you at once so sometimes I like to have another person there with me to help out with that.
0.766700	I think that for the most part, I can get the information process it pretty well. If I do not understand something though, I always ask questions, either to the doctor or the nursing staff because that is why they are. They are there to answer things that you may not be completely sure of. When they start using the medical names for conditions or treatments, I start to be lost, until they break it down for me to understand.
0.861100	I feel like I never have any issues when I am given instructions or information from my doctor. I would say that the only issue that would keep me from telling all of the information behind something that is bothering me is having a lack of comfort with the specific doctor or nurse I see that day. This usually only happens during urgent care visits. I always ask questions even if the doctor does not seem interested because, as the patient, I deserve to know exactly what could happen to me. Health is something that people should have a blasÃ© attitude towards.
0.750000	I feel like I have a good understanding of basic health, I'm also not afraid to ask stupid questions or ask a question more than once or ask it a different way so that I understand what I am hearing. My mother in law is also a nurse so if I don't understand something she can usually break it down into something i understand.
0.861100	I have no problem  processing information, understanding health information, and to make health choices. I can obtain health services quite easily myself.

0.777800	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions. I also know that it's not always easy or something you can accomplish in a timely manner. Health centers and hospitals differ, as do health professionals. I have a primary care doctor who is unfortunately overworked and somewhat difficult to speak with to the extent that I need to. On the other hand, when I had a fracture almost two years ago, all the specialists I saw after I left the hospital were very forthcoming with help and information, and they listened well. Their assistants were superb. However, my experience in the ER was terrible. Really terrible, especially while being in the midst of trauma. So I feel that my capacity to obtain what I need has been very uneven.
0.838900	I don't have extensive knowledge of the medical feild and services, but I do think I enough of the basic knowledge to make good decisions in regards to my health.  I do know that if it is something I know nothing about,  I am not afraid to ask for assistance from people who I know are much more knowledgeable.  I also will do any research I  can to obtain a better grasp of the situation.  
0.822200	I pretty much am able to obtain, process and understand basic health info and services to make health decisions.  Since I'm not in the medical field sometimes it hard to follow what the doctors are saying, especially if English is not their first language.
0.811100	I feel like I can get the info from the Doctor. If I have any further questions, I'll ask health professionals I know, call my Dr. back,  and/or do additional research online. 
0.916700	I feel that I have a great understanding of medical terminology. I have worked in the medical field, as a secretary and now a billing coordinator,  for many years. I have a clear understanding and health information and the services that are needed to make appropriate health related decisions.
0.844400	I can see and read perfectly fine. I don't like it when the Dr. doesn't give you time to respond to any concern that have arisen while he is talking to you. I almost always feel rushed. And uncertain what was even said. I have had so many come in and start going on about what needs to happen or what is going on right away. They don't give you time to process anything. You might have a question early on and the not hear anything said after that. Or else completely forget the question you had trying to comprehend what is being said. 
0.861100	I feel like I have a capacity to understand what information I am given when it comes to my health. If I do not understand, I know who to ask to help me to understand the information.

0.916700	I have never had a problem understanding health information. I frequently research myself when a medical condition occurs before I go to the doctor.
0.522200	I feel like when the time comes and im actually in a doctors office, I freeze up. Its like taking a test, I get really nerbous. I dont know what to say.
0.811100	I have never really had a problem reading any material or filling out any forms.  Sometimes there is some medical jargon that I need to ask questions about though.
0.650000	I feel that I have the basic capabilities to read and understand what is being written regarding my health. If I am unsure about something then I ask the person that gave me the form to explain what is written. 
0.722200	After having to go through the process over and over again i have gotten somewhat good at filling out the forms that I need to . Sometimes I will call the pertaining agency or office that issued the documents and let them assist me over the phone. It may take a while but we get it done
0.805600	I feel I can effectively obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself.
0.761100	I think I have a moderate capacity to in obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. The times I need to help is when there are many technical terms being used or when information is complex and has many interwoven factors that must be taken into account. But overall, I think I do a fair job in understanding and processing these things. 
0.883300	I feel I am able to make appropriate health decisions - I ask a lot of questions and if unsure I will look it up online to make an intelligent decision
0.916700	I am a doctor's daughter and grew up around medical terminology, so it is very easy for me to understand a medical practitioner when they are explaining something to me.

I am also able to use medical portals to ask any questions which may arise after my appointment has ended.
0.916700	Yes, I have been in the medical field of work for 20 plus years and I have a good understanding of all situations involving medical care. I ask as many questions as I need to be fully informed.

0.850000	I believe I am able to understand the basic information to make the right health choices. I am also very confident in asking for help to understand and make my own decisions.
0.766700	If I dont understand what a doctor is saying I can research on the internet. Services are dependent on my finances, so if I have the money I have the services. The bedside manner of a doctor matters too because if I feel like their agitated then I wont want to ask questions or share health information.
0.850000	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision to a high degree. The few times that I do not completely understand any medical information I am comfortable and confident in asking questions so that I can obtain a better understanding.
0.655600	I feel like I can understand some health information, but a lot of it is confusing because of all of the medical terms and the way medical professionals talk.
0.550000	I feel like I have a basic grasp of common medical terms but the medical industry has gotten a lot more advance and complicated and they're are many terms that I am unsure of and don't really understand.

0.611100	I think I have a good understanding if the information is broken down in a way that's easy to understand. The basic information is easy to understand but the complicated stuff needs to be broken down for me. When it feels like it's becoming overwhelming, that's when I start asking questions. 
0.533300	I feel that I can get the information I need, but not form doctors or nurses.I can all the information I need from the internet. I trust it more than some doctor who may no keep up to date to what is happening in the medical world
0.866700	I feel like I understand basic health information very well. It is when the big fancy words come in where I need a little understanding.
0.900000	I feel that I am perfectly capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services need to make appropriate health decisions.   As a leukemia survivor, I have lots of practice taking in medical advice from doctors and doing my own research to make decisions.  
0.600000	I feel that I can obtain information that I need about the process. I think when it involves a specialist for a specific issue, rather than a primary physician, information gets a little harder to obtain.
0.900000	Based on some poor health care experiences in my teens and twenties, I rarely use doctors except for acute situations (i.e., where I need a prescription for antibiotics). When I think I need a doctor, I collect the symptoms, figure out my best guess for what's wrong with me, then go to the doctor with a careful explanation of what's wrong and what I likely need. Doing my own diagnosis to then get it confirmed by a doctor is a pain, but it has resulted in a lot better health care for me. I believe I can competently obtain and understand health information. I have also been successful in obtaining the few services I need. I make a point of trying to manage chronic conditions (such as obesity and obesity-related issues) without pharmaceuticals. Drugs, in my experience, are best used for acute problems. Change in behaviors, such as eating, are usually necessarily for chronic problems.
0.833300	I feel pretty confident in my ability to process information and comprehend what is being told to me by a medical professional. If there is something I don't fully comprehend, I do not hesitate to ask the health professional for clarification on the issue and subsequent treatment. Based off my experiences, doctors have always been very good at clarifying certain points and re-wording things in a way that I can understand. There are also so many resources available now to people online which makes it easier for anyone to obtain basic knowledge and/or clarification on any health issues that might be occurring. 
0.916700	I do try to keep abreast of medical information, and am in the habit of asking my doctor questions. I feel that although he is the professional, it is my life and he works for me.
0.900000	Besides my own level of education (the equivalent of a BS, MA, and MSW), I grew up in a family of physicians and have been around the medical world for my entire life. I frequently get advice about my health decisions from family but I feel comfortable in my ability to understand the information and access what is needed. 
0.855600	I think i do not have an issue with basic health information. The more difficult things or if it is my first time with a new medication I might need a little assistance figuring out how to take it but other then that I d not find it difficult.  
0.833300	I feel I have all the tools and resources I need to be able to understand basic health information. My health insurance company has a nurse hotline that I can call as well if I have questions or need assistance understanding information. My doctor is open and tries to be as available as possible whenever I have questions as well. The internet helps further my understanding about any questions I may have too.
0.688900	I believe that I have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information in most situations. Most of the time if you don't get lost in random jargon the point is clear. From time to time doctors and nurses say stuff that makes sense to them but doesn't to a normal individual that doesn't work in the medical field. 
0.916700	I'm pretty good at understanding health stuff. I understand vaccines are important, second opinions are important for any major health issues/procedures, and I have a firm grasp on information. For example, I have a fibroadenoma, and I understand that it's a non-cancerous tumor that is actually very common, and I understand the ultrasound, sample-taking, and other information that led doctors to conclude that there is a 9999/10000 chance that there's nothing bad going on.
0.888900	Having gone to 90% of the Doctor/dentist visits by myself I have learned to fill out all the info and ask all the questions I need to. The only time I have needed help was when I was coming out of surgery and had to have my mom sign paper work.
0.794400	I feel that I have the capacity to understand, obtain and process my health information because I pay attention to what is being told to me, and I personally care about what may be happening to me and want to fix it as best as my doctor and I can. I feel that I try to be as open about what is going on and ask questions that I worry about or information I do not understand. 
0.883300	I can easily obtain, process and understand basic health information, I am very open and don't mind asking any questions about things I do not understand and have never heard of. When it comes to my health I want to be well informed about anything pertaining to any sickness or issues I may have. I like to know if there is anything I can do to reverse the issue at hand or if there are any treatments or not. I like to have the information in pamphlet form and I use online forums and research sites as well.
0.883300	I think that I always feel the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions

0.866700	I believe that I am pretty good at understanding health information, and when I don't understand, I ask more questions or come home and do more research about the issue.
0.555600	After being given information, whether it is by brochure, verbally, or through a call I always ask the doctor or nurse to state everything in layman's terms for those who do not understand the medical terminology they use. Once they state everything in layman's terms, I repeat back what was stated to ensure I am correct with the information they have provided. 
0.844400	I feel I am extremely confident in receiving, understanding, and communicating when it comes to medical records or issues. I have never had a problem in any of these areas. I even help with the my grandmother when it pertains to her medical information.  
0.855600	I feel I have the full ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.850000	I have had issues with my health specifically migraine headaches since I was twelve years old.  I feel I have learned to get the information I need to make appropriate health decisions.  I think that when I don't understand health information I seek counsel from someone I trust.  
0.900000	"I've worked in health care, and know the kinds of things that make a difference when doctors and others are making decisions.  I do some online research before I go to appointments, and usually have questions I'd like answered.  I also have been volunteering as a ""practice patient"" for medical students, which gives me a sense of how good doctors go about doing their work."
0.916700	When given information I attempt to understand it the best I can. If I'm unable to understand something, a healthcare professional is always there to help me. Any time I ask for explanations help is given to me.

0.855600	I believe that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I understand these the most when presented in Layman's terms. I have difficulty when medical terms are used exclusively and assumed that I understand the meanings. Because I feel like my doctor is rushed at appointments, I think it's very helpful when given a printout summary of my visit when leaving as well as the option to access my medical information, test results, etc from an online portal. That way, I have my diagnosis in writing and can do further research later if need be in order to make a more informed health decision.
0.916700	Assuming that a doctor or other provider is not withholding information, I believe I have the full ability to understand and process information related to my health.  I believe I have an adequate understanding of medical terminology to comprehend what a doctor is telling me and make an appropriate decision.
0.644400	I feel that i have a moderate amount of ability to obtain process and understand basic health information. I listen and read information carefully sometimes more then once.

0.888900	I feel that I have total capacity to understand basic health information between asking my provider, a family member, or google.
0.888900	I feel I have the total capacity I need to make appropriate health decisions. I can read and understand health-related materials provided by a doctor, and when I don't I can easily ask someone or look it up online. If I ever have a question, I can research the answer or ask a professional.

The cost is unreasonable and the time involved in making and going to an appointment is sometimes overwhelming.
0.866700	I am confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for my family and I. I have spent 10 years working in the medical field so I likely have an advantage, but I have never really struggled with any of this to begin with. I am very particular about my health care providers and will not stick with any doctor that does not explain things well or make information I need readily available and accessible to me.
0.883300	I believe I am self-sufficient when it comes to this regard. I do not depend on anyone but  myself to get the information I need.
0.772200	I feel that overall I am able to process the information I get from my doctor or nurse.  I do need to sometimes look up things and get some ideas of questions to ask when I am not sure what the information means exactly for me.  As for my basic health I have a good understanding of what I am told. 
0.800000	I feel i am 100% capable to understand the processes of basic health and the services needed to help me make the right medical decisions. I went to nursing school so i understand medical terminology plus i tend to ask questions when i dont understand something. It is very helpful to do research at times to better understand. 
0.750000	I feel like I'm capable of managing my health and understanding basic information. I do feel like I don't ask all the questions I need to to truly understand because I feel like I'm a bother to doctors and nurses.
0.616700	 I withhold information that I believe will be used against me or give the doctor the idea to refer me to other doctors because that is a slippery slope.  Medical staff do not have time to answer your questions.  They go by textbook and give answers without having examined you or checked your history.  I don't trust medical staff.
0.861100	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I also believe that if I am given health information from a doctor that I can assess the situation and make an informed decision from there regarding what is appropriate for my continued health.

0.572200	I feel like I have good ability to understand written health information, but often get confused or feel under-informed when speaking directly to doctors or nurses. I often do not feel comfortable to ask the questions I need to in order to understand fully what health decisions I need to make. 
0.822200	"I think I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. I consider myself a smart person and have an advanced degree. My mother is a nurse so I always have someone to ask and I write down all my questions before I go so I don't get nervous and just say ""it is fine"" like I used to. I have tried many doctors and FINALLY found one who speaks in plain english and is clear and not rushing me out. I have decent insurance and it gives me a better chance to go to the doctor and get what I need. "
0.405600	I would say my capacity would be in the middle, a lot of what is said is foreign, but If someone is willing to take the time to thoroughly explain everything it would be alot easier to understand and be capable without anyone else's help. But in my experience most people don't want to put the time into explaining as that takes time. 
0.833300	I'm a college educated middle-aged man.  I do not have a background in the sciences other than basic classes.  I feel that I can understand consumer level medical information.  But when I hear lipid counts, or other medical tests/jargon, I start to glaze over, honestly. 
0.711100	Well i went to the hospital a lot of times when i was young due to my asthma so i have a pretty good idea of the basic information that is given to me. Anything else i would ask questions and look up anything i can online.

0.650000	"I have the capacity to obtain and understand health information, but I find doctors to be a little intimidating. So, if I have a question about my medical condition for them then I might not ask in case it is a ""stupid"" question. "
0.883300	I feel like I have the appropriate knowledge needed to make informed decisions about my healthcare and if I don't, I will ask for it to be explained.
0.811100	I believe that I can fill out forms sufficiently enough to get the job done. However, when it comes to family history I have a hard time remembering everything that my family has told me about their medical backgrounds. I understand most of the conditions that doctors describe to me, but I have a hard time understanding the causes of them.
0.855600	I have a pretty high capacity to understand everything regarding health information and services. I graduated high school and have a degree in college. The only difficulty I might have is hearing clearly, because I have a slight hearing loss. 
0.900000	I am not shy about asking health professionals about anything, even things many people find embarrassing. If do not understand their reply, I will question them until i do understand.

0.838900	Over all I can put justification to all basic information that a doctor or nurse my tell me. If there would be something that i might not understand completely i am not afraid to ask. I personally have a very good relationship with my primary doctor, and i am very comfortable around him. 
0.900000	I am fully capable of gathering the necessary information for my health concerns. That being said it is very difficult to obtain this information in today from doctors and nurses.
0.766700	I think I'm fairly well equipped to deal with all of the basic health information. However, some of it is still convoluted. The documents are frequently bordering on the cryptic and the health professionals aren't always sufficiently clear. 
0.916700	I only have one body, one life in this world. I know that doctors are not fail-proof, so I ask all the questions I need to in order to make sure I am getting the best care possible. It helps that my husband is extremely interested in our overall health and can hold an informative conversation with doctors. It makes them take us much more seriously!
0.616700	I have the ability to understand English. The problem is that doctors have not found a way to describe probabilities in a way that adequately captures the way we assess risk in everyday life.
0.733300	Even though I am not very confident about my own decisions in this matter, I think I should be able to decide for my own health choice because I think I should be able to make decision for myself.  If needed important ability for it, I should try to have any capacity to understand basic health information by asking and learning for final choice for my own health.
0.866700	I think I'm pretty capable of understanding it. Sometimes it can be unclear what services are offered, whether and where they're covered by insurance, things like that. It's more the kind of administrative stuff that I find confusing sometimes.
0.888900	I feel like generally I am ok in the specifics of going to the doctor's office and understanding all my test results/procedures. I have not had any major health concerns yet, but I try to follow everything they suggest when it comes to the regular checkup. I feel as though I'm a smarter than average individual (like in K-12 I always was in the 99th percentile on standardized tests), so I'm pretty good at understanding and analyzing information. I don't need a lot of outside help, but I can ask them if I have any specific questions about my current condition. 
0.861100	I feel that I can understand basic health information quite well.  I rarely need further explanations or very minimal explanation.  I know when I need to ask for more information to better understand health related information.  
0.888900	I'm fairly confident I have the ability to obtain, process, and understand health info and services due to my reading comprehension skills, question forming skills, and the general knowledge I possess.
0.861100	I feel that I am very capable of understanding basic health information and services, which allows me to make appropriate health decisions.

0.766700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand most of the time. Some times I don't get the answer I was looking for or expecting. I do make sure to insist and get the best answer from the doctor. On occasions the doctor comes in and out and does not allow time for asking the questions I want.
0.838900	i always make sure to ask any questions I have with my doctors and nurse, even if they sound stupid.  Often times though, I will think of questions I need answered long after I've already left my doctor's visit and I have to go online and research what little I can but still be unsure of decisions.
0.800000	I'm for the most part somewhat aware of my health so when it comes to health and filling out forms most of the time I don't need help because I've been on top of my health and know what I need to ask and to add in a form when visiting the doctor. 
0.777800	for me i come from a household with a large medical background. my mother was a nurse, my brother an emt/nurse and i helped both study very often. medical things like in the survey come to me without too many issues but there are sometimes i get tripped up with terminology but overall im good with it
0.850000	I feel I'm better than the average person at being able to process and understand basic health information. My mind is still sharp and active and I study about my conditions in order to understand them and their causes. I know that many people my age are unable to do the same.
0.816700	I feel like I am able to ask for clarification from medical professionals but am also fortunate to have a mother who worked in the medical profession who I can ask additional questions after the fact if I need additional assistance processing information.

0.772200	I feel that I have the resources it takes to understand basic health information. I make sure to ask questions when I see a health professional. I also have access to the Internet to do research on anything that I am uncertain about. I fill out my own medical forms and help others fill out their medical forms. Family members often ask me for assistance when it comes to understanding forms or information provided by their doctors and other health professionals. If I have any questions, I know who to ask for help, or where to do my own research for clarification. 
0.866700	I feel that I have the capability to read and understand health information. If the language is complicated, it might take me a little while, but I am confident in my ability to process what I need to.
0.583300	i feel that i i sometimes have issues obtaining medical information solely becasue im unfamiliar with the process i would go about to obtain it. I work in health care so im familiar with documentation and how its processed on a very basic level. However this is for the patients that i aid in the care of, and not my own medical forms. 
0.850000	I feel confident that I have the capacity to understand all the health information. Sometimes I do not ask all of the questions because I am nervous
0.850000	I recently had numbness in my right toe due to a pressure on my L5S2, occurring from when I had to lift a 300lb person after finding them intentionally overdosed. When I realized that the problem wasn't circulatory - neither bathing in warm water nor going for a walk helped - I hit up urgent care. When I arrived, I succinctly described my issues as above. They immediately send for a neurologist, because they could rule out other causes due to my ability to explain in sufficient terms. I also grew up with my grandparents due to a shit parent, so I had to help them understand pharmaceutical interactions.
0.800000	i am not that old for me not to understand what the doctors trying to say. i am having trouble to read their writings but pharmacy can do it for me. so i am certain that i can get what i needed

0.805600	I am very capable of understanding basic health information to make health decisions. As long as the condition isn't something I am hearing about for the first time i am quite capable of understanding medical talk. I also went to school to be a medical biller, but never made a career out of it.
0.916700	I am fully able to either understand the information I'm given or ask questions about it until I am comfortable that I understand sufficiently. I've been doing this for a long time for family members as well as myself. I also have experience selling health insurance and worked with the case management and customer service departments to advocate for the members so I was exposed to a lot of technical information which increased my capacity for understanding the terms used.
0.916700	I feel that I am more confident than most because I am highly literate and have experience helping others decode medical information.  I also research things thoroughly to make sure I understand.
0.794400	When it comes to my health, I feel that I am able to understand when the doctor talks to me and describes what's wrong with me, what I need to do, and what will happen from that moment of us talking.  I know I don't have extensive knowledge in any of their fields but I know the basics of what they're saying to be able to ask questions if I need to and to be on the same page when we need to make decisions.
0.888900	Right now I am dealing with probable lung cancer so it has been scans, pet scans, xrays, primary care physicion, my Pulmonologist, a lung surgeon, and now being sent to an oncologist! So I have had my share of procedures and Doctors in the past couple months. I can honestly say I do not have to have someone go with me as I can understand everything they say. Of course it also depends on the Doctor and if he will take the time to explain. I am at 69 very capable of understanding and managing my own health care!
0.916700	I'm pretty confident in my ability to understand and process whatever information doctors or nurses tell me and if I Have any doubts I always ask for clarification. If I am not satisfied with a response I ask again or look it up online to get more information. Understanding basic health information is really not a problem for me at all.
0.872200	I think that I'm well equipped to read documents and understand information that is told to me. In the event that I do not understand I do not have any problems asking for further explanation so that I may understand.
0.888900	I have the right to ask because itâs dealing with my health. You got to understand whatâs going on with you and itâs okay to ask even if you donât know whatâs going
0.761100	I feel that I have the ability to understand and process most of what a health care professional has to tell me.  There are times when i am somewhat confused about what they are saying.  When this happens i try to ask them to explain in more detail so that i can comprehend what is going on.  I feel confident in filling out medical documents/forms when needed. But, again if there is any confusion i just ask for it to be clarified.  Now, at the pharmacy, i don't always ask all the questions that i should. I usually refer any questions about medication back to my doctor/nurse. 
0.833300	I have 100% confidence in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. If I do not understand anything, I will ask until my understanding is sufficient. 
0.633300	I think I can understand some of the information, but when there are a lot of medical terms it can be hard to know what's going on and what my options are.  I like it best when the doctor explains the options and information in layman's terms.
0.900000	I feel like I have enough knowledge to understand my health information and if there's ever something I don't understand I know what to do in order to obtain the information I need.  If I don't understand something I can always go to a relative or search online for more answers.
0.416700	I am not a good patient. I need help from my brother and mother when I get handed or told anything. They have to be the ones to tell me everything and my next steps to do. 
0.844400	I feel fairly confident that I am able to navigate most healthcare situations in order to get the information I need.  I have rarely had any sort of complications when going to a doctor's office, pharmacy, clinic, or hospital on the occasions I have had to go.  If there is a question I have, I tend to almost always ask when I am at the doctor's.
0.855600	If I do not understand something, it is due to my lack of medical training. I know how to find the answers and can do so easily. 
0.916700	I feel 100% capable of finding and understanding the health care information that I need, and in consultation with my doctor making the decisions that are best for me.
0.811100	I feel like I do have the capacity to obtain all the info that I need. It depends if I am intimidated by the doctor or the doctor is busy
0.916700	Being an educated person, who can read, write, and comprehend, I feel confident that I can make decisions on my own, or with minimal help from others. Being involved in your own healthcare is very important.
0.916700	I am confident that I am competent to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have a degree in nursing.
0.650000	I believe I have the capacity to understand some of the basics about health care.  The doctors and nurses do not take enough time, though to fully answer questions.  I feel like I'm on an assembly line when I go to the docs\ter.
0.311100	I have physical impairments that stem from a car accident that prevent me from doing specific things. The disability or impairment has had a severe effect on memory and I am often times unable to remember what I was doing or going to do just moments ago. I can process the information, but I need someone there with me because I will forget what I read within the next 30 minutes. I will remember that I read something, but have a vague idea of what it was that I read .
0.883300	I try to be as open and honest with my health care provider as I can. When I visit the health care provider I accept the fact that in the end they are the expert in the field. I may have some limited knowledge and will give what little I know and ask questions based on that. However, I look to them as the person who can best understand and explain things. It is their field of expertise and seek them for their knowledge and help.
0.750000	I think I can understand most of what I am told.  If not I will ask for a clearer explanation and if I don't get it I will look it up and try to find out more about it.

0.900000	I feel I have the capacity to process the information. I usually think about what I want to talk to the doctor about. Also I try to inform myself about the condition ahead of time. I truly listen to the doctor and when I feel I need to ask a question, I do interrupt and ask a question. 
0.733300	My mother is a nurse so when it comes to 'medical talk' I usually have an understanding of where my doctor/nurse is going. I am also very capable of understanding what is being said to me. I make sure that i am asking appropriate questions if for some reason i don't understand something. But for most of the time, I do understand basic health information that is given.
0.916700	I am very confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and service whether that information is being given to me by a doctor, nurse, or hospital so that I can make appropriate health decisions.
0.777800	I feel like I am very capable of understanding any health information that providers give to me. However, my recent experience has been that providers may give you conflicting information and may be highly unavailable to answer questions and communicate poorly in general. For example, my husband has high blood pressure and his old PCP said to try to reduce salt, while his neurologist said that salt intake doesn't matter. In our community, we have facilities run by Banner, and our experiences has been that these doctors have poor communication and don't feel bothered to answer questions or return phone calls. 
0.838900	I believe I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions to a very high degree being a medical professional myself and being married to a healthcare provider
0.883300	I am very capable of receiving, giving and understanding information to and from my medical practitioners and facilities. The information can be overwhelming if you have something major going on so it's always good to have someone you can count on to help if there is an emergent situation.
0.872200	I feel I have an average degree of knowledge about obtaining and understanding health information needed for myself and family members.

Also doing my own research on the internet or could provide information and explanations. 
0.844400	I feel like I'm mostly able to understand basic health information. I'm comfortable with forms and written information. To the extent I have some minor problems, there are times when my mental health issues act up and make it difficult for me to be assertive about asking questions or correcting assumptions. That's pretty rare, though.
0.766700	I feel confident i can access the information regarding my health and/or easily find someone who can help me understand. 
0.783300	I feel confident I can obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have worked in a medical environment with physicians for years so am familiar with much of the terminology.
0.916700	I feel that when I go to the doctor I understand how to fill out the forms given. I understand the things that the doctor is trying to tell me. If I don't know a certain aspect of something I ask question so that I will have a better understanding of it. That being said I feel that I can adequately have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.883300	For the most part I've had no problem understanding anything involved with going to see a doctor, but I have had to ask for help to understand health insurance.
0.761100	I often obtain the information I need to understand and maintain my health in such a condition, that I am not a nuisance to myself and my loved ones. Sometimes healthcare providers resist. They don't have time for me, they have too many patients, they don't care, etc. That's a sign for me to find a better healthcare provider.
0.794400	I am currently a college student and decently educated in biology and chemistry, along with anthropology. While none of these things alone would help me very much, the combination of them I feel gives me a pretty good understanding of basic medical information. I can usually understand what a condition or illness is doing, or why, at its core. 
0.883300	I feel pretty confident in my ability to read and understand basic and even slightly complex medical and health information and services in order to make good health decisions.  I'm not an MD, but I do have a bachelor of science and I have studied and taken classes on health and medical issues, so the extent to which I understand a lot of the scientific terminology and complex issues is usually pretty good.  If I don't understand something, I will ask, but generally my doctor or health provider is able to answer my question in such a way that I can understand afterwords.
0.900000	I think I have a very good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I generally take time to read through medical information that is provided and ask any questions I might have to my doctor or nurse to fully understand the material.
0.916700	I feel that I am perfectly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have never had a problem with communicating to my healthcare providers any questions or concerns about any of my conditions.

0.705600	I feel like I obtain most basic health information but it is very hard to process and understand the information. I feel like I already make appropriate health decisions, but when a doctor sits down and tries to tell me what is wrong with me and what I should do about it it can sometimes get very confusing. I have never understood why doctors use technical terms with regular people because a regular person has no idea what the doctor is saying half of the time. If a doctor were to sit down with me and slowly explain what is going on in regular, every day terms, I would might understand better what is wrong with me whenever I go to the doctors office.
0.900000	I feel I have the full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I can under my doctor, ask the questions I need answered, and take the action necessary.
0.827800	To make the appropriate health decisions  and understand basic health information  I feel like I'm pretty confident I could handle it by myself.  Sometimes if I do need help I will just find somebody and have them explain it to me.   I would say 75% of the time I could figure it out.  However I never sign anything that I do not fully understand. Because me and my wife work separate shifts  I have no choice to go to the doctors myself and fill everything else as well as take my 2 children to the doctors and fill their information out.   Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%. Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%
0.600000	usually when i have a health problem and visit a doctor, I give all the symtoms to the doctor and try to explain them as detailed as possible and ask all the doubts i have without any hesitation and when any form is to be filled out I usually need a help as i dont understand all the things asked for and complete the form.
0.855600	I believe that it is fairly easy for me to access and understand my medical plan. I have freedom to make educated decisions regarding my health.
0.872200	I work in a pharmacy, therefore I feel that I understand more than that average person may concerning health and medicine. I've also always been intrigued by health care and things of that sort.
0.888900	I can certainly obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I don't feel I'm at the point where I need help with this. If there is something I don't understand, I do ask questions. 
0.577800	I do not really have a lot of medical knowledge about the anatomy so when a nurse or doctor is trying to explain medical conditions or what needs to be done, it is a little difficult to understand what exactly needs to be done. I put my trust in them that they have my health and well being in their best interest but sometimes I wonder, especially with the billing they are going to send to my health insurance career, it might be a time where they want to add some dollars in their pocket. Luckily I have my wife who is a nurse who can explain everything in a much slower manner once they leave. This is very helpful because then I have time to process what exactly is going on and then we can come up with the best possible decision regarding my health.
0.916700	Yes i know about all these things because when I was young my mom and dad taught me everything I need to know about my health and things of such.
0.783300	I feel like I have a fairly average capacity to process and understand basic health information as long as it doesn't get too technical about the medicinal or diagnostic aspect of it. I do feel fairly confident in my ability to make decisions based on this information. I feel more hesitant about my ability to obtain such information, as due to anxiety I find it difficult to ask relevant questions in real time. 
0.838900	I think I am very capable to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make health decisions. I usually know when to ask for more information as well as help to understand that information.
0.800000	"I'm a very patient and curious person, so even if I encounter something I don't understand, I will do what I can in order to understand it, given enough time. I may not be the smartest person around, but I often make up for that with persistence. I'd consider all but the most complicated of topics within my reach (and those complicated topics out of reach simply due to not having the resources available to me to study them farther). Since the question here is in regard to ""basic health information"", I feel confident in my ability to come to a solid understanding, if needed."
0.816700	If I am given a document to read, I can understand most of not all of it, and if I have any questions regarding the document, I am able to ask the doctor or an employee about it. Sometimes if I am asked an open-ended question (for example, if everything has been okay since my last visit), I tend to err on the side of not mentioning what I consider small or irrelevant problems. Overall though, I feel confident about my ability to get the information and services needed to make decisions about my health.
0.883300	I feel that being a well-educated person who was a caregiver for an elderly family member that I have a strong knowledge of health and medical information. If I am uncertain about a medical condition or a decision, I feel I have the necessary research capability to find the necessary answers or resources.

0.655600	I believe that i have full capacity to obtain, process. and understand basic health information. If I do not know the answer I can usually get it, and then understand it. However, there are some instances in which everything is way over my head, but for the most part, I feel competent. 
0.794400	I have enough ability to understand the basic health services and information given to me and the ability to obtain information about my health conditions. With the internet I'm able to have a full view of what is going on and have the ability to bring up things I've researched to doctors. 
0.794400	I think i have a mediocre understanding of how to process and go though my basic health information. I also have the ability to process and understand it quite well.
0.861100	I believe that I have the mental capacity to read and understand complex issues as well as basic health information and services.  I have received a higher education (Masters Degree) that has helped me learn how to do this
0.916700	I have complete capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic and complicated health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions.  I have a background in competitive athletics and know what to look for and listen for with injuries, and my academic schooling is such that I have a good understanding of science, biology, and the way such things work.
0.838900	I feel pretty confident understanding medical information given to me and i am not shy about asking for help if need be. i also know that not all doctors know everything, so i have also done independent research into various topics. so far, i have been lucky to have good doctors and nurses.
0.633300	I typically understand what they are telling me, but I find that my biggest problem is remembering it all. A lot of times I will only remember 2 or 3 things we talked about and forget the rest. This becomes a problem because I can't put all the pieces together and remember the entire conversation and how it all relates to each other. 
0.744400	I feel like I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding most basic health information. I sometimes need help understanding how some medical diagnoses affect me, but otherwise, I am competent enough.
0.827800	In this day and age you don't really need a other individual to help you understand. A person can simply go online and search what is needed to be search to fully understand. The internet gives a person a wide range of information needed if an individual doesn't receive the help needed by a staff.
0.855600	I feel like I have near total capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am able to read and write English, I feel like I am fairly well versed in health care forms and what they need, and usually understand what a health care provider explains to me and I am able to ask them to elaborate or explain further if necessary.
0.833300	doctors often speak in a term that I can not answer, I almost always go with a family member to understand things more and I like that apart from medical prescriptions written the doctor tell me with his words what he is sending me because I do not understand his writing
0.722200	I believe I have a basic understanding of health related information when it is laid out in simple manner by a doctor or nurse.  If there is something I find confusing or hard to interpret, I'll on occasion ask for some elaboration and a better explanation to help me be more certain.  In that way I don't leave misinformed.
0.827800	I feel, with my level of intellect and reasoning, I have the capacity to process and understand basic health information. If I don't process and/or understand it the first time around, I have the wherewithal to ask questions of others and to get answers in that manner.
0.861100	I feel I am able to obtain and understand general health information.  However, sometimes in a situation where I feel like I am being rushed (short doctor's visit) I forget to ask questions or don't realize I have questions until later.  
0.833300	I feel like most information is readily available to those who know where to look, or know whom to ask questions to. Google is a great tool. Taking notes or receiving a pamphlet about what is medically going on, you can go home and do proper research. When I'm in the moment of receiving a lot of information, I process what I can and tend to wait till later to ask questions. The more often you receive that medical information, the more likely you're going to understand it subsequently. 
0.688900	I feel that I can understand and process basic health information well but obtaining it is more difficult. I do not like to ask questions that have been on my mind or ask someone to explain things to me. In addition, some knowledge I have of my own medical history is faint and I will need to contact a family member to know it and tell the doctor.
0.844400	I feel like I am quite able to understand general medical information. I rarely have issues comprehending or understanding information given by a doctor or other health professional. I am able to make choices I feel comfortable with and feel mostly confident in my own abilities. 
0.655600	I feel fairly confident about it; I have little to no medical knowledge but I feel I have the capacity to ask as many questions, no matter how trivial or redundant, until I feel sufficiently informed about what I need to know.
0.638900	I think I have the capacity to understand basic health information but I do often check things out online and by doing so, it can often make me question things that the doctor or nurse have told me.  I think the more I research, the more confusing it is and I then almost want to question the doctor or nurse about certain facts they are telling me.
0.705600	I feel like sometimes the pamphlets and print outs are way too much information and it's so much to read. I'd rather have the cliff notes. Sometimes I worry about giving too much or too little information while talking to the nurse or the doctor. Or I forget things and then I remember after the fact. Sometimes I think doctors are in a rush and they also dont always take the time to explain things to you in an easy to understand manner. Or they don't give you enough options or time to decide on options. 
0.855600	I am pretty confident that i would be able to get all the information i need by asking my doctor questions about what ever illness i have and i would also do my own research. If i did not understand something that the doctor said, i would let him know.
0.788900	I feel confident in my ability to understand what I'm told by my doctor.  I am also proactive in researching anything that I may not understand or didn't think to ask and  ask follow up questions.  I've never felt as though I left without obtaining and understanding information I was given.
0.788900	When it comes to basic health information and services I am fairly confident in my ability to handle everything myself without issue. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate myself around 7 or 8, where 10 means fully confident.
0.916700	I like reading all the paperwork handed to me by my doctor so I can better understand whatever condition or issue I may have.  If I don't understand a particular condition I always ask my doctor or the nurse.  If I happen to be at home, I usually email my doctor and also look up the definition of certain medical terminology on the internet.  All in all, I like making sure I'm well aware of any condition or illnesses. 
0.694400	I feel I'm at a point in my life that if I need to know something about my health I am going to ask a doctor or a nurse and hope,they give me the best answer they can. If I do not understand I ask them to explain it a little more. 
0.794400	I definately have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  However, I do have difficulty trying to have discussions on this health information with my health care providers.   He would rather joke and laugh, then be available to answer questions.  And if I call on phone, I cannot get a hold of a knowledgable person.
0.872200	I generally do not have any problems obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have taken quite a few college courses about health and medicine. Health and medicine has always been very interesting to me so I have done quite a bit of research in different areas also.
0.838900	I feel I can understand basic information given to me but I do sometimes have a problem obtaining information when I need it from my providers. I also don't always have the time to ask certain questions. I ask what I can but sometimes I will think of something later and by then there's no one to ask
0.761100	I think that I have capacity to manage all the information but in any real situation I often miss some information, do not feel confident to make connection between the health issues and what is important to share with the doctor. I forget some health issues from the past, After a visit I need time to rethink everything again and to talk to the doctor but nobody has that time, I read a lot of health articled and follow famous health blogger, knowing some information I feel confused because sometimes I see conflict between the information I know and the doctor's opinion. I would like everything to be consistent and logically understandable but it is not. In some of the cases doctors are working with old knowledge, and they do not make connection between the health problems and prefer to focus on one instead of the total picture.
0.916700	I can completely understand information pertaining to my medical conditions. I also make sure to bring my spouse to any important appointments so that we both hear the information and so he can ask questions if I don't think of one. 
0.827800	When it comes to my health conditions, I understand the basics. If itâs a new health issue that I might have, after consulting with a doctor I usually go online and gather more information if necessary. I also talk to my family or friends who might be suffering from the same illness and get their take on the matter. Iâm pretty okay when it comes to understanding what is going on with my health. At times, there are things that I donât understand so I confined in my husband who helps me better understand what the doctor has said if given me.
0.916700	I think I have the full capability to make my own decisions regarding my own care. I think if any problems arose, I would be able to handle them in full. 
0.827800	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate decisions regarding my health in a high degree.
0.705600	I feel that I have the general knowledge to understand what I need to do when it comes to medication and any questions I may have about my health. However, deeper information regarding serious health issues may take time to comprehend. 
0.766700	I can understand and fill out quite a lot about my own health. I have been doing that ever since I was a kid. My parents did not help me much as they do not speak English very well. So I even had to fill out their medical form when they are at a hospital or just a simple doctor visit. Thus, I have more experience about this than anyone in my family. Plus, I want to know the condition of my health or any of my family health thoroughly. I don't want to miss out any little details that would delay the healing process. 
0.827800	I feel like I have a great amount of capacity when it comes to understanding and processing health information when the wording is in everyday language. When the material use a words I don't really know the meaning to that's when it can get a little confusing. If I know it's information I really need 100 percent understanding on I will most definitely ask the doctor until I comprehend what is asked of me.
0.866700	i have the capacity to understand health information and services since I went to college and listen extremely well and I don't hesitate to ask questions. I will often research beforehand so I can ask questions to the doctor.
0.827800	I feel that I have a high capacity for learning about and understanding such things. I worked very closely to medical professionals while doing medical registration and billing for a while and also had a very strong interest in neurobiology, anatomy, medical diagnoses, and pharmacological pursuits just to scratch the surface. I'm quite sure I can make appropriate decisions concerning my health.
0.722200	I don't think I'm that great at it.  I typically search stuff on the internet and get myself overly worried about it.  Then I do ask questions of the medical staff but usually it's kinda brushed off.  I do ask questions a lot which they probably don't like, and I try not to come off as a know it all because I definitely see them as the experts.  
0.805600	I feel pretty capable.  I can mostly handle it on my own, but I do need help with medical terms some times.
0.900000	I feel confident because at one time I was considering becoming a nurse. My mother was a nurse and I took a medical terminology coarse 
0.750000	I feel I have the capacity to obtain and understand basic health information given the wealth of information available. I however feel most doctors are uninterested in being thorough and want to get patients in and out so they don't provide or unwilling to provide good medical care and just want to order some tests and prescribe something to treats the symptoms of whatever ails someone based on some robotic intepretation of test results. 
0.900000	I feel well-equipped to understand the materials given to me. My educational background is in Psychology and Pre-Medicine, which means I've taken a good amount of coursework in the sciences including biology, chemistry, and (obviously) psychology. This material challenged my reading and information-processing capabilities and has taught me to understand medical information more thoroughly, though I am no physician!
0.755600	I am an injured veteran. So most of my care comes from the VA hospital. I do feel like I have the capacity to understand quite a bit, but sometimes my doctor isn't always available to answer my questions. In the past, I have also had many issues with misdiagnoses and am honestly not 100% sure what causes many of my issues. Several different doctors have told me different things, so I'm not sure what is right, and what is wrong.
0.672200	I believe that if I do not understand something about my health I have the ability to ask health experts the right questions. I am usually capable of understanding the benefits and risks of any course of treatment. I am capable of understanding the costs also. Overall I think I can make informed decisions.
0.866700	I feel I am highly capable mostly because I have worked within the medical field and psychiatric field for the past twenty years.  
0.783300	I can easily obtain, process and understand basic health information.  When it comes to major health information, it is a bit harder to understand as the words the doctors utilize are harder to  understand.
0.677800	I feel fairly capable of understanding, and obtaining the proper information related to my healthcare and any conditions I might have. My background in partial medical helps me to better understand things than most, however, this can sometimes lead to me not asking questions that I should because I believe I understand something when I might not have the full (or most up-to-date) information on the subject matter. But as a whole, I find I am capable of understanding, and asking enough questions to get the information I need to decide and understand what care is being offered.
0.777800	I feel that I have some capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information based on my own intellectual capabilities. However, I am pretty educated and still find some information confusing and hard to understand. I feel that I have a limited ability to make health decisions based on what I can understand, but there are still things that I need to ask for clarification about. 
0.816700	I am extremely intelligent. I can read and comprehend what I read. Even though I don't claim to know everything, but I know enough to fill out a medical form with my information on it.
0.533300	Due to the group of people that I have around me to support me, I have no problem getting medical information without having to go through my doctor.  Generally I do not easily make health decisions for myself and use this group of people close to me to help.
0.633300	I understand what is common knowledge. Some medical terms stump me,.. others are common sense. I think that if i look up a few things i would be able to process and understand the basic information to help me make the appropriate decisions. 
0.666700	My capacity to obtain basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is very high. The doctors and nurses try to give me as much information about my condition as possible and answers many questions I ask them. My capacity to process basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is kind of slow. I have to visually see what the doctors and nurses are saying to comprehend it. Just listening is not enough to register my condition. My capacity to understand is that I usually donât understand what is happening unless I am given time to process the information because I need time for the information to sink in and ask questions.
0.916700	I believe I have the basic ability to grasp all the health information that I receive. If for some reason I donât understand something fully I am sure o ask all appropriate questions. I do not feel stupid asking any questions. Because if there is something I donât understand I need to know because it is concerning my health. I have love ones to help me also and there always is the internet as the last resort.
0.688900	Usually if the doctors use big word terms for things, its difficult to understand. But explaining it or using different terms can help my understanding of things and I'm able to figure out what is happening to me.
0.872200	I feel I have a general understanding of information on my health. If there is any information, I do not understand, I make sure to ask questions until I am confident that I understand. 
0.588900	Well, I'm not mentally disabled. I therefore *can* do it. I don't sometimes understand medical terminology, which for some reason medical personnel seem wont to use when speaking to non-medical personnel, and often I can't be bothered to have a conversation about it. If it seems important, I'll make the effort; otherwise, it doesn't really matter.
0.827800	Most of the time I understand what I am being told. About 2%, I have issues understanding what actually is wrong or causing the issue, I think this is more due to a language barrier.
0.916700	I think that I am capable of understanding anything provided by my health care providers.  I am capable of learning about new information and doing my own research to go along with it.
0.616700	I think that I do I just am sometimes worried that I'm going to miss something that they are telling me. There has been a few times where I've not understood what they were telling me but I made them explain to me again.
0.888900	I feel I have the capacity to understand all health-related documents almost every time I read one. I take time to read the directions/information and ensure there are is not any ambiguous wording. I am able to understand all of the necessary abilities that I need to get the information, how to process it in my mind to think about and determine what is needed from me whether medical records, insurance or even authorizations that I need to give to other healthcare providers or to other people. I understand that the doctors use the information I truthfully give them in order to make detailed decisions about my personal health. If I am ever unclear on what decision is being made about my health, I make sure to ask the doctor  - even if it has to be asked in multiple different ways for me to understand.
0.866700	I sometimes have problems with forms, but I can always ask the receptionist for clarity. I have no issues understanding procedures and so forth. 
0.722200	I believe I understand most of what I am told. I used to work in healthcare for over a year. I went to college for medical billing and coding so I know most of the medical terminology.
0.388900	I believe that I am more than capable! Sometimes, the problem seems to be that the doctors are in a rush and some times I feel guilty keeping them longer by asking my silly questions. Also, sometimes the paperwork side of healthcare can be so confusing! I can understand them, but I always have someone go over them with me as well so that I feel that I am 100 percent understanding the information that is given to me.
0.744400	I feel that i understand the basic communication of heath information and services. where i lack knowledge is with all the medical terms that are important to my medical issues.

0.816700	I believe that I can read, talk and understand any medical info given to me by a nurse or a doctor and be able to repeat that information to someone else, such as my spouse, easily.  
0.900000	I have a background as a health care social worker, but even before that time, I have never had problems with processing fairly complex written material. Not only have  worked in a hospital, my mother was a nurse and we used to look at her books. From that exposure I have a reasonably good grasp on medical terminology. I have more difficulty in following verbal instruction, especially if the person giving them does not do it well.
0.883300	I have an advanced degree in Library Science and am very well able to find, read and understand basic and advanced health information.
0.705600	I believe that I'm maybe average in terms of this type of basic health information processing, and how to understand it in order to make informed health decisions.  In the case of something that I don't understand from medical literature or perhaps something I hear a medical professional share, I would say I can obtain the information I need.  Its important to me to make the best decisions so I try to get information from different sources.
0.844400	I am a nurse, and I know the importance of understanding your own medical condition.  When I see a healthcare provider for myself, I try to be sure I understand everything.  But sometimes I forget to ask questions, or feel rushed.
0.666700	I think I have a good grasp, but sometimes the physicians differ in their abilities to convey information in a way that is useful to me as a patient. I find medical forms a challenge as I am dyslexic and also an immigrant. I usually have my husband read them over or fill them out for me.
0.716700	I believe that often times, I am able to read and assess the situation that is provided to me in terms of my basic health information. The difficulty occurs when, if I have a health issue, and I wish to obtain further information, I don't always have the best understanding of what is then told to me. This is perhaps due to the fact that past a point, my knowledge regarding treatment and medications is lacking, and doctors do not often have the time to explain in detail exactly what certain things do. Even when they do, they do not specify side effects of treatments. As such, I am often worried about what will happen. 
0.744400	As a fully functioning adult with competent medical facility, I feel confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and to make decisions pertaining to my health/ medical care. 
0.716700	I have a problem in that I wear hearing aids. If I am not wearing them, I often have to ask the health care provider to either repeat himself or to repeat what he said.
0.777800	From the age of six, when my father carried me into an Arkansas emergency room, I have been intrigued with medicine.  Although my major in college was in Business, the desire to work in the medical field was always on the back of my mind.  At the age of 42, I enrolled in some basic medical classes, just to see if I would really enjoy the subject.
0.600000	I think I have all the tools to find the basic information I need. I can either call in to my insurance and have one of them aid me or I can find information online regarding my questions and requirements.
0.588900	I'm able to read basic health information and services, but I have difficulty with filling forms out without leaving out vital information.  I have someone else fill out the forms and I just sign them in order to avoid the hassle and confusion.
0.805600	I feel more confident in my understanding of details only if I find the healthcare provider has listened to the details I have shared.  That is not always the case.  Typically feel they are rushing me through.
0.650000	I do not have a full understanding of health information, especially since I am not in charge of insurance and live over 50 miles away from the nearest medical center.
0.800000	I can make basic health decisions. There are times when I may not understand everything if they use technical language, but I just go along with it. I have not had any serious medical condition where I need to be on top of my care.
0.577800	I feel relatively confident in my ability to fill out and submit both hard copy and electronic health forms, however, sometimes I do not feel that I fully understand the content of these forms. Also, when I visit a doctor, I don't always know what questions to ask, and sometimes feel that I do not receive effective treatments as a result. Typically when a doctor explains something to me, I can develop a general understanding.
0.783300	I am very competent at understanding this kind of information for myself. if anything, speaking with doctors is the part I find challenging because they can be confusing and misleading sometimes. 
0.900000	I feel confident in my ability to ask questions of my doctor or research conditions online to gain a full understanding of my health status. I regularly ask doctors follow up questions so that I can fully understand
0.755600	I feel like I can understand my doctor or nurse most of the time. However, there have been several occasions when my doctor tried to explain something to me that was over my understanding, or he simply didn't care to try and explain it in a way I could understand. Sometimes I leave with more questions than when I came in. My doctors tend to rush out of the room and I feel like they already have one foot out the door when they speak with me.
0.794400	I feel that I have a fair understanding of medical terminology in regards to my own health and medical needs. If there is something I do not know and a medical professional is not readily available to explain the term, I can usually google the term I do not understand and educate myself for future interactions. 
0.572200	Well it is all so complicated, not even just the medical information but the information needed to navigate the bureaucracy so that one can begin to have medical coverage and have things set up the right way to afford coverage. Then you have to do not only what is medical best for you based on what the doctors tell you but what works out with your work schedule and is covered by your insurance but often to find these out it is a waiting game. So you might pick one option in the hopes that you are covered but then find out later that you are not. Plus you might have to go out of work depending on what choice you pick and then you don't have a job and that makes future medical even harder. Plus I worry too about changing insurance standards because everyone seems to think that healthcare should be about making money instead of taking care of people. 
0.900000	I feel I can handle basic health information when it is given to me. I haven't had a problem yet with this situation. I usually only have a question or two for the doctors and nurses when I go to the doctor and most of the time it is just to get confirmation that I understood the information I was given correctly.
0.872200	I can understand a good amount of medical terminology as well as the treatment process.I took a couple of classes and have worked in a hospital before.

0.838900	I would think that I fall into a normal catergory of understanding of medical information.  It is not an area that I am interested in or studying so I know about my issues but not those of other areas. 
0.855600	I have access to medical professionals in my family, as well as a background in a tertiary medical field.  I am able to access information via the internet if I encounter any terminology or diagnosis with which I am unfamiliar.  I am very confident in my capacity to understand information provided, ask appropriate questions for further understanding, and research any additional information if help is immediately unavailable.
0.883300	I believe that I have the necessary capacity to obtain and process the information that I need. If I have problems understanding then I am certainly not shy about asking questions. These are issues that are important to me so I will not settle for not knowing what I need to.
0.855600	I think in general there are more than enough sources available for me to learn more about any health or medical issues I might have. I also know that if I don't understand something I should ask my doctor to explain more to avoid more potential issues.
0.900000	I feel like have the capacity to a large degree to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. I often use my health insurance webpage or the doctors group page for additional information.
0.644400	I guess that I have a very basic understanding of the human body and medical procedures.  The only health class I have taken was back in high school so I don't remember to much of it.  I have to ask a lot of questions at the doctors office because I don't understand a lot of the terminology.  Medicine has always been a mystery to me and I feel out of my element when I'm expected to grasp it. Prescription drugs make me nervous because there are so many side effects and sometimes I don't understand all the jargon on the information sheet so I have to ask the pharmacist.
0.788900	I feel I have adequate knowledge and research skills to be able to understand my basic health test results and findings. My largest knowledge gap relates to pharmaceuticals, specifically with regard to understanding alternatives, standard of care, side effects, and potential for dependency. Since I lack this technical knowledge, I usual ask the doctor, a friend in the medical field, as well as the pharmacist about the prescribed medication.  
0.794400	I feel very confident that I can obtain, process and understand basic health information. I like reading all the material that is given to me at the Dr. Office and usually write down my questions before going but sometimes I do forget and find google to be very helpful. I find most of the time the nurse and dr both explain everything at least 3 or more times. After having Kids and going to the Dr a lot you learn the process very quickly and it's usually the same every time.
0.844400	I feel I have a solid capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make my health decisions. I have a good understanding of anatomy and physiology so if something is wrong I feel like I know the appropriate questions to ask. I have no problem requesting that my doctor run certain tests if I feel they are missing something. I feel strongly that it is my responsibility to be accountable for my own healthcare and I do not rely solely on the doctor.  I don't trust that doctors have the time to do thorough physicals on their patients unless the patient pushes the point, especially with the healthcare provider that I have. So I would say that I take the reigns in making sure my healthcare needs are taken care of  
0.883300	I feel that I have the basic understanding of health services and information, as I am a retired RN. I very much have my wits about me and stay up to date and current on health issues through nursing journals and by staying in contact with fellow co-workers who are still employed.
0.794400	I generally don't care too much about going extremely in depth about health issues, but I understand enough, ask enough and communicate enough to cover the most important things.
0.622200	I don't trust insurance companies and I am extremely skeptical of the healthcare industry. Not so much of the doctors although after going to college and seeing future doctors and nurses do blow I am wary of the the future.
0.672200	I feel like for the most part I can obtain health information I need by asking the doctor for documents, pamphlets and other hand outs. I can't always understand or process all of the information because a lot of times I feel my doctor is in a rush or I don't think of the right questions at the time of service and think of them later. I don't know who I'd contact about situations once I am no longer in front of the doctor.

0.794400	"I feel like I have the information I need because I have a background in healthcare so it's a little easier for me to understand the medical terminology and paperwork. As for others, I feel like certain things should be broken down for patients who don't understand.

Some times i feel like i am not allowed to ask questions as the doctors act like they are above you and seem to get irritated when i ask questions to try and understand. they like to speak in terms i don't know the definitions to and seem unwilling to explain further. the last time i went to the hospital i asked the doctor to explain why i was having so much  pain she gave me an answer  i did not understand and said can you explain it a little better and asked how long should i expect the pain and was told by her that she already explained it the best she could.

0.883300	I feel like I am more prepared than most people. I am in my 50s and was never in great health, even as a child. I have multiple serious and chronic conditions. Consequently, I have had exposure to a lot of medical information so I have a reasonably good understanding of what is being explained to me. Even when something new is being presented to me, I have a strong base of general medical knowledge from which I can pull to understand what I'm being told. Furthermore, I am well educated and therefore less likely to feel intimidated when questioning a doctor. Because of my experiences, I am often called on to help explain medical information to family members and friends so I know that this is a serious issue.

0.850000	I would say 85% confident that I can obtain, learn, and comprehend the information to base a good decision on.  I feel better is the information is confirmed via a variety of sources, in person and internet.  It's only what is known at this time anyway, and can change.
0.872200	I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding probably more than the average person. I think this was is because I have spent more than average time at the doctor's office due to ailment. 
0.900000	I have a couple of chronic conditions. I have been to enough doctors and have complete confidence that I understand the information that is presented to me.  If I have a question or am unsure I ask.

I work in the health care field so I am around a lot of the terminology and understand most of it.

I understand my health problems because I have had them for years. Now my records are on the internet because many offices keep them on patient portals. 
0.644400	I google things when I do not understand them. I also get a second opinion most of the time not only for my condition but for my family as well since we have a doctor in the family. He explains us information that we forget to ask our doctors.
0.850000	I feel like I have enough common sense to understand what a nurse or medical professional is telling me, given that they use layman's terms.
0.866700	I think I have a great capacity to understand.  Sometimes I have difficulty with the more technical terms, but when it is broken down, I can grasp what is happening or what I need to do.
0.755600	I am typically able to understand all the information and am able to ask questions until I fully understand. However, it's definitely helpful to have somebody who is more experienced there to help out. I sometimes struggle with processing information for the first time so I often need something to be repeated. It's nice to have somebody else take the responsibility on occasion.
0.900000	I have worked in healthcare in the past, so I feel I understand most basic information given to me.  Also, if there is anything I don't completely understand (or even find interesting and want to know more about) I feel I know where to find the resources I need.

0.633300	I even come from a medical family as my mom was an RN but still I often leave feeling like I do not know what they said. I think I may not be the best at processing orally and then you factor in the vocab/lingo, and stress of being there and when I leave I feel I really am at a loss to discuss indetail what is going on. I get the gist but not the details and tha stresses me out. I have BA and I still striggle with the forms.

0.805600	I am able to process information and fill out required forms. If I leave an appointment still having questions, I google the condition.

0.794400	I feel like I can understand basic health information.  I work in the healthcare industry so I feel like I have a better understanding than some people.  However, I feel like sometimes I don't get all the information I need about my own health from my healthcare providers.  I always feel as though they are just rushing through everything and I don't get all the answers  and explanations that I want.
0.644400	I think I do have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  There are times when I have been confused by a medical professional's explanation, however, I am okay with asking for clarification or assistance to better understand  what I do not know.  Also, I can look things up online if a person is not physically available to assist me.

It is really very serious and I need to be precise when choosing. I feel I have average skills to read and understand and dont feel thats strong enough to make tough decisions as this on my own. I really have made this mistakes in the past regarding my healthcare and I spent thousands of dollars trying to make right on it.
0.688900	I think I only know the basic stuff that every average citizen knows.  I'm not a medical professional and I don't know much research my conditions or anything I have problems with.

0.772200	I can understand most of the basic information about condition I may have  .

Discussion with doctor makes me make my final decision about how to address health issue
0.827800	I believe I have all the necessary information I need to process and understand. I don't believe that doctors or nurses have enough time for me. I often avoid going to the doctor because I feel I am bothering the doctor with my problems.
0.750000	I have no major health issues or constraints, so I am perfectly able to seek out, obtain, and comprehend any available information. 
0.900000	I have no problems with the health information, medications or interaction with the doctors. However occasionally i do use the internet to get additional information and that can be an interesting quest to figure out what information is pertinent to my case. 
0.861100	Medicine has always been an interest of mine, so I have no difficulty reading detailed medical reports or understanding the significance of the numbers associated with blood and other test results. If I do not know a term, I look it up.
0.916700	I feel as though i am very able to gather information about any health information that i may have, and even understanding it is not a problem for me.

0.816700	I believe I can understand basic health information and services pretty well - well enough to feel confident about the decisions I make if I am given all of the information.

If there is anything I don't understand, I always ask questions, and if that doesn't work I take it upon  myself to research what I need to to make sure I understand everything. I understand what I need, recognize things I don't understand, and know how to find answers to any questions I might have.
0.711100	"In the past I've had difficulty getting the information I need because the nurse or doctor just seemed too busy to care. I felt like a burden or just another $$$ to them. They barely checked me out, barely heard what I was saying, disregarded it because ""they know best"", and sent me on my way. Recently I've gotten another health care provider who are a lot better and seem to genuinely care about their patients. Yes, like many places they still feel rushed and busy but they try their best to help as best as possible and even if they can't address the concerns at the time of the appointment encourage their patients to call or reach out to them through the online messaging system. Previously I felt too burdening or even afraid to voice my questions and concerns, but now I feel welcomed and even encouraged. They want to make sure I'm fully aware of everything and they want to know everything so they can provide the best treatment. I feel like I'm both informed and have the ability to get the information and understanding I need. We're a team in this."
0.916700	I feel I have a really high degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services that I need to make appropriate health decisions.

0.866700	I believe I can always obtain, process, and understand my basic health needs with regard to services being offered and health decisions I make.  
0.811100	i think i have a high degree to obtain this type of information.  I don't read everything i'm given (for example i don't read every single possible side effect of every medication, because that would take too long), but i am almost always able to obtain, process and understand the information and on the rare occasion i don't understand it, i know who to contact.
0.827800	I am fairly confident in the information I receive from them and always ask for handouts. Sometimes I feel the Dr is not listening to what is being said as they are rushed for time and are not as detailed as they should be. 
0.883300	In matters of my health I will take the time to carefully absorb the information I am given to evaluate my situation. I will research any additional questions I may have and will utilize all people I have available to me that have a understanding of my situation.
0.722200	I feel that I've had enough services performed within the healthcare system that I understand a good deal of what information I'm given. I also feel empowered to ask pertinent questions where my knowledge and understanding fails me.
0.761100	I feel that I have a good understanding of the information that I am provided by my doctors and nurses, however I do not often feel that I have all of the information on potential alternatives available to me. I am also very confused by my health coverage and whether or not certain things will be covered as preventative care or if I will be billed for them to meet my deductible. This often makes me feel very stressed about talking to the doctors and bringing up additional symptoms or questions because I fear getting a large bill for tests that I may or may not have even needed.
0.883300	I feel like I have a firm grasp on how to access and understand basic health information as needed. My medical services have made both accessing and understanding health conditions incredibly easy with the use of phone apps and websites, as well as timely discussion through these mentioned means. 
0.900000	I am educated and well-read. I have been reading about medical and health-related information from a young age. My mom is a retired RN and I learned a lot from her growing up. I oversee my elderly parents' medical care, requiring me to stay relatively current on a multitude of medical specialties. 
0.777800	I feel like I have a high degree of understanding of medical issues and what my Doctors are telling me. I am also not afraid to ask questions, if I don't understand or only partially understand. I like to take a piece of paper with questions written down with me to my apt if i have things i am curious about or don't understand. And when a doctor is telling me something I will stop them if I don't understand something. I'm not a doctor so I don't have to understand things, thats why i have a doctor and why it's important to ask questions when they are explaining things!
0.916700	I have a graduate degree. Although I have never had any medical training, I am familiar with the meanings of many medical terms. I have also studied Latin, and learned the Latin derivation of many terms. I once volunteered in a medical clinic, and learned terminology from a doctor there. He encourage me to go to medical school.
0.916700	i feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make decisions for myself.  i have no problem understanding any information received from a doctor, and often do my own research online. 
0.822200	I feel pretty confident that I can get the information I need. I usually search the internet thoroughly before a visit, so I go into the meeting with a pretty good set of questions, and hopefully a decent understanding of what the situation is. I always try to listen pretty carefully when speaking with my doctor in order to ask the appropriate follow up questions.
0.588900	I'm competent, just as much as the average person. I know the basics about health to relate any problems and I've had enough experience getting hurt on how to either treat it or find someone who will treat it.
0.794400	I have been dealing with health problems for many year with my own and family members. I have taken on the care of my grandmother and mother from doctors appts, test, hospitals and caring for them  until they passed away also I have a child with special needs from birth and deal with his care daily along with my health issues. I don't not know everything but I know I can try and find the help I need online and with doctor, aids and help with other family members.
0.705600	I currently am injured and disabled and have been in this state for over 2 years. I see a doctor once a month minimum and see multiple doctors, physicians and health care professionals. Since i have been dealing with this type of stuff so frequently I have a pretty good grip on health care forms. The information gets a little more complicated as I have multiple doctors working with me and they all have a different opinion so in that regard i usually require more information from each individual doctor because I get so much new information every time. Deciding which services are needed is also a little more difficult since my problem falls into the chronic pain category so no one really knows exactly what to do to treat my problem so this gets a little tricky too since everything seems like a guess to see what works and what doesn't work.
0.744400	I feel that I can obtain the necessary information through reading provided materials and asking questions. Often, if I find something confusing I ask and get an in depth response that explains it
0.833300	I feel confident when i interact with the medical service providers like doctors and nurses  and ask them to clarify if anything is complex to understand,  in some instances I may need some help if i am filling up or reading the content related to medical condition 
0.805600	The one thing I feel I don't have is an advisory function from the doctor.  They are really good at recommending a TON of tests and a million other things, but they rarely tell you how much that is going to cost, which is all out of pocket these days any way, and if it's really needed at all.
0.916700	I feel very confident in my ability to understand necessary health information. I also am competent on researching symptoms via the internet.  Overall, while I am not an expert by any stretch, I feel like I have a very good grasp on my health and what impacts my health.
0.600000	I feel that I can be able to get the help I need to process and understand information, but I do feel I miss out on a lot of information. I feel that when you go in doctors and nurses are on such push for time that the rush through a lot of the information. The often hand you paperwork when you first walk in that the rush you through. Next doctor are handing you paper work and talking really fast because the are behind schedule  and you are still try to process everything they just told you.
0.755600	I feel as though I am adequately empowered to make my own decisions when it comes to my health. In several instances, however, I have been complacent with what my doctors suggest despite not fully understanding my diagnosis.
0.900000	I feel completely in control of my health decisions.   I can read all the documents, fill out my forms and I ask questions as necessary. 
0.872200	I feel that while I may not know the right questions to ask in a medical situation, I have the capability and knowledge to get the information I need to make health decisions. I am of sound mind and can fill out my own forms without feeling the need to fabricate or gloss over my medical history.
0.827800	I think I have the right tools and mindset to understand this information and for what I do not understand I would ask someone.
0.883300	I feel I am very capable of understanding basic health information. I am not afraid to ask question and get clarification when needed, I also research information for better understanding.
0.855600	"While I may not know that I am not asking a certain, necessary question of a doctor or nurse, it's simply because I don't know or understand enough. It's not that I'm not capable of understanding what the doctor/nurse is saying, It's just that I don't know I need to ask. I also issues with ""making waves"" so I will sometimes just ""go along to get along."" I do have a wife, who loves to ""make waves"" and a mother-in-law who is a nurse with nearly 40 years experience so even when I do miss something, one of them will usually understand it or figure it out."
0.683300	I believe I have the capacity to understand basic health information.  If I have basic health issues I am fine with understanding the risks and treatments.  If it is more complicated then I would tend to have someone with me who understands the medical field a little more than me or someone who has been through the process before.  I think that I can make decent informed decisions on healthcare needs and services.  
0.700000	I am semi confident, I dont have alot of experience dealing with doctors so it is a little intimidating and I may not understand everything they are asking for or explaining. I feel like if I were to receive some type of document that was not completely clear I would ask for clarification regarding the questions. Maybe some of the terms used would not be something I know and dont want to sound dumb and would ignore but really important things such as conditions I may have or steps I need to follow I would ensure a clear answer from my doctor.
0.822200	I do not always feel confident that I am getting sufficient information from my doctor or nurse, so I always follow up with reputable medical websites. I especially find it important to review medication information because no one ever explains side effects.
0.816700	I have my B.S. in Biology. I went to the college health center quite a bit and go to the doctor now for regular checkups where we have candid talk about whatever health issues might be occurring. 
0.777800	My family physician goes above and beyond to spend plenty of time with me during my visits. He makes sure I understand everything being said. Also, I am very versed in internet searches and know I can find a lot of useful information there.
0.722200	I feel like I am fully capable of making decisions upon and understanding basic health information.  I feel that I can grasp most concepts myself, if not there is usually a nurse or doctor willing to answer any questions. Additionally, I have access to the internet via smartphone, so I have essentially all of the knowledge in the world at my fingertips if need be.
0.822200	I believe that i possess the capability to understand basic health information to a high level of degree which helps me make andecision as to what is going to be the best decision regarding what action i should or should not take for my health benefit. I am good at understanding or comprehending and if not inwill ask questions.
0.672200	I feel like I am experienced enough to understand things.Also I have a history working in the Medical field and I feel like it can be helpful to me in my personal situation.
0.427800	I do not feel like I have a strong ability to understand medical health information that is to be provided to me. I always find myself getting help from someone. I do not want the chance of misinterpreting something. I take it very seriously when it comes to money and health.
0.511100	I feel like I can understand if the Doctors / nurses take the time to explain it.  If they don't I look things up on the internet.  It can become confusing because there is so much information available online.  It is hard to get the Doctor to spend more than a few minutes with you.
0.750000	I think that I have the capacity to do all these things. My conditions are not severe enough to disable me from being able to understand and comprehend the problems that lie within me.
0.766700	I consider myself to be smart so I can say that it is easy for me to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.900000	I am intelligent and I am good at coming to understandings and learning on my own how and why things work. Because of this I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.888900	I think I have above average competence and ability to understand things.  I will generally do internet research on my own before seeing a doctor so I have a better understanding.  I generally do not need any assistance.  If I have questions I try to remember or write them down to ask the doctor.  Sometimes the doctors are too rushed and busy during an appointment.  That is very frustrating.  I am the type of person who wants to understand and ask a lot of questions.  At the same time, I am very intelligent and understand things quickly, as well as do my own research ahead of time in order to not waste time during the appointment.  Nevertheless, the doctors many times do rush me or make me feel that they are not interested in answering my questions.  The scariest thing is when they do not have the answers to my questions or are dismissive of my concerns or when I am using supplements that work that they have never heard of.
0.777800	am an adult. i do understand what the doctors say. i understand if there is a problem i am responsible and i should have all the rights to obtain any information regarding my health. that is how i can take decisions based on what is really the problem an how will it affect me
0.638900	I have a good understanding of my past medical procedures, allergies and current conditions.  I can convey this on the new patient or similar forms so the doctor can get my background.  I try to ask questions of the doctor when he comes up with a recommended treatment plan.  I use email correspondence with my doctor to follow up on any tests or labs. I primarily use Kaiser for my health care which stores all my medical records for easy access to any doctor. In fact, I recently moved to CO from CA, and the new Kaiser physician was able to transfer all my records locally. For prescriptions, I try to read about all the side effects and watch for them.
0.527800	I think i have a pretty decent capacity. I don't know much because I don't fall sick often and therefore my contact with doctors is very rare
0.900000	I feel that I have a strong capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am very confident in my research ability and the internet has reliable sources of information when you know where to look. Outside of the internet, I have access to health professionals that I can speak with or make appointments to meet if I have any concerns regarding my health or any health related decisions.
0.861100	I feel that i am able to completely understand any information that is given to me by my primary care provider. I may not understand all of the terminology or how to pronounce many of the medications generic names, however i haven't had any problem comprehending any medical information that has been explained to me.
0.783300	When the doctor is talking to me and it's important some of the information just goes over my head for some reason. I guess because it's a lot of information to take in all at once. I am trying hard to understand everything and create a mental image. When I am processing the information I am thinking about the important things that are said. When it comes to understanding basic health information I retain the more important information and forget about the less important information causing me to ask what was said by having them repeating the less important information when I ask a question.
0.844400	I feel very confident in my ability to receive and process basic health information.  I am pretty familiar with medical terminology and the medical industry, enough that I do understand the medical advice given to me by physicians and nurses.

0.916700	I feel extremely confident in my ability to obtain and understand health information, whether obtained directly from a health care professional or from written literature.
0.816700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand what I need to do for my health. The problems that I have had in the process usually have been because the doctors don't have enough time for me or don't care explain anything because they think their patients are too dumb to understand. 
0.900000	I feel very competent to voice my concerns and questions with my health care providers.   If I don't understand something I have no problems asking them to repeat or put in laymans terms so that I can understand better. 
0.705600	I feel pretty confident when it comes to understanding basic health information. I took a few medical assistant classes in college because I was studying to be a medical assistant a few years ago. One of the classes was about understanding basic health information and also what some abbreviations and other important terms mean. It was a fun class. I feel that with my knowledge in this field, from school, that I have a little bit of an advantage compared to others when it comes to understanding basic health information and services. There is still some things I am probably not familiar with as I didn't get a degree in this field because I switched majors, but I feel that, overall, I have a pretty strong confidence and understanding in this area. 
0.483300	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. The problem is whether I am informed enough to make appropriate health decisions regardless of how many questions I ask.

I often have my husband present with me for a second set of ears so we can both discuss our understanding afterwards.

0.872200	I am competent  to understand the written and oral word of a medical practitioner. The only time I have had any problem is understanding why I have to take a certain medication. At first I got a lot of medical jargon that any layman would not understand. I made the doctor slow down and put it into plain English. I am still not totally satisfied with his answer not because I did not understand but I am suspect about the basic premise.
0.783300	I feel that I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I think obtaining the health information and services are easy to acquire through the 24 hour call service I have and through internet searches.

Through all the resources I have available for myself I believe that it's easy for me to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.605600	I believe with my schooling I have taken I could understand and process basic information. Once you get into more complex and unusually diagnosis is when I can no longer comprehend what is going on.

0.816700	I feel as if I have little to no trouble understanding medically relevant information given me by doctors or nurses. Sometimes I find myself unfamiliar with certain medical terminology, but I always make sure that I am confident in my understanding before I leave the office.

0.694400	I understand all health related stuff except for the big medical words that i don't understand. I sometimes need help to learn what my condition is and how to fix it and such. I only need help when they use big  words to explain my conditons. 
0.772200	I feel that I typically obtain and process the basics when it comes to health information and services. With as much as I have had to go to the doctor, it almost is a natural thing for me to research more if I do not understand.
0.755600	I am not much of a verbal learner. Someone explaining something to me is far less likely to stick than if I can read the information and absorb it myself. I am a researcher.
0.833300	I believe I can understand forms that are written in layman's terms. I can read through medical material and glean relevant information.
0.916700	I have no problem understanding basic health information. My father was a doctor so I grew up around medical terms.I have never had any information that I could not understand.

0.822200	I feel that most of the time, I am able to get a good understanding about health conditions I may have by reading the information I am given by my doctor, asking questions and doing additional research online. I usually feel rushed when I am in the office with the doctor so many times I may need to get additional answers after my initial visit. 
0.833300	I do feel I have the ability to effectively understand the basic information they provide as anything that I don't quite understand I ask in detail about the information in order to form a better understanding of my condition.  I do feel that sometimes I do need things to be broken down into simpler terms but for the most part I feel I have enough of a grasp to make an informed decision. 
0.622200	It really depends on how I feel. If I am in pain or severe discomfort my ability to understand complex issues drops dramatically. I don't go into a doctors office often for a checkup, so most likely the reason I am there is that I am not well. This can lead to my understanding of complex issues and situations being less than great.
0.916700	I feel that I am very good at understanding what a doctor explains to me because always listen close when it is something that relates to my health. I am also not afraid to ask questions if I do not full understand something. I am also very good at searching the internet to find things to help me understand things i did not understand at first. 
0.844400	I think I am highly able to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make appropriate decisions. I usually ask questions to expand my knowledge of what is going on with me and if I don't understand something I usually ask. Sometimes I am shocked and can't think of anything to ask at the moment. When I am at home preparing for a doctor's visit, I try to write down any questions I want to ask so that I don't forget them. Often, after talking to or seeing a medical professional, I take what they told me and do further research online to learn more about whatever is going on with me.
0.688900	I understand I have basic knowledge and I also keep learning about different information when it comes to the decision making in my health and other peoples health aswell. I try to always keep learning.

0.844400	I think in most cases I can understand what needs to be know. I enjoy reading when I can about even the possibility of a condition. What I don't understand I am capable of reaching out find out. 
0.677800	I think I'm pretty good with getting and understanding information to make proper choices. It does help though if I was given a list of alternatives like similar drugs, comparable specialists, or other methods of treatment. It helps if all documents are typed out and not hand written. It is so hard to read information when they have sloppy hand writing. I also like to have a bit of time to look over all documents, ask the right questions and come up with the best solution for myself. I don't like to be put under pressure to make a choice quickly.
0.688900	I sometimes feel that the Doctors and Nurses forget that I am the patient and don't understand all the medical terms and they sometimes make me feel stupid if I ask for more explanation. 
0.816700	I feel I am very capable of making medical decisions. If I don't understand something I will ask the doctor to explain it in a way I can understand. I can also ask them to show me on a picture of organs or part of the body it pertains to.

0.605600	I feel like if I really need help, I can easily find it. I always have family that will help out. If I ask my doctor she will sit with me and explain everything to me!
0.733300	I feel that many doctors and physicians use very technical terms, and do not want to spend the time to explain everything.  I trust a lot of what the doctor tells me with very little questions so that I do not waste their time.  I rely on using the internet to search out or answers any questions I may have
0.555600	I believe I have a fair deal of capabilities to understand, obtain, and process basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions.

0.750000	I feel like I have the capacity but sometimes I have to seek out the information I need or push to have questions answered. I don't like that sometimes I feel like a doctor won't tell me the exact truth and instead they'll sugar coat things.
0.916700	I have a wonderful relationship with my doctor who can communicate complicated ideas quite easily.  But even if I were dealing with someone else, I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I feel very knowledgeable about my health; I'm confident I can make the right decisions for me and for my loved ones.
0.916700	I have the ability to fully obtain, process, and understand any basic health information that is given to me. Any time that I go to the doctor or the hospital for any medical condition that I am experiencing at that moment I make sure to ask all of the questions that I have and that I understand all of the information that is given to me. 
0.811100	I guess first I try to understand everything on my own. If I am still in the doctor's office I will ask a question.  Usually only once though.  I don't want to sound stupid by asking the same question over and over again, or repeated questions of different kinds.  Usually I manage pretty well on my own. but, sometimes I don't always understand medical jargon, or what certain blood reports show, but I have a couple of nurse friends that can help me.  I also know a pharmacist if I have a question about a drug.  
0.883300	I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information because six years ago I was a insurance agent. I was licensed in health care. I had to have educational training on new information(policies) that effect the client's selection of choice based on his/hers health.
0.711100	I feel generally capable. Whenever I have health concerns or change medication I tend to do some research online beforehand. Then, when I have an appointment with my physician I can ask relevant questions and confirm what I've read. I'm not always prepared for the amount of information certain medical paperwork requires me to know, but it's never prevented me from being treated.
0.888900	I believe that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic and intermediate health information and services. The times that I have had issues have been related to interpersonal misunderstandings and friction. 
0.822200	I have an extensive medical history going back more than 20 years. Throughout that time I have been in situations that called for requests of my medical records and other related transcripts of my care. I also have been in need of more materials for my own understanding, as I have had more than 10 surgeries over the years and many procedures.  I have fulfilled the requests(for legal and Disability reasons) and supplied myself with what I needed too. I was in touch with anyone and everyone including, records department employees, APRNs, to people that are part of national health help organizations to the doctors themselves in order to obtain what I needed to get.
0.827800	I feel that I am almost always able to obtain, process and understand the information given to me, especially since most health professionals are willing to explain.

0.672200	I feel like I understand when I'm there with the medical staff, but I often forget later when I'm at home. Then I read things online and I either get scared or confused. 
0.794400	When the doctors tell me about a condition, if I do not understand I will ask them questions until I fully understand everything involved
0.855600	I feel fully capable obtaining, processing, and understand basic health information and services. I am a native english speaker, and have never had interactions with a medical professional that wasn't fluent in english. 
0.916700	I rarely have any issues understanding my doctor or a nurse and if something doesn't make sense to me I ask them to elaborate on what I don't initially understand.  I occasionally have an issue getting in contact with my doctor by phone but it's understandable as he's busy and it's rare that I actually need to contact him anyhow as he tends to explain things well and answer any questions I have during my visits.
0.916700	I see my doctor every 3 months and he always spends time answering my questions. In between visits I usually write down things I have a question about.. I just jot them on a piece of scrap paper.
0.866700	I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG FIBROSIS IN 2008 AND SINCE HAVE BECOME PRETTY ADAPT AT OBTAIN INFORMATION THROUGH THE INTERNET AND ASKING QUESTIONS OF MY DOCTOR AND NURSES. I GENERALLY KEEP SEARCHING OR ASKING QUESTIONS UNTIL I KNOW OR UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH MY CONDITION.
0.838900	I think overall I have a good capacity to understand and process basic health information that medical staff present to me. Obtaining the information is relatively easy in my opinion. In terms of making proper health choices I feel that that is more of a grey area. The reason I say that is because I feel most doctors are very biased and will recommend things that may not be the best possible option for me.
0.655600	I feel as though I have the full capacity to fully understand what health literature is presented to me in the hopes of fully understanding my health outcomes.
0.827800	I feel like I'm more competent than most when it comes to the capacity to understand my health information. When doctors are not clear, I usually feel comfortable questioning them. I also feel comfortable researching my health issues independently. 
0.900000	I feel have the capacity to understand health information and services to a very high degree. I often research health conditions and review information given to me by doctors. I feel is in my best interest to be as well informed as possible in order to make good choices for me and my family. 
0.850000	I definitely feel I have the ability and capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information and services because my health is incredibly important to me and I am always diligent.  Between my doctor, credible online resources and friends and family, I thoroughly research prior to making health decisions.
0.827800	I think that I have the necessary knowledge to make educated questions or have a proper conversation about my health with my doctor. 
0.788900	I have taken enough health related classes and done enough research to know the questions to ask.  I know the basics of how my body functions and reacts.  This knowledge helps me to communicate better with my health professionals and get the help that I need
0.688900	I feel like I understand most of what is told to me regarding health information but sometimes I need help.  I rarely go to the doctor or get sick so I am not familiar with a lot of medical terminology or how processes work so I usually have to get either my wife or mother to help me understand things.  I usually consult someone if there is a big decision to make although that is extremely rare.
0.661100	I think I have a decent capacity to do so. At times healthcare professionals make me feel rushed and unable to answer questions which I would otherwise have anted to ask. 
0.811100	I feel I have a good understanding of most medical terms and I often do research before I go to an appointment.  I usually have an idea of what treatment will be recommended and I have my questions and concerns written down
0.644400	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions to an average degree. Sometimes I have questions that I do not have the answers to, but if I am motivated enough I will call or email my doctor to find an answer. Sometimes I will simply look up my question online to find a good answer. Other times I will ask my significant other or  a family member for advice.
0.677800	I feel like sometimes it is hard to understand the information and services about health care. I do think I can figure it out though. There are many resources available to help with things like that these days.
0.800000	I fee confident in my skills regarding basic health concerns and information. I usually want more information about how medicine works, why I have to take it, what damages it can cause and things of that nature. 
0.650000	I feel that I have a reasonable understanding of health information and services; however, I do feel that there is a lot that I do not know or understand.  Sometimes I feel rushed and don't feel like I have the time to ask all of the questions that I would like.  
0.855600	I feel I have good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Generally medical professionals are helpful in that regard, as if you ever have any questions, most are willing to explain it in detail. Also the age we live in, any questions about medical stuff are only a google search away. From the google search you can find actual medical documents explaining certain things, or just find other people like yourself suffering from the same thing who will share their experiences. Also not trying to brag but I've also been a smart person, so I find understanding things like this, isn't that tough. Generally though, I just try to make sure my Doctor and/or Nurses are fully informed of what is going on with me, and make sure to ask any questions I have.
0.883300	I understand what I need to understand and what I have trouble with I will inquire about until I do understand. I was never one to be shy about asking questions because there are just too many things out there to expect that any one of us could know all the answers ourselves.
0.522200	I have a biology/medical background so I feel somewhat more prepared than the average person. I get frustrated when I feel like I am being talked down to by medical personnel.
0.827800	I comprehend most basic health information. I have been given diagnosis that I have had to say âwhat is thatâ on numerous occasions. The doctor explains and sometimes I fully understand and sometimes I donât. I have written down the diagnosis and researched further on Internet from Home. 
0.766700	For the most part I think I am able to understand basic health information.  Sometimes there are aspects of it that I don't grasp and that sometimes even asking for clarification I might still not get, but figure I can do more research online later as long as I remember the basics of what they told me.
0.777800	First of all, I usually will do some major indepth investigation upon my own to examine the facts, and then compare to what my medical staff is telling me, or suggesting that I do in their care. I absolutely do not put all of my faith in any one doctor or health professional, as many are simply wrong, or just doing what they are told to do by their superiors, which often is in the best interest of the pharmacutical and insurance companies. We as patients are sold to the highest bidder who then have control over our medical decisions. The outcome of my life is of no concern to these corporate entities, only the bottom line which determines the lowest cost factor for them, and the highest profit margins for the pharmacutical companies which the insurance provider can accept. It is in my best interest to know what these corporations are deciding, and through proper investigation, only I can really know if the medical care that I recieve is in my best interest.
0.883300	I feel that I have excellent ability to understand and process basic health information. I worked in the pharmacy field for several years and have medical professionals in my family and this helped me understand some medical terms and jargon much better.
0.900000	I am self sufficient in filling out forms. If I do not understand them, I have no issue calling someone or talking to someone at the office of where the forms need to go. Usually all the forms I fill out for medical stuff, is pretty generic and I have no problems understanding the questions they are asking. If I did have a problem, I can always call the doctors office and talk to someone. Usually I fill them out there at the doctor, so if I had any questions, I would not hesistate to ask the front desk. If they didn't know, I would talk to the nurse or the doctor to get the help I needed.
0.850000	I am sixty three years old and have been to the doctor both on my behalf on the behalf of many family members with varying (including very serious as well as unusual) medical conditions, so I have had a lot of experience and know the vital importance of obtaining service and processing how to use it
0.866700	I ask my doctor or nurse to explain exactly what my health problem is.  With prescriptions, I ask the doctor what they are for, talk to the pharmacists to get a clearer idea of what the medicines do.  I also look up online at webmd or other medical websites. 
0.883300	i am pretty knowledgeable on health issues. if i dont know something, i am quick to research it on my own. google is my best friend and i use it a lot.
0.916700	I enjoy learning about health in my spare time so I tend to understand a bit more then the average person and I am not afraid to ask for more information or research it myself if I don't understand something. I am very confident that i can understand basic health information and make good health decisions based on my needs.
0.638900	I feel that most of the questions I have are answered. I am pretty knowledgeable myself but there are times where if feel like I need to ask about them. When I do. i feel i have the right resources to make it happen and feel confident if they don't know the answer. they can find someone who does.
0.350000	I have a difficult time understanding medical terminology because it is so complicated and scientific. I often times need someone to verbally explain to me what a specific term or symptom means. Most of the time I feel lost and that I do not understand the cause of my symptoms or that I am just clueless why the health issue is occurring. When a doctor tries to explain it to me, I lose focus quickly because they are speaking too fast and talking about medical issues I am not educated about.
0.855600	If I ever need help understanding anything at the pharmacy, they always are willing to take the time to explain any side effects or questions I have about specific medications.  When I see my doctor, it can sometimes be a little more rushed because he has so many patients during the day he has to see and he runs a very tight schedule.  However, I never felt like he answered any of my questions inadequately.  I usually do research on my own (online), before I go in for an appointment, so that I am better prepared to ask relevant questions regarding my potential diagnosis or ailments.  Therefore I know what to ask and usually have a good understanding of the health information presented to me.
0.844400	I feel confident enough to understand basic and somewhat more complex health related information, services to ensure that I will be taking the correct approach to treating such health conditions. Anything that is out of the ordinary or too complex I would probably ask for a more thorough breakdown of what it is what I will be dealing with.
0.738900	I feel I can understand medical information if it is laid out in a comprehensible format. However, I often think that important details are left out of the information I get due to lack of time by my medical professionals or a breakdown in communication due to the bureaucracy of the healthcare industry.
0.900000	I feel confident in being able to understand basic health information and services because I find that the forms are rarely difficult to follow and I have no problem asking questions and figuring what I need to do/understand my health.
0.900000	I feel that I can work through most health related decisions fairly well. Written materials are usually concise enough but I ask a lot of questions if I don't understand.
0.900000	I find basic health information easy to obtain and understand. If the information that the doctor or nurse provides does not make sense to me I ask questions until they can explain it in my terms. As far as I know, I've never had an issue gaining information for basic health decisions.
0.783300	I feel I have a reasonable ability to understand basic health information and services and that I have the basic ability to make decisions about my health.  I feel I have an average ability for comprehension and if there is something I do not understand I have the ability to look up the information I need to know. 
0.838900	For the most part, I'm pretty confident in my ability to get information about my health and use it to make decisions. The interplay between doctors, the practice they work for, insurance companies, multiple departments...etc. can be obscure at times, but not to the extent that it would seriously effect my health choices. 
0.833300	I haven't experienced many hospital visits, but when there I haven't had a difficult time understanding my medical issues. I have experienced long wait times even when I have had a scheduled appointment.
0.605600	I have the capacity to obtain and process material but sometimes there are medical vocabulary that I need someone to explain.
0.844400	I have a high degree of understanding. I'm confident in my ability understand basic health information.

This includes filing forms for new doctors or new patient check ups or getting into the urgent care clinic. I've paid out of pocket and I've used insurance when needed. I seldom experience any issues.
0.833300	I feel as if I have a decent understanding being able to understand the term of medical terminology. I also understand when my health is declining i know that I will have to go see a doctor to check on my health and receive treatment. 
0.672200	I feel like I have an above average understanding of medical terms and technology, although I'm not in med school or anything.  I feel that a lot of the information available assumes that we are doctors and isn't really put into terms that the typical person can understand.  Some information is missing too, like how nasal steroids can cause dependence and shouldn't be used for more than a week or two.  These spurts of missing information can lead to very misinformed decisions.  I feel like the medical community could provide better resources.
0.861100	I feel I have a high degree to make appropriate decisions based on my 5 year university degree and subsequent work in a field providing health care. Therefore I feel comfortable making sure I ask all the right questions to understand my treatment to the best of my ability

I subscribe to my hospital and physicians' online service which supplies me with results of lab tests, clinic notes, and appointments. I have learned to navigate this online service fairly well. My biggest complaint is that some of my doctors don't adequately use the system so I still have to contact their offices for simple or routine matters.
0.744400	I think I am capable but hesitant when it comes to gathering health information. I can definitely do it but I am unsure because of the frequency in which I actually make use of certain information.
0.833300	I think I have full capacity for to make these decisions. I am also confident in my  judgement for knowing what I don't know and identifying whether or not it is important to learn/seek more information.
0.866700	I have a pretty good understanding.  I have studied anatomy and physiology and my mother works in a medical field so I have someone to call if I have questions.
0.755600	I feel pretty confidant that I can obtain and process any information provided to me by nurses, doctors and any other hospital staff. I understand basic health information when received. If explained to me I would understand the services needed to make the right health decisions. 
0.866700	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I will not approve of services that I don't fully understand the reason for or fully agree with the risks. i.e.risk vs. benefit
0.811100	I think I'm fairly confident in being able to find and understand information. If I have any questions then I usually go online and do a lot of research. I like to be fully prepared and have good understanding to be able to ask any important questions.
0.800000	I think that I have the ability to gain the knowledge that I need about my health. My personal issue is that I am shy and I don't like bothering anyone with my problems, which extends on to speaking with doctors.
0.566700	I have the basic understanding of medical services. Most times if I need help to understand something I ask a family member or I go on  the internet. I live by myself so I usually call a family member with my questions. I find that the internet is really helpful with my meds and diagnosis that I have received.  Online it is really easy to understand. The only problem with that is that there's a lot of information on the web and it can get confusing sometimes. So mostly I will ask my family members or the doctor.
0.794400	I believe I am fully capable of understanding basic health information and services needed to make health decisions for myself. If I am unclear about something, I will research it myself or ask others for help or I will seek understanding from a health care professional. 
0.777800	Often forms are easily to fill out because they cover most concerns. Sometimes doctors do not ask if there are any questions and sometimes I forget to provide the questions. Mostly I understand or will look on  the web.
0.594400	I feel confident in understanding basic health information, but when the information presented is more complicated I tend to reach out to my mother who works in the medical field. 
0.661100	I feel to some extent that I comprehend the information that they relay to me, however some medical terms are hard to follow, so I most of the time would do online research after leaving the appointment, I also google any prescribed medications so that way i'm well aware of what the side effects or outcome will be. Once I feel comfortable with the treatment prescribed then I will follow the recommended doses information.
0.900000	I am responsible for taking care of the healthcare needs of myself and my kids. I have become capable of making any and all decisions. Anything the Dr. may mention or diagnoses I see on forms I receive, I will go out and google to get information on what may have caused it or what other recommendations for treatments might be offered other than those offered by my physician. I take care of my kids' needs and I am not afraid to ask questions when it comes to their health. There have even been times where I can't make it to their visits with them, but I am on the phone when the Dr. is talking to them and directing them to ask questions so that I feel I'm fully informed.
0.900000	I am quite confident that I can understand many aspects of medical terminology. I rarely have problems when speaking to doctors, nurses or medical staff and have never had a problem filling out forms.
0.861100	I'm positive I can obtain and understand basic health information. I'm a medical assistant, it's my job to have a basic understanding of human health and to ensure that our patients have an in depth understanding of their own health issues.
0.544400	I feel that the degree is difficult. I think most information is presented in a manner mentioned to confuse patients about what the real cost involved are.
0.816700	I definitely feel I have the ability to understand and process my health information. I am of sound mind and pay attention. I tend to Google medical issues and problems before seeking a doctor, so I often have a general idea of what is wrong with me and even know some of the terminology before they tell me. Even after I am diagnosed, I do a ton of research to get more facts than the doctor would have told me and even hear or speak to others with the same problems.
0.861100	Filling out forms and explaining symptoms and circumstances are not a problem. I only ask basic questions when it comes to medical visits. As a fast paced person, I do not ask extra questions. 
0.916700	"obtain 10/10, I can research or ask them if I can't find it online; process 10/10, like I said, I can search texts for relevant information; understand 10/10, with the caveat that if it's the actual science it'll take a lot longer than if it's just ""treatment x versus treatment y"" type stuff"
0.866700	I think I have a pretty good ability to process health information. Most importantly, I am not hesitant to ask questions. I go in to a lot of appointments having done research online beforehand, so I am typically prepared with several questions already in hand. Once the health professional gives me more and/or better information, I repeat it back to them in simpler terms to make sure I've understood correctly. With online resources, a close family, helpful friends and quality insurance provider who gives me access to good doctors, I feel like I have the ability to obtain knowledge and support pretty easily before making any health decisions.
0.805600	I feel I am very capable.   Most older family have me go with them to important doctors appointments because I make sure to ask when confused and not leave to we have everything we need and fully understand.  If something pops up after leaving I do not hesitate to contact the doctor again by phone.  Understanding health is so important  so I make it a priority to get the info needed.
0.727800	Health information is so important that sometimes it may be overthought of something too simple. However, in most cases there are times where I do need help in regards to medical forms that need to be filled out of have questions for the doctor. therefore, a lot of questions that can be given in a written format may require too much of a distinct jargon that couldn't be understand. Making the right health deicisons are important especially if it medical history in your family such as diabetes,  high blood pressure, and other health risk. it is always right seek out the best information. 
0.855600	I have had no issues in the past with understanding what I am supposed to do and medicines I am supposed to take.
0.850000	I have a PhD in public health, so I am generally pretty knowledgeable about health related issues. When I am uncertain about particular health conditions or my family history of disease I usually ask my mother, a nurse, for help.
0.555600	I think that I am capable of figuring out and making concious healthcare decisions when I am faced with it. I understand the services and what is required of me and I fully comprehend what my health care provider is telling me.
0.827800	I feel like I am moderately able to understand and process the information. With the help of better educated friends and family I am able to get a better understanding without much trouble.
0.416700	Most of the time I feel out of place. The explanations the doctors give have such high medical vocabulary that it is difficult to understand what they are saying. I feel I get lost in the middle of their explanation. When something is hand written by a doctor for a prescription it is even worse since half of the time I cant understand what they are writing wether it is the name of a medicine or the instructions on how to take them. The procedures are also hard to understand. It all comes down to the amount of endless information I fell I am given by the doctors. Its too much to take at once, most of the time.
0.883300	As an attorney for 30 years I represented many medical providers dealing with associate rules, HIPAA rules etc. I am well versed in contracts and medical issues/terms 
0.916700	I am fully capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I do not have any mental issues that make me incapable of understanding things and making decisions.  I have 100% of my mental capacity and am very good at understanding medical information.
0.788900	"I feel pretty educated on my health conditions and feel confident in my doctors.  However, there are times when I still don't feel I have all the information I need to make health decisions.  Often, doctors are unable to ""dumb down"" language to the point where a lay person could understand.  Additionally, I feel that my time with doctors is limited.  I rarely feel that I have had as much time as I wanted.  Insurance forms are also very difficult to understand.  I almost feel like I need to have a lawyer look over everything!  Often the receptionists do not seem educated in health language."
0.800000	I was a certified CNA at one point and have worked in the healthcare industry for several years. I have a high capacity to understand basic healh information to make health decisions for myself. I will always ask doctors to explain anything I do not understand until I can understand it fully.
0.838900	I have worked in healthcare and I make sure to understand my medical conditions/medications as well as I can. I don't always think of the right questions in the moment, but I'm a curious person and want to stay up to date with new info.
0.916700	I feel I have a strong ability to obtain, process and understand basic health and services information in order to make appropriate decisions.  If I have any questions, I actively seek out information.
0.722200	I feel very confident that on the occasions that I do visit the doctor's office, I am capable of understanding conditions as well as treatments that are necessary. If I am unsure, I am not afraid to ask.
0.777800	I feel I can get all information I need and understand instructions. The problem area that I usually have is when it comes to insurance papers. Luckily I have a sister that works in the insurance dept. of our local clinic and am able to get help from her. I often think of what the poor people do that don't have access to someone like that and what I would do if she wasn't there to help.
0.883300	I'm a senior citizen now I'm told. I'm 63 years old. I have always tried to make sure I communicate with my doctor, dentist, etc regarding anything to do with my health. I do ask questions or I call, or e-mail people to explain things to me. I also do this for my husband who is 69 years old. Since he signed up for Medicare I had to make many phone calls to understand different things. 
0.561100	Reducing hospital load, meeting better needs of medical examination and treatment of people is an important target has been set by the Ministry of Health for many years. To realize this problem, the Ministry is focusing on combining many solutions on health financing mechanisms and policies. In particular, solutions to mobilize resources from the society to invest in facilities, equipment, cooperation on management, improve the quality of the health system is expected to bring efficiency positive.
0.744400	I feel I have a pretty good capacity. I am too shy to ask the questions I should of my provider. And I rarely share all of my concerns with my  psychiatrist because if I do he'll probably have me change my medications or increase my visits. And I don't give my general practitioner all the info she needs to help me as it may cause more tests or drugs.
0.916700	When I go into the doctors, I always have a list of questions that I need to have answered and hopefully I can come up with more if I am very concerned about the condition. Most of the doctors or nurses that I have encountered have been very helpful and open to answering all my questions and relieving any concern that I did have. I have taken health courses and do have a general idea of what is going on. Also, I try to do as much research as possible before an appointment so I don't go in there completely naÃ¯ve to the condition. 
0.700000	I think my only concern is the way that technical terms are explained to the patients, since they don't know educationally
0.794400	I feel that I normally comprehend about 90% of the information that is given to me, however, there have been occasions that I've had questions about drug interactions that I found difficult to get direct answers about.
0.883300	Between google scholar and the amount of time I spend reading about health and medicine I feel fairly confident that I know what the doctor is talking about, and when I don't, that I have the base knowledge to ask the right questions. 
0.883300	I believe that I am capable and qualified to understand basic health information and services needed and to make appropriate health decisions because I have a scientific and medical background which has familiarized me with a variety of medical concepts and terminology. My familiarity with medical concepts comes from my undergraduate degree in biochemistry as well as my prior professional employment in the pharmaceutical industry.
0.688900	I am a pretty fast learner and most of the time I am able to understand all the medical forms. Sometimes I will have someone go over it with me to explain in more shortened terms
0.883300	I feel I have the capacity to understand materials presented to me. I also feel like I know how to form questions to get the answers I need. I do not struggle communicating with health care professionals.
0.900000	I feel that I am well able to process all the information needed to make intelligent health decisions. I can easily understand written and spoken information, and I research health topics that concern me.
0.833300	I feel mostly confident in my capacity to do the above. With the Internet as a resource if there is something in a pamphlet that seems unclear to me I can often do some reading to clear up any confusion. I am comfortable with my doctor and he answers my questions well. I have had doctors in the past that answered my medical questions as though I were another doctor. Sometimes that made understanding my conditions or the decisions that were being made regarding them difficult to understand. I think doctors just need to remember that sometimes the most simple way for them to explain something might not be as easy to understand for some of their patients.
0.600000	sometimes I have some particular difficulties to understand what it is written on the doctor's diagnosis. In some situations, i have some difficulties to better understand medical terms used by my doctors so I often  ask them to explain them to me
0.883300	I think I'm pretty good at understanding things. I usually repeat the information back to health professionals in my own words so they can correct me if I haven't gotten it right. I read written information provided by hospitals or doctor offices; I don't always read all the prescription fine print. When I'm back home, I look online (usually WebMD) and read up on topics that were raised.
0.916700	"I have had to learn to advocate for myself with all healthcare people and specialists. About a fourth of those people are apathetic, overworked, inattentive, abusive and/or neglectful. I realized a long time ago that they mostly guess ""conditions"" without proper testing. I have been given ""band-aid"" medicine for decades and much of that medication has caused me further harm. I will no longer take anything without further testing and more proof that it will actually improve my quality of life. "
0.916700	I feel that I am fully capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and the services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  
0.916700	I am a college educated individual and believe that I have the mental capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have health insurance and regularly go to my primary care physician and eye doctor for frequent check-ups. The key is to be honest with your doctors on any potential issues that I might be having.
0.800000	I feel very confident in understanding the science of medications and medical problems. However, insurances deliberately try to make forms, processes and procedures difficult for the patient and medical professionals in order to avoid paying. The fear of being stuck with the bill is enough to deter me and most others from seeking medical attention. 
0.900000	I feel I understand the majority of the information given to me by my providers. I have studied in the medical field and therefore already know the basics and a lot of speciality information. The information that I have trouble with or know nothing about I know to ask my provider to fully explain and tell me what values are suggested for lab/image results if a part of the diagnosis.
0.633300	I am somewhat familiar with health terms and can pretty much figure out health related material on my own. If there is a term I don't understand, I ask a professional.
0.916700	I feel that I have a great capacity to understand basic health information that is provided to me. I'm also a fairly healthy individual so I don't often find myself needing information given to me in the first place.
0.900000	I feel highly confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. If I ever have any questions, I make sure to ask either a health professional, someone who has personal experience with what I am inquiring about, or check online for further explanations/information. I have a personal interest in health care (i.e., taking proper care of myself and others as well as attempting to understand things that I may hear about and could be something of use in the future). Both my father and brother work in the medical field and I actively listen(ed) when they share what they know. My educational background is primarily in Psychology, but I have taken a few medical courses as well. I feel that having a good understanding of how the human body works is important and know that, if something is ever slightly difficult to understand on my own, I can find answers somewhere.
0.633300	I can understand most of the basic questions. The problem that I have is when the doctor or nurse use medical terms in which I've never heard of or when I'm filling out forms. So I can and feel confident that I can obtain basic or certain information to make the appropriate health decisions. I just can't do it when it gets too technical. 
0.622200	I feel as tho I have could handle all that basic information. As long as I can have all the information I would need I should not be that hard.
0.833300	I feel I have enough experience with going to many  Doctors that I can get most of the information that I need to determine what is the best way to approach the medical situation.
0.761100	I feel very confident about my ability to make health decisions. All of my doctors belong to the same health system and have access to my medical records.  This is useful for when they need to prescribe something - they have immediate access to see what else I'm taking to be sure something new won't interfere.
0.900000	I have easy access to the answers that I need for any medical information.  A hospital is very close to my whose and I can use Google to find out whatever I need to know.  Also, I have friends and acquaintances who are on the medical field who I can ask questions.  Anytime a doctor explains something to me, they usually say it in a way that I can easily understand.  Also, they never use big medical words that I can't understand.  It's very easy to simply ask the doctor everything you need to know about any medical condition that you have.  
0.916700	I believe at this point in time, health information is there if you are willing to seek it out. The web is ever expanding in regards to the information available, health provider apps are becoming more robust, and I happen to work at a call center (Carenet) that works to fill gaps in the consumer healthcare experience through providing various health provider services. However, for most people, I believe they are somewhat in the dark. The doctor's offices I've always been too do a terrible job of providing knowledge unless it's a doctor trying to prove they know the jargon. Clerical staff usually seem to avoid customers at any cost and ironically have terrible customer service (for the most part). Most offices have the same 30 year old graphics of the inner ear workings alongside  numerous posters advertising designer drugs. It'd be nicer if doctors offices were part medical care, part personal medical library. Plus, nobody really likes to reach out for health/insurance related information. I think it takes the external people who have a stake in that persons health (insurance providers) reaching out with info and care plans.
0.750000	I feel for the most part that I am intelligent enough to grasp basic health concepts and am able to make choices based on the information provided.  If any concepts are above my head I am able to communicate that and confirm what are the facts.
0.533300	I think that i definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed. My biggest issue that sometimes i dont get is that sometimes doctors will prescribe medication without knowing what my diagnosis is. That is something i have a hard time understanding sometimes and it can be hard to get a straight answer out of my doctor.
0.733300	I believe in listening to what my doctor tells me about my health. When I don't understand the information I'm given, I ask for it to be explained until I get it.  I like to know what type of medicine to buy, what to eat, what not to eat, what I should be doing for my health. Also the internet helps a lot, if I need more clarification on something I research it more and get more information
0.777800	I have access to many resources to be able to make health decisions. Those resources include doctors, nurses, medical books, and the internet.
0.783300	I have a severe traumatic brain injury and get a fair amount of mental health treatment.  I don't necessarily understand all of the information I am presented, but I always have someone that can explain things to me.  Either the doctors or an aide that helps me with handling everyday tasks.
0.866700	I feel that I have possess the codependency to comprehend basic health information, and slightly higher capacity at interpreting medical terminology.
0.722200	When it comes to basic issues I feel as though I have the ability to interpret them on my own.  However, when we start to get into more complex issues I often need someone with knowledge to make the explanation easier for me.
0.888900	I am pretty confident with reading medical materials I constantly freeze proof read every documents and ask a lot of questions anything I don't understand I always Google it
0.916700	I AM TOTALLY CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING HEALTH INFORMATION AS I HAVE A MASTERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS WORKED MOST OF MY WORKING YEARS IN THE HEALTH FIELD. I CAN OBTAIN, ,PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND ALL HEALTH INFORMATION GIVEN TO ME AND IF PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND I WILL ASK ALOT OF QUESTIONS TO HELP ME COMPREHEND BETTER. 
0.677800	I am very in-tune with my own physical and mental health, and when I believe there is an issue I need to discuss with a doctor I seek out the appropriate resources. The internet is a wonderful tool to research different things and determine the right questions to ask. I also work in the medical field so I understand the logic and reasoning of doctors. So when I am told something about my own health, and if I don't understand any aspect of what I'm told, I know to ask them t explain in a different way until I can make an informed decision.
0.755600	I feel confident that I do understand basic health information. If I have questions, I will first try to ask the medical staff. If I still do not understand, I try to do research online. After reading more information, I will then go back to my doctor and ask relevant questions until I fully understand.
0.900000	I think I have a pretty good understanding of many conditions, especially those that I am dealing with. I have diagnosed myself long before a doctor could. I enjoy learning about medicine and feel confident in my decision making.
0.916700	I feel confident that I can obtain, process and understand all the basic health information to make the appropriate health decisions. And if I do not understand something then I would ask my doctor.
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to completely understand and process basic health information. I always ask doctors relevant questions during medical appointments. If I donât understand something I always ask the doctor to explain the material until I do understand. If I were to go to a doctor that didnât thoroughly explain things then I would discontinue services with that doctor and find a new one. 
0.755600	"Yes, because there is this thing called Google.com. Google.com is a search engine that allows anybody to have the world's knowledge at the tip of their finger. You can search for ""How to walk your dog?"" to ""How to implement brain surgery?""."
0.883300	I generally feel like I am able to understand almost all of what my doctors tell me.  If I have difficulty with materials, I am capable of googling the correct information.  I often help others interpret medical information.
0.850000	I I think I feel quite confident about my capacity to understand most of health info and services needed to be able to make proper health decisions. I am able to fill all the necessary medical forms and easily interact with doctors or nurses in case anything needs to be clarified upfront. I also do thorough research by myself on the health info and services to make sure I make a proper health decisions at the end of the day. From time to time I also help my wife on these decisions. 
0.883300	I definitely feel I have the capacity to use information to make health decisions, largely because I have had the opportunity to work with and around a variety of different clinicians and am comfortable with medical jargon.
0.850000	I do research ahead of time so I can try to ask the best questions. I have good enough mental fortitude to process the information given to me and ask the right follow-up questions. I can think about things afterwards to help me best.
0.794400	I do feel that i have the ability to read, understand and process all basic health information that any doctor or nurse may give me or anyone i know. If there is something that i dont fully understand, i will ask them for some more information and any other questions related to whatever they are trying to explain to me. If i need or want more information after my visit, i would then google it and do my own research. 
0.805600	I feel as though it's completely in my control in how I obtain and understand my health information and the services provided to me. I don't have any issue asking for help and if I don't understand something I'm not afraid to admit it and ask for an easier explanation in terms I can fully understand.
0.616700	Sometimes I feel like I do not understand some of the documents given to me. They might ask things that I am not sure how to answer or if I am making the right decision. For example, if the doctor gives me a document about a vaccine he is recommending then I like to have someone look over it with me and I like to look up information about it instead of giving an immediate answer by myself. Other times, I completely understand the information given to me and I can make an immediate answer without hesitation. 
0.916700	I think that I have the capacity to understand any of the basic and non basic health information from any of the services and am able to make good decisions also.  I think that if I had any misunderstandings or questions then surely I could talk with one of the health professionals and gather a appropriate amount of understanding for the question.
0.916667	I think i'm very able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I don't have a problem understanding things and I have a great deal of common sense.
0.572222	i understand a little only because they don't simplify what it is they are trying to tell me. so therefore i just don't understand most of the time. 
0.794444	I can always ask someone in the medical field if I'm concerned about something.  I can also go to medical websites.
0.422222	Everything I Say but if anybody have a problem with me or how I do things they can find another way of doing ti
0.844444	I am able to process and understand basic health information with minimal problems.

0.550000	They give potential job applicants a sense of whether they should apply for the job. The clearer you can be about the requirements, duties, and responsibilities of the job and what kind of person you're looking for, and the better you can represent these in your advertising for the job, the less time you'll have to spend reading applications from inappropriate candidates. The act of developing job descriptions and selection criteria forces you to clarify your thinking about the position, the kind of person you want for it, and the organization itself. Organizations often have to include job descriptions in proposals for new programs or positions. Sometimes, the act of composing the job description changes the whole course of the proposal, as people realize that they can use a position in ways they hadn't considered, or that what they had originally conceived was, in fact, unworkable. A job description can sometimes serve to define a whole program.
