Whether it was an issue with his heart, his kidneys, or his prostate, my mother was constantly traveling from home to take him to the doctor or to the hospital.

1	Right after my grandfather had moved into assisted living, I was visiting at dinner time and he checked his blood sugar, which was at 450.

1	I'm not sure if I really have a knowledge of health or medical issues. A few years ago, I started eating a lot better because my dad had a massive heart attack, and started learning more about how sugars and bad fats were affecting my life experience, as well as the sty little nicotine habit I'd picked up.

1	I used to work in the medical field many years ago. I have experienced many different health issues over the years, including a couple of rare diseases.

-1	When I was a teeger my Mother cut her hand while cooking. I immediately found something to make a tourniquet to stop the bleeding and we got her to the emergency right away. The doctor asked who did that and I said it was me. She commended me for taking the right steps to stop the bleeding and cover the wound. This demonstrated that I had knowledge that I had learned in first aid.
-1	A few years ago a friend of mine had a really bad boil. I had experience with draining and getting rid of boils. So I showed him how to drain it and it went away.
1	I honestly cannot think of an experience where I've had the opportunity to demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues, outside of explaining tests or procedures that I have had.
1	I would say every time I get a cold or the flu(rare) that I demonstrate my knowledge of health issues. I actually try to avoid taking any medicines unless its necessary. I think the foods we eat play an important role in our health. So when I do get sick I know that my body needs lots of rest and fluids.

We were talking about how the medical community has recommended low-fat, high carbohydrate diets for patients with heart problems or at risk for heart attacks for the past 45 years or so, but the evidence that this diet has been effective for reducing heart problems (or for losing weight, for that matter) is poor. They agreed with me, and we further discussed how cutting out sugar and reducing your carbohydrate intake while increasing dietary fat is likely to be the most healthy diet.

When the doctor told me he had high bilirubin numbers and was slightly jaundiced, I didn't get upset like I did with my first son, because I knew that this was a common occurrence that rarely turned out to be serious. I was able to understand what the doctor was telling me and able to enjoy my son's first few days instead of stressing out.
1	I have basic understanding of medical knowledge of simple diagnoses. Plus I can use my common sense to calculate the rest.
1	One time a coworker had a stroke at work.  She couldn't speak, but I had her squeeze my hands and one hand was barely functioning, so I knew she was having a stroke.  Somebody called 911 and I stayed with her.

1	I was trained how to heal wounds on a battlefield. I helped take care of injured passengers when a bus got knocked down on the highway. I bandaged many severe injuries using a first aid kit from the bus..
1	I suppose having had the flu throughout my childhood has shown me when I should panic, or when it is just general symptoms of the flu.  So this (very) basic knowledge lets me know that I just have the flu.  Altertely if the symptoms were different or more severe that I'm used to, it would be indicative that maybe I should look further into it, and perhaps seek medical professiol assistance.
1	In cross country I felt tired and my legs were heavy. I knew something was wrong. I went to the doctor and I had iron anemia.
1	I had 2 heart attacks so I learned a lot about cholesterol. I did the diet thing and exercise and it made no difference at all in my numbers. So I take meds. They work. So I learned about hereditary stuff. No much you can do but take your meds.

1	While I have my own health issues, my husband has even more of them. And since he's a bit less capable of taking care of everything himself, I am the one who takes care of coorditing a lot of his healthcare.

This experience has given me the insight (generally) to know what kind of information is important to a doctor.

1	I had to give a presentation about CRISPR, the gene editing tool, explaining how it's different from other methods and why it's capable of completely curing genetic diseases.
1	I don't really have much knowledge. My mind runs away with everything and makes me think symptoms are more serious than they really are. So over the years I've learned to deal with that. I suppose that's my best answer. Whenever my heart skips a beat or I get chest pains I've now learned to ignore them and that's it's just my anxiety. Problem is what if it isn't?

He did die later on that night despite everything that was attempted to save him.

I also have some basic first aid knowledge if that counts, and I've used it a couple of times during my life.
1	"Years ago, I had gallstones so bad that it blocked my bile duct. I turned yellow, my urine turned brown and I was in terrible pain. I had no idea what it was, but was quickly diagnosed and rushed in to have the stones ""scrubbed"" out. Two weeks later they removed my gallbladder.

I was blessed to be able to get to go to a doctor that prescribed me Suboxone (new medication treatment for heroin addiction) and because I did a lot of research on treatments for my particular issue, I knew to alert the doctor that I did have Hep C because the ""blocking agent"" in the Suboxone (keeps you from being able to experience euphoria from opiates besides the buprenorphine in the Suboxone), the loxone, has reportedly effected liver function in some people. Now the doctor is going to watch my blood labs to see whether or not I can stay on the current medicine or if I need to switch to a similar version of the drug that does not have the loxone in it."

1	Signs of infection in a wound. I had an ingrown hair that got infected. The area got red and swollen and pus started to build up under the skin. It took a while for the wound to heal after it was excised due to build up. So I learnt about how to know when something is infected and signs and symptoms associated with it.
-1	Reading through document about bell's palsy and knowing what to expect because a relative had experienced it.
1	A couple of months ago, I started a keto diet. This diet is similar to the Atkins diet. The major difference is you add more fats and healthy oils. After a week or two of no sugar and lows carbs, you're body will go into Ketoisis. This uses stored fat instead of carbs for energy.
-1	I remember a friend telling me he suffered from very strong headaches that made him sensitive to light and sometimes sounds. He complained that the pain was a pulsing one. You could always describe it as throbbing. I mentioned to him that it sounded like a migraine headache, something I suffer from. I told him to see his doctor to make sure, but it sounded like a migraine to me. Turns out that was what it exactly was.  
-1	When my husband was sick, he would not go to the doctor or hospital-I knew he was close to dying and called an ambulance, he had septic shock and they had to warm his blood with a plastic topping he was that close to death.
1	ANytime i have i make decisions about my health and whether or not to exersize or go to the doctor for any reason, i am demonstrating my knowldege
1	About 10 years ago I self-diagnosed my Autism Spectrum Disorder. I was filly professiolly diagnosed about 8 years later. During that time I learned more than the doctors who refused to listen to my concerns.
1	I've worked as a life and health insurance agent in the past. Often I would help older people with medicare supplement plans. Going through the various plans, overages, deductibles, etc., took a fair amount of knowledge. Drug pricing, altertives and availability. Hospital costs, referral procedures. I would often help them to understand medical terminology.
1	My mother was diagnosed as pre-diabetic and had blood pressure around 200. She was put on meds that turned her into a zombie, but necessarily to save her life. I read up on her medication and found that over long periods of it could have negative effects on the kidneys and had her go back in to see about a different medication, they did tests and found high amounts of protein in her urine because of the medication and was at high risk of kidney damage.
1	I tore my ACL, and had to decide if I would have surgery to replace it or not, and if so, what I would use to replace it. After reviewing the information, I decided to have the surgery, and to use a cadaver part to fix it.
1	My grandmother had heart surgery and she developed a staff infection. They also found pre-cancer cells in her throat at the same time. My family heard cancer and freaked out. I was more concerned with the infection because she was old and pre-cancer cells could take decades to actually turn into cancer. The doctor said i was right and calmed my family the immediate concern was the infection and the heart.   
-1	The research I did on my own issues and the books I read. I looked at WebMD, Wikipedia (even though it's not secure), and other sites. I even took an atomy course where we picked a disease relevant to the chapter and wrote a short discussion board post about it.
1	I was the caregiver and advocate for my father who was dying of lung cancer. I dealt with his doctors and the hospice nurses daily for many months.
1	On one of my doctor's visit, the appointment had to end early because of an emergency. The doctor didn't have enough time to explain to me in person all the questions I had, so he gave me a small booklet instead. I had no problem understanding the material without any help from healthcare professiols.
1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is when I was younger I got a rare disease that made me really sick. During this time I was forced to start learning and understanding different medicine and side effects. 
1	I have learned that the food you eat and the exercise you do are very important to your health. It keeps your body strong and your stress level low. 
1	I had a liver disease issue. I looked up information on the matter. I became knowledgeable. I discussed the matter with my doctor in an informed manner.
-1	This may seem a bit odd, but my mother was a nurse and once told me that you can judge health by stool samples. As a result of being told this, I would not allow my children to flush the toilet until they were past the age of 10 so I could check their stools each time they went. If they had a loose stool, I varied their diet. If their stool appeared hard, I varied their diet. Also, when they had too much energy, rather than assume they needed medication, I had them exercise - it worked every time. And one other instance, my younger son was slow to talk. An in-law suggested something was wrong. I explained he had no problem communicating what he wanted or needed and, thus, nothing was wrong. I was right; she was wrong.
1	I have self treated illnesses that most people believe you need to go to the doctor for. 
-1	i just had to listen to doctors and do research on my own
1	"I'm not really sure. I had cancer twice so I guess as I was doing chemo I understood how all this stuff was supposed to work. I knew Everytime I went to the hospital what the routine was, and knew everywhere I needed to go. I'm not sure I really ""demonstrated"" my knowledge but this is the only thing I can think of."
1	My mom went to the ER thinking that she was having a heart attack or at the very least heart problems.  I accompanied her to the hospital although I told her her symptoms were not necessarily heart related and that she really just needed to relax and work on stress reduction.  The doctors agreed with me but went ahead and performed heart stress test.  There was nothing found.
1	I honestly cannot think of such an experience.
1	I interned at a cancer research center where I read a lot of documents on health/medical issues.
1	When taking my son for a follow up appointment after getting croup, I felt I could understand and communicate with the doctor about all of the medications given and treatment protocol. 
1	I have asthma. When I was about 15 someone explained that my difficulty breathing was due to too much air in my lungs, not as it seemed, too little. I used this information to train myself to breathe in more shallowly and breathe out more completely. It seems to help when it gets bad.
1	I developed a keloid scar and was going to a dermatologist to get rid of it.  On the first visit she was attempting to describe how it developed in layman terms and I responded by using the medical terminology.  She laughed and said oh you are smarter than you look.
-1	I fell down a flight of stairs.  My son insited I broke my ankle but I assured him I probably had a hair line fracture.  The bone had not come through and I was somewhat able to walk on it.
1	"A few weeks ago, my brother hit his head at work. He'd had several mild concussions as a child and pretty much self-diagnosed himself as having another one this time. (Yes, that's wildly irresponsible. Yes, he should have gone to the doctor. You know what, tell it to fucking Nikki Haley because it's her fault he's not insured.) He did some research about concussion and painkillers and said he needed to take something other than Excedrin, preferably Tylenol. He was pretty upset because we didn't have any Tylenol and his head hurt. So I realized that often, different me brands of the same medicine will have similar mes, and another painkiller that ended in ""ol"" might have the same active ingredient as Tylenol. I looked up the active ingredients online and checked the bottle to make sure, and then gave him a Midol from my supply. So most of the medical knowledge in that scerio came from him, but I was the one who realized that Midol would probably help and did the research to verify it."
1	When my aunt was sick with cancer a few years ago, I read up about information from John Hopkins to see how I could help help and then told her about it and provided literature. It showed her how she could alleviate pain through a lot of methods that I persolly assisted her with, and later it her cancer went into recession, happily.
-1	I had to go get a mammogram so I researched online about it and learned stuff.
-1	When my mother in law got sick with cancer she needed alot of support.  Since having going through it with my mom, I was able to tell her some of the things that she would possibly experience with chemo.  We were able to go to the store to get some things to make her comfortable throughout the process.
1	My daughter frequently has rashes and I have taken her in a few times to have them checked out but they are just eczema. Now I am able to diagnose that myself. We also are able to handle small issues at home like colds and mild fevers with confidence.
1	I worked in a residential care facility for 11 years as a certified medical aide. It was my job to dispense medication according to doctor's orders, as well as provide medical care to patients who had medical procedures done like surgeries, for example. We also had clients who would have to do certain things to prepare them for the procedures, which usually included a list of doctors orders like fasting, colon cleansing, etc.
-1	I was having inflammation in my sweat glands and I researched what my symptoms were and I found out I actually had a skin disease and my doctor ended up diagnosing me with what i had found
1	An experience that occurred that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues would be when my mother was telling my about some symptoms she was experiencing which raised some red flags. I was extremely concerned with the symptoms she was describing so I insisted she speak with a medical professiol to be examined to find out what were causing her symptoms.
1	Several years ago I was having trouble getting pregnt. I had to go through a bunch of fertility treatments including giving myself shots. I researched everything and spoke with medical professiols on many occasions. Not long after my first child was born, I had a friend going through the same exact thing that I had gone through. I was able to explain a lot of what she would have to do and what it would be like for her since I had just gone through it.
1	My boyfriend has MS and during the time of his diagnosis I spent a lot of time doing research in order to to keep up with doctors when discussing his medical options, as well as on medications that were mentioned.
1	Nothing special, It's just migraine.
1	I've lead a very healthy life however I've had 2 brothers who both passed from cancer. My oldest brother died first and I was the only relative to be there for him. Because of that, when my middle brother passed I had a working knowledge of questions to ask the attending physicians and what to expect when the time actually came.
1	I was a C a few years ago.  I also took pharmacology in order to get in to nursing school. I never entered nursing school, although I was admitted.
1	When my daughter fell and hurt her ankle, I was able to stabilize and care for her until we were able to get to a night time clinic for professiol care. The doctor on staff confirmed that I had provided the correct temporary care for her.
1	I have some experience dealing with IBS which hasn't responded that well to conventiol treatment. I have been able to learn about ways to mitigate it without having to take drugs.
-1	I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol so I am familiar with medical terms and how they affect my life. I was a corrections officer in the infirmary and had several cases that I was able to help because of recognizing certain symptoms.  
1	I have asthma so that has made me more aware of my health choices and medical issues. 
1	One time I was talking with a co-worker and she was talking about her nephew that had been born with heart defects.  I know a lot about congenital heart defects because my daughter has that also.
1	When my mother doted her kidney to my aunt, I feel like I learned a lot about medical issues. The entire family felt the need to educate ourselves on the issue. Overall, I feel like I became much more comfortable with the medical environment as a result.
1	At one point in my life i was constantly sore and fatigued. No matter how much sleep i had i would always be tired and had poor recovery from excercise. After researching and cutting out all forms of sugar, processed foods, and dairy and started to eat a plant based diet, My health became amazing. I looked and felt amazing. I never even imagined it was possible to feel so good and have so much energy
-1	I recently went through surgery to remove some abnormal cells off of my cervix and this opened my eyes to better women's health.
1	Like I stated  eariler  in this survey, Im a type 1 diabetic.  Im a mamber of many support  groups and  have built  my own  glucos moniter  so that i could  get my  blood sugars  on my smart watch. 
-1	I had to take an MRI on my knees to look for problems. The nurse was trying to explain to me how it worked but I already knew how because I had read about them. 
1	In the past, I have had kidney stones. During the emergency room visit, I was given an IV of an anti-inflammatory drug. I was also told to drink plenty of fluids and was forced to urite. I was able to successfully pass the stone.
-1	I had really bad pains in my right side after eating several times.  I suspected it was my gall bladder because I have friends wohad similar problems.  I had to visit the doctor.  I was correct.
-1	My daughter has a history of passing out and when it happened the first time she had a battery of tests that told us that nothing was wrong with her. It happened several more times and while teachers and coaches freaked out when it happened, I informed them that it was likely caused by my daughter being under the weather - having a cold come on or a low grade fever - as that is what caused these episodes previously. I knew this because of the previous doctor visits and asking questions while at these visits. 
1	My youngest daughter fell and she thought she broke her wrist. It was swollen but not deformed and she was able to move her hand and fingers. I iced it and waited a day and saw no bruising, so I assumed it was sprained and not broken. I guess I could have been wrong, but in this situation I was right. The swelling went down with ice and the pain was gone in a couple days.
-1	When I tried to eat salads
1	After i was diagnosed with Type II diabetes (three years ago) i got little to no help from my Dr. So, i took to the net and learned everything i could about it. One thing i learned is that i can deduct the fiber count from the carb count and that will be my total net carb intake.   When i was at my Dr's office and mentioned this, she did not seem to know about it or was surprised that i knew about. 
1	I recently had kidney stones again. I had them once before a year ago, and when I started having pain in my back I knew that it was most likely kidney stones. I went to the doctor and it took a while for them to do tests to find it but eventually they found the stone in my ureter. I was right about my diagnosis. 
1	A time that I demonstrated knowledge of health or medical issues in my life was when I was with my friend David. David suffers from diabetes and fainted when we were out walking the streets of shville. I was very aware of his condition and ran into the nearest restaurant and got orange juice. We rushed back to David and gave him the orange juice and some food and he was able to get oriented pretty quickly after that before checking his sugar and insulin levels. 
-1	
1	When I was diagnosed with thyroid disease and the depression that is often related to the disease did not go away after being medicated and having normal results, I researched and found that I may need an addition medication to help with the absorption of the synthroid. I spoke with my doctor and he prescribed me the additiol medication to help me absorb the synthroid better. As a result, my depression did go away... which could have been due to my request...I also have had other chronic health issues that I am knowledgeable about only because I have been undergoing treatment for decades. I also noticed a friend having neurological side effects from long term haldol use. I told this friend that I thought he may have tardive dyskinesia which, as it turned out, he did...   Other than that I do not believe I have a great knowledge of health or medical issues.
1	When I birthed my son, I took no preparation courses and I handled the birth well. I understood the progression of labor to delivery and knew what to expect without educating myself otherwise. 
1	having gone to the doctors myself and then going with my family members
-1	"An experience that demonstrated my knowledge was at my friends place. My friend's father complained about swelling on a bruise located on this kneecap. He apparently still believes in old methods of injuries and says that there is bad ""chi"" blocking. He would take a slipper to smack the bruise and this gives him relief. I was really shocked at this thinking and I had to stop him and explained that the swelling is because the vessels are damaged so the blood is clogged in the area which gives the swelling look. His solution should be massaging the area so the blood flows away."
1	I just go to the doctor and have seen people be diagnosed. I know basic stuff
1	My daughter was stung by a wasp last August. We were celebrating my ex-wife's birthday with her when this happened, and she has a tendency to panic about things. I thought she was just comforting the little one upstairs, but when I went to check she was on the phone with 911 concerned about allergic reaction. It had been long enough that it was pretty clear our daughter wasn't going to have any kind of serious 911-warranting emergency reaction so I helped the operator convince her that she was overreacting and calm her down.
1	I have a undergrad degree in human biological sciences. This degree is essentially a pre-med degree. 
1	I enjoy reading articles on health from many sources. My mother is also a doctor and tends to explain things to me about medical issues. Even if I ask her a general question, she wants to give me much more information than I asked for.
1	I got salmonella poisoning one time, I was very sick for 5 days. I filly took my temperature and it was at 105 degrees. I knew that anything above 104 could be deadly, so I arranged a ride to take me to the emergency room.
1	I had a condition in which my ear produced wax without stop. A friend of mine started having the same problem as me some years later and I was able to help him in solving the problem.
1	I remember a spring where I was constantly congested and had itchy eyes. With the knowledge I had about my symptoms and exterl factors, I guessed I had allergies or hay fever. I felt confident in knowing why my body was like that.
1	what i typically do to help my hypertension is read a lot of nutritiol labels. i try to keep my sodium intake fairly low (a lot of salt makes me really bloated anyway) and i always look at fat and carb content. this is something i do every time i buy a packaged food that has a label on it. if it doesn't have a label, i look it up on my phone if i am shopping. this helps me be much more knowledgeable and aware of what i am eating.
1	One experience that demonstrates my medical knowledge was that I lost about 30 pounds over two years and gained a good amount of healthy lean muscle. Getting fit involved learning about and counting calories, choosing healthy proteins and carbohydrate sources with enough fat, and learning about exercise. Through this learning process, I was able to lose this weight in a healthy way, and improve in my efforts at the gym greatly. 
1	In general, I have little knowledge of health and medical issues. The only thing I can think of to describe is a time in my early twenties when I went on a no-grain diet. I had read about the diet and what it entailed, and while looking back, I think it was a poor choice, I was clearly acting on knowledge (however misguided) of a health topic. 
1	I worked as an Arizo Paramedic for 10 years
1	I had a knowledge of health issues when I saw a spot on my mom's hand. I knew the ABCD method of detecting skin cancer, so I told my mom she should get to a doctor because it fit all the criteria. Sure enough, the doctor said that it was skin cancer after he performed a biopsy and she had surgery to remove it. Luckily it was still in the early stages, but the doctor said I should be proud of myself for noticing and knowing the criteria, because if I had just brushed it off, it could have gotten a lot worse. 
1	My husband is a T1 diabetic, my daughter was born with spi bifida and my grandmother is blind. I have a lot of experience with hospitals, doctors, and their forms.
-1	MY HUSBAND WAS FEELING DIZZY AND FELT WEAK. KNOWING THAT MY MOM'S FAMILY HAD LOW BLOOD SYMPTOMS AND AFTER CHECKING HIS BLOOD PRESSURE, I KNEW HIS SUGAR WAS LOW. SO, I GAVE HIM ORANGE JUICE.
1	I 'm not sure that I really have one. I am on medications for anxiety and depression. Before they figured out what worked for me, I went through a long list of medications that did not work, so in that sense, I was able to determine what worked for me. 
1	I cut my finger while working in the dirt. I had to keep working, but i knew mi finger would get infected if I did without taking care of it. So I washed it, cleaned it with peroxide, bandaged it then put a glove over my hand. It healed fine and never got infected
1	When I was diagnosed with asthma, I had no idea what it was and it really tested my knowledge.
1	I was able to help my mom choose the correct insulin when she was faced with a choice of switching medicine. I was able to help her read and understand the benefits and side effects of each drug.
1	My friend broke his arm a few years back. I was the only one around so I made a splint out of sweater and some wood. When we got to the ER, the nurse complimented me on my splint.
1	After a mammogram showed an area of question, I knew not to panic right away as there could be different reasons for this. Sure enough, after a follow up, it was shown to just be folded skin.
1	I was sent home from the hospital and told to monitor my intake and outake to check for kidney function.  I measured everything I drank and all urine to determine whether or not to call the doctor.  At one point, my intake was almost twice my outtake.  I called the doctor and was hospitalized because my kidneys were shutting down.
-1	I just have a general knowledge about health and medicine. I do not have any significant expertise, and i have not gone to med school. But when my son scrapes his knee, I clean the wound and put on a band aid. 
-1	Well one occassion where i was having severe headaches everyday for about a week without stopping i knew something was wrong. I went to the doctor and i already was hoping for them to do a head scan to see what was wrong. They showed me i had severe chronic migrane and i needed to start taking a few medications . I totally understood everything when it comes to my health and how much i know my body
1	I went with a relative to the doctor for a medial emergency. The doctor made assumptions and gave them the wrong diagnosis. They began ordering all kinds of tests that were for the wrong things. I told them what to really check for based on the symptoms and I was correct. They canceled the tests and changed the diagnosis. 
1	A couple of years ago, I began to feel extremely anxious. This is a problem because it told me my anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medication was no longer doing its job. My doctor chose to make no adjustments. I knew, from being told by several different therapists, that eventually mental health medications can either stop working or bring your brain chemistry up to a level where it's no longer needed. That I might need off the medication or to be switched to a different one. My doc seemed uware of this. When I couldn't get the help I needed, I changed docs.
-1	When I decided to get into shape. I did all my due diligence and learned the value of eating clean and exercising regularly. By learning to restrict my calories and exercising to create a caloric deficit. This not only helped me drop the pounds but helped with my asthma. 
1	I have two elderly parents who live part time in Florida, where I live, and I am usually called upon to help them if there are any serious health issues that come up as the rest of my family lives up north. I have more than once had to spend time in the hospital as the only receiver of their health info for the family.
1	My child was sick and caught croup. My wife freaked out and said we should go to the hospital, I told her there was nothing they could do and to just make a doctor's appointment instead.
1	My wife had a tooth pulled and it would not stop bleeding. I told her to put a tea bag pver it and that would help stop the bleeding.
1	When I was diagnosed with Trigemil Neuralgia, my neurologist was surprised to find that I actually knew what that was, and what the treatments for it were.  I had done some research prior to going in to see what could have been causing such terrible pain.  My research came up with the TN diagnosis.  However, I wanted a professiol's opinion before deciding with any certainty that TN was indeed what I had, or requesting treatment for it.
1	When dealing with my children I have to fill out all there medical forms and deal with there illnesses or injuries.   I would say just having children you learn a lot by raising them about what is severe and not.  You know when the doctor needs to be called or visited.
-1	When I was twelve years old, a drunk driver hit the car my mother was driving while I was in the backseat. I have very few memories of the accident, but I do faintly recall a serious but calming face as I was gently lifted out of the car. The paramedic held my hand as we traveled to the hospital. I was in the hospital for several weeks and that same paramedic came to visit me almost every day. During my stay, I also got to know the various doctors and nurses in the hospital on a persol level. I remember feeling anxiety about my condition, but not sadness or even fear. It seemed to me that those around me, particularly my family, were more fearful of what might happen to me than I was. I donât believe it was innocence or ignorance, but rather a trust in the abilities of my doctors
1	I can't say there has been an experience in my life that would demonstrate medical knowledge. 
1	when i found a lump in my right chest  just below my nipple. I knew that breast cancer is rare for males, but not impossible. So i went to the DR. to find out what he thought. He fealt it was nothing major, but had tests done just to make sure, which i figured was likely when i went in.
-1	i was diagnosed with high colestoral, I was given Lipitor and took the drug as proscribed.  On the next vist to the doctor my colestoral was within acceptable limits
1	A co-worker cut his leg at work one night and was bleeding like a stuck pig.  I got a flatbed cart and told the boss.  I ran with the cart to my co-worker, had him lie on the cart holding a towel to his leg to apply pressure, and got a cardboard box for him to elevate his leg.  By the time the boss got there, he was ready to transport to medical.
-1	I was able to detemine if some one has a cold has opposed to an allergy, by the type of symptoms and the pollen count at the time.
1	I was discovered to have high blood pressure a few years ago.  I started taking medication and my BP was lower but I felt terrible.  No energy at all.  So I went back to the doctor and described my symptoms so he put me on a different pill and now I'm doing fine.  I guess that demonstrates my understanding of making sure I get the right medication for me.
1	My college did a free health screening that I participated in, and while I was being explained my results I was able to correct the medical student on several items.
1	My father is a doctor and my mother is a nurse. I'm not the best with math however. 
1	There was a time that I fell and hurt my wrist. I couldn't twist my wrist or bend it without pain and I knew that it was more than just a sprain. I figured it was broken and so I went to the hospital to have an x-ray.
1	A friend of mine actually recently had a mammogram that came out positive. I told her there was a good chance that it was a false positive and might just be a cyst or something. It did in fact turn out to be a false positive.
1	I got bit by a tick and contracted Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever so I went and looked it up and learned as much as I could about it and even offered information to my own doctor.
-1	Probably when I had to go for lab work and had to find out about my thyroid. I knew I had a high TSH level, but my Free T3 and my Free t4 was insanely low too. So I had to tell my doctor about those and she was shocked and said I was right. So now we not only look at my TSH , we also look at my Free T3 Free t4 too. Because you can have a normal TSH but have low Free T3 and Free t4 in hypothyroidism. I feel my best when my levels are optimal, not just normal.
1	When reading the paperwork on a new medication, I discovered that it was Not advised in someone with my other conditions. Called and told the doctor.
1	A FEW MONTHS AGO MY DAUGHTER HAD A SORE THROAT, FEVER, AND HAD TROUBLE SWALLOWING. BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN A FEW INSTANCES OF STREP THROAT IN HER SCHOOL, I HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SHE DID TOO. I KEPT HER OUT OF SCHOOL, MADE HER REST AND DRINK A LOT, AND I TOOK HER TO THE DOCTOR. MY GUESS WAS CONFIRMED, AND AN ANTIBIOTIC WAS PRESCRIBED.. 
1	I was diagnosed with a chronic disease a few years ago. I searched a lot of medical information and knowledge online, and consulted with many peoples about this disease. Now, i am taking some medicines to control this disease. I could adjust my medicines based on the self-testing results now. 
-1	Mostly contra indications of my husband's many meds, how to maintain a dyalysis patient, deal with doctors and ask questions that got my husband the right treatment. Also stopped an amputation of Grandmother's leg by indicating the need for a Doppler as she had phlebitis. Only her toe was then amputated.
1	I started being seen by Dr.'s at a very young age, around 5-6, due to gastrointestil issues. Later, as a teen, I was diagnosed with mental health issues such as bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety. Now, as an adult, I believe I am suffering the consequences due to my past issues and, while still dealing with anxiety and also having other issues come up. I have had a broad range of medical experiences.
1	I once had an abscessed tooth which caused major swelling in my gums. I remembered that peroxide worked as a mild antiseptic agent and salt water tends to reduce inflammation. With the combition of both of these things, I was able to reduce the swelling.
1	My husband told me he was peeing blood and that it hurt to pee. He tends to freak out about these things. I told him it was just a UTI. I told him I could make an appointment for him in the morning, but he dove to the ER instead. They said it was an UTi and gave him antibiotics. Im SO glad he listened to me :( spent $300 at the ER instead of waiting for the morning to see his regualr physician and co pay of $30.
1	I have a genetic predisposition to kidney stones. The first time they occurred, I ended up in the emergency room because I was in great pain and didn't know what was causing it. I learned as much as I could from the doctor and online information so that I could prevent that situation from happening again. Since then, I have only experienced one reoccurrence and I was able to alleviate and reverse it by taking the proper steps as soon as I recognized the symptoms beginning. It kept me out of the hospital and hopefully free of any future issues. 
1	One of my daughters was born with heart defects (ASD, PDA, Coarc) - I got a crash course in medical issues during her 2 heart surgeries.
1	I had never had an abnormal mammogram until I moved to a new area of the country, and my old mammograms were lost due to flooding. For the next several years I was told I needed further screening after every single annual mammogram. None of this further screening revealed any signs of cancer. I discussed the situation with my doctor and asked to be sent to a different provider for my next mammogram. I have not had an abnormal mammogram since.
1	The 2nd time I got cancer I pretty much knew what I would have to go through. I knew it was not going to be fun and I knew I would have tons of tests .It was not a good time in my life.
1	It was just a few days ago, I got a sore throat. I knew I gargle warm water with salt it would go away. Then few days later, no more sore throat.

I try to make myself knowledgeable whenever I have a medical issues by studying and inquiring.

I was thought I knew the causes so I asked them if they were running everyday and if they continued running after pulling the muscle. When they answered yes on both counts I explained that they needed to add rest days to their routine and that the hip pain was the result of the body making unconscious corrections in running style due to the pulled muscle. I recommended they take a week off to heal up and some NSAIDs to keep swelling down. The recommendations were effective.
1	I had an experience with a situation where my husband was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and was medically induced/placed in a coma.There was no action on the part of the team at this hospital to help correct the problem. I contacted a neurosurgeon in another city because I knew there was a 48-72 hr window for any help to be successful. He was airlifted to the facility and recieved a coilb procedure to seal of the bleeding. He survived.
1	I really don't know how to answer this question. I really can't say I've had an experience that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues. If I have a problem, I will either make an appointment with a doctor, or I will research online and probably attempt to treat, avoid or ignore whatever issue I am facing depending on its severity.
1	
1	I woorked in a hospital as a night shift computer operator. Part of my function was to print the bills. What an eye opener as to the horrible cost of medical care in the US. As recently as today I am reminded of the cost of healthcare in the US with ads about bankruptcy due to medical bills and how people have to hock eveyrthing to pay off their medical bills. What a mess!
1	I went to the dermatologist and found out I was correct about a rash that had appeared on my forehead. I had been putting on a mix of over the counter creams that she was going to recommend, but I found them to be lacking so she gave me a prescription for something stronger to help.

-1	I had a cyst on my butt that I tried to treat at home until the pain became so unbearable that I had to seek medical help. The doctor sliced open the swollen area and odorous pulse came out of it.

-1	I am 41 with three kids. I have a mother who gets sick, my grand parents who have been in an out, and those who i interact with on facebook., My knowledge of medical is really based on what i have had explained to me within those visits.

-1	I went to a doctor because i had a lump at my side. it was the size of a marble and it was black in color compare to my lighter carmel complexion. it was painful to touch and i could not lay down on that side of my body.  The doctor told me it was just fat tissue when she felt it and said she could do minor surgery and remove it by cutting it out. I told her i'll decide if to do surgery to remove it. I did my own research online based on signs and symptoms and the swelling turned out to be a acne cyst. I look up treatment for cyst and treat the problem myself. the pain disappeared and the swelling went down flat.
-1	when i get a cold i know that things to do to get myself well. i know the foods to eat. i know to rest and what medicines to buy.
1	It seems that regularly I am able to self-diagnose many problems and make necessary changes that get me on the correct path before I even see my doctor to get his opinion. I have adapted my diet and lifestyle to combat symptoms in advance only to have my doctor commend me on being proactive with my condition.
1	About two years ago I awoke one morning with a large bump on my back.  It was very painful and pus was oozing out of it.  I went to the minute clinic because that was fast to get into.  The lady just said it was probably a bug bite and nothing serious.  I hadn't ever had a reaction like this to a bug before and knew that where the bump was, on my back near my spine, that I needed to get another opinion.  I got into my normal physician about five hours later.  he said it was good that I came in because it was severely infected and the infection area was getting very close to my spine and getting into my blood stream.  If I hadn't known something was worse than was diagnosed at the minute clinic I could have easily ended up in the hospital.

1	I began experiencing severe coldness in my fingers of my left hand, to the point where the digits turned blue and dark purple (even when I was indoors at 65 degrees). This progressed to affect my nose, left foot toes, and sometimes my nipples, with severe episodes causing my fingerils to develop waves and my fingers to develop painful lesions that scarred. I researched and figured out that I have Rayud's syndrome and that constriction in my blood vessels was likely due to stress, cold temperatures, etc. Through diet and exercise, I have reduced the number of episodes that I have. 
-1	I kept having very severe reactions after eating certain types of food or consuming certain drinks. It was very painful, like being punched in the stomach from the inside. I suspected it had to do with my being sensitive to the acid content of what I had and it could be acid reflux. I went to my doctor and sure enough, my suspicions were correct. 
1	I have borderline high cholesterol.  Although the doctor did not go into detail with me about my cholesterol levels, I understand the relationship between HDL and LDL and triglycerides to know that my high cholesterol reading is not necessarily alarming.  I also understand what I need to do to improve my cholesterol reading and independently (without medication) took some measures that lowered my cholesterol level by 11 points over a year.
1	Being able to basically consult my direct family and tell them when to get what medication and when to see a doctor demonstrates my knowledge of health and medical issues, Sometimes I feel very informed even though it may be basic knowledge.
1	I was doing some cleaning and lifting heavy objects when I felt something in my stomach and groin area, I thought maybe I pulled a muscle, but then a bit later I noticed a bulge in my groin.

Turns out, my daughter had developed an allergy to tree-nuts. My husband is deathly allergic to eggs, so I had an idea of what a food-allergy reaction looked like & how serious it COULD be. I'm also aware that allergies can develop or fade away at any age, or stay the same for life.
1	i honestly dont know what to put here, i dont feel ive ever shown something like this in a significant way
1	My child had been ill with a fever, random usea and fatigue. After the fever and usea had passed, he was still extremely fatigued and had swollen glands. Even though I had never known anyone to experience it, I suspected mono since this was unusual for him to be so tired. He had bloodwork done and he was in fact infected with mono.
1	Taking a drug for ADHD required me to understand the health risks associated with an amphetamine.  I had to understand percentage and probability risks for things like heart attack due to chest pains and irregularities.
-1	Changes in the body which are not pleasant
1	My wife was rushed to the hospital in extreme pain. She was worried it was something serious. The area that was in pain and her symptoms lead me to believe she had a hernia or cyst that was causing the pain. After she was admitted it turned out it was a cyst that cause the pain. It was nothing serious as I kept telling her. 
1	I have been able to diagnose and override a doctor when my brother was on the clinic, and It turned out that I was right.

1	No experience with this type of medical issues
1	I'm not sure I can think of one. My cat was diabetic  so I had to give him insulin and when he went into kidney failure I gave him fluids so I understand the technical process but I don't feel I have a proper understanding of the actual disease.
1	I sometimes discuss my friend's medical condition with them. I will pass along information I have confirmed with my doctor.
1	
1	I felt that I was going to faint after I had spent a long time standing up in a particularly hot office. I had had similar experiences  before, and had researched the subject of the vasovagal response and the best action to take in that situation. I quickly got to the ground, elevated my legs, and tensed my leg muscles as I had researched.  As a result, I didn't faint and was able to stand up again and resume work shortly afterwards.
-1	The most important experience was when I took my state board exams for my PTA license. I had to be well versed in medical terminology as well as diseases and the causes and treatment for each one. Most important was knowing what muscle controls what part of the body. 
-1	When I had my first heart attack I was in really bad shape. When I got out I was given all of these different types of exercises to follow every day in order to keep me in tact with my health.  It was difficult to keep up with. I had to get family to help me out with my schedule.  I learned so much during this trial about things I didnt even know about my own body and health. 
1	The second time that I got pregnt I felt as though I had a great knowledge of the process. This is the only medical issue that I am very familiar with. Now that I have friends who are pregnt I get to show my knowledge. 
-1	i   got knowledge through friends  and relations health problems
-1	I have had multiple friends and loved ones pass away from cancer, so therefor have looked into the topic of cancer in itself and the single fact that cancer is a business in this country.
1	When I was diagnosed with pcos. I am able to explain to people the effects of having it and what exactly it is. A lot of people have never even heard of it.
1	I have not had many experiences in my life to help my knowledge of health or medical issues. I am studying to become a nurse, so I have taking a couple of Atomy and Physiology courses that have helped a bit. My grandmother is also a nurse, and I am sure just talking to her has had a little bit of an effect on my understanding.
1	Most of my knowledge of health issues would have to be because of my husband who has several of the health issues that you listed in your examples/questions above. He has diabetes, high cholesterol, has had stints put in twice and was diagnosed with prostate cancer, high blood pressure and others. He doesn't fit the norm for most of these, not overweight, gets plenty of exercise and is active, etc. So I have learned quite a bit through his treatments and issues. 
1	A couple of years ago, I had some kind of a bump on my upper leg. It kind of freaked me out, not knowing what it was and how it developed. But instead of worrying too much about it and running to the doctor I just watched it to see if it began to hurt or get bigger. I didn't want to scare myself or my family too much about it so I just waited. I also didn't look anything up online, knowing that that would only make me much more anxious and scared. Eventually, it went away, as I believe it was just from stress or something.
-1	Once I had a tiny growth on my thyroid. One doctor (who was slash for cash happy) wanted to rip it out. In light of the fact that I'm a singer, I instead elected to monitor it once a year. There has been no change in the 6 years I have been monitoring it. 
1	When I had to take a family member to the hospital. The person fell from his roof I brought them there. I had to fill out all the paperwork since their was no one else in the state to do so. 
1	When my father was still around, he tripped over a shovel in the backyard. he couldn't get up, so he called me with his cell phone. I only lived about 10 minutes away so i drove over and entered through the backyard. his ankle was swollen pretty badly. So I helped him up and brought him inside. I knew we probably had to take him to the hospital to get it checked out, but him being a stubborn old man, he refused. I had him sit in a chair and brought another chair over so he could elevate his leg. I put a pillow under his foot and taped an ice pack around his ankle. We them argued for about 15 minutes about going to the doctor and I eventually convinced him to talk to an advise nurse. The advice nurse told him to elevate his leg and keep it iced. If it didn't improve within a half hour, to come in to be checked. 3 hours pass and nothing improved, so I eventually got him to agree to go to the hospital.
-1	I guess when I was talking to my husband about diabetes. My father has it, so I was able to tell him about my dad's condition with an above basic level of understanding.

1	A time in my life when I had to demonstrate my knowledge of a medical issue was a time when I had to help care for my sick relative, I had to learn about their condition and the medication they took.  I had to take them to the hospital one evening and explain to the doctors their condition and medication.
-1	In my studies of my own ailments such as blood pressure
1	I came down with flu-like symptoms but experienced headaches and stiffness in my neck that are symptoms of a more serious ailment: meningitis. I quickly sought the assistance of a health practitioner that commended me for recognizing the dangers and not trying to remedy the situation myself.
1	I have persolly been through two surgeries, one was an adenoidectomy and the second was to remove my gall bladder. My sister is also a nurse and we have discussed different medical issues. I also remember my experiences with my grandmother and her fight against cancer and diabetes.
1	Having children made me a pseudo expert in diagnosing health issues and adding to my health knowledge. Many times, my children would exhibit symptoms and if they appear benign enough I would go online to check symtoms to self diagnose. While doing that, I've read up and gained a lto of knowledge on many different illnesses and its treatments. 
1	My fiance had 3 strokes in 3 weeks in March of 2017. Fortutely, I was aware of the warning signs, and got her help before things got too out of hand. I've also helped her with her other medical issues, so I know what meds to go for when she has a problem.
-1	i think just going to the doctor all these years and listineing to her has really educated me in so many things but i google a lot of symptons too and learn a lot fron the internet web md
1	This is kind of a hard question to answer. I have never had any serious medical issues persolly. I have extensive knowledge of many issues my father had prior to his death. He was a diabetic, along with the majority of his siblings and mother. I know that there could be a high probability that I could acquire diabetes myself if I don't take care of my body by watching what I eat and exercising  regularly.
1	I had blood work done and my glucose level was 130. My doctor was worried that this was elevated. I explained I had just eaten shortly before my blood work. I asked if there was a reading on my A1C. My A1C was checked and not a cause for concern. I had my glucose re-tested later that week and it was below 100.
-1	I would get tested with how these things are done and how people were doing and making sure that these things can work
1	I like helping people figure out the dosage recommended of a specific medicine and also look up symptoms to try and diagnose an ailment. 
1	A few years ago I decided to severely reduce my sugar intake due to the harm caused my eating too much. I avoid little added sugar as possible and reduced my carbohydates.
1	I once cut my hand on glass pretty bad. I was able to clean it, stop the bleeding, and bandage it fairly quickly without going to the doctor.  
1	When my daughter was born she has SVT, which essentially was a hole in her heart that led to an elevated blood pressure.  She had to spend the first three days in the NICU, take medicine once a day for a year, and see the cardiologist once a week.  
-1	I tore a muscle in my back off the bone working out. I was able to figure all this out by doing my own research and saved myself a lot of money by doing so. 
-1	I was diagnosed with breast cancer and I did a lot of research about it by finding every medical book on the subject and reading it and then going to see the surgeon to discuss my options. 
1	I don't think there are any great stories in my life that would tell about that kind of thing, so I don't know if this is any good...  I just try to follow the low-carb diet my doctor said I should follow every day and take my medications as directed.
1	I noticed my friend was smiling weird.  Her smile was crooked.  I knew this was a sign of a stroke and got my friend to the hospital.  They were able to give her medication to prevent a major stroke.
-1	I suppose helping a friend who's wife was pregnt as I had gone through the same thing a year prior.
-1	I persolly have been very lucky as far as my health goes. I have pretty good health for my age. My sister had cancer, I learned a lot while being with her at the hospital. My son was in a coma for thirteen days, I gained some knowledge while he was in the hospital. I do not think I have a great deal of medical knowledge. I did sell health and life insurance for a few years so I know some of the terminologies but not that much on what each condition details.
-1	The time that I had IVF's.  I learned a lot about difficulty of having a baby.
1	I had a friend who was acting quite unusual.  Her behavior was odd, yet quite familiar.  As a person who is treated for depression, I have read up a great deal about the condition, where I even volunteer to counsel other who also experience depression. I knew the signs right away, and talked to her.  Luckily, I referred her to a licensed mental health specialist to get the care and propoer diagnosis that she needs.
-1	The first time I went to a doctor's visit alone. I had been enough times that I did not need any help asking questions or filling forms. 
1	It is difficult to say but I have a certification in CPR, I exercise regularly, received all my vaccitions because I believe in them.
1	One day my mother told me she was having severe stomach pain.  The pain happened when her stomach was more empty.  Drinking milk relieved the pain.  I had heard of this and told her to go to the doctor and tell them she probably has an ulcer and needed some antibiotics.  She did that and came home with the antibiotics.  Her stomach pain went away for several years before flaring up again.  
1	For several years, I helped my parents with chronic health conditions including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. I learned a lot about those conditions and was constantly applying what I learned to daily situations including maging high and low blood sugar, confusion, and activating community resources for their situation.
-1	I started having bad headaches then I started having seizures. I had never had seizures before. about six months past and I had a stroke.   
1	I didn't have insurance and I had an abscess in my mouth where a tooth had decayed.  I ended up treating it with fish antibiotics.  This did the trick as I felt better in 2 days (but continued to take the antibiotics for a week).  A few weeks later I got the rest of the tooth removed at a dental school on the cheap.  But yeah I knew what to do in that instant without going to the emergency room and getting a huge bill and prescription I couldn't afford.
-1	I knew my symptoms were aligned with a certain diagnosis. I explained it to my doctor and he realized that I was correct based on my symptoms. 
-1	"The first time my husband and I were expecting a baby, we found out that we had lost her at 13 weeks.  I was scheduled to have a D & C at the end of the week on Friday, but began to bleed on Wednesday.  The doctor had me come into the hospital to have a D & C on Wednesday evening.  On Friday, the doctor had me come back to the office for a check up.  I asked if I had been given RhoGam (since I have A+ blood) and was told I was not.   The day I was seen was right before the office was going to close for the Easter weekend.  Had I not asked about the RhoGam and had they not rushed to filly give it to me, the 72 hour would have been missed due to the Easter break.  This doctor knew my blood type but ""forgot"" to give me RhoGam until I asked for it!"
1	I hurt my wrist and had to decide whether or not to make an appointment with my doctor or go to the emergency room at a hospital. I called my doctor and described my symptoms. They asked me about the location, appearance, and other details, and I chose to make an appointment rather than go to a hospital.
1	I used to have to help my grandmother often with her diabetes issues so I am familiar with what most people typically have to do. One day while I was at work, an older coworker of mine started to feel faint because of low blood sugar. I was able to get her something to eat and helped her restore her blood sugar levels back to normal.
1	This one here has; it's likely shown how inept I am at math.
1	My son had a sore throat recently.  He had the sniffles due to allergies and I thought that was the issue at first, but when I took a flashlight and looked at his throat, it was very raw.  Also, he was running a low grade fever.  I knew it must be strep.  Sure enough, the doctor confirmed it.  
1	My mother had an inner ear infection that led to an absess in her brain. She was hospitalized with quite a few surgeries, and spend a couple of months in rehabilitation. There were several doctors explaining several things over the course of her treatment and recovery. 
1	I once had a severe earache. I also had a sinus infection. I deduced that I had an ear infection. The doctor confirmed I had an ear infection.
1	One experience I had that showed my knowledge of health issues was dealing with the hospital when I had a kidney stone. It took 8 visits to get them to listen to me, and search what should have been the first step. I knew they were wrong, and being neglectful, so I pressed them further, and made them do their jobs.
1	I actually had a bacterial infection in my lungs and had went to a doctor who claimed it was a cold. I tried telling him I had no symptoms of a cold and he would not budge and told me to get some Robitussin or something similar. I ended up going to ER where I was diagnosed with a bacterial infection and receive the proper anti bacterial  medicine and within  two days the cough started to subside. Most Dr's just don't bother to spend the time anymore to ask and simply generalize what they think it is based on whatever may be widespread at the time as opposed to your symptoms.
-1	I will say it was when grandmother was diagnosed with brain cancer. Her brain swelled up and there was a medication that could be given her to lower the inflammation on the brain but she had diabetes and this will increase the glucose level. She was 75 years old and I expl to the doctor that based on what I read online the chances of her going into a diabetic coma were almost none. Based on what I read there is a little chance of a person with a high glucose level who is over the age of 70 going into a diabetic coma almost non existing and also she was going to die anyways, the tumor was not operable and it did not respond to radiation.
1	I was quite athletic when I was growing up. Did a lot of weight training and exercise physiology. When I injured myself and had to go to physical therapy. Everything that the therapist was talking about made perfect sense to me, and the verbiage and actual motions used during the exercises were all ready within my muscle memory.
1	I just listen to what my doctor tells me.  If I don't understand, i just ask questions.  I saw my doctor, last week for a check up.  this applies then.  I have no real knowledge of health or medical issues.
1	My friend had recently had recently had a miscarriage and was having problems afterwards that was effecting her work and home life. I suggested that she might have reactive depression which is something that can happen after a miscarriage. She went to see a doctor and he confirmed I was correct. He put her on some medication and she saw a therapist which real he helped her get back to her usual self.
-1	Well, my parents is not very healthy person.  When their was sick, I always took them to see the doctor.  That doctor later become my neighbor and friend.  So he kind of explain and teach me about the medical issues. 
1	I demonstrate my medical knowledge from what I learn from my doctor to other people when the topics come up, for instance with my other friend's children are sick or hurt.
-1	when I was having an extremely hard time breathing I knew something was wrong, I went to the hospital and discovered that I had two PE's in my right lung. I knew it was more than my asthma and I knew it was in my right lung.
-1	"My son while still in highschool got a concussion during practice and I was called to come and get him. I took him to the emergency room. The doctor gave the typical instructions on what not to let him do. I asked him if getting some of the amino acids that act as neurotransmitters to the brain help speed up his recovery. He looked at me as if I had three heads and answered I guess in disbelief that I actually knew something. His response was"" yes""."
1	Recently I've seen that I have more health problems if I sleep less, and my health is better if I sleep more.  So I've been trying to sleep more because sometimes if I sleep less my ear starts hurting.
1	"I've been dealing with back pain for a while (over a few years) so throughout my pain 'journey' i have researched anything from sciatica, plantar fasciitis (which caused this whole thing from the beginning) as well as knowing different terminology for my symptoms as well as the body parts...like explaining to my (new) chiropractor and/or physical therapist which part of my body that are having problems and what kind of exercises i've done. I actually have gone to my doctor at one point (for a follow up visit) and he started our conversation with ""So, what did your online research find?"" and after I explained what I've found he confirmed yes/no on what I read and it was quite a good and efficient meeting."
1	I had a pain in my neck that was getting worse and I figured it was because I was using my tablet and my head was at a angle that was causing me problems. I started setting my tablet at different angle and over the course of a couple of weeks my neck pain faded and then completely went. If I would have still had the pain after a couple of weeks I would have went to the doctor, but since that time I have never had any problems with it again.
1	A close friend developed high blood pressure and prediabetes. Doctors put him on medication that he didn't want to take, and they gave him a (truly) lousy diet and exercise program that would've ensured he stayed on the meds forever. I cleaned up his diet, got him on a sensible training program, and now he doesn't need to take any medication.
1	My exposure to medical topics began when I was very young. I grew up on a dairy farm and when I was about 10 I started helping the vet when they came to do herd checks, etc. I have worked in hospitals as a med tech in the ED and lab so I am very comfortable around it when I am not the patient. In my late 20s I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and that was when things began to go downhill health-wise. I had to learn a lot about autoimmune diseases and honestly believe if I hadn't fired my docs at the end of 1999, I would be dead now.
1	I play basketball a lot. I was also interested in sports medicine. I have twisted my ankle numerous times over the years. My knowledge on how to treat sprains was an asset to me. 
1	i sometimes kinda diagnose my aliments using google,however i am not very good at it. when i was a teeger.my girl friend at that time was babysitting a 7 year old boy,who fell off a swing and broke his arm.she called me first since i was only a few houses away,and asked me what to do.i went over there and his arm had a u shaped fracture.i told her to call an ambulance.thats it,thats all i got.
1	I learned knowledge of health or medical issues as I was raising my children.  Also my parents had health problems early on because they smoked, ate food that was high in cholesterol so I've learned what not to eat and to exercise to stay as healthy as I can.
-1	I take my kids temperature and if its high i give them medicine.
1	My friend told me about a disorder they had called celiac disease and I already knew quite a lot about the disorder. 
-1	a coworker complained of have the worst sore throat he had ever had i told him he need to get that checked out because if strep  is left unchecked it can damage the heart  he went to the doctor and he had strep
1	When my mother was diagnosed as diabetic, we were told to limit her carb intake. I spent time reading several guides given to me by her doctor and attending two classes given by a registered dietitian. Through diet and medication, we were able to lower her fasting glucose levels significantly.
1	My mom had ALS.  We cared for her at home for 10 years with nursing help during the day.  She was non ambulatory. She was on a ventilator and feeding tube for the majority of that time. I knew how to administer her medication and feed her, change her catheter, change out vent tubing, suction her throat.  She needed total care.  I could care for her myself when we did not have a nurse.  
1	My niece called me and asked about symptoms she was having. I had a good idea of what could be wrong. I told her it was my best guess and that she should see the doctor. It turned out my educated guess was correct.
1	I had leg swelling, and red blotches above my ankles, so I went to a clinic that open.  The doctor there told me that I had cellulitis, but I didn't think so because there was too much pain involved.  I decided to go the hospital ER and get a different opinion.  After the results of the tests, I was informed that I had three blood clots in my outer vein.  I was given antibiotics and a list of doctors to see for the recommended surgery.
-1	I get migraines so it's interesting to see what causes it 
1	Sometimes the math of medicine is a little bit confusing and you have to be very careful not to make any mistakes.
1	I was being evaluated for high risk pregncy due to a blood clot early on.  I had done a lot of research prior to visiting the doctor so that I would have knowledge to understand what the doctors were going to recommend in relation to how my pregncy would progress and how my birth would be.
1	I was able to lose weight a few years ago when I realized that I needed to. I lost about 30 pounds, which was my goal. I accomplished this weight loss by avoiding junk food, eating more fruits and vegetables, and walking every day. I still follow these healthy routines so I can stay fit and healthy.
1	I cant think of any one specific incident.  There have been a few times I have administered first aid like the heimlich maneuver or recognized someone needed to go to the hospital because of a fever or difficulty breathing, etc.
-1	I worked in the service as a nurse aid and learned a lot about the basics
1	I was trying to figure out my results from a blood test.  Much of the information was abbreviated or included terms I was not used to, so I would use the internet to look up the definitions to help determine the results.
-1	I suffer from high blood pressure and obesity I have to monitor everything.
1	I woke up with a cramp in my leg one morning. I took a spoon full of mustard and the cramp went away within 2 minutes and never returned.
1	I was diagnosed about 10 years ago with possible cervical cancer.  The doctor sent me in for a myriad of tests.  I filly had to have surgery to remove the cells that were cancerous.  I followed up ahead of time on all the possible outcomes and any side effects.  Surgery was the best outcome to remove the cells and not have it spread.
1	There hasn't really been just one significant experience that demonstrates my knowledge of health and medical issues. There's just small things that I do to alleviate or resolve medical issues that pop up. For example, I take apple cider vinegar for my indigestion because I know that I have low stomach acid. And I take frequent breaks and move around to prevent my sciatica nerve from acting up.
-1	I care for my mother moderately. She is independent and usually takes care of herself but doesn't have information on important health facts. One afternoon she described to me how she had had difficulties pouring her coffee, she explained how she had to hold one arm with the other to even lift minimally. I insist recognized the symptoms of stroke. We went to the ER where they did find she had a stroke.
1	I had two C-sections. Once when I was 23 and one when I was 27. After the first one I tried to look up a lot more information about C-sections and surgery in general, because I figured I would need another C-section with my second child. I was a lot more informed by the time I had my second C-section, which made the process a lot easier and more comforting for me. I knew what was about to happen, so I did not have to worry as much as I did with the first C-section.
1	My fiance was out of town visiting family and he started feeling sick. Each day that I talked to him he sounded worse. I filly convinced him to go to an Urgent Care and he was diagnosed with an Upper Respiratory Infection.
1	I found out I have Restless Legs Syndrome a few years ago. My doctor had some recommendations, but I did a bit of my own research and found out that low-normal levels of ferritin (stored iron) can exacerbate it. I was then able to follow up with the doctor and get a ferritin test, and confirmed that I should reduce my frequency of doting blood and take an iron supplement when I do. That helped reduce the intensity of my RLS symptoms.
1	I can comprehend health materials as I am very good in science and math. I always look at ways to reduce my risk.
-1	When I was younger I had a terrible problem with heavy menstrual flow, cramps and fibroids. I did my own research, and worked with a conventiol and altertive health care professiol to obtain the results I needed to get rid of the problem. Today I am fine and in great shape.
-1	I was not feeling well one day and could not figure out what was going on. So I went online and pulled up WebMD and searched for all the symptoms I was having and was able to rrow it down to 2 possible things. In doing this I was able to give my doctor a better account of what I was going through.
-1	i was shoot in the leg and i know to tie my leg up to stop the bleeding
1	The increasing pain, stiffness and swelling in my big toes and ankles was an indicator that I had a problem with arthritis, since it was persistent but fluctuated in intensity depending on the weather, not due to trauma or recent injury, and consistent with the development of arthritis in my aunt when she reached the age I'm at now.
-1	When I started breaking out in like a rash and skin kept growing I thought it was psoriasis based on what I had seen before and I turned out to be correct when I went to a dermatologist.
-1	I told my mother to get a flu vaccine as I knew it was helpful.
-1	I whought I had a sinus infection, went to the doctor, and that was confirmed 
-1	I am learning about health and medical issues every day. I have several medical problems that I see a doctor about monthly and I frequently have to go to specialists for this test or that.
1	My children will frequently get sick, and my two year old recently had a slight fever of 99.6, but I simply gave him some over the counter Tylenol, and made sure he stayed hydrated with water and Gatorade. My six year old had the same conditions of fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. I knew it was probably a virus, and did not feel it was necessary to take him to the doctor for it.
1	Once I remember seeing a medical category on Jeoparody!, the game show. I think I got almost every answer.
1	My best friend found some thickening bellow her collarbone. I told her to immediately go to the doctor because I knew there's a big possibility that it's a breast cancer. It turned out to be nothing scary but the doctor told her that I gave her a good advice.
1	After an off-road motorcycle mishap I knew that my leg was seriously damaged.  My leg had been wrenched around under the heavy bike, and I had actually heard a sp.  Once we were able to get the motorcycle off my leg it was obvious to me that there was a serious fracture, perhaps a compound fracture, as any movement would result in a feeling of bone grating together.  I decided that the best thing to do was to keep my tall, heavy boot on to stabilize the lower leg.  I was uble to walk due to the pain, so my friend carried me to the shade so that I'd be out of the hot sun and we elevated the limb.  He went for help leaving me with food and water, I was hungry, but resisted eating much in case surgery would be necessary when I ended up in the hospital.
1	This is a tough question for me.  I dont ever remember an expeience that has demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues.  There were a few times when I knew that one of my children needed to see a doctor, but in these times, my knowledge was intuitive rather than inherant.
1	Not sure if this is what you are looking for but true story. A few years ago I experienced severe pain in my feet that lasted for weeks. I looked up the symptoms and was reasobly sure it was something called plantar fasciitis (sp?). It HURT. I went to my doctor and he agreed with my assessment. Unfortutely there doesn't seem to be an effective treatment other than stretching and not walking (or walking as little as possible) for many months to allow the muscles in the foot to heal. Near the end of the appointment my doctor offered me a shot of cortisone for the pain. I was surprised and promptly refused. The problem with the cortisone shot, in my opinion, is that it simply masks the pain and might lead me to overdo it during a time when I needed to rest, thus making the injury worse instead of better. It took over a year for the problem to go away. Even though I suffered through the pain I feel I made the right choice because the cortisone shot might have made the recovery last even longer!
-1	I saw him live with my mom
1	After having a stress test done I am now informed about all the risks and causes of heart attack and stroke. I had a false positive stress test, but I feel that I have gained a lot of knowledge associated with the heart. Now I have a lot of knowledge and useful information to help take care of my heart and help my family take care of theirs.
1	I studied and researched and read a lot about different forms of birth control before I went to my OBGyn and talked about the best method for me. I think she was impressed that I was so knowledgeable. 
1	A few years ago, I had to watch my mother die of a disease that should have been treated years before, but none of her doctors could ever diagnose it until it was too late. I found it appalling how little the medical professions knows and how much they say they know. It was left to me to care for her, almost without their help. I had to literally demand palliative care for her.
-1	Someone close to me started to freak out about a bump in their buttocks--from persol experience--that sounds like hemorrhoids. I was quite surprised that she was freaking out about such a thing, but it indeed turned out to be hemorrhoids. Another one that comes to mind is that a friend said he had abdomil issues and other related symptoms of appendicitis--I only thought of it because I did some research myself in fear of having it. When he went to his Doctor, it turns out I was correct.
-1	I cannot actually say that I can. After basic stats like one out of ten are mingled with ideas like false positives I lose confidence in my ability to be certain of their meaning. I think I actually deal in comparative strategies like value judging. For example 30% blockage of an blood vessel sounds terrible in and of itself but if the info accompanying that is stents are not used until 55% then that is how i gauge it.
-1	I was given a choice to get a flu shot I was told of all the side effects and I decided to get it.  Later I felt awful.  I called the doctor he stated that it happens sometimes.  I should just drink a lot of fluids and rest.
1	I have a family with a medical background on both sides of the clipboard.  This survey is mostly simple math.
1	Knowledge of my medical condition has helped me to avoid putting myself in a situation where I would be endangered. I know that I will put myself at risk if I do certain things that would increase my heart rate. I also need to slowly raise my health level through proper eating and strengthening myself to make my heart work less. Therefore by overhauling my nutrition and by avoiding those situations I have demonstrated knowledge of health issues. 
1	My family has a long history of medical issues, primarily autoimmune diseases. It has been imperative we stay as healthy as possible as many doctors are not knowledgeable in this field. Treatment is typically left to us and in several cases had better medical knowledge been obtained, lives would have been extended. One family member was lost due to a medical mistake, another to incorrect diagnoses, and another has had quality of life severely impaired because of incorrect diagnoses. I struggle with my own health and have two children with a complex medical history. I have also become the primary caregiver to my mother who is now severely impaired. If I am not fully aware and knowledgeable then the risks are simply too great. It's worth it to me to learn and understand all that I possibly can.  
1	I am working to lower my A1C count due to being pre-diabetic along with trying to lower my cholesterol. I am exercising and cutting back on sweets. I am also cutting back on my fat intake. I have been working on this for the past 5 months. I will be tested again in one month. I have read many articles and talked with my doctor regarding these tests.
-1	I spent a half a year researching if I had diabetes or not.  I found out a lot of things that contributed to diabetes, so I lost weight and balanced out my hormones. I also looked into people who reversed diabetes.  This saved me from the disease. 
1	An experience in my life that has demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is when I researched an upcoming procedure for my husband and got information about it and gave him suggestions as to things to bring up with his doctor.
1	One of my coworkers sees the same doctor as I do.  She was telling me about a recent visit and had a question about some of her blood work.  I was able to answer her questions because I had experience in similar blood work.
1	I helped to take care of my diabetic brother when he was little. I had to use nutritiol labels to determine how many carbs he had eaten and then figure out how many units of insulin he needed to take. 
-1	When I was in health class and gave a presentation on joints and arthritis.
1	The best example that I can think of was when my young daughter started having bed-wetting issues long after she had learned to go to the bathroom herself. The doctor did some tests and ruled out a UTI, which I was familiar with, then wanted to rule out constipation. She did this by doing some x-rays on my daughter. Sure enough, she just hadn't been drinking enough water and was really constipated, which was putting pressure on her bladder. This whole thing was pretty easily understandable, and was explained well by our pediatrician.
-1	Never
1	It was a time in summer, when one of my friend started feeling dizziness while playing in sun. We helped him to get him under the shadow and had him drank some water and after that he was felling better.
1	I think you have to have somewhat of an understand of medicine otherwise you can't trust if your doctor is right or wrong 
1	There was a time I had an ear infection but since it was my first in my life, I didn't exactly know how to explain what I was suffering from to the doctor, this made my diagnosis hard because I didn't really know what was going on but my glands in the neck region were swollen, so my doctor tried treating different stuff till I actually found out on my own with the help of the internet that I had an ear infection, then went back and told my doctor for proper medication.
1	Once when visiting a doctor I was asked if I understood everything and explained everything correctly to my doctor.
1	When my mother was diagnosed with stage 3 endometrial cancer I knew there wasn't a study or trial for her to participate in because I was transcribing for an oncologist at the time. 
1	My significant other had serve pain in his back for sometime and they gave him an MRI. We received a copy of the CD and looked at the imagery at home. I was able to tell him what was wrong with his spine prior to receiving the phone call from the doctor. At the appointment I discussed with the doctor the options for treatment and percentage wise how rare the condition was. Already knowing about some issues and being able to research and learn about the possibilities of treatment, it was easier to understand what the doctor thought was the best option and for us to make an informed one confidently and in a short period of time.
1	I have chronic shoulder pain that has been worsening for 25 years.  I know nothing can be done except pain pills.  I do not take them because I know I might become addicted.
1	An experience was when I was having high blood pressure. I am at a normal weight and exercise regularly. I went to the doctor and he wanted to put me on some pills which I read had bad side effects. I went home and read about it and found that l-arginine lowers your blood pressure and since it's an amino acid there's no side effect. I started taking it and my blood pressure got lowered and I didn't need to take the pills that were prescribed.
-1	When i had a stomach bug. I knew that steps i had to take in terms of what kind of food i should eat and which ones to avoid.
-1	I have moderate experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues. I am somewhat confident.
1	I went to the doctor for a cut on my hand, I needed stitches but the blood wouldn't stop. The doctor didn't know why and was about to give me medicine to make my blood clot. But I told him that I had taken aspirin. I knew that aspirin thins my blood and makes it harder to clot. So I told him and it saved me from having to take medication I didn't need. 
1	I had a colonoscopy at 32, that showed and removed several polyps, two pre-cancerous. I was told to have a repeat colonoscopy every 3 years, even though my 2nd generation family has a genetic defect that causes a greater, aggressive risk, and the fact that I was only 32. I researched the subject and decided to have one every year. Good thing, because for the next eight years, they always found some. Now I have one every three, if they don't find anything.
1	"I found a mole on my back that met some, but not all aspects of looking suspicious. When I brought it up to my PC doc,  but he wasn't really convinced.  I had to insist on a derm referral,  because I was fairly certain based on my research that the markers it did have meant it was bad. I did get the referral and the derm took one look at it and said,  yep that's coning of today. Though it eventually turned out to be ""really weird"" but not cancer,  i still felt I made the right call by insisting. "
1	I had a class in college that medical questions such as these on this survey. I did pretty well in that class. I was able to finish with a 87 in the class.
1	I took my mother to a health clinic to have them look at a problem she was having with her foot. there was a sign on the wall telling people they should report when they have been outside the country. I asked the doctor why weren't they interested when and if people traveled to Florida and may have been bitten by a mosquito. she agreed that that would be a good idea, but I doubt they printed up new posters or asked anyone then or now
1	My husband was having pain in stomach and he was useous, and he was bloated. I thought it was an ulcer but the first doctor he went to could not find anything. My husband wanted to just take aspirin, and wait until the pain went away. I was adamant that he not take aspirin because it would do more damage. And that he go to another doctor. He went to my doctor, and she found the ulcer. 
1	I was able to successfully perform the Heimlich maneuver for a gentleman that needed my help.  I was able to successfully pass CPR courses which demonstrates knowledge of medical issues.
-1	I have administered first aid and CPR to several individuals 
1	I found my mother passed out on the toilet.  I knew there was something about pressure on the vagus nerve that could make you pass out.  I remembered she needs to get blood to her head so I put her head down.  She came to a little and we were able to get her to lay on the bed.  Then she became totally awake and  responsive.  We still went to the emergency room, but she was fine.
1	I had gone to the doctor for a checkup and was told that my cholesterol was borderline high and that we needed to keep an eye on it, and that I might have to take medication. I laughed and said that I was not going to take cholesterol lowering meds, and that I could make it go down just by changing my diet. the Dr. gave the usual spiel about genetics and how that was not always possible and I went on my way. A couple of months, at most, later, after eating mainly vegan, I went back and it had gone down 20-some points. I know a lot about the things that contribute to chronic conditions, and what to do to help the body heal.  
1	As a medical professiol, my everyday experiences are  a constant testament of my medical expertise and knowledge given my involvement in patient care. 
-1	when i noticed symptoms in one of my friends and told him to see a doctor 
1	My brother has type I diabetes. He recently came to visit and in the morning he was unresponsive. I knew that his blood sugar must be low because he was incoherent and combative. I called 911 and when the paramedics arrived I explained what had happened and they were able to quickly check his blood sugar and give him a glucose drip to bring it back up. 
1	My experience is based on news stories, persol experiences, family experiences, now outdated first aid courses, and college biology. I have used my knowledge to determine when I or a family members need to go to a doctor or emergency room and to reassure and explain  information to my niece and nephew. 
-1	I have 4 children and all of them have issues with breathing. I gain more knowledge as each child disease progresses.
-1	I had a doctor present to me various things about my check up. I understood what my blood pressure was and things like that. Just had a good common awareness of the information.
1	Being pregnt and giving birth to my children gave me good experiences with medical fields and medical documentation. 
1	"I'm not really terribly interested in ""wet"" sciences. Because, frankly, ""Eww."" I understand what I read and I don't leave the health of my children to chance, but I don't go out of my way to seek out new medical knowledge."
1	I was in a long term relationship with someone with Type 1 diabetes, so I learned a lot about insulin resistance, carbohydrates, and the glycemic index. 
1	I would get strep throat regularly in the past. I don't exhibit the common symptoms associated with it, but I knew I had it. I made the doctor take a culture. It confirmed strep. The next time I had it, I opted to NOT take antibiotics, stay home for 3 days with lots of hydrations and Advil to keep my fever down. My hopes were to get over it and build a tolerance to it. It worked and I have not had strep throat in the decade since. Most recently, after breaking out with a skin rash of sorts, I figured out it was dyshidrotic eczema and went to the doctor. Without me telling her what I thought it was, she diagnosed it the same. This has also happened with a less common diagnosis of Bells Palsy and other issues.
1	I was told that a hysterectomy was necessary for fibroids.  I knew this was not accurate information.  Based on my own research and listening to doctors who specialized in this area.
1	I was a Medicare Specialist customer service rep for an insurance company.  I was frequently in contact with Doctor's offices and hospitals to help a patient seek clarification on diagnosis, coverages, prior authorizations, appeals, etc.

-1	When my father had a stroke
-1	I once worked in a retail pharmacy. I was able to learn plenty about medicines and medical conditions. I also knew information prior to that by reading books.
1	"After my third in-vitro cycle resulting in no viable follicles via aspiration, I knew something was very wrong.  I knew I would need help getting pregnt, but to have ZERO follicles aspirated after seeing 18 on the ultrasound was very unusual.  I saw many specialists about the problem and their best answer was ""You're a medical anomoly"".  I did research myself, and thought that maybe I had what's called Luteinized Unruptured Follicle Syndrome.  When I brought that information to the ""specialists"" they agreed that must be my issue."
1	I once had an experience of helping someone who sustained a leg injury.  I was able to provide a support mechanism for the leg until the ambulance came.
1	I have learned about different things from the internet. That way I know whether something will pass quickly or if I should go to the doctors. Thus, I haven't had to go to the doctors in years.
-1	After having a child I gained over fifty pounds, because of this weight and family history of diabetes I knew that it was important for my mental and physical health to eat healthy and exercise.
1	A dentist was wanting to do serial extractions on my son.  I was worried about the wrong teeth getting pulled.  I got online and printed out diagrams of teeth labeled with numbers and letters, then I double and triple checked with the hygienist to make sure everything would get done right.

I knew from dealing with different things while taking care of her that something had changed in the time I had talked to her until I got to hospital. I talked to the nurse who told me she had had her morning medicine. I ask to see her chart of exactly what she had been given. The nurse wasn't happy about that but I assured her I wasn't trying to cause trouble I just wanted to find out what was wrong with my mother. After looking at her chart I realized she had been given too much of one of her medicines. There was an error by doctor or hospital in what she actually took. I immediately called pharmacy spoke to pharmacist, explained what had happen and had him look up what to expect. It wasn't an amount that would cause any damage, just make her feel bad for awhile. I had to take control as all the nurse seemed concerned about was who's fault it was. I explained to her...mistakes happen..we're human but when you make one or one is made you try to correct it asap.
1	"I had surgery on my abdomen which left a scar from my waist to mid-chest. I developed a hernia soon after. Someone asked me what happened since they could see me ""stomach"" sticking out so far. I was able to explain that surgery weakened muscle and other tissue resulting in a hernia. "

1	I took a C class a few years ago when I was exploring different things, and I thought it might come in handy to know this stuff anyway. I already knew most of the things on the tests, but it was good practice to know how to take BP and the other measurements. Other than that, I can only say I usually do research on a condition that a close relative might have, so I can send them the info if they're interested. But it's frustrating to not have access to some of the medical research materials online.
1	My dad sprained his ankle one night, he wanted to start applying heat pad on it immediately, I told him not to. For the first 48 or better 72 hours of sprain, you better apply ice pack first to reduce swelling and tissue bleeding, then use the heat after 72 hours.

1	A few years ago, a nurse practitioner prescribed buspirone for my anxiety. I reminded him that psychiatric drugs in general tend to affect me much more strongly than they do most people, and suggested that I should start at the lowest dose possible. He wrote the prescription for the second lowest dose available. When I got home with the medication, I broke the tablets into quarters for the first week, then into halves for the next week. I didn't have any adverse effects, but did not really see any positive effects either, so on the third week, I took whole tablets as prescribed. I got very useated, extremely dizzy, and found it nearly impossible to stay awake. I continued at the recommended dose, thinking that maybe these were side effects that would wear off with time, but they persisted. I tried to reach the nurse practitioner, but he was on vacation and I didn't feel comfortable discussing it with anyone else in the office, so I went online and looked up information about the medication. I learned that what I was experiencing were symptoms of a severe overdose of the medication. Going to an emergency room was recommended, but I felt certain that no one would listen to me if I tried to explain my drug sensitivity and that they'd probably think I took some illegal drug. I'm aware that some psychiatric drugs recommend tapering off rather than stopping abruptly, so I looked for this information online and found that while it's not recommended to stop abruptly, in some situations it may be necessary. I decided that this was one of those situations, so I stopped taking the medication. The symptoms decreased appreciably within several hours, and though there was some lingering dizziness, everything else was more or less back to normal within a few days.

When some students doting blood would feel light-headed or dizzy, I knew to have them lie flat on their back with their knees bent to return blood flow to their head.

1	Cannot recall
1	I was at the scene of a car accident. The occupants in the car were not in any further immediate danger.

-1	When I went to the ER for some back spasms, they wanted to give me 10ml of morphine. I'd never had it, but I knew that I was easily susceptible to medications and their effects, so I told them to please start at 2, and we could work our way up. By the time we hit 4, I was pain free, but I was also barely able to walk on my own. I'm scared to know what it would have been like if they have given me 10. 
1	I was supposed to play golf one morning, but when I woke up I discovered that my back was bothering me. I tried loosening it up with some light stretching exercises, but that didn't help.

1	I noticed a place on my husband's face that was diagnosed as a sun spot by 2 internists and a dermatologist. It was very small and was not growing on the surface. I had my husband go to a new dermatologist, who also thought it was nothing, and have it removed. It was cancer! Took 2 cuttings to remove all cells and many trips to a reconstruction plastic surgeon to fix his face. We are now down to two trips a year for skin checks and have been clear for almost 5 years. I do not know why I felt so strongly about this spot, but I had my husband insist it be taken off even if it turned out to be nothing. Melanoma is nothing to fool around with. 
1	A friend of mine had a health concern regarding her surprising hair loss. I gave her advice and medical knowledge I'd researched myself regarding the topic.

1	I was having mouth ulcers, interrupted sleep, hot flashes and irregular periods about a year ago. I immediately knew it was a hormone imbalance and the start of perimenopause.  I knew that I needed to go to the physician and get a hormone replacement therapy if I was going to start feeling more normal.  I went to a gynecologist since they are more equipped in handling this type of problem.  I know that for heart and bone health it is important that I take some kind of hormone replacement because Osteoporosis does run in my family.  I also knew I needed a supplement with not only estrogen but progesterone.  So I was sure to notice the physician gave me the right prescription.  And to save money I also knew that I could cut the pill in half since the best therapy is the lowest dose that relieves symptoms.  I cut the pills in half and they seem to be working fine and have relieved the menopausal symptoms.

1	I think the most memorable experience I can think of is when I started experiencing acute pain in my general groin area & started frantically googling the symptoms, prior to going to an emergency room, which were actually very hard to narrow down.

During college, I had read about stomach ulcers. I had not looked up the symptoms yet because I always do that and I didn't want to get myself worked up. After dealing with it for awhile, I figured I had a stomach ulcer and I should probably look up how to go about treating it. Sure enough, when I looked it up, the symptoms matched 100% My grandmother was going to the doctor for her colon, and he was super friendly and I asked him about the possibility of me ACTUALLY having an ulcer. He asked me questions, asked me to show him where it was hurting--all for free. He said for me to keep doing what I was doing which was taking OTC Prilosec. He said the fact that I started that on my own was a big help in healing the ulcer. So, my knowledge from college led me to accurately start taking the right medicine without going to the doctor.
1	Well, I was talking with a pharmacist the other day and noted that modern psychiatry was weaker than other fields of medicine because the brain is so much more complicated than other organs. The pharmacist then went into a 10 minute long tirade about how much he agreed with me.

1	Someone gave an account of feeling that they were being held down by someone when they woke up. It felt like an evil presence like they were being attacked by an evil entity.

1	I got sick with pneumonia once, and was given lots of things to read about how I could have contracted it. I was able to read and understand them all, and throw them all out because none of them fit.
-1	I feel like I have a good feeling over my body. When I get sick my wife always pushes me to go seek medical help. At this point I'm able to tell here exactly how I feel and if I should seek medical attention or not. I think it's important to know your body 
1	I experienced swollen tonsils with white pus, went to the doctor and asked for a strep test because of my familiarity with the illness and likely exposure. She agreed, I tested positive, and she prescribed 10 days of antibiotics. I took the pill 2x/day as prescribed until I was out of medicine.
1	My husband wasn't feeling well, and his medboard (military sick call) told him to just go home and sleep. However, I knew with his symptoms, (fever, sore throat, white spots on throat and tonsils), that he most likely had strep throat and needed antibiotics. He went back to see another doctor, and they diagnosed him with the strep.
-1	I've had a few surgeries and  treatments in my life and have seen many doctors in different cities, and I have done a lot of research about my medical issues that helped me a lot. I have also gone to school to be a certified CNA and have worked in the medical field for over 14 years. I'm no expert my any means , but I do know certain things.
1	I have many times pulled muscles that I've self-treated using RICE. I have also self-diagnosed colds vs allergies. I've also modified my diet to improve my slightly high cholesterol. 
1	As a med tech i received my diabetes speciality which enabled me to administer the stick test for diabetes and administer insulin using a sliding scale.
-1	We took a health subject at school, and did a very good research task on health issues. It was very successful.
1	I started having weird chronic adult acne in my mid 20s.  I figured something was wrong because no one in my family have this issue, and acne in general is not normal for someone in their 20s.  I went to my primary care physician who referred me to a specialist.  The specialist told me everything is normal, and prescribed a strong acne cream which damaged my skin, but also helped with the acne.  The specialist ignored all my concerns of me having abnormal adult acne to begin with, saying she only dealt with the skin - possible bad digestion or hormonal issues, all of which may cause acne, are not her business.  I spend the next few years dealing with the acne and being told by my PCP that maybe it's just normal for me.  I got sick and fed up with this, went to a holistic hippie doctor, who said I had issues with digestion, and prescribed a change of diet and probiotics.  With the hippie doctor's help and a change in my eating habits/supplements, I no longer have acne.
1	There has been instances of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, thyroid issues, and hormonal imbalances in my family. I have been around it all my life. It would be difficult to keep up at a family dinner without being able to understand or even speak up for yourself.
1	I have severe acid reflux.  I have taken several medicine to no avail and now I am asking for certain test to see if there is an underlying issue.  
1	A couple of years ago, I stepped off the front porch of my new home and into a hole that was covered in leaves.  It was instant blinding pain for a few seconds, then I crawled into my house.  My ankle was huge and I couldn't put any pressure on it.  Everyone insisted that I go to the ER, but I looked up how to test fractured/broken vs. sprained ankles.  Canada actually had a great write up on it, apparently ER visits due to sprained ankles seriously hurt their socialized medicine policy due to costs.  I did their tests, and correctly diagnosed my sprained ankle then treated it accordingly.
-1	When I was younger and my mom was sick. I did a lot of reading and research because I wanted to make sure my mom was going to be ok. I took care of my mom knew what medicine she needed. I knew when she needed it and when she had to go to the hospital I knew what to tell the doctors and nurses.
1	i went the doctor once because i was having some problems. i had googled my symptoms and done some research to see what might be going on. the doctor diagnosed me with the same thing that i had suspected i had, so i felt like i had done a good job looking into it myself
1	I can't say that I've had a significant experience that would demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues. I have a general knowledge and attempt to get some regular exercise, but always ask relevant professionals because it's better to understand what I don't know than to not know and think I know.
1	A few years ago, I found out my dad had diabetes. Now we know more about it and my sister and I are more careful with our health so that we don't get it in the future.
1	I had a c section and a few weeks later after a long car ride my right leg was in a great deal of pain. It turned purple and swelled up. I went to the ER and said I had a blood clot and I was right.
-1	When my son was chocking I had to give him the hem lick maneuver.It was the scariest thing ever. Thankfully, it worked and the piece of hot dog dislodged from his throat. 
1	I don't have any extensive training or education on health or medical issue. My experience is very limited to just what I learn on the internet and from my doctor. Basic diagnosis of a typical cold, fever, flu are very simple to figure out. Any abnormal pain in the body will require a doctor visit. If it's just something I am not familiar with, a visit to the doctor will usually answer the question.
1	I had to take care of my mom when she had meningitis and was able to navigate the different specialists and tests she needed
1	My wife is a nurse so I often consult her if I feel like I'm in need of medical attention. I have seasonal allergies so it's not uncommon to have sore throats, runny noses, and coughing at various times of the year. Occasionally, those symptoms are very severe. In the fall, I have a severe cough that was not going away and she thought that it was just allergies. I couldn't take it anymore and felt that it was probably worse and went to the doctors - it was bronchitis.
1	When my mother in law had a heart attack, one of the first things I did was make sure she had taken some aspirin. I know that, because it's a blood thinner, aspirin can help with heart attacks and improve people's chances.
1	I had a swollen lymph node a while back that was not tender to the touch, and I had no other disease like symptoms.  the doctor thought it was best to remove the lymph node and biopsy it for lymphoma.  the results were negative.
1	I had some issues with anxiety attacks after eating. I realized that these were happening when I would eat a lot of carbs. It led me to learn about hypoglycemia and the effects of low blood sugar on the adrenal system
1	During my last visit to the PCP's office, I was asked to fill out a new form of medical history. I found that most of the terms showing on the form seemed to be familiar. I did not have any troubles to complete the form. This was very different from the first time when I was asked to do such a thing.
-1	Before I thought about having my last surgery I read online and in medical journals about the pro and cons of the procedure before having it done. I wanted to know the facts for myself before making that decision.
1	I have a wife with severe COPD and a heart condition that developed while she was in the hospital for her breathing.  I spent many hours talking with the nurses and the doctors as well as on line researching her conditon.  I was able to visit with her for 12 hours a more a day while she was in the hospital and monitor the care she was given.  A few times my research paid off such as the time they wanted to clean her room and I had to ask them to not use areosal due to her COPD and the fact that the areosol triggered it.
1	I saw the history of weight gain within my family, and also saw that I was starting to gain weight. I decided that while I had not gained a significant amount of weight yet, and while my schedule best allowed for it in the stage of life that I was in (i.e., I had a lot of free time), I wanted to take matters into my own hands and gain control of my weight before it became harder to do so. I exercised and took better care in terms of watching what I ate, and was able to gain control over my weight.
1	My mother was very sick most of my childhood, so I picked information here and there from her pamphlets and also her doctors. Also, in college I was in a Physician Assistant program where I started to learn a lot about health and medical issues. To get into that program, I had to shadow a doctor or PA for 500 hours, so I also absorbed a lot of information from there. 
-1	Whenever I think about experiences in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health and medical issues, I think about my grandpa having a heart attack. I remember sitting in the living room of my grandparents house with my grandpa and grandma and then all of a sudden my grandpa started rubbing his chest and saying that he had a tight pain and I continued asking him questions and trying to figure out exactly what it was that was wrong with him and if he needed to be taken to the hospital and eventually, I told him that we needed to go because he was having a heart attack and it turned out that he had.
1	In my early 30s I got serious about taking care of myself. I started going to the gym consistently. I started building muscle, my cardiovascular fitness improved, I could do more activities without getting tired and stopped having dizzy spells. I started reading diet-related articles, reading nutritional labels and cutting out saturated fat and excessive sugar, and increasing protein intake. I replaced fat with muscle and my energy increased.
1	My husband and I are currently trying to get pregnant. We tried a new method called invocell. During the process, 12 eggs were able to be retrieved and inseminated. At my age, 80-90% of those should have become embryos. Unfortunately, only one did and it did not implant. This means that something is wrong with my body that caused so little of those to become embryos.
1	One night about three months after I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, I took 20 units of Humalog (short acting insulin) instead of 20 units of Lantus (long acting insulin) before bedtime. My boyfriend got upset and called 911. I ended up in the hospital for three hours having my blood sugar tested every half an hour, and paid $700 for the privilege. The next time I took the wrong kind of insulin at night, I did the math, made the appropriate amount of toast, slathered it with honey, and didn't tell the boyfriend.
1	When my sister was very young she choked on a marble. I had my little brother start the Heimlich maneuver right away while I called 911.
-1	A time when my cousin was worried that he might have a serious health issue. I told him to calm down and to stop reading things online and to just go to the doctor.
-1	I have an auto-immune disease and I researched to learn what to do, eat and which medication would make me feel my best. I also spoke to others with the disease and got input from them as well. I also found a doctor who helped me understand my disease better. 
1	I was prescribed a steroid and told the doctor I would not take it as it can effect the pressure in the eye and increase the chances of getting glaucoma. I have glaucoma and knew that taking steroids was an issue. 
1	I try to stick to the healthy diet and exercise a couple of times a week to be healthy. So i don't really have a lot of experience of health issues.
1	When I delivered my third child, I went into the hospital knowing exactly what to expect. I was prepared to fill out all the paperwork given to me, had all my medications noted, and had a very seamless delivery since I had been through it twice before. I was even allowed to leave after one night instead of the usual 2-3 night stay since I knew what to do. 
1	Started eating diced garlic for a cold about 17 years ago and...I haven't had a cold, flu, sore throat or any similar illness since then. There are of lot of studies that back up the use of garlic as an anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal medicine. Dice 2 cloves finely, let it sit for 20 minutes, eat with some peanut butter or other fat. If you already have a cold repeat for 3 or 4 days. If you're not ill do it occasionally anyway to boost your immune system.
1	I was seriously injured when I was 24. I subsequently had to go through many tests and medical procedures which has given me much higher than average knowledge of doctors and medical procedures. I have an artificial disc in my back, arthritis in the facet joints, scarring on the nerves, and other problems that I still suffer with due to this injury and it has been over 16 years. 
1	I fell on my right hand one night and heard a pop. I knew I broke a bone in my hand - not just a sprain or minor injury - because my finger was unable to bend without pain and my knuckle was misplaced.
1	"I was on vacation with friends, and my friend's teenage daughter got sick with a high fever. We were in a third world country, and the resort's on staff ""doctor"" looked very young and unprofessional (she was wearing jeans). The doctor was going to give her a shot. I stopped her and knew enough to ask first exactly what was in the needle. Thankfully I asked, because the doctor actually could not answer the question! She said it was ""something like aspirin"". I advised my friend not to allow the shot to be given. Instead, we brought her daughter back to our room and gave her Tylenol and gatorade, which we purchased from the gift shop. Her daughter was fine by the next day."
1	One time I demonstrated knowledge of health issues by helping care for my cousin who has diabetes. I researched and asked questions, and learned where her blood sugar levels should be and what she could eat and couldn't eat at certain times and helped her measure her blood sugar.
1	I am able to help my mother manage her blood sugar by testing it after a meal and ensuring that it is less than 180 mg/dl
1	When I started having pain in my elbow and forearm, I did some research and discovered it was possible I had cubital tunnel syndrome.  When I went to the doctor, they confirmed this diagnosis.
1	When I recently went to the doctor for mild depression, the doctor discussed several different treatment options with me.  I was already familiar with the different types of medications used to treat depression which helped me to make a decision with the help of my doctor.
-1	Taking care of my mother's medical issues. She had lung cancer and never smoked a day in her life. Six long years and over 125 chemo treatments. spent a lot of time in doctors offices.
-1	i am experienced in the knowledge of what you have presented me with to answer the questions that you are asking me. I have heard of these things or saw them in real life.
1	My friend was having trouble breathing and I've had experiences with a family member that had panic attacks. I told him that what he was experiencing was likely a panic attack and to calm down and breath.
-1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues happened when I discovered that I was allergic to barley. After consulting medical sources, I was able to communicate to food servers that I needed gluten free meals that did not come in contact with cross-contaminated foods containing wheat or rye.
-1	When I was pregnant with my daughter. I was given instruction to perform the test at home and needed to calculate my intake of sugar and carbohydrates. I was able to do it my self and I was able to understand everything
1	I had a nodule on my thyroid that I was concerned about. My daughter was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 15, so I already knew a lot about the disease. It helped me tremendously because I knew exactly what to expect, as well as general information about thyroid cancer, thyroid disorders, goiter, etc. I knew that the lump was not normal, and I also knew that I should have a biopsy just to make sure.
1	I recently had to tape off of some medication. First by taking half my dose for the first 7 days, then  1/4 of my dosage for the next 7 days. After the first 7 days I also started my new medication. I was able to tape off the old meds and begin the new meds exactly as prescribed. 
1	First, I have a degree in Psychology and i'm a certified Professional Educator in the state of Florida with certifications in Biology and General Science. Second, my family members and I have had complex health issues in the past. For me, my health concerns have increased in the past ten years as i've aged and i've had to have both corrective and emergency procedures performed on me.
1	I went and got a flu shot to lessen the chance of getting the flu, and also lessen the symptoms if I did get the flu. It's important for everyone to get vaccinated, especially to protect those who can't.
-1	My daughter has a hemagioma that was rupturing, I knew how to stop the bleeding as well as preventing rupturing again. I made sure I knew all about this red blood filled birthmark.
-1	When my dad was having stomach pains. I told him what medicines to take and what to drink to help calm the pain.
-1	My daughters both got super high fevers. Once the fevers went past 100.4 I started giving them fever reducers. If the fever lasted more that a couple days or they developed other symptoms I took them to the dr right away. My 18 month old got a Hugh fever with no other symptoms. I did research after the drs sent us home with no answers. I concluded she had a virus call roseolla and I was correct. 
1	A partner I had at the time was starting to show signs of an Addisonian crisis (she was diagnosed years before with Addison's disease), and was starting to become delirious. I injected her emergency medication into her thigh and we went to hospital. 
1	there Was a time that I caught a food borne illness and was throwing up every five minutes for 5 hours. I was so pale and so dehydrated that I knew I had to go to the hospital. I had my husband drive me to the hospital so they could give me nausea medication and rehydrate me. They said that if I hadnât shown up to the hospital there would have been dangerous being so dehydrated.
1	I used the best statistical anaylsis I could to determine the answers to the questions.  I really don't know how any medical knowledge would help in this scenario because these were all math problems.
1	My daugther had a recent bone tumor found in her fractured pinky. She was to have surgery by taking a bit of bone from her elbow to replace the weakened bone in her pinky which would also be filed down to remove the tumor part.
1	after a while of taking various medications, i did research on each one so that i could gain knowledge on whether or not i needed to keep taking each one, or whether i could lower the dosage. i used this knowledge to have an indepth conversation about the medications with my primary care physician on the next visit.
1	I've had 2 children delivered vaginally via induction and had stitches afterward. I take medication for depression and anxiety and hypothyroidism. One time I cut my leg open and had to get 15 staples to close it.
1	When my mother was taken to ER and eventually died, I was asked after unsuccessful surgery (stroke to the bowels) if I wanted life support and I was smart enough to know that you cant live without bowels and I said no.
-1	I was having sever pain in my esophagus and was unable to swallow food. The meds my PCP gave me caused an allergic reaction and I went to the ER.
1	Once when I was visiting my father he began to have numbness in his extremities and moderate chest pain. He believed it was just heartburn, but I convinced him to go to the doctor and he did in fact have a mild heart attack. From that point on I was instrumental in maintaining his cardiovascular health by helping him maintain a diet and exercise. He is now much more conscious of his health and willing to consult a medical professional about any questions he may have concerning his (or any immediate family/friends) overall wellbeing. So, by demonstrating applied knowledge concerning heart health I have effectively prolonged my father's life and very likely those of the people he spends his time with.
1	I know when i catch cold, what I need to take and what to do. I do not need to go to see a doctor while I had a fever.
1	When someone had heat stroke, I ran to them and figured out what was the cause. I didn't necessarily save their life but it definitely helped knowing what it was. 
-1	When I was 24 years old, I went to the doctor to get my yearly physical exam.  Up to that point, I had been having them for 6 years without any issues but this time, the doctor called me the following week to tell me that I had an irregular pap smear and that the pap had shown that I had precancerous cells.  Because I had taken anatomy for 3 years and I was pretty enlightened on how the different type of cells all line up in  woman's reproductive parts, I instantly knew that it was serious.  I did not complain or argue when he got me into a specialist for the following week.  The specialist advised that he had to do a LEEP which again, I was familiar with so I had some comfort only because I knew what the process entailed.
-1	I have very little knowledge of medical issues. I am parent of two kids so I have had to use the little knowledge i have to take temperatures, treat fevers, upset stomachs and other ailments. My knowledge of head aches, which i have often has helped me with my kids in knowing what type of head ache they might be having and what could be causing it, whether it be dehydration or sinuses.
1	I have hidradentitis and once on a weekend a nodule swelled up to the size of a soft ball. I had to  go to an urgent care and while they were not educated in my condition I was able to coach them on the normal course of treatment.
1	These examples shown in the survey were simply mathematical equations. Someone who has no experience with health and medical issues would be able to figure these out.
1	Not to long ago my mother in law was diagnosed with cancer.  She had to have surgery, and then some chemotherapy to make sure everything was good.  My own mother spent two and a half years doing chemotherapy.  She was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic bone cancer.  I was one of her primary care givers while she was going through the chemo, and her eventual passing.  I was able to talk with my mother in law about chemo and the possible side effects.
-1	I had pains in my chest in the heart area so I went to the clinic and they said it was because I was very overweight. I was actually 250 lbs-80 lbs overweight. I was very scared and asked them to check for blood clots around the heart. They put me on high blood pressure medication and told me to lose weight. The chest pains subsided but I still have a lot of weight to lose.
1	When I had an upper GI endoscopy and talked to the doctor about it after we went through all the biopsies he took and the pictures from inside my stomach I actually understood and he was impressed!
1	I am the father of six children, and have been in the military for 14 years. Constant training from the military as well as the plethora of issues that having that many children have has made me quite well versed in medical issues.
1	I taught health Education 101 at the collegiate level and have an MPH. I know the basics of health and regularly work with doctors and nurses in my current profession as an emergency response specialist
-1	A time I can think about that demonstrated my knowledge about a health issue is when I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. After I was diagnosed with high blood pressure, I went home to do some research on things needed to lower my blood pressure other than medication. At the time, a doctor I had did not tell me to make any lifestyle changes, instead just put me on medication which had me sleepy all of the time. A few months in, I was taking my medication and came to the doctor and got it checked and it was normal. The doctor asked if I was consistently taking my medication and I also explained that I was also making healthier lifestyle changes in which he was very surprised.
1	I once had to have my liver enzymes tested. I was told that it needed to be at a certain level before I could be sure that I did not have chronic Hepatitis. I was able to follow-up with the doctor and get my test results, read them myself to know that I did not need to schedule a follow-up visit.
1	A few years ago I got kicked in the kidney in a soccer game and it was bruised. I knew that rest and inactivity would help the situation, so that's what I did. The body is made to heal itself in most cases. 
1	I had been experiencing pain that some doctors told me was in my head. I had done research and was fairly certain it was a certain condition. I finally got a doctor to listen to me and they confirmed my thoughts.
1	I don't really have any experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge.   Maybe just trying to help my fiance lose weight and lower his cholesterol and blood pressure for his annual checkup. In six months I really helped him turn things around by changing his diet. 
1	I studied a lot of science while I was in college. I took a lot of corse and I'm familiar with many of the terminology.
1	My son was broken out in a terrible rash that ended up getting infected.  I told my wife that we needed to get him to a doctor immediately because I had had infections before and his skin looked like mine.
1	I was diagnosed with PCOS at age 18, so I know a lot about insulin resistance, hormonal issues, and blood sugar as I actively work to prevent myself from developing diabetes. I also worked as a receptionist at my endocrinologist's office for a year.
1	The other day at work my coworkers and I were discussing the flu because a lot of people thought they had contracted it. I had done some reading on the flu, knew symptoms, how long it should last, etc. but many of my coworkers did not. They claimed to have gotten the flu, when in reality they just contracted some sort of virus that had similar symptoms to the flu.
1	I can always google what I need but going into the doctors or having a checkup and having them tell me my numbers for blood pressure and heart rate I can tell that those numbers are good for me or not. I keep an eye on my blood pressure and have actively worked to improve it over the years.
1	the birth of my 3rd and 4th kids. from my previous experience and research i knew what was necessary and what was dr convienance
-1	I am a massage therapist.  Many times of the years clients have asked advice on nutrition, exercise, pain management and I have helped them work through their issues.  It is surprising how many people are not self-aware. 
-1	WHEN I FOUND OUT I HAD TWO CYST IN MY OVARIES, I FELT SCARED BUT WHEN I GOT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I NEEDED AND WAS VERY INFORMED I FELT GOOD ABOUT IT. 
1	When I found out that my daughter had asthma, I made sure to find out everything I could. That knowledge helped me when she was wheezing. 
1	When I was diagnosed with diabetes I was already fairly knowledgeable about how to manage symptoms because of literature and websites I had read previously. Knowing that diet and exercise were the key components to managing diabetes helped me stay relatively healthy.
1	Every quarter I teach a section on mental health. We cover underlying causes of psychological disorders, both biological and environmental, as well as symptoms and treatment.
1	I have correctly self-diagnosed certain conditions I have had or still have such as an hernia and blefaritis to name a few. I took a nutrition course at the University that completely open my eyes about healthy eating and has helped become the health conscious person  that  I am today. I believe that nutrition course should be mandatory starting at middle school at least.
1	I visited a doctor at my college campus a few years ago. She told me I needed to diet, and asked me what I was eating. I had come to a realization that I had been eating too much fast food. When the doctor told me about a diet plan, I asked questions, and she seemed of the opinion that I knew what I needed to do. I follow much of her advice, and began losing weight in the first week.
1	About one and a half years ago, I visited the emergency room due to pain in my lungs while breathing. The staff figured out that I had pulmonary embolisms and a blood clot in my heart. I was given a lot of information and I was able to understand most of it without too much struggle.
1	When I broke a bone in my foot my blood pressure readings were high.  Doctors and staff tried to put me on blood pressure medications.  I waited until after my injury was healed and until after I was able to start jogging again.  My blood pressure readings went down, and I successfully avoid the blood pressure medications.
-1	My grandpa had merca in his blood due to diabetic sores he had on hes feet. He was in the hospital for along time and even had to get some of his toes cut off due to this issue. 
-1	When I was in Junior High, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. This is when I really started doing research to better understand what she was going through. I now perform breast exams on myself a few times a month.
-1	My daughter had the flu to where she was hospitalized a month ago and the she got the flu shot and then a week ago she got the flu again.  So that really made think about what is really effective when it comes to prevention of things
-1	There was many times that i had certain symptoms and i would read in books or study online about the possible ailments. I usually figured out the specific illness myself even before the doctor could.
1	After each of three babies, it was important to bring them to their many well baby check-ups. After my middle child experienced some difficulty with weight gain (he was gaining weight but not at the amount expected), I was on alert for the same issue with my third child. Indeed, it happened to him too, even though he did not have the gastric reflux issue that my middle child had had. By being on alert for it, I knew to take it seriously when the doctor pointed out the weight issue, even before the doctor was seeing it as much of a problem. 
-1	Education and training. I've worked in a hospital, not directly with patients but we are thoroughly informed and trained on basic medical courses.
1	"A few years ago, I was experiencing extreme pain in my left testicle and found a lump on the back of it, which I know isn't an indicator of testicular cancer. I looked up problems with the epididymis and found, unsurprisingly, that there is a condition called epididymitis, and I knew right away that ""-itis"" means that something is inflamed, so I knew from the name that I was experiencing an inflammation of some kind. I went to the doctor who confirmed the diagnosis and gave me an antibiotic. After my first time taking the medication, I recognized that I was having an allergic reaction and took Benedryl to help slow it down until I could get ahold of a doctor, and I managed to get through the situation without needing to go to a hospital or back to the doctor's office."
1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was when my mother was complaining one night of having weird visual hallucinations of small bright lights. I took her blood pressure because she has a history of high blood pressure and it was about 170 systolic. I was concerned because her baseline systolic was around 130 on medication. Because of my knowledge, I was concerned that she may be at risk for stroke and her blood pressure was very high. I retook her blood pressure because if you get an abnormal reading, you should always recheck under the same circumstance. She had a headache also, so after rechecking her blood pressure was still around 170 systolic. I told her that we need to go to the ER because I was concerned about how high her BP is and her risk of stroke. She also smokes cigarettes, so her risk is increased. Her symptoms could have been dangerous and the abnormal visual hallucinations could have been aura for an oncoming migraine, but I didn't want to take any chances. I took her to the ER. She ended up being fine. 
1	One time I was discussing an abnormal looking mole on my friend's arm.  He was concerned it might be melanoma, and I told him about the ABCDEs of melanoma.  I told him he should definitely have it checked out because it exhibited some of these signs.
-1	The heart doctor's P.A. said that I seemed to know a lot about heart issues after I asked several questions related to a condition.
1	My son recently had a high fever so high that I decided to take him to the doctor. After answering the nurses and doctors questions, he was given a prescription for an antibiotic and ibuprofen. I had to remind the nurse that I had already given him a dose of ibuprofen, so he could not have more.
1	I have been on clonazepam for years (for insomnia). Due to a mix-up, the prescription lapsed. Due to the fact that I had been on the drug for so long, my body experienced withdrawal. It was strange that I needed to hold onto the wall of the shower to take a shower. Fortunately, I have not had a similar problem. Got to the doctor asap and got the prescription re-issued. End of withdrawal, which can be scary even if you know what is going on.

Through a thorough search I noticed all of the symptoms were lined up with what I assumed at first and waited it out a few days since it said that it could possibly burst on its own accord and there's not much to worry about aside from going to the emergency room of it actually does burst. So when it finally did on that day I was not only relieved that it wasn't any other sort but confident in my own initial observation.

I mean, I know myself and I knew it was bad. People at work thought I was just calling out for no reason until I brought the note from my doctor, who was going to put me into the hospital if the last of 4 antibiotics tried did not work. It finally took breathing treatment, CIPRO, and getting a swab up my nose before I finally started getting better.

Since learning this knowledge it has enabled me to have intelligent conversations with others as well as help myself be more knowledgeable about my health and the health of those around me

Neither am I particularly fond of sweets so I did some research and found that chloresterol reducing medicine that I have been taking some for about 6 years now has been linked to the onset of diabetes.

But the doctor said to go home, put him to bed, he'll be fine with the meds we gave you. He was in ICU for 4 days and then in the hospital 10 more days after I just brought him home.

1	I recently was diagnosed with a UTI. I knew from the symptoms, the constant urge to go, burning after urination  and full feeling that it was more than likely a UTI.

-1	When my sister was little she had a lot of issues.The doctor would diagnose her with inner ear issues (not infection) to behavioral issues, but I read about sensory processing disorder and thought it sounded like what she might have. I told my mom about it and she asked the doctor how to get her tested. The doctor said it was a made up condition to explain behavioral issues but my mom asked for another opinion. That pediatrician referred her for testing and she not only got a diagnosis of SPD but a few years later we found out she has autism. If I hadn't pushed my mom to have her tested it she might have missed out on early interventions and her sensory issues would be labeled behavioral.
-1	When I was diagnosed with IBS I had to learn how to change my diet first and foremost. I had to do some research because at the time I was told it wasn't a disease and could not be treated (ten years ago). I had to figure out what aggravated my condition and learn to cope with it.

-1	I mean, most of it is common sense. I'm no where near as knowledgeable as a doctor. For the last 10+ years, instead of spending a bunch of money to go see someone who is only worried about getting through the day, I will just look online. If something weird is going on with my body, I will look online and gather knowledge.

1	I honestly don't really think that I have any. Outside of regular checkups I haven't ever been to a hospital. I guess the closest thing would be that I have a daughter, and I've had to read and talk to doctors about her. However she's only been to hospital once for something other than I regular checkup so I don't know how much experience that really gives me either. Overall I think just my general ability to understand things is probably my best experience.

1	I have recently been experiencing very bad insomnia. I discussed possible factors with my doctor, and asked for bloodwork, which came back normal. I started charting my cycle, my alcohol consumption, my diet, and also considering my stress levels. After three months of tracking, I determined that alcohol was the main factor. I stopped drinking alcohol, and my insomnia has gone away.
-1	My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago and at that time I didnt know much about it. Over the years I have educated myself all about it ans In turn that has given me the knowledge to take preventive measures for myself. A few months ago my aunt was diagnosed as well. Science has come a long way since I first learned about it so that knowledge that I had from the experience with my mom helped me to be prepared for any questions that my aunt had during her process and I think the fact that my mom went through it too help me as well to get through it.
1	I think I learned some information when I started going to the gym regularly years ago. Terms like resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, pulse rate, etc. where in the fore when I took on the aerobic portion of my workout.
-1	When I was 35 I was feeling really bad all of the time.  I fell generally unwell, dizzy, headaches, thirsty all the time, unable to sleep well and just feeling blah.  I had a weird feeling I was diabetic so I started to do some reading about it for a few weeks and got as much information as possible.  I then made a doctor's appointment and told my doctor what symptoms I had and why I thought I had diabetes.  My doctor was impressed with my knowledge and scheduled a test.  A couple days later I found out I was indeed diabetic.
1	This is difficult to identify. I can only describe it definitively as the moment that I had children of my own to take care of. I care so much about them that I learn about things that I would otherwise ignore. I want them to be healthy; therefore, I learn as much as I can about health and medical issues. While not objectively logical, it is a function of love.
-1	I was prescribed a combination of 3 antibiotics. The doctor wanted me on it for 3 months. But after research and feeling sick I took myself off this combination. 
-1	Being in the military has given me a little bit more exposure to the medical and health issues. We practice a lot of medical procedures. Also going to Afghanistan has allowed me to work on casualities. 
1	Recently my elderly aunt fell in the snow and suffered frost bite on both hands. After spending three days in the hospital burn unit, she was discharged home with both hands bandaged. The next day I went to visit her and saw that her hands were in poor condition. She had removed the bandages and several of her fingers had open, weeping wounds. I thought a couple of them might be infected. She refused to return to the hospital. Later a visiting nurse came and confirmed possible infection. She also convinced my aunt to return to the hospital. Fortunately she was able to make a full recovery.
1	I knew the technical terms used by the doctor during my husband's cancer treatment.  I also knew the doctor was not keeping up with the latest science and he confirmed that to be true, given his schedule.
1	I worked in a rural hospital that served as the local area cancer treatment center on the weekends.  I would sit for hours and register patients for treatment the following day.  I would have to file lab and xray results into their charts.  This was before everything went paperless.  I spent a lot of time reading notes and diagnosis because I worked a lot of second and third shifts.  I was still in college and I tried to make the most of my time when I was a work.  
1	One time I was not feeling well and I was able to go online and look up my symptoms. The tentative diagnosis I gave myself matched what my doctor thought.
1	A few years ago I got in shape and lost a lot of weight. I had a chance to demonstrate my knowledge of health when I helped a friend to also loose a few pounds with healthy eating and exercise. 
-1	When I had an STD scare, I had to look for issues and symptoms in certain places. I had to research and use my common knowledge on the issue.
-1	I had hep c. I was told there wasn't much to be done by my PCP. I then heard on npr a new drug was now available called sovaldi. I found a new Dr who put me on a program got the drug approved, and after taking the 3 drug regimens cocktail I was cured.
1	One time, my nephew cut his hand and was very nervous.  I proceeded to not only stop the bleeding, but give him a lesson in basic first aid.  This involved methods for stopping bleeding, barriers to infection, and treatment of bruises or sprains.  He found this lesson interesting and informative and demonstrated these skills later on when injuring his ankle a few weeks later.
1	My pregnancy required that I ask my doctor lots of questions about symptoms that I was experiencing. I frequently went to each appointment with a list of questions about what was normal and what was not. My doctor was impressed that I had learned so much about pregnancy and pregnancy complications.
1	Woman problem. I had my period for 8 months straight before my doctor got me into a specialist (gyno). I was quite confident when I was able to go back to my doctor and repeat what my gyno had said and understood what I was talking about. hyperplasia is the overgrowth of uterine tissue, which was causing that issue, but I also had multiple cysts at different times on different ovaries, but not in my uterus.
1	I don't have any experiences that demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues. I have never faced a life experience that required me to know anything. I do know about basic health issues such as obesity or what it feels like to have high blood pressure but i've never been in a situation where i had to demonstrate it.
1	I was able to bring up some possible causes of what I may have been suffering from to my doctor. When they explained things I was able to easily understand and ask questions.
-1	I don't know , just accepting the fact that I have to go to a doctor and let them diagnose the problem seems good enough. The fact that I'm not someone who goes on the internet and tries to solve there own medical problems means I'm doing better than a lot of people.
-1	I have been Type 1 diabetic since I was 10 years old. This really helped when my nephew was diagnosed because most of my family is semi=aware of what to expect. My nephew still calls to ask questions sometimes and I am happy to help.
-1	I canât say that Iâve ever had knowledge of medical issues that Iâve been diagnosed with before being told about the issue and what it is. As far as health issues I know that itâs not good to smoke or drink a lot. I know that keeping active and eating right help aid in staying healthy things like that.
-1	I have a thyroid issue where my body doesn't produce calcium. Ive had this issue for about 15 years. I have to see the doctor regularly because it can cause seizures.
1	Having gained some basic medical knowledge over the years I have learned to listen toy body. Specifically in response to stress. I have multiple autoimmune diseases and have learned much needed stress management techniques.
1	An experience I has that demonstrated my knowledge of medical issues was when I cut my finger, and due to a rather large snowstorm, was unable to leave to possibly get it looked at. I went ahead and washed it out with hot water, and disinfected the cut on my finger. I also went ahead and elevated it slightly and applied pressure until most of the bleeding had stopped. I had somewhat skimmed the top layer of my skin off, so it looked a lot worse than it actually was, and in this situation I was able to control my thoughts and use basic first aid, rather than freaking out about the situation and causing myself to panic.
1	I was at a festival and a person was experiencing dizziness and nausea. I noticed that the person was wearing heavy clothing even though it was a hot day. I asked the person if they'd drank any water that day and they had not. I thought that the person may be dehydrated and overheated and told him he should slowly drink as much water as he could and to place a wet towel over his head and neck. 
1	I have been dealing with persistent colds and respiratory infections and recently, I looked up what I can do to get rid of them and have been taking steps in making sure that I no longer deal with them.  I have been eating healthy, exercising and sharing my tips with friends and family.
1	I am not good with math, so I need someone to thoroughly explain such stats to me rather than depending on my math skills. Most doctors I have had are willing to do that. 
1	I had an auto accident a little over two years ago. I was rear-ended, and although I had no scratches or bruises, I did hit my head hard on the headrest and the rear impact caused pain in my back within the hour. I knew to apply ice and knew to rest until I could be checked out by a physician, which somewhat controlled swelling. Plus I knew to seek treatment immediately for rehabilitation and to reduce any muscle damage/scarring.
1	My wife is a nurse and we have been married for nine years and she helps me understand all sorts of medical issues. Her along with Google makes things a lot easier to understand.
1	I had some heart related issues early on in life so I think I learned about cardio matters a lot earlier than most people which has helped me stay informed with health matters.
1	Working on a jobsite years ago a coworker cut his hand badly, so badly that he cut a vein and it was squirting blood along with his heartbeat. He was losing blood quickly. I knew to put a tourniquet on the arm to stop the bleeding so he could travel to the emergency room.
-1	I studied medical assistant program and it has given me some knowledge of various tests and procedures as well as health and medical issues. It has also helped working in this environment and from reading and office/hospital visits.
-1	I had a bad cut on my hand that probably could have benefited from having stitches. I took care of it on my own, however, from previous experience with bad cuts. Through proper bandaging, cleaning, and maintenance, I was able to heal the cut in about two weeks. 
1	When my wife had a baby I knew when to take her to the hospital due to the fact that we had had multiple children before hand.
-1	"My husband had severe pain in his left side after a pleurodesis procedure. He also had a fever, an elevated white blood cell count, and constipation. The doctor insisted it was just ""residual pain"" and the body's response to the procedure, while I kept arguing that it was more likely he had an infection of some kind. The doctor refused to do any blood work or send him for a CT scan to be sure, so we left that hospital AMA and went to another facility's emergency room. They found out my husband had a ruptured intestine, which required emergency surgery. He died 22 days later of sepsis from that rupture. Doctors don't always know everything and should learn to pay attention when their patients say something else is wrong."
1	I damaged my toe nail. Based on a previous experience I understood that the doctors would only help to rip off the damaged nail. I opted to do this myself to save time and money.
1	every week, when we have exams, my knowledge on medial issues is tested in more ways than i can explain. Boards, are the ultimate test of my knowledge i guess, and thats in 3 mnths. 
1	I have borderline cholesterol issues.  So I have done a lot of research on eating properly  to keep that from going up.  I actually had it go down into a very normal range.
1	In the past 1.5 years, I have lost 95 lbs. I had to pull from my knowledge of exercise and nutrition to achieve this. Additionally, I have had to understand how this affects my blood sugar, cholestrol, pulse, and heart rate. I have also had negative effects from my health goals in terms of exercise causing me injury and extreme pain. I have had to pull from my knowledge of how muscles, bones, and cells work to design plans that have gradual enough progress to prevent injury.
-1	An experience in my life when I demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is in being able to assist when people are having seizures. 
1	I honestly cant think of one where I have but Im always willing to go the doctor if something is wrong
1	my brother is a diabetic so once my friend was telling me he wasn't feeling well and he described  his symptom and   from my experience i could tell he had low blood sugar
1	I went in for a gastrointestinal issue and it was deemed that I needed a colonoscopy.  I was given a list of medications to consume in preparation as well as a process to follow for the surgery.  Without any assistance, I took the list and prepared myself for what turned out to be a successful procedure.
1	After tearing my ACL in 2012, I ended up re injuring it once again in 2013 and had to have two surgeries. By the second surgery I was already prepared with what I had to do for recovery and rehab. 
1	I had been vomiting every morning for 4 months. I saw 6 different types of doctors and none could give me a diagnosis or any relief. I did my own research and discovered Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome. I brought the empirical guidelines to my doctor and have had successful treatment since.
1	My family has a long history of diabetes, heart disease and breast cancer knowing this has helped me recognize sysmtoms, prevention and care for those disease also.
1	When I got hired to work security for a large corporation, they put us through a special version of the CPR training so that we can be informed and help if anything were to happen while we are on post. I had previously taken the CPR training because I spent some time working at a hospital briefly and they required it. I demonstrated my knowledge by completely acing all of the tests and the demonstrations they had me perform, and even helped out other people who were having difficulties performing the tasks.
1	I researched and implemented a medical protocol (long-term, low-dose antibiotic) to recover from the affliction of undifferentiated monoarticulating HLA-B27-related spondyloarthropathy, in which I eventually went into remission after 3 years (that was 20 years ago, so I'm calling it permanent remission), avoiding becoming a certain cripple with a compromised immune system, or dead, as my colleague's husband ended up, from T-cell lymphoma, having the same doctor as I but actually following his advice to take methotrexate.
1	I was a caregiver for my mother-in-law when she had cancer. So I would go with her to her appointments and I always took along a notebook and made sure to ask questions and write down the answers. It was really important that we understood and remembered everything that was said. I am not sure if this is the kind of answer you are looking for, but I believe that the communication between a doctor and patient is the crucial factor. My knowledge is that I know that I don't know, so I have to depend on my doctor's knowledge and expertise.
1	I understood helath issues when I got a UTI. My doctor fully explained everything that was going on with my health at the time. I told him I fully understood and took the extra steps neccessary to nclear up my issue. 
-1	My daughter had surgery on her aorta and the doctor was explaining the surgery and I was able to join in the conversation and knew what he was talking about.  I had knowledge about the situation.
1	One of my grandsons was pulling on his right ear one day.  He couldn't talk yet so I knew something was bothering him.  He had a slight fever and just wasn't himself.  I figured it was an ear infection.  We took him to the doctor and it was an ear infection.  
1	I am a Standardized Patient for medical students and have been for over 15 years. I have portrayed a multitude of cases including blood clot, sinusitis, pregnancy, appendicitis both during pregnancy and not, gallstones, pediatric meningitis, etc, so I have a fair amount of knowledge above the regular person not in the medical field.
1	I've always had problems with cramping during my periods, and have had a history of ovarian cysts.  I had multiple exploratory surgeries to remove the cysts.  The cysts came on a cycle of approximately every five years, I would have surgery every five years to have them removed.  Finally after quite a bit of research and discussion with my doctor it was decided to do a partial hysterectomy and remove my uterus to see if that would break the cycle.  this worked for ten years, at that time I started getting the cysts on my ovaries again, with the pain being 75% of the month.  it was decided that my ovaries needed to come out to prevent this from happening.  By my doctor being informed on what the best course of action was for me I was able to keep my ovaries for a longer period of time, therefore not having to take synthetic hormones until absolutely necessary. 
1	I worked at as a physical trainer and had to help monitor heart rates and health concerns while people were exercising.  I was also trained in CPR.
-1	Try to use common sense and math skills.  It will be better for use to understand the number to be more accurate.
1	As someone who grew up with family members in the medical field and being around people who often had to take medication, I feel that I've had enough early exposure that I'm not uncomfortable around medicine. I'm also in pre-nursing at the moment so some of the pre requisite classes I've taken as well as advanced reading I'm undertaking have given me some insight and knowledge into these kinds of things
1	I do not have any experience at all regarding health or medical. Everything I know if from experience or looking it up online or in a book. Or asking my mother.
1	My son when he was young began choking on a grape in a restaurant.  I was able to perform the Heimlich Maneuver on him successfully.
-1	I had to be proactive when talking to my son's doctors about a medical course of action for him due to his kidney issues.  
1	When my children ran high fevers, I would take them to the Dr.  When one child got the chicken pox, I knew what the symptoms were, and was able to tell when my second child got chicken pox because they exhibited the same symptoms.
1	It was several years ago when I was dealing with a snake bite that a friend of mine received while we were out on a hunting trip. Knowing that it was a rattlesnake that had bite him, I knew how to handle it, keep him calm, and do what I needed to do until we were able to to him to the Emergency room. 
1	I was recently in a car wreck last year and went to see the doctor because I had pain in my back and neck. I explained to the doctor that I had a previous back injury (bulging disc) from a sports injury and that I had pain in the same places but not as severe. After we did x-rays and and MRI he explained that there was no serious damage done to my vertebrae and I fully understood the situation because I had been through it before.
1	The only thing that I can really think of is a time when I developed pneumonia.  As I stated earlier in the survey, I never go to the doctor unless I'm sure something is wrong.  I felt myself over the course of a two week period becoming less energetic and more and more out of breath doing simple everyday things.  I continued to go to work during that time assuming that my body would defend itself and I would snap out of it.  When I coughed at work and expelled a mass of oddly colored phlegm, I new something wasn't right and went to the doctor that afternoon after work.  That's when I was diagnosed with a form of walking pneumonia.  I hope that's near to what you're looking for.
1	I have raised a family , with two children, who are now 34 and 36 years old.  I faced and dealt with the whole spectrum of childhood mishaps, common illnesses, and accidents, thank God successfully.  Mainly I got good at discerning when medical help was absolutely needed and when I could handle it myself with  ordinary first aid and care.
-1	My husband was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes close to a year ago. We both have become very educated on eating healthier and also managing insulin levels. 
1	My friend asked me about a test that he got at the doctor. I looked it over and actually had some knowledge about it. I explained what I knew about it to ease his mind, and told him to get more info from his doctor.
1	I was in a group session led by a psychologist. We were discussing antisocial behavior, and like most people mistakenly do, the people in the group thought that being antisocial meant that a person dislikes socializing. I began to explain that this is a misconcecption, and that antisocial behavior actually would include a lack of empathy for others, willingness to achieve one's own pleasure at the expense of others, and an ability to be incredibly skillful at manipulating people. One one the other members of the group tried to interrupt me, but the psychologist told them that they needed to listen to what I was saying.
1	Recently I had a tubal ligation.  I was talking with a friend who was slightly misinformed about the potential side effects of the procedure.  Since I had recently learned a lot about it, I helped to correct her.  She stated that in most cases, the blood vessel supplying the ovary would be cut along with the Fallopian tube.  I informed her that not only was this very rare, if it did happen to someone she knew, they could probably sue for malpractice.  My doctor personally assured me, and she has done so many procedures she lost count a long time ago, she had never seen it happen where the blood vessel was cut.  So I let my friend know about it, and she was pleasantly surprised.
1	I had cancer. I had to learn and adapt very quickly. While I went through treatment I had to trust my doctors that they were being open and honest with me about my cancer.
-1	I have always been a fast learner and exceptionally bright. For this reason I read most things I found lying around the house when I was a baby. I also try to keep track of health issues as they arrise for myself or family should the need arise to seek additional care.
-1	I would have to say that an experience that I demonstration my knowledge on health and medical issues would be when I gained 15 lbs in a year and decided that was way too much.  It was caused by a medication I was taking so I requested to get off that medication, started walking fast everyday and lost the weight. 
1	I started to develop a rash on my arm/wrist and visited a dermatologist to help determine the cause of the rash. In preparing for the visit, I listed out foods I had recently eaten as well any outdoor activities that may have had me come into contact with any plants or insects. In talking through the situation with the dermatologist, I mentioned that I had eaten a cherry pie very recently to which he noted that certain red dyes in such foods can cause random rashes. Since all other foods I had eaten were not out of the norm and my activities did not bring me into contact with any poisonous plants, we were able to determine that that pie consumption was the most likely root cause.
1	A friend asked me where she should go for prenatal checkups. I felt that my doctor was knowledgeable and caring so I sent my friend to that doctor. The friend was pleased with the doctor.
1	I have a thyroid disorder and through much research and dr visits I am able to tell exactly where my thyroid level should be for me to feel my best.
-1	I was overweight for a period in my life.  I did what I could to lose it by eating healthy and working out.  I got obsessed with staying fit.
1	Discussing high blood pressure and its relationship to weight made it clear to me why I should lose weight. I very well understood the stress that extra weight puts on the heart and blood vessels.
1	I have been to the doctor for a concussion and was aware of many of the possible issues caused by having a concussion prior to the doctor explaining them to me.  The concussion lead to a few complications that I was unaware of, but learned about them and have been able to deal with them because of the information I learned and received.
1	I have found bee propolis and elderberry to be very effective in treating the common cold. While on my job I have in many instances seen people who were sick quickly recover after I give them a couple of capsules of these. They are effective because they enhance and boost the immune system to fight the virus.
1	I used to be a medical transcriptionist. My grandmother had gotten home from a doctor's appointment and had not understood what exactly they were telling her. Upon hearing what the doctor told her, I was able to explain some terms to her that she didn't know what they meant before.
-1	An issue I had one time when I was around 16 and discovered a lump mass in my right breast and told my doctor. 
1	I was told by my doctor to get a shingles vaccine but since I had already thoroughly read the warnings on the prednisone pamphlet that the pharmacy gave me I knew that someone taking prednisone had to be off of it for  at least 6 months before taking any live vaccines.  Knowing this saved me from having a severe case of shingles.
-1	I ripped the tendon in my arm from the elbow to hand, when I went to the emergency room they wanted to xray the arm, I told them several times it was not a bone, however, the xrayed it and found nothing wrong, after going to my pcp and having an mri, he found the tendon was ripped. I worked as a pharmacy tech for many years, so when people come in with a fever, that you can alternate between tylenol and advil every 3 hours. I can usually help my friends when something is wrong by giving them advice about what to take, such as my friend had hurt her knee and was having trouble walking on it, so I told her to take ibuprofen and ice it, the next day she was able to walk and went to the dr.
1	My friend was getting lightheaded and dizzy.He was complaining of headaches often and he had a couple of fainting spells and had an irregular heartbeat. I knew the signs of high blood pressure and suggested they get checked out just in case. Sure enough high blood pressure was the diagnosis.

1	My finace was in a lot of pain and having trouble going to the bathroom. the pain was mild the first day but by the third day it was very bad and he was nasueted. His syptoms were simlar to an apendicitic from what i googled, but he had already had his appendix removed 20 years prior. i told him something is very wrong and we need to seek emergency care because what he ha sis not just a stomach ache. It turned out he had blockage from the cra tissue that was left form the apendicitis and the scar tissue and been slowing down is ability to pass waste over the years. the doctor said his condition could have killed him if i had waited longer to get him to the emergency room.
1	I've broken fingers and toes and splinted them myself, I've dressed wounds, I've given myself stitches. I'm former law enforcement and also a certified first responder and CPR card holder.
1	A few years ago I fell on the ice and broke a rib. I did not go to the doctor. I believe that a rib needs time to heal and that there was not much a doctor could have done for me.

1	I was ill with what I thought was the flu back in 2015.  I didnât see a dr and ended up having a collapsed lung.  Since then I have been treated for an immune deficiency.  I have been so frustrated with that diagnosis and treatment that I quit seeing my doctor and getting treatment,

1	When I became very tired all the time, muscles were very weak, it hurt to even sit for long periods of time and I had headaches frequently I suspected my B12 levels were low.  I asked the doctor to test that and it did turn out to be very very low.  Took a supplement for some time and recovered.

-1	In high school I was in an advanced placement biology and anatomy class, and they taught me so much about basic health sciences that I should know. 
-1	"Experience is the knowledge or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.[1] Terms in philosophy such as ""empirical knowledge"" or ""a posteriori knowledge"" are used to refer to knowledge based on experience. A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an expert. The concept of experience generally refers to know-how or procedural knowledge, rather than propositional knowledge: on-the-job training rather than book-learning."
-1	I started getting painful bumps along the left side of my forehead and over my eye. At first I didn't know why but by the second day I realized that this could possibly be shingles given that it was painful and only on one side of my face. I went to the doctor because it was so close to my eye and that concerned me and she confirmed that I was correct that I did have shingles. Everyone was worried that they would contact this from me but I knew that if they had previously had chicken pox they would not get this and if they didn't have chicken pox they wouldn't get shingles from me but would actually could get chicken pox from having contact with me. My dr. confirmed that this was correct.
1	I have always been interested in health and medicine. I believe healthy living starts with the nutrients (food) you put in your body. Exercise and a healthy lifestyle in general is important to health success.

1	Those were tough at the end. I really got most of my knowledge from my schooling. I was going to go as a pharmacist but ended up just going for biology and chemistry. I also have had some severe stays in the hospital upwards of a month from my brain injuries and I worked in a hospital for a year.
-1	I basically read and studied any material that I have come across on medical issues and diseases. It's crazy how you are more knowledgeable than some mainstream doctors. 
1	I go to the rheumatologist on a regular basis and she is always telling me the likelihood of worsening conditions in percentages.  I find it easy to understand this info fairly easy.   
1	After having gallbladder surgery, I was still having bowel issues.  I researched online and found what the problem was and what could be done to remedy.  I made and appointment with my doctor and described, and he prescribed the medicine and it took care of the problem.
1	My sister was extremely concerned about a lump she found in her leg.  She called me very upset and scared.  I told her that it is very likely just a cyst and not anything cancerous and to not google it.  She went to the doctor and found out it was just a cyst, as I had told her and she was fine.  I don't really have much experience with anything medically serious, so this was the only example I could think of.
1	In high school, I did my health presentation on atherosclerosis and that taught me a lot about causes of plaque build-up and how the body manages it through a mixture of LDL and HDL fats. It was a half hour presentation and I used visualizations on a computer to illustrate the process. That project also showed me how I could use better sources of information that were available to me, like Nature and Scientific American to get a detailed understanding of health processes.
1	Well, one time I was with my friend who was high and I noticed he started having what appeared to be symptoms of an anxiety or panic attack. I assured him that he would be okay, (he thought he was having a heart attack). 
1	I was having some issues with feeling sluggish and foggy and had to have a ton of tests done. I went through all of the information about the tests that my doctor had ordered so I would know what I was getting into
1	One morning I woke up and felt extremely lightheaded. It was a hot summer day and I had not been drinking much water that week. I nearly fainted when I went to go use the bathroom. I figured occurred  because of the extreme heat and because I had been so dehydrated during the week. I immediately got me a cold glass of water and put on lighter garments. I allowed myself to sit and rest and made sure I had drunk plenty of water throughout the day. I did not have any other episodes like this since.
1	When I went to a doctor last year about painful anal fissures and haemorrhoids, I was already pretty well informed about them. This was due in part to having researched them in the past, both in how they relate to poor diet and how they can be caused or exacerbated by anal sex. I already knew going in that these would take a long time to heal, so I didn't expect a quick recovery. Furthermore, I was able to ask better clarifying questions during my appointment due to my prior knowledge, which helped me understand what I needed to do as well as diagnose the cause more quickly.
1	I was a caretaker for both my mother and my father in the last years of their life while managing my own health issues.  I had to learn many skills while caring for both my mother and father like how to change, service a colostomy bag, measure diabetic sugar level, maintain.  Also had to care for my own bipolar 1, meetings, etc. Dad had dialysis as well. had to learn all of that.
1	I went a course on how to provide cpr to a paitient no I am ready for when ever anything happens to one of my family members in order to administer CPR. I know that it can revive someone having a heart attack, and my father has had a heart attack so just in case it happens again I can bring him back to life again. I also spend a lot of time with my grandmother so it will be very useful to know this knowledge beforehand just in case anything happens. I highly recommend everyone taking a CPR course and learning about what it can do for people in danger.
1	I have diabetes II. I met with a nutritionist who taught me how to eat right to keep my blood sugar levels good. I learned what to buy & eat. She was right. When I eat the right foods my blood sugar is great.
1	I was told that I am underweight for my height, as such that I needed to eat more. As such I had decided to exercise in regular intervals as well as I did not want to experience negative side effects associated with overeating. So with the help of online resources I formed a meal plan that fits within a recommended nutritional profile/caloric intake for my body size. As with the previous questions it involves some light mathematics and a bit of research, but it is very much worth it knowing that I am in as much control as I can get in the maintenance of my health.
1	when I was sick with a respiratory illness I mad fresh garlic tea and fresh chopped garlic releases allicin which is good medicine
1	Being diagnosed with a chronic disease has made me aware of issue pertaining to it. I know more about auto-immune diseases now, and am familiar with symptons and treatments of them. I know what others are going through.
-1	When I was younger I babysat for a friend of mine who neglected to tell me that her children just got over chickenpox.  Because of my age, she thought that I would have already been exposed to it.  At point, I had spent very little time around children and during my childhood, I was not often around a  lot of children because I grew up in the country.  On my way home from her house that night, I became very ill and knew right away that I needed medical care because my body did not react in the normal way this illness would have affected a child. 
1	I can't honestly think of any situation like this, I rarely go to the doctor or have any medical problems. I suppose just knowing that a pain in a certain spot on my back could be a kidney stone counts but I only know that because I've had one.
1	My wife had breast cancer.  At diagnosis, her radiologist discussed her ultrasound, and I asked for him to elaborate on the shape of the lesion, the smoothness of the edges, blood vessel involvement, etc.
-1	Everytime I go to the hospital I always demonstrate my knowledge or medical issues because my doctor always asks me and I have knowledge about it.
1	I have had two prostate surgeries. From speaking with my PCP, the surgeon, and my own research, I went into them knowing what to expect. There were no surprises. Although the first was successful, I was in the low percentage group that had recurrence and required additional surgery. That was successful and I have not been bothered since.
1	Most recently, our newborn was having mucous and traces of blood in her stool, and because of our prior experience with our first child, we knew right away this was an allergic reaction to dairy/soy protein in my wife's breast milk.  We cut dairy and soy out of her diet and she perked right up in a few days and her stools normalized.  
1	I had a friend/coworker who had a peculiar change in some patterns that I noticed. He was using the bathroom more often and constantly refilling his water bottle throughout the day. We are software engineers, and he also complained about issues he was having while typing on the keyboard, which he attributed to repetitive stress. I have family members who have had diabetes and suggested that he might want to see a doctor, as some of the issues mentioned above are symptoms. It turns out that I was correct and he is now receiving treatment for it.
-1	I just had an xray done on my back to see if my scoliosis has worsened, i now have a double curved. It's still not bad enough to do surgery but they recommend physical therapy or it may worsen over the next 5 years. Knowing the risks, I can't afford physical therapy sadly, but if it gets bad enough my insurance covers surgery.
-1	I used to teach mentally ill about their illnesses in a group setting.  I have a bachelors degree in psychology which helped in this.  However, I did a lot of research into the medical illnesses they had and also taught information about the physical illnesses as well to help them in all aspects of their lives.
-1	When my father was sick because of his heart and he was on warfarin i knew that he was not supposed to have anything with vitamin K in it because that makes it not work

1	Last year, I woke up and was barely able to open one of my eyes.  I was certain it was pink eye, but my roommate disagreed with me, saying it was allergies.  I wanted to go to the clinic, but he advised against it, as he thought it was just allergies.  I went anyways, and was ensured by the clinician that it was pink eye.  I was given medication to help get rid of the pink eye.  I think this demonstrates my knowledge of medical issues, because I was almost certain it was one thing, while a peer of mine thought it was something else.
1	I had a strong pressure in my lower chest region. It turned out to be just gas and I was able to self diagnose. i went to the doctor anyways and they confirmed.
1	I had to get a blood test done to see if I could be diabetic. I had some signs and to help ease my nerves I was checked and given a clear bill of health. It just turned out to be a coincidence but I based it off of my dad and my aunt both of whom are diabetic.
-1	Because my parents and grandparents had diabetes, when my husband was diagnosed a few years ago, I had a basic knowledge of what to look for and how to help.
1	When I wanted to lose weight I decided to start tracking calories and macro nutrients. Previously I had never really paid attention to food labels but to properly track my consumptions I had to purchase a food scale and weigh my food and keep a journal. I was shocked out much I was actually eating as you assume the serving size is much larger than what it actually is. Watching my intake I was easily able to lose 5 pounds with diet alone before changing my exercise to lose more.
1	I had melanoma at the age of 28. In my fifties, I noticed a spot on my leg that looked suspicious. I had the mole removed and it was in fact pre-cancerous. I knew what to look for because I had it before.
-1	I have a son who has asthma and food allergies. I have successfully managed his health issues and am slowly teaching him to do the same.
1	I had a miscarriage. the dr was right away going to have me get a procedure, but there was no need for it. I knew this from my research... that it could happen naturally. When I told him that is what I wanted to do he said that is better (He never should have suggested it in the first place and I left him after that)
1	I have learned a lot due to personal experiences with family members. My father had heart disease, and my mother, a brother, and my son have all had cancer at some point, which caused me to research and learn as much as I could about their respective conditions.
-1	I have asthma and my son has asthma. We were following the doctor's action plan but it wasn't working. I knew right away that he needed to go to the emergency room. He was admitted and they didn't start him on steroids. I told the doctor I knew he needed them.
1	When I was younger I  lost a lot of weight by researching the right foods and a good exercise routine, ( i have since put the weight back on). I looked up all the right foods to help with different things and was able to clear up my acne and lose a good deal of weight and well as increase my strength and stamina. I also help other member of my family get into better shape
1	As a teenager, I was correct in telling my mother to go the hospital based on her appearance. It turned out her blood pressure was dangerously high and she ended up being admitted.
1	I volunteered as an ambulance worker in a conflict zone several years ago. We had to deal with injuries from bombings in the immediate aftermath and pick up of the people to be transported back to the hospital. I have no medical training, but I learned how deal with traumatic wounds, bleeding, concussions, and how to triage effectively. I also learned how to administer painkillers and tie tourniquets properly.  
-1	Two years ago, I twisted my ankle, and it immediately started to swell. I could still bend my ankle, and walk on it, without much pain. I thought I had a sprain, and applied ice for a few days then warm heat. Within a two weeks the swelling went down and able to walk without much pain. 
-1	doctors are not always right. i was in a nursing home at 35 and told nothing could be done. through my parterns research i was treated off study and walk totally unassisted now. 
-1	My mother died of lung cancer. It was a learning thing for me. Having taken her to the clinic for therapy. I found the experience enlightening and a bit frightening. However, it something that would help me in the future if I need that sort of care.
1	Few years ago, one of my friends was seriously ill. He had to be admitted in the hospital. He was suffering from bone fracture. I had fractured my bones during my high school.

1	im not sure what to write here because i do not have a time in my life where i demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues.  
1	I had a mysterious allergic reaction that I went to the doctor for. I was having a very delayed reaction (5+ hours later) so I started keeping a food log everytime this happened. I went to the doctor with my food log so I could show her exactly what food it was. I had also researched why the reaction to this particular food happens and what to do about it and talked to her about that. I went in pretty much knowing what the problem was just looking for a solution. 
1	many members of my family have health issues that I had to learn about to help them keep on track. I have had to look a lot of information up also to make sure my kids are going to be alright when they are not feeling well. 
1	I worked as a health unit coordinator for 25 years up until 2014 when I retired. A main part of my job was to have an extensive knowledge of medical terminology. I have worked in various departments in a large city hospital ranging from telemetry, medical/surgical and maternity.

1	I had a stroke when I was 22 and I was able to understand why it happened to me and what things I needed to get checked out so it wouldnt happen again. I actually was a big advocate for myself because I had a stroke, followed by a concussion and a seizure but when I woke up 45 minutes later I had no residual symptoms. I had to convince the doctors and radiologists to look for proof that I had a stroke and I was able to find evidence of it so we could figure out more about why it happened.
-1	A time I demonstrated knowledge is when I became pregnant again, and because it was my second pregnancy I was more experienced. I knew of the issue and what steps to take for each trimester.
-1	My brother was once hit by a car when we were biking to school, and the driver got out of the car to help him. I ran to his side, and made sure to tell my brother not to move his head/neck, and told the driver not to move him as well. I knew in doing so, much more damage could be done. 
1	A friend of mine was suffering fro fatigue and a rash on her face I told her some of the signs of lupus and she asked her dr to test her and found out she hadl lupus.

1	I went with my dad to a doctorâs appointment because he has high cholesterol. The doctor told him that he needed to lower his cholesterol to a certain level. After we left the office my dad looked at the results of his blood work and believed that his number was within the range of what the doctor recommended. I showed him that he was looking at the recommended amount and not the results of his test. His actual cholesterol was way too high. He would not have known that if i did not get with him

-1	I used to take care of my grandmother. Her mind was starting to go and one day she started having really bad hallucinations and talking nonsense. At first, I thought maybe it was dementia, but then I remembered that strange behavior and hallucinations can often be a symptom of UTIs in the elderly. I called her doctor and was able to get antibiotics. 
1	Several early college classes tested us on human health and medical issues. I also studied psychology as my major, so if mental health counts, I graduated with a 3.5 GPA. I would say that my grade demonstrated an above average knowledge of health and medical issues. 
1	I was able to diagnose the issue when my cousins child was very sick. I was able to tell that she had early stages of typhoid fever and told my cousin to take her to the doctor as soon as possible because of the symptoms and the seriousness of the condition.

1	A few months ago, I was searching for a new dentist that could do everything I needed, from cleanings all the way to endodontics and surgeries. After selecting one after a few weeks of research, I went in and was able to discuss a plan for my dental care with them. We were all on the same page because I knew what I needed and what I wanted from them and they were upfront about what they could offer me and payment. I've been to them a few times since and they've been great, haven't disappeared me, so I'm glad I did my research and was knowledgeable about what I wanted
1	I have taken a few classes on basic health and medicine.  I have regularly gone to the doctor all my life and have done quite a bit of reading on health and healthy activities.  
1	After I went through puberty, I started getting migraines every day. Since then, I have seen more doctors then probably most people will see in their entire lives. Not a single one took my concerns seriously.
1	"This was many years ago but my mom kept getting these burning, itchy rashes accompanied by hot flashes in the middle of the night.  She went to an allergist that checked her for everything and told her it was allergies.  I was reading about vitamins one day and saw that high doses of niacin is used in cholesterol medicines and causes ""flushing"" as a side effect.  I asked her when she takes her cholesterol medicine and she said ""right before bed"" so I told her what I'd found out.  She had her doctor change her medicine and hasn't had an issue since."
1	I had a severe reaction to an antibiotic a few years go.  A few months after it happened, I filled out my paperwork at a specialist's office and marked that I was allergic to the drug.

-1	I was having very serious nausea for 3 weeks, I couldn't eat anything. Several people told me it was stress, or acid, but I knew it couldn't be that. I did lots of research and my symptoms were very similar to an under functioning gallbladder. I went to the hospital and had a test done, and it proved that my gallbladder wasn't functioning properly. I'm glad I went by my gut and not what others had assumed. 
-1	When my son was 17 he looked to pass out while playing cards with friends. But he was shaking with his eyes open. This to me was the sign of a seizure, so I made sure to put him on his side to keep his airway open so his tongue wouldnt block it and keep anything he could kick or hit away from him that could harm him till the seizure was over.
-1	I was taken to the hospital not too long ago because I was having abdominal pain. The pain was so bad that I had actually fainted. The doctor discussed all the different reasons that I might be experiencing the pain.
-1	My daughter was sick. She was coughing and sneezing and had a temperature of 102.4. Even though she had a cough and sneezing, she was behaving normally. I gave her medicine to reduce the temperature. Later on she started to act very tired. I called the doctor and they said that she was probably fine and wanted us to come in the next day. Then she started to vomit. I took her to the hospital because of her symptoms and she had a stomach viris. i felt that something was wrong with her and i did not want to wait until the next day.
1	When my dad started displaying symptoms of pneumonia, I immediately had him rushed to the hospital.  If I didn't know the signs, he would have gone into septic shock.  My knowledge of health issues likely saved his life.

1	I once treated myself for a sexually transmitted disease by ordering antibiotics I had looked up (by affect to body region). I found ciproflaxin for my bladder and urinary tract, and I found doxycycline for my STD health. After looking up how long a trial is of each, I was able to complete two weeks of dosing both. I then paid for a std test at my University Health Center and I tested negative twice, to which I was very happy. In my opinion you don't need a doctor, it's just 99% of people (including myself) will never share the same knowledge as one and medicine in it's concentrated forms can be very hard to dose and apply to select cases. I am glad doctors are around, as anything more complicated than the pills would be beyond me.
1	I had just had my third baby and was nursing him one night when I felt my left side go numb. I knew something was very wrong and the feeling lasted into the day. A few days later I could not walk and was slurring my speech so I went to the ER. I was positive I was having a stroke based on my symptoms but I passed the stroke test. After my MRI results came in they indeed saw that I had suffered from an ischemic stroke.

1	"I am a mom of 7 children, so I often have to make late night ""diagnoses"" using the internet as my source. Recently one of my children had a sore throat. I googled it and found images. I looked in her throat and determined that it was strep throat by the white spots on the back of her throat. The next day I took her to the doctor, and it was diagnosed as strep throat. "
1	All of my knowledge is done through the internet. With how the internet is today you can search anything and many accredicted doctors will have information on what these symptoms can mean. People can also post on forums who have had the same issues and they openly discuss them for the world to see and learn from.
1	I I had an abnormal cervical screening.  I was diagnosed with PCOS, inferitility, and IBS.  You just kind of pick up knowledge as you go.  The older I get the more I am diagnosed with.  You just pick up knowledge of your body as you go along.
1	well, I think this survey very much demonstrates my lack of health knowledge.  I can't figure the majority of these what % of people got false positives.  I just don't know.  I don't know that it really matters to me, the statistics of it all.
1	I tested positive for the hepatitis B antigen, so I was disqualified from giving blood. However, I know I did not contract hepatitis b, so I know it was a false positive, which can happen all the time with tests like that.

Before having kids, I never had any problem, but after my C section I developed pain that I could not control in my abdomen. After several tests I went in for surgery and ended up having a cyst.
-1	When my father developed blood clots in his legs - I was able to recognize the symptoms: pain, swelling, discoloration, warmth.  He thought he'd just pulled a muscle, but I convinced him to go to the ER.
1	When I had my baby he had to stay in the NICU for 2 days. At first, I didn't understand exactly why, as it could have been a few reasons. It could have been because he had pooped before he was born so there was poop when my water broke. It could have been because I tested positive for Strep B. And it could have been because I had a fever during labor. I later figured out it was because of my fever.
1	I suffer from chronic migraines. I often found a significant tension in my neck when these headaches would occur. I suggested to my PCP that I might benefit from seeing a massage therapist. He agreed and we found the massage therapy would help alleviate the headaches some. 
1	I suffer from RSD and it originally started in my left arm and hand after surgery to repair a broken wrist.  Within 4 months of developing RSD in my arm my left leg started to swell and turn red and blotchy which is a indication of RSD.  My leg was also cold to the touch and very painful when touched which is a definite sign of RSD.  When I saw my pain specialist and he looked he would not believe that it was RSD because he did not believe it traveled, however after finding a newer board certified doctor in pain management he did diagnose this as the RSD traveling and also said it was not in the stage known as CRPS.  I trust my instincts and what my body tells me even if doctors may not agree. 
1	A time when I felt I had medical knowledge was when my child was very young. Her doctor told me that she had nothing wrong with her. I suspected she had a milk allergy and acid reflux. I took her to a different doctor and they confirmed my diagnosis.
-1	I had to go in for surgery to have a ganglion cyst removed from my wrist,I had knowledge of this cyst type for many years because several family members have had this type of cyst.
1	I am a type one diabetic on an insulin pump and medication to lower my cholesterol. I go to my doctor once every three months for check ups  
1	I look up the side effects to my own medications to ensure that I am not having any symptoms that could result in me having serious complications in the future. A lot of major issues with medication start as minor ones.I saved my own life about a year ago knowing these signs. If I had waited any longer to go, or did not notice the symptoms, I would have died. 
-1	My leg was going numb and tingling. I looked at several websites for information, while waiting for an appointment. Turned out to be my sciatic nerve. It was remedied by keeping my wallet in my front pocket instead of sitting on it.

1	My doctor casually mentioned Kleinfelter's syndrome and was surprised that I knew what it was. I don't have Kleinfelter's syndrome, and I really can't remember why I read about it in the first place. We talked about it for a little bit and then moved on with the checkup. I have also printed out pertinent medical studies that I've found interesting on several occasions only to find that my doctor knew something about them already. Those moments were probably the times that fit this question the closest.
1	Several months ago, I woke up with a Soren throat.  My glands were swollen, and when I looked in my mouth, I could see the tell tale signs of strep throats in the back of my mouth.  When I went to the doctor, he confirmed what I already knew - strep.
1	I was a psychology major in college so when I was diagnosed with Depression I knew what was happening to me.  It still affected my judgment and made me reluctant to seek treatment but when I did I knew I had to trust my doctors because of what I learned.  I knew medicine and therapy would be helpful for many with my condition but it does not always work for everyone.  I was more prepared for it than some others may have been in my position.
-1	After my mom suffered a stroke, I spent an extensive period of time learning about the condition and how to reduce its reoccurrence as well as the measures necessary to take if someone around you suffers from the event again.
1	A time when I got a very serious cut and knew to tie a tourniquet to reduce excessive bleeding until I could get to the hospital.
1	I have always believed to have reactive hypoglycemia. Doctors always told me I have low blood sugar but not as bad. Yet I lived with the risks and symptoms all my life. Finally 3 months ago after having a bad symptom, I found a doctor willing to do all the tests possible (unfortunate for me financially). He finally confirmed I have reactive hypoglycemia. And a lot of other health concern no other doctor informed me about before.
1	Several years ago, I had what appeared to be a bull's eye rash on my abdomen. Having read about Lyme Disease in the past and having spent significant time in the woods in recent weeks, I reckoned that it was likely that I had a tick bite which should be investigated. I went to the doctor before any symptoms (other than the bite) of the illness manifested.
1	There is not many experience where I had to deal with knowledge of health or medical issues. At times I have to read nutrition labels, or sometimes in college classes I must execute hypothesis testing where the scenario is often a new drug attempting to fall below the 0.05 p-value threshold
1	I don't have any specific examples, any knowledge I have about issues are ones that I relied on the medical community for, I don't spend any time on these things because I don't want to think about the negatives.

1	Other than high school biology presentations, I have had to switch doctors and apply/appeal for disability and unemployment several times over the last 2 years. I successfully talked about my condition to Social Security and was awarded benefits. Also everytime I've switched doctors, I didn't have transferable records so I have to to recount details of my diagnosis. 
1	My mother had lung cancer and eventually was diagnosed with diabetes due to chemo and eat habits. My mother was not used to her new diagnosis so her sugar levels were up and down. From what I learned in school I was able to help her with trying to get it under control. 
1	I was concerned about some pain my child was experiencing. He was running a fever and generally irritable. He has recently had a cold and I suspected it might be an ear infection because of the constant fussiness. It turned out I was correct and he had a bad ear infection.
1	When two of my three children had breath holding spells as infants. I knew to hold them upright so they wouldn't faint and get hurt. I knew to then give them fluids and rest after.
-1	In basic training we had to know cpr and how to decontaminate contaminated people, animals, and objects. It was fun, but also serious. Not knowing the right steps could mean someone losing their life or a more serious outbreak of the contamination in question.
-1	I gave birth by c-section. So I know the procedures for that and the way in which things are done concerning that. 
1	I've had health issues in my life and my family has also had health issues. I've learned most of my knowledge through having different experiences while going through medical things myself or with another person.
1	A friend had pain in her calf and thought she had a blood clot in her leg. It wasn't red or swollen, didn't feel hot to the touch. I told her I didn't think it was a clot. She went to the doctor and it wasn't.
1	Any time I try to explain neurological disorders, every face goes blank. I try to break it down even further and make it more simplified, but it seems as though thinking on that scale of body processes is something most people I've come across just can't grasp. Most do not understand the ties between injury, fever, swelling, neuron misfires, cerebro-spinal fluid, etcetera. I have to know theses things due to personal medical history..
1	One day I passed by a man lying in the street unconscious.  I recognized that glazed look on his face and came to the conclusion that he had a stroke.  I witnessed this before and am somewhat knowledgeable about strokes.  I immediately called 911 emergency and the came promptly.  They told me I did the correct thing.

1	I guess an experience that would be considered knowledge of medical issues is when a friend of mine almost passed out because of his low blood sugar.  I was able to, along with other friends, get him to a stable position and get him a few crackers until someone was able to locate his insulin. This was a pretty intense situation.
1	Lately, my lack of fertility...I have had to change my diet, start prenatals, stop hormones and my body has changed.

-1	My son has severe eczema and food allergies and I have to talk to people who watch him a lot about his different meds and his epi pen and where and when to put his certain meds. I feel like Iâm knowledgeable in that sense of medicine 
-1	I think about the time that I hurt my back. I knew that If I went to the doctor there was nothing that they would do besides tell me to put a compress on it. I decided that it would be a waste of time to go so I did the compress myself and in a couple of days my back was better. I was able to avoid the doctor.
1	My partner's dog tore her dewclaw and it needed to be bandaged while it healed.  After some time of bandaging, it still wasn't healing very well.  I suggested it might not be healing because it was constantly wrapped up so couldn't heal properly.  My partner called the vet and they said the same thing to her.

I tried to help customers find the right medicine for them, while I was being watched by the pharmacist and he said I did a great job every time.
1	I have a degree from a culinary school and have also taken several courses on my way to becoming a nutritionist. My stepfather has gout and it bothers him regularly. My mother asked me to design him a meal plan because he does not eat as he is told and as such gout is an issue he deals with regularly. I worked with him and, based upon my knowledge of how to eat with and treat gout, designed a meal plan with food that he likes and was agreeable to eating. This made a noticable difference in his gout symptoms and issues.
1	A coworker was injured on the job. I have first aid training, I was able to assist them with their wound until medical personal arrived.
1	Probably the area where I know the most about medical issues is in terms of sexual activity. In college, I had to write a couple papers about the issue of sexual education, so I did plenty of research on the subject of STDs or teenage pregnancy. This is probably where I gained a lot of knowledge of health.
-1	I developed a blood clot in my twenties. When I walked into the ER I explained that I had a DVT due to the birth control pills I was taking. I had read the insert and I was correct.  
-1	I have a 2 1/2 year old so I deal with some sickness in him. I've only had to take him to the doctor one time when he was sick, because I know the ways to help your body fight the illness more efficiently. I do everything in my power before resorting to the doctor because there's only so much the doctor will be able to do. 
1	I used to work in a healthcare company in data analytics. So I would have access to all of the patient information and procedural information for the tristate area to run predictive analytics as well as other things. I am pretty familiar with coding and procedures from a statistical stand point and what it means, so the numbers make a lot of sense to me. Additionally, I come from a family of medical professionals so if i had questions about a certain procedure i could always ask.
-1	I have had a problem with weight gain since my 2 pregnancies. I am aware that I have higher weight, higher cholesterol, and higher blood pressure as a result of this weight gain. I am aware of 2 main causes - 1) unhealthy eating 2) not having time to exercise. Because I am aware of the risks, I decided to try to eat healthier and exercise more.
1	I was able to speak to my friend about irregular heart rhythms. I have it and have acquired lots of info. The more I know the less I'm freightful
1	I have always had sinus problems. I have gotten to the point that I can feel when I am getting a sinus infection and can start doing the necessary things to feel better.
1	When my brother in law was in hospice, I was able to use my previous experience from other family members.  Able to explain to her how to change his dressings and how to change his position often to prevent bed sores.
1	I went to the hospital complaining about light headiness.  The doctor told me that I had Hypertension.  He told me to diet and exercise before he considered prescribing me medication.  Ultimately my blood pressure returned to normal after following a stricter diet with exercise.
1	The last time I went to the doctor, I had strep throat. I was being checked up on and I needed to fill out paperwork at the beginning of my visit detailing some of my medical history and needs. This went smoothly.
1	In general, I would just mention that I help certain family members with their own medical and health needs. This could include doctor visits, completing paperwork, understanding how to take medication, etc.
1	In my life, I have learned almost all of my knowledge of health from either my university classes or from medical websites online. The time this knowledge actually came into play was when I went to the hospital and listened to what hospital staff says to patients. Recently my father went to the hospital from an illness while visiting him with my mother the nurse came in to tell us what his condition was like. During the conversation, I had no problem trying to understand any of the basic terms or some of the more difficult medical terms that were discussed by the nurse.
1	A couple years ago I was discharged from the ER suffering from abdominal pain, and other weird symptoms like high blood pressure, and no insight really given as to what was causing this given by doctors. On my own, I was able to figure out that diverticular disease was leading me to experience eventual high blood pressure, and that it got worse the more that I ate, so I could avoid this by fasting when I began to have these kinds of symptoms. That's more than the doctors figured out, maybe I should be a doctor.
1	One thing that comes to mind is the fact that I show up each year for an annual physical.  While this seems like a small thing to many, people who think they are healthy should be getting annual checkups because you really can't always tell.  Even if you work out religiously and eat an extremely healthy diet, it's still vitally important to check in and make sure everything is actually okay inside of you.
1	I have to go back to my osteogenesis imperfecta again as having lived with it for over 60 years now, it is what I know best about my own body.   It takes very little for me to fracture. At times I get what are called spontaneous fractures.   Medical professionals who are not particularly familiar with OI can't believe how little it takes for me to get a fracture nor do radiologist always understand that what I often get are tiny hairline fractures which are hard to see.  Thus I can be diagnosed as not having a fracture when I actually do.  I have to know enough to listen to my own body in those cases.
1	I don't know if it's really knowledge, because I did have to research to be sure and still go to the doctor for verification and treatment, but a few months after my daughter's birth I started having breast pain and woke up one night with terrible chills and fever. I thought it might be mastitis (I was breastfeeding) and after some reading online, found the symptoms sounded right. I went to urgent care, confirmed my suspicions, and got some antibiotics.
1	Taking a course during college for food safety and illness prevention. We took numerous tests, courses and had information about the illnesses people can get from raw food, improper food handling and cross contamination. I am also knowledgeable out items that carry common bacteria from food and food items, since it was meant to keep the workplace, work areas and preparation clean to prevent any issue that may occur during cooking and serving guests.
1	I am a testicular cancer survivor of 15 years. I had to make a choice between surveillance, chemotherapy, and adjuvant surgery (after initial tumor removal). I had and have access to a myriad of professional medical peer-reviewed publications that enabled me to make an informed decision with the advice of my doctor. I did the chemotherapy and got my butt kicked. 
1	I was feeling very sick for a few days straight. I knew that it was very likely strep throat but other people kept telling me it was the flu. I read up some more online and finally went to the doctor. He did a strep test and was able to confirm that I did have strep. 
1	A couple years back I went to the dermatologist, but prior to that I did a lot of background search on what derms do and what they can provide for a patient. I already got a good understanding what they would prescribe me and therefore I knew how to take the prescriptions and what some of the side effects were going to be. I did end up getting what I thought I would so it really helped me out.
1	A year ago I had a false positive mammogram and had to go through so many test including a biopsy to get the final results.
-1	When my mother was diagnosed with cancer, I was told that if I did not remove her from the care of one doctor and follow my knowledge I had on the signs and symptoms of kidney failure to send her to a new doctor. Then she would have died within days instead of her having the few months that she had.
1	When my girlfriend got a similar stomach virus to one i had in the past. i knew the best immediate treatment for her and she got over her virus
1	My 1 year old son had fever. His fever was 100 degrees. I knew that was a little bit lower for a medical attention. I used fever reducers for home treatment.
1	I had a child. I read up a ton on childbirth and pregnancy. I was an informed patient and worked with my doctor to create a plan that would involve as few drugs as possible and would allow me to have as much ability to move as he could grant me. Because I was informed and because he was receptive to my desires, we had a solid relationship that made me feel safe in his care. 
-1	My son was diagnosed with fever seizures. I understood that when he had a fever that I had to watch out for this to happen. I was told that I needed to treat any illness where he could get a fever aggressively. If he starts to feel warm or shows signs of his temperature rising he will get meds to have reduce that so it doesn't happen.  
-1	My experience in life would be that I was  a trained combat medic in the US Army, which in turn qualified me to be a paramedic in the civilian world if I chose to take the state liscensing test.

1	I think my level of experience is pretty common for a regular person. I think i learn more every time i go to the hospital, i get sick or anybody in my close circle gets sick. I also enjoy watching different tv programs that teach you more about how to take care of yourself. I also read a lot of articles online about healthy lifestyle. I took few classes about healthy cooking and nutrition   
-1	As I had said or described previously, through my experience I have been able to learn only the basics for medical cases. For example, a while ago I had some problems with my heart. These problems made me understand that I should drink a lot of water, always avoid strong emotions or dislikes. I understood that I could feel thanks to the problem in the heart dizziness and desire to vomit
-1	I have so many to choose from. When I was pregnany I was put on bed rest for 20 weeks. Was hospitalized 5 times. Had a bunch of different doctors. My husband and I researched progesterone and questioned why I wasnât on it. Turns out all the doctors thought I should be, but none of them did anything because they assumed one of the others had. So upon my urging we began daily treatment 
1	One of my friends had to have a surgery because he had an abnormal swelling. By watching grey's anatomy, I was able to tell that my friend had a hematoma and this was confirmed when he had to go in to surgery. One of my medical school student friends was impressed that I was able to tell that from watching a TV show, despite not having taken any medical courses.
1	I have a daughter and she developed a skin rash on her legs.  I took her to dermatologist and the dermatoglist said that she had allergies and prescriped a wide variety of medicines for treatment.  But I did research on the diagnosis and my daughter's problem simply didn't appear to be what was described online.  As a result, I took her to a regular doctor who diagnosed her differently and we used the medicine prescribed and the problem cleared up within a week.
1	I have been dealing with anxiety for a very long time, so when a friend was having panic attacks. I took that information along with what i knew about her personality and told her that I thought that she had a disorder and she should go to a therapist. I was right and she got help for it
1	I learned first-hand about the side effects of cancer treatment (chemo, radiation, surgery).  I learned about the various treatments (CT scan, Pet Scan, external and internal radiation, surgery, transfusions, chemo).
1	Probably when my step dad was complaining about a growth on his face. I have run across information in the past about skin cancer and immediately told him he should get that checked out. He went a couple months later and it turned out that I was in fact right, he was diagnosed with cancer. Thankfully, they were able to cut it out of his face and now he doesn't have it anymore. 
-1	When I was went to the doctor and found out that my cancer came back, I was already familiar with what medicines I needed to take and was knowledgeable about my options 
1	My mother had diabetes. She was diagnosed in 1972. I was 12. I had to make sure she took her shot, and that she ate enough, went to the doctor and would call the ambulance when she had too much insulin. There were no blood monitors and it was a shot in the dark. Sometimes she was too high (the highest  was 1250, and sometimes she was too low (once she was 25). I grew up fast.
1	I have lived with and taken care of a terminally ill parent for years. It was a struggle to keep everything going. It felt like any small slip up could mean she could die. So I was vigilant in everything that was happening to her

1	I had a lump in thigh and looked up information on the lump and found a picture of it on the Internet. The lump is a lipoma (or fatty tissue that grows after an injury).  I got lucky and was correct.  The doctor told me what I had.
1	I have a degree in medical laboratory technology and have spent many years working in the veterinary field. I am familiar with testing and medical diagnosis and procedures. Although, it is at times easier to talk to my veterinarian about my dog's health issues than it is to talk to my Dr.
-1	I had an issue with my arm feeling numb and could not use it for a few days. I went to the doctor thinking that is could have been a stroke. They ran tests and put my arm in a sling. I had read up on strokes and saw news stories online regarding strokes. 
1	I had been put on a new medicine by a new doctor that I didn't really think I needed to be taking from what I had read. She was a very new doctor and I wasn't sure she really knew what to do. The next year when I went for my annual checkup, I saw an older doctor that had been practicing for years and he immediately said that there was no reason that I should be taking that medicine and I should stop. He tried to explain to me the reasoning thinking that I would be against stopping but I told him that I had thought the exact same thing.
1	I took a course on environmental toxicology. I also work as a lab chemist for a water-testing company and need to know how ingested chemicals can affect the body.

1	When I found out that I had high cholesterol, the explanation by the doctor was quite complex. It resulted in it being a genetic disorder which was something I couldn't control. After hearing the explanation from him and hearing how the blood works with cholesterol, I was able to go home and explain all of this to my parents so they could understand. The ability to explain something so complex shows the extent that I understand what the doctor had told me.
-1	My knowledge of health and medical issues are when I had my daughter.  When I had her it was an emergency c section.  I had a condition called HELLP.  I didnt at the time know what that was until that day. I had extremely high BP.  I had to have blood transfusions and platelets.  I had to make sure from that point on I watched my intake of fatty foods so my liver would not be affected.  I have learned what fatty liver really is.  My dr test my blood now to make sure my liver is in the normal levels.  
1	I have given advice to a lot of friends who have mental illnesses since I suffer from depression and anxiety disorder.  I have also researched my parents medical issues and helped educate them or clear up any confusion they have about their conditions or the medication they are taking.  Having to have surgery 4 times also helped me learn a great deal and help others deal with the same medical issue that I have.
1	My tenant informed me he was experiencing chest pains.  I called 911 and had him rest.  I checked his pulse to make sure it was strong.  When the fire department arrived, I made sure that they had his medications to take to the hospital with him.
1	I started eating more healthy food and more carefully watching what I eat after taking a Health course in college. I now think about what nutrients different foods offer and have cut out unhealthy foods.
1	We are trying to get pregnant, so I started to track my cycle and attempts to conceive. Based on my research, I determined that these were important to getting pregnant.
-1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was when someone claimed to have had the flu. I asked them what their symptoms were and based upon their answers, I concluded that they had a mere cold instead of the flu
1	My best friend frequently panics over small issues regarding her health. When she starts to do so, I often give her statistics to calm her down and when that does not work, I then point out to her the process of elimination so that she can realize how minimal her chances usually are of something major.
1	I was able to get myself from 168 pounds as an adult to 215 pounds through diet and exercise. I was able to maintain a healthy blood pressure by monitoring my sodium intake. I was able to gain muscle by adjusting my caloric intake slowly so as not to gain fat while gaining muscle. Also dropped my LDL and raised my HDL through diet and exercise while gaining muscle through increasing protein and reducing carbohydrates. 
-1	When I was younger in school I remember doing health projects. I had the project boards (tri-fold boards) and my presentations were well researched and sited. Later in life, I can recall even myself having to be re-educated due to advancements in science.
1	I was troubled by BPH for years so I constantly monitored my prostate health. I knew that if my PSA were to rise above 4 and stay there for any length of time that I could possibly have prostate cancer. After many years of monitoring and numerous biopsies I was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
1	I think that the most beneficial experience that I have come across would be just learning how to read nutrition labels, and figure out what my daily intake should be. This has allowed me to learn how to control my weight.

1	Whenever i have issues with my health, i will often do my own research prior to seeking medical advice. Most of the time, if you look into certain things from reliable sources, you can find that most common health related issues can be alleviated on your own without an external help. 
-1	When I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis I was not given much instruction on how to deal with it on a daily basis other than to take drugs that had terrible side effects. I began to take the blood test and scopy tests results and learn what each thing meant. I went and got a blood review done and was able to see my cells and learn what the shape and distribution of my cells in the vial mean. I started to change my diet drastically and began taking natural substances such as aloe and ginger to reduce inflammation. Now I have problems still but I can better balance with the chart information and finding resources online I can go to the health store and try and help myself naturally.
1	"One year I went to my primary care physician and there was an option to learn more about diet.  When my doctor found out that I had checked that option, he said, ""You know plenty about diet, you don't need that info!"""
-1	In all honesty, I can't describe such an experience, because I DON'T have a great knowledge of health or medical issues.  I'm not a doctor, or even a med student. The only account I can give you is when I broke two of my fingers at work (due to a rolling machine accident).  The doctor said that he'd have to burn a hole through one of my fingernails.  I immediately understood why... it's a common practice to prevent clotting and swelling of that area. Sorry folks, that's it.  That's all I can think of.
1	I was able to significantly lower my blood pressure by changing my diet to mostly vegetables and fruits. As well as avoiding red meat.
-1	My wife likes to claim that she has cancer every time she feels sick. I keep telling her that she has 0 signs of having cancer, and that she just worries way too much about it. 
1	I had to go to my doctor on 4 separate occasions at one point before she finally agreed to test me for mononucleosis, which I believed I had. At my first visit, she told me I was tired because I was depressed, and she prescribed an antidepressant. At the next appointment when I complained of pain in my side, she told me I pulled a muscle. At the next visit, I told her I believed I had strep throat as well, and she told me there was no sign of strep and sent me out the door. Two days later, I was back in her office, and she then tested me for both strep and mono, which were both positive.
1	When I was pregnant for the first time my period was late and I was throwing up every morning. Even though I had never been pregnant before I knew enough to take a pregnancy test and make an appointment with my doctor to make sure I actually was pregnant and could start getting the medical care that I needed.
1	When my grandfather was in hospice care, I was able to understand what the nurses were saying about his health and how to take care of him.
1	Recently I encountered (along with several other people) a woman lying prone on the sidewalk during a day when the temperature was less than 0 degrees Fahrenheit. More or less spontaneously, we made sure that she was breathing, that she had a heartbeat, that someone had called 911, and then we did what we could to make sure that she wouldn't suffer too much from the cold by warming her hands in ours, talking to her and making her comfort level as high as possible.
1	When my mother in law (age 99, had a heart attack 20 years prior) complained of a sore shoulder and nausea, and her feet turned blue, I suspected that she was having a heart attack. It turned out that I was correct - she had a massive coronary and went into full arrest. 
1	The most relevant evidence that I have experience that demonstrates my knowledge of health or medical issues is not only my many years of taking care of my personal health matters through the health system, but also my having successfully graduating with my Emergency Medical Technician certificate.  I have also interned in an emergency room for some time and have two years of premed education in college.  
1	My medical knowledge tends to relate around lower back and foot pain. For a number of years I had experienced lower back pain at a young age and doctors just told me there was nothing to do about it. I then went to se a chirpractor and he was able to adjust my back over a number of sessions. This relieved a lot of the pain I was experiencing. A number of years later I started having really bad foot pain and was told by doctor that it was plantar fisciatus and gave me inserts. This did not help and I basically self diagnosed and firued out that problem was being cause by my lower back. Started to do a number of streches and eventually pain receded. Then went back to chripractor to get an adjustment and this totally removed the pain from my foot
1	I developed a blister rash on the bottom of my feet and on my hands. From all the symptoms, I discerned it was probably dyshidrotic eczema. My primary care physician at the time had never seen it before and tried to treat it but ultimately sent me to a dermatologist. She took one look and said classic DE. 
1	When I have a headache or a sickness of some sort, I used to take ibuprofen or other painkillers like that. For the past couple of years when I get a headache or feel rough I will just drink lots of water and take it easy. I find that when I run a fever and leave a headache alone, I will usually get well much faster and even have a feeling in my body the next day like my body is no longer fighting something. I've come to feel like the pain you during sickness is literally the thing that's gonna defeat the virus and make you feel better sooner, and recently I've been around lots of sick people and haven't been sick in over a year. I feel that I've challenged my immune system like it's naturally supposed to be challenged, and strengthened it as a result. 
1	During my pregnancy, I found out that I had a condition that had a high risk of early delivery. Through research, I tried to best guess the chance I had at delivering and how much the prescribed treatment (progesterone suppositories) would lower it. I also looked up statistics on survival of babies at a given weeks gestation, to make me feel better at the chances of my baby's survival if I did go into early labor. In the end I was fine and stayed pregnant until my exact due date. So my son was born on his exact due date.
-1	this has never happened to me, i always research my symptoms and then go to the doctor to see if the internet was right or wrong. then ask the dr why its this and not these other things.;
-1	I have had a gastric bypass with many complications.  I have had surgery, multiple procedures, medications and lifestyle changes.  Using all of these, and the information I have been given, I am able to manage these problems.
1	I've had to demonstrate knowledge of a specific medical issue with my own doctor. I was diagnosed with something she had heard of but wasn't really familiar with. I would conduct research etc and report back to her what I found and she would record for reference with future patients. 
1	My mother-in-law was running a fever of 104 and I noticed she wasn't very coherent so made sure she went to the ER as soon as possible. I made sure someone stayed with her at all times since she was not 100% coherent.
1	I took my godmother to the emergency room for a mild chest pain, which was her compliant at the time. After reading the emergency test results and medicines prescribed, I was able to understand what her underlying medical issues are, which was proved right when we later visited her regular doctor as she explained everything to us. 
-1	A time where I was presented with the knowledge of health or medical issues was when I was at the clinic with my doctor who explained to me the problems that I had with my health.
1	"My sister was having severe pain in her lower leg, for no apparent reason. She was a smoker at the time. I suggested she go to the ER because it could be serious. She declined, because it was ""just leg pain."" She was in ICE 2 days later for a pulmonary embolism. The leg pain had been a blood clot. It broke free and went to her lungs. It could have killed her. Had she gone in when I suggested, things would have been much better for her ."
-1	I am an ultrasound tech for my profession.  I had a pt that had experienced sudden weight loss, new onset diabetic and several other symptoms that were side effects of pancreatic cancer.  I scanned her pancreas and found a mass in the head.  I took the information to the radiologist and he did not agree.  I went above him and took the info to the physician and he tested specifically for it and foudn it to be positive for panc ca
1	When I was in the jungle in Thailand with three other people, we spent several nights with tribal people.  On the first night, the woman whose hut we were staying in had a very badly broken arm.  She had broken it a couple of days earlier.  Pierre and I talked about it and agreed to clean it up and set it together, knowing that she would probably get gangrene and die if something wasn't done.  
-1	Most employers are concerned about worker safety since injuries or other workplace incidents can impact productivity, morale, and insurance rates, while also leaving the organization
1	I demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues when my daughter got sick. I took her temperature and gave her cold press to relieve her pain. I also gave her probiotics and other good food to make her feel better.
1	After graduating from college I had a degree in biochemistry. Quite a few years later, I completed 1 semester in a medical technology program.
1	I am familiar with the symptoms and numerical glucose values of diabetic persons who are beginning to have an insulin reaction so I was able to tell when a young boy I knew was in this situation though no one else around him was aware of it. This allowed me to react quickly, grab his blood sugar test kit and test his blood to see if the situation was an emergency.
-1	I don't really have experience except from reading online and luckily I've only had two medical issues, both having to do with my kidneys. I've learned from the doctors and WebMD about supplements and dietary adjustments that would decrease my risk of kidney stones. Otherwise, I really do not have much knowledge on medical issues.
1	When my grandmother was sick, I was two years removed from college and working in a lab.   This made is much easier to help her and my father when going over options for medical decisions
-1	I had my appendix taken out a few years ago. I had a lot of paperwork and discussions with my doctor and the surgeon.
1	I'm not really sure, probably when I got tested for thyroid problems because I did a bunch of research beforehand. It turned out that I did not have any abnormal thyroid condition.
1	I injured my back and began going in for treatments to help with the pain.  I began having pain in my sciatica nerve, and explained this to the doctor.  He didn't believe me because I hadn't had a specific injury that caused this pain.  I explained the pain, and all of the information regarding it, and he finally believed me.
1	I can't think of a specific acute experience but my mother taught me how to read a nutrition label, count calories, and assess whether said calories are empty or nutritional. I could just do better at following that info. 
1	Blood pressure issues.  I know from seeing various family members who had severe high blood pressure what kind of issues can occur.  This was enough for me to decided to address my blood pressure issues with my doctor.
-1	I needed to get a blood transfusion for and ulcer. I wasn't sure how bad it was but relied on my knowledge and common sense to get myself taken care of.
-1	I went to the doctor and thought I had a UTI. The doctor confirmed this and said I should be a doctor. I knew the symptoms and that there was a chance of this or another diagnosis. 
-1	I had found a lump in my breast and had to take the steps to have testing done.  I first went to my obgyn who then referred me to a radiologist to have a mammamogram done.
1	My mom has been diagnosed and survived 4 different cancers. Likewise, my sister in law is a PA. Personally, I have been power lifting for over 4 years therefore understand about the human body and food consumption 
1	I noticed spotting after menopause and knew that it could be serious so I went in for a check-up.  I did have an issue and it was caught in time.
1	My mother was diagnozed with Alzheimer's disease at age 76.  At the time, I read that both high doses of vitamin e and hormone replacement therapy could slow the rpgress of the disease.  In addition, vitamin B12 shots administered monthly would also be beneficial.  I convinced her primary care physician to introduce these supplements into her protocol of care and she remained on a stable plateau of forgetfulness for the next six years, with marked improvement in her mood and sociability.  She died of pneumonia at age 82, before Alzheimer's progressed to its inevitable awful end.
-1	There are time when I may try to self-diagnose at home. It worries me at time when doing so, but I have to go to the doctor as well, and there are a number of times when the doctor gave me the same answer I already figured out myself.
1	I have had check up throughout my entire life. My father was also in the hospital quite often because of a couple different health conditions that he has. I also spent a week in the hospital when I was younger for about 2 weeks because I have a very high fever and pneumonia.
-1	When I was given my lab results while in the Drs office I asked them before I looked at my copies if everything looked good and the nurse said yes everything is perfect so I looked over the reference ranges on all tests done. I found 3 blood tests that were flagged as abnormal and one was really low compared to what the reference range showed for Vitamin D and I was very deficient on paper. I told the DR my findings and he said ohhh just go out in the sun more. Well I talked to a nurse practitioner about it on a follow up appt and she put me on Vitamin D3 supplements for 3 months and I really felt so much better after my level was up. 
-1	When I was in school, I got sick sometimes, and would have to see the doctor. I also had to do a lot of problems like this in school.
1	My first child was born premature. He was in the NICU for a month. During that time I learned, mostly through repeated exposure, how to read a lot of what was going on around me. For instance, I could tell if a baby nearby was have real bradycardia vs. a false brady by the sounds the alarms made.
1	I experienced chest pain on the left side of my chest, so I went to the emergency room thinking I was having a heart attack.  The tests were negative.
1	I had an unusual mole on my shoulder.  It was the same color as my skin but was an unusual shape and just looked very odd.  I researched skin cancer.  I went to a dermatologist and hew was able to test it.  It was cancerous and I had it removed.  
1	I suspected that my son had autism at a very young age. When I took him to the pediatrician, he did not think that my son had autism and did not feel it was necessary to refer him for testing. I persisted and was able to get my son tested. My son was officially diagnosed with autism at the surprise of the pediatrician.
-1	My husband recently had an episode of CHF.  He's had heart disease for years.  The day he could no longer walk from one end of the house to the other, I knew he could no longer put off going to the hospital.
-1	When my mother started experiencing tension types of headaches, I suggest she try to work to loosen the muscles in her neck and shoulders to prevent these headaches. She began stretching each morning and the headaches stopped.
1	I have made sure that my kids have all their vaccinations because I know that the chance of serious vaccination side effects is much smaller than the chance of getting a dangerous disease if you're not vaccinated.
1	I was a pharmacy tech student for over a year. We had tests on the subject and I did well, especially in medical terminology. I have been telling doctors for nine years about chronic back pain, and kept getting sent to do physical therapy which wasn't helping, they tell me I need to exercise and lose some weight but I actually have arthritis and 2 herniated discs shown by an MRI I finally talked someone into doing last year.
1	I have Multiple Sclerosis. One symptom I used to suffer from is extensive pain and numbness in my arms overnight. After extensive research I concluded that water fasting would help improve my condition. After 14 days of water fasting the symptom among many others has vanished.
1	Twelve years ago I was diagnosed with presumed ocular histoplasmosis. It was an emergency situation that I had to make a decision regarding my eyes by putting trust in the doctors. I asked my personal eye doctor a lot of questions and he was able to help me with my decision to have treatment on my eye.
1	I check my weight daily and some days it's increased substantially despite no real change in my diet. This seems to happen most often after I've eaten at a restaurant. Knowing that salty foods can cause the body to hold water for a longer period of time, I can conclude that restaurants use high amounts of salt in their foods and that shows up on the scale as increased weight from excess water in the body.
1	Previously I was thought to have hypertension.  My doctor wanted my cholesterol reduced by 15% in the span of 6 months.  I actively took medication and my cholesterol reduced by 40%
1	I knew that a loved one had a bowel blockage that needed to be addressed. It wasn't because the doctors only focused on the fact that that person had cancer. They refused to look at anything else. It was a hard battle to win.
1	An experience I had in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was when I when my toddler daughter fell from a tree and cut her arm. She was frantic but I observed that the cut was relatively minor, was an isolated injury, did not appear to need stitches and there were no apparent breaks or rapid swelling. I soothed her tears by reassuring her as I cleaned her cut thoroughly and applied pressure to stop the bleeding. Then I applied a sterile bandage to the wound and walked her through some gentle range of motion maneuvers to verify that her wrist and elbow were unaffected. Since everything checked out OK, I determined that a trip to a physician was probably not necessary. I cleaned and dressed the wound, changed her bandage over the following week, and her healing progressed without incident.
1	I had to determine whether to vaccinate my child.  This led to taking the risk of having autism.  I realized that research was trash and did it anyways.
1	When my daughter was little, she was prone to very high fever when sick, often over 104-105 degrees. I was aware that we were approaching dangerous territory.  Early on, doctors told us that we could overlap Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen every 4 hours because that would allow us to wait the recommended time between the same medication while shortening the time between medications.  We continued this practice, understanding that we were not exceeding recommended dosage, when she would have high fevers. 
-1	Usually I know when something is serious or not, because I try to read a lot of medical research and articles about misconceptions people might have. 
1	My son was being evaluated by a cardiologist for a heart condition. The doctor was explaining to me that his pulmonary valve has stenosis and hence had a diagnosis of pulmonary valve stenosis. Because I had recently took a course in college on the heart and how it functions I knew what the word stenosis meant. I also knew the hearts structure and functioning. Without the course I took in college I probably would not have known these terms nor had an understanding how the heart functions or its structures. Because I had prior knowledge of the heart it made it much easier for me to ask questions of the doctor about the diagnosis. It made me feel more at ease when communicating with the doctor because I knew the basic medical terms when referring to the heart. 
1	I demonstrated my knowledge of health and medical issues by self-diagnosing my eye infection as a sty. I went to the doctor and told him that I was developing a small sty around my right eye and he confirmed my suspicions.
-1	When my daughter got a skin allergy reaction when she was 5, i immediately knew  it was food poison by just looking at the color of her skin
1	I had a rash on my leg and suspected that it was Eczema. I went to the doctor and he diagnosed that.
-1	Well I do not have to much experience with examples that I are listed above but I do have basic knowledge of health and medical issues. Well primary my knowledge comes from my wife who is self taught health adviser. Also my mom is a health aid she have been working for 20 years now. Sometimes I do help her with her patients, I usually drive her and her patients to and from doctors appointments. So generally my experience comes from my family, which I am thankful for, because I found a lot of things that will be very useful regarding my health and medical issues.
1	When my dad was diagnosed with kidney cancer, we both talked about the face that his 1 year survival rate was only about 15%. Particularly interesting was the fact that he had a rare form of kidney cancer and his next door neighbor died of the same cancer a few decades before making us wonder if there was an unusual cluster happening.
1	Often I don't know much about what is going on with me medically, once I get the results of blood tests or other diagnostic information is when I start studying and trying to understand. I once got pregnant while using an IUD and being on the pill. I had an intrauterine and an ectopic pregnancy at the same time. They always teach reproduction at the end of anatomy and physiology courses (6/6 times for me it was at the end) so it's usually rushed and cursory, so I needed the doctors to explain a ton to me. Like I didn't know that ectopic fetus' (feti?) don't grow at the same rate as intrauterine ones. Anyway, all the things I learned through that experience, like that I have a bicornuate uterus that makes my IUD less effective, were things I had to explain clearly to new health care providers as I have moved around.
1	I've had many experiences in my life where I felt I demonstrated knowledge of health and medical issues. A few instances that come to mind are when my children were younger. I use to be able to diagnose their issues with an 80 percent efficiency. This was mainly during the ages of one and five. I felt as they got older my ability to pinpoint their illness was not as spot on as when they were younger. I sometimes can make an educated guess as to what is ailing them, today. 
1	Growing up, our maid's daughter had epileptic fits. One night in the middle of the night, I was woken up by my sister who was frantic. Janelle, (maid's daughter) was having a fit and I knew enough to keep her from swallowing her tongue using a spoon and then driving her to the ER. (My parents were both out of town).
-1	I was told I could possibly be at risk of not being able to have children when I went to the hospital a few years ago due to stomach cramping. I questioned them and they could not explain that to me. I asked why they thought that and if they had any proof and they could not. I told them they shoulndn't be telling people that. 
1	I noticed that I have a blue ring around my sclera. I knew that this could be due to an issue with my collagen. I went to several different types of doctors and was told by all of them that I have a strong likelihood of having a collagen defect. I was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos syndrome shortly after. 
-1	My daughter was born with Sturge Webber which is seizure disorder. I had to learn all about it so that I could make sure she got the care she needed.
1	A few years ago, my youngest son, who was 7 at the time, was hit by a car.  He suffered a traumatic brain injury.  He was on life support and in a coma for 3 weeks. He then was placed in a rehab hospital for many more weeks.  I had to quickly learn what was happening around me, the machines, the medications, and the monitors.  Nothing existed outside of his hospital room.
1	My doctor told me that a new medicine I could take has a 25 percent chance to cause nausea.he said it would help me though if I wanted to chance it.i figured the odds were in my favor.
1	When my girlfriend got very sick with some weird symptoms, I was able to tell her which ones were concerning and which ones were perfectly normal. 
-1	I know when I am having trouble with my Cholesterol.  I know when I start feeling a certain way -- tired ect. that I am not treating it like I should be.
1	I don't know that I have many, just that I have have a few surgeries and regularly see a neurologist for migraines.
1	I am a registered sonographer so I get alot of people sending me their ultrasounds to look at baby or tell them what the gender is ect. THis will get annoying after a set of time but when you see a ultraound of a friend that is bad. you never stop thinking about it
1	To be honest, I'm not sick very often and I haven't had much experience with any life-threatening diseases.  I don't call the doctor at the first sniffle, but I do call if I do need to go see him.
1	generally everytime I go to the doctor or er, because I've had biology and medical classes and know a thing or two
-1	I have had to have many medical tests along the way. I also dealt with a sick mother (kidney disease) and a child with medical illnesses since birth (premature child 26 weeks). I have had to have more than my share of medical experience. 
1	I went into my doctor to discuss my mental health options for anxiety.  I knew there was different classes of anxiety and depression medications, but I had a hard time figuring out what would be best for me.  My spouse had to help me figure out which would be safe for me so I don't have negative side effects like I had had before.  I couldn't separate the thoughts of the side effects to the physiological effects.  
-1	Someone was recently mentioning renal failure. I knew what this was just because my wife had explained it to me just recently. 
-1	After I had prostate cancer surgery and was in the process of recovering, I developed lympidemia in my left leg. For a large portion of my life I had been in excellent physical condition. As a result I knew that if after recovery I stayed active there was a very good chance that my swelling go down and stay down with regular exercise. This knowledge was gained through several sources including my doctors and previous trainers.
1	I gave birth to my son at 23 weeks (17 weeks early).  During his NICU stay, the doctor was trying to explain to me what problems we were looking at long term for him (ex: Cerebral Palsy, blindness, lung problems) but, before the doctor could finish I was already listing all the different possibilities to him.  He was amazed at my knowledge of the all that was involved in my having my son so early.
-1	When my husband had cancer I had to learn a lot of information. He had issues that were never discussed with us about his long term problems from head and neck radiation.
1	My knowledge on health and Medical issues is really only valuable to one person, me. I know how i feel, i know how i don't feel, I have a vested interest in my health and well being that encourages learning about whatever symptoms i may be dealing with at any given time, due to this i usually am pretty educated as to what i may likely have and why, or what i most likely do NOT have and why. I have noticed that doctors have seem to be thankful of this at many of my appointments and maybe even a little impressed! One time in particular i correctly diagnosed my skin condition and the doctor got it wrong in fact i had to really advocate for myself to finally get the medication that would treat the condition i was convinced i had, and finally when i saw another doctor he agreed with my diagniosis and treatment was immediately successful. The prior doctor had told me flatly that the condition i was concerned about was familiar to her and i DID NOT have it, in fact I DID! 
1	In boy scouts we had to learn and demonstrate first aid. I learned all the basics. Also in health class at school.
1	My husband has diabetes and so i learned alot from him. I couple years ago my doctor told me that my blood sugar was borderline but i could reduce it by changing my diet. I was fully aware of what that meant and the implications of it and i knew fully what she was talking about and what to do
1	MY GIRLFRIEND IS DIABETIC, WHEN HERE BLOOD SUGAR IS EXTREMELY LOW HAS THE APPEARANCE OF BEING SAD, IF YOU ASK HER A FEW QUESTIONS AND SHE IS UNABLE TO ANSWER THEM YOU KNOW HER BLOOD SUGAR IS LOW AND SHE'S NOT SAD.
-1	I am starting mammograms and I ask my doc questions.  I have breast cance in the family.  I've already decided what I'll do if I'm diagnosed with cancer.  I'd rather go into doc office with information I've gotten.
1	When I last went to the doctor, I brought along with me a detailed list of my symptoms as I recorded them when they occurred. Along with this, I made sure to ask questions about certain health conditions that I thought I had a higher probability of having.
1	We have three kids.  Without preventive measures, if one gets sick, we'll all get sick.  Any time one of them has vomiting or diarrhea, we take precautions by sanitizing everything by cleaning and spraying disinfectant and quarantining when  possible.  By taking these measures, I'm sure we've saved ourselves hours of agony.
1	My son was having lots of issues with his ears.  I suspected that he had an ear infection.  I took him to the doctor to get checked out, and he indeed had an ear infection.  I was lucky enough to be able to try an alternative therapy to antibiotics, which I had heard about from a nurse friend of mine.  The doctor allowed us to try it and come back in a few days to see if it had worked.  It did (it was mullein garlic ear drops) and he avoided antiobiotics.
1	When my mother was ill I had to help her with her medical issues.  I did the best I could and I felt like a very competent person in regards to medical issues.
-1	2 years ago I had my son via c-section. 10 months post-partum I had picked him up along with a 24 pack of water and I ended up getting a hernia. I told the doctor and they agreed with me. 
1	 I fell and scratched my wrist in my front yard one morning. When I put my hand in my pocket about 2 hrs later I was shocked by the pain from my hand. My fingers were swollen and red in just a couple of hours. I went to the VA clinic and was told I must have had a sting because infection didn't occur as quickly as that. I went home and tried to rest but I realized I was feverish.  I went to the hospital emergency rooms and they immediately admitted me with a MRSA infection. I was told that had I followed clinic instructions I probably would not have lived.
1	My sister was describing pain in her abdomen,  After showing me where the pain was I told her she may have appendicitis.  After going to the hospital it was confirmed she had it,
1	I was diagnosed with shingles and I had already had read up on the shingles symptoms and side effects. I felt as though I was equipt enough to understand my condition better because if this. 
-1	I am able to understand when something is diagnosed to me. I understand that antibiotics are only for bacterial infections so if it is most likely a virus they should be avoided so you don't get immune.
1	Just reading random articles and looking to understand more common health occurrences and illnesses beyond a generic understanding of what most individuals would have.
1	There was some white sags in my throat once, I already know what they are, is an infection Iâve already had before, so all I needed to get was some antibiotics, I told a doctor friend of myne to give me a prescription. 
1	With the exception of minor things such as headaches, stomachaches, sore throats, colds and the flu, I am not sure if I ever have really demonstrated much knowledge of health or medical issues. 
1	My father was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis years ago and he had a very hard time being able to understand any of the information that he got. Since I had been in college taking medical and biological classes, I was able to break it down for him and help him make the decisions that he needed to.
1	My mother is a medical social worker and my father is a healthcare consultant. My mother in particular has influenced me knowing a good deal about medicine. I regularly went to the hospital with her from a young age and volunteered at her hospital as a teenager as well. I also had more serious medical problems in my late teen and early 20s that required a good deal of medical attention that made me more knowledge about medicine and tests and procedures than I ever cared to be unless I was attending medical school.
1	I fell down a flight of concrete stairs once and got pretty banged up but felt OK to walk and did not immediately go to the hospital because I knew that I did not have a concussion. I knew to go to the hospital the next day as my neck was extremely sore and my hand had bruised severely, and I knew that I had at least one broken bone in my hand.
1	One time, I had to go to the dentist and ended up needing an antibiotic for an infection. I told them to give me Clindamycin instead of Erythromycin because I had previously had an infection that was resistant to Erythromycin and I was allergic to Penicillin.
1	My son was born with syndactyl (webbed toes) and his left hand was webbed also.  During that experience I did a lot of research in order to decide what to do for him.  We consulted with several different doctors and specialists.  (Part of that was due to us moving and having to find new doctors).  I felt pretty knowledgeable about his condition.
1	My mother has serious health conditions, and has had 8 major surgeries.  Her most recent 30 years have been rough (that's more than half of her life).  I learned a lot growing up with a sickly mother.
-1	A few years ago I was diagnosed early with the full-blown flu. I know something was out of the ordinary because my body aches were very extreme. I knew it was the flu and luckily got it before it became worse. 
1	My grandfather suffered from a heart attack several years ago.  He was told to stop using tobacco after surgery and he could reduce his change of another heart problem by a significant percentage.  I helped him to understand how important it was to stop using tobacco.
-1	I had a cyst in my hand when I was 19 years old, but did not know what it was at the time. I used the internet to look up my symptoms and found out that it was a cyst. When I went to the doctor, I told them what I thought it was based on my research and it turned out that I was correct.
1	I cannot say that it really demonstrates my knowledge on medical issues but I have clearly learned many things regarding the subject. Many things I learned since my daughter was born and she had all kinds of typical for her age issues. Also when she was found with the mild hearing loss I learned a lot of her condition.
1	When my husband had an iliostomy and I had to help him change it and had to deal with giving him IV meds and had to deal with dr and insurance companies and everything else as well as taking care of my two small kids.
1	When I was younger, I had contracted Mononucleosis. After I had completely recovered, I had developed lumps on my shins. Most people would automatically assume that they were shin splints, but I knew better. I met with one Dr. who diagnoses me with shin splints even though I told him that I was not an active person. I also showed him my research results which suggested that I had Erythema Nodosum, which is common after contracting Mononucleosis. That Dr. told me I was wrong, so I went to a Dermatologist instead who confirmed that I was absolutely correct.
-1	Brain Tumors a condition called Neurofibromatosis. Very serious. I have both and right now my daughter has one of these diseases. Also premature babies my first born was born at 25 weeks. At 1lb 3oz. Over 4 months in the hospital
1	i am an optometry student so i often talk to friends about their eye problems and help them especially with proper contact lens care
1	I have Hypothyroidism.   I have been getting treatment for years.  I have normal numbers but still have symptoms.  My doctor does not listen to me even though I know my body better than anyone else.  This frustrates me because I have done my research and know that other people have the same symptoms as me despite having normal numbers
1	I have a good knowledge of conditions that i have had in the past. There was a time when i had to have a series of test done and through the research to find out what it could be i was able to help the doctor know what test to try
-1	Two weeks ago, my puppy got ear infection and started feeling really bad. I took care of him for about ten days. I cleaned his ear, put medicine on it, changed the gauze, and closely kept an eye on him. I knew which medicine to use, and how often to use. Also, I knew how effectively to clean his ear and take care of the infected area. Soon enough, my dog got a lot better and now his ear infection is completely gone.
-1	There are many, but because I have a nursing background, most of my friends come to me for medical advice and to explain what the doctor told them.  Before I give any medical advice or explanations, I always ask if they have been to their doctor and what did he tell them.  
-1	actually in very difficult to understand simple read some terms and diagnoses, that's why I find it hard to understand and I need some to explain many times the diagnosis
1	I helped my dad take my grandfather to the emergency room when he was sick. The doctor told us what was wrong with my grandfather using medical terms. I understood this and told my dad in more simple words.
1	I had a liver transplant in 2003. Since then I have become the go to expert for the people I know on anything to do with the liver. Or any organ transplant. Or really any major surgery. Even veterinary questions. I really donât know that much about the medical knowledge behind liver transplants, but I can advise on how to approach the procedure, and what to expect to happen after the procedure (which is more important to the patient, anyway). I know I have been able to put some peopleâs minds at ease who have experienced a transplant, so that makes me feel good. In 2017 I had a kidney transplant, so now Iâm an expert on that, too.
1	My colleague cut himself. So I got a first aid kit, wrapped the cut up with ice, had him hold his cut hand over his head for a half hour, then applied wiped the cut with alcohol and applied cream to prevent infections, and bandaged him up. 
-1	I believe that doctors are incompetent. Every experience I have had with an doctor has been miserable. There have been doctors that have told me I wasnât a virgin, steered me in the wrong way as far as medicine and about health decisions 
1	A friend began suffering from terrible migraines, but didn't want to go to the doctor. I asked him different questions to identify the cause, including whether he had any dental issues. He didn't see the connection, but admitted that he had an exposed nerve in one of his teeth. I suggested he stopped avoiding the dentist because that may be the cause of his migraines. Within a few days of going to the dentist, his migraines stopped.
1	I have a chronic endocrine disorder that I diagnosed myself based on research done in medical journals. I had been to a variety of doctors who missed the symptoms. Once I found out that the disorder sounded like me, I went to a doctor who confirmed the diagnosis through blood work and other testing. I might still be without diagnosis had I not been able to find it myself. 
1	I have a lot of health problems and so does my family. I also have have a job in the healthcare field before. 
1	I verbally walked a patient through what will happen during a cerebral angiogram from start to finish.  What they will experience and and to expect from the dr.'s.  I have had these before myself and i also schedule them.
1	I was a coach for many years and I would teach my athletes about proper diet, hydration, and exercising. I believed in helping the athletes be healthier and better conditioned to be able to handle sports and injuries.
1	I had a friend that I was helping out when I noticed that she was having problems. First it was just not being able to remember but then she couldn't add and that was not like this smart individual so I asked her a few questions and I told her she needed to go to the doctor right away.  I was right she had a brain tumor that was causing her trouble.
1	When i was Dx with fibroids it was a scary time. I relied on my knowledge of medical procedures to be able to explain to family members the extent of damage done to my body. I was able to explain how the symptoms I was experiencing how they would have long term affects on my body. I was also able to make educated decisions on my healthcare. 
1	I was with my grandma when she was diagnosed with dementia.  Based on movies I had seen, I was able to question the doctor about what was to come.  
-1	I am Trained as AN CERT ( community emergency response team) member a program funded by FEMA and have basic and intermediate first aide training. I also assist at local red cross functions.
-1	I had a real bad sore throat a few years ago and I had a feeling that I had strep throat. I was correct with my diagnosis, I realized that I was having to much pain so I knew it couldn't be a regular sore throat. my thinking was confirmed by my doctor. 
1	I had a mammogram that was suspicious and needed a breast biopsy. I asked to have an ultrasound or MRI to confirm before surgery. They did as I requested and found it was a fatty tumor, no surgery needed
-1	About 15 years ago my primary physician was completing my annual exam and asked if I was experiencing any pain in my upper back.  I told her that I was aware of the curve in my spin but that I had attributed the discomfort that I was having from the years of pushing Z-racks at work. She prompted informed me of the medical term for the physical condition and recommended that I keep an eye on it.  She did send me to have xrays done to begin tracking.
1	I had a ingrown toenail that I had to have a doctor remove a few years ago. I knew what an ingrown toenail looked like and the health risks that it came with.
1	A few years ago, I lost about 70 pounds without help from a medical practitioner. I just made a switch to eating whole foods and exercising daily. My doctor always wanted to make it a thyroid issue, but I firmly believed that once the change was made the thyroid would follow. It did.
1	I can't be specific. However, I learned about edema in the hospital. I knew that this was a serious issue and could be life threatening. This information was instrumental in helping me to understand the facts of a condition. 
1	I had many experiences practicing as an emergency medical technician for a fire department. I would have to obtain histories, perform physical exams, treat some injuries, provide health advice, and come up with a differential diagnosis.
1	Apologies in advance if this isn't exactly the type of experience that you're looking for, but it's the only thing that I can think of that somewhat relates. Whenever I run across something that I don't know about (especially a health issue), I typically try to do as much research on it as I can. As mentioned before, I suffer from IBS. I tried to do what research that I could on my own, but I eventually had to cave and go to the doctor when it didn't seem to get any better (it's a good thing that I did, because I likely also had a stomach ulcer). Anyway, fast forward about half a year later, and it seems that my IBS is getting worse and my medicine doesn't seem to be helping that much. I go to the doctor again to get a different medicine, which also doesn't seem to be doing much good. In the meantime, I've been keeping a food journal and doing more research on my own. After a couple of months of pain, I figure out the problem--I've developed fructose malabsorption. After cutting out soda and other things high in fructose, the problem is as fixed as it can be.
1	After a mishap on the bicycle immediately after getting home I thoroughly cleaned the scrape and applied Neosporin then covered the wound with a bandage.  Over the next couple days I regularly cleaned the wound and watched for any signs of infection.
-1	I had to go to the doctor with my mother when she was having a stroke and I had to explain all of her symptoms to not only the doctor, but the paramedics and nurses as well. Explaining her symptoms directly helped them get my mother care faster.
1	When my mom had a heart event.  She had to be shocked back to life twice, and put into a medically induced coma for 2 days while her body recovered before they allowed her to wake up and took her off of all of the medications. I had to deal with all of the inputs from the doctor's on if she would wake up, when she would wake up, how should would be if and when she woke up as well as medications and after her open heart surgery, how to take care of her when she returned home.  It was 3 weeks of being in the hospital looking after her with my husband, pulling night shift and working to be a patient advocate.
1	When I was told about ear infections, I knew most of the information because I had had ear infections in the past. I knew any technical terms and what causes them and the treatments for them.
1	I had trouble breathing through my nose during exercise. It turns out, it was because I had a blockage in my nose called nasal polyps. I had heard about this from reading things online about congestion. I realized I needed to treat it with nasal spray so I went to my doctor about it.
1	I had a perianal abscess a few years ago. last year I started feeling like I was getting another one. I went to my doctor, explained what I was feeling and the doctor examined me. He told me I was right and started me on antibiotics.
-1	I was diagnosed with unexplained high blood pressure. Since there was no explanation, it has made it challenging to figure out how to solve the issue and avoid heart damage in the future.  
-1	I have had to have over 12 surgery's and many more biopsy's in my life. i have had bone grafts done to breast biopsy's.. i have a lot of experience in the hospital care world. Today i do home care for a quadriplegic between his and myself we have plenty of experince.
-1	In 2004, I took a bad fall in front of the hospital I worked at which resulted in a fractured right hip.  It required surgery and 4 weeks later after a rehab stay I was home and regaining my mobility and living life at a much slower pace.  It was the first time I was incapacitated and had to rely on others for help.  I knew that I needed to follow the dr's orders and almost 9 months later I was back to work.  I did everything as ordered and because I was familiar with medical jargon I was a good patient.
1	My mother is a type 1 diabetic which she got in her 20s. So since then she is well versed in medical knowledge and keeps on it. She kept up on me as a kid and into my 20s. I think I learned a lot from that and apply what I learned from my mom to own health. I also consult with her still. 
1	I knew antibiotics have to be finished completely. so With my knowledge I helped my friend to take the full course rather stopping it in the middle after she started feeling okay.
1	I went to college for nutrition/dietetic technology, so I am aware of the values of the lab tests and what they should be. I also know how I could improve my diet to lost weight and help my cholesterol numbers. I am also very aware of having to take care of myself and particularly my heart to help me live a better life. I have also suffered from depression, anxiety and PTSD for over 25 years, so I know how to avoid triggers and help myself so I can stay on a low dose of medicine.
1	I recall when my son had an accident by the door slamming to his fingers. He almost lost the tip of his fingers the doctors told me that I have the option of either amputate or go for a surgery to try to save the fingers but the chances are very slim. I asked them to give written information about the surgery and the likelihood of success. I took my time to go through the information provided and based on what they told me and my knowledge and I decided that he will go for surgery. It was one of the best decisions i have ever made, four years later my son's finger look pretty normal.
1	19 years ago my doctor told me I was diabetic. He knew me well, and said he'd give me 6 months to learn as much as I could about it and to see if I could control it on my own without medicine. If I didn't have it under control within that time (or wasn't showing improvement on subsequent visits prior to the 'deadline') he'd prescribe something to control it. I had it under control within 6 weeks. Through diet and exercise maintaining extremely tight control of my blood glucose level has become routine. I'm almost always below 90 mg/dL. I get a good night's rest to not interfere with my 'dawn effect.'
-1	When I tried to lose weight a few years ago I created an eating plan that was very healthy and I actually ate everything i needed to eat and was losing weight fast without starving.
1	When I was only 16 or 17 I had a gland that was swollen.  Being that I do get nervous about health related things, I did my own research before seeing the doctor.  This was just shortly before the internet took off.  I had a book that explained what my issue was, with the specific name of the gland.  When I visited the doctor, I used that name to tell him what I thought was wrong with me.  He was very surprised that I had any idea what it was, and said that I was correct.  This example explains just many instances like this I have had in my life with doctors.  I apparently surprised them with how much I know.  I do this because it lessens anxiety to have as much information as possible.
1	I was talking to my doctor after a visit and I mentioned that I saw the AHA had changed the guidelines on cholesterol. He had heard about it too and we had a discussion about cholesterol numbers.
-1	I have low blood sugar and my doctor explained the need for me to eat 6 small meals a day and make sure I eat complex carbohydrates and protein at each of those meals.  I understand that doing this will keep my blood sugar level and I will feel better.
-1	I had high cholesterol when I went to the doctors 3 months ago. I decided to go on a vegetarian diet to lower my cholesterol and take fish oil 3 times daily.
1	When I started feeling depressed, I recognized the symptoms from my degree in psychology and was able to seek out treatment right away.
-1	I was losing weight and had no appetite. I continued going to the doctor but everything seemed normal. I ended up in the hospital with PE's. A month later I found out I had thyroid cancer. The only reason it was found was because a scan was done looking for clots. My labs had always been normal. I understood the need for surgery to remove half my thyroid to prevent it from spreading and that the clots were probably caused from that.
1	I really just use what I have been through plus what information I get while online. I like to read about things so it makes me curious to know things.
1	I'm a Registered Nurse and took care of my husband when he was sick and dying.  At that time, the doctors communicated with me as a professional most of the time and respected my knowledge of medical issues.  We worked as collaborators.  
1	when my husband fell and broke his nose, he also got a concussion.  He kept asking me the same questions over and over, which indicated short term memory loss. He also lost a lot of blood.  The paramedics came  and took him in the ambulance.  I called them because I thought there might be a head or neck injury, and I didnt want to move him and make it worse,
1	I was able to cure a bout of strep throat in myself without the help of antibiotics.  When I found out that I had it I researched it and discovered that I could use household products to kill the bacteria and that it would likely go away on itâs own if I waited long enough.
1	I had an anxiety attack and anxiety issues that caused me to over think some things. I meditated and calmed myself down to help clear my mind and decided that what I was worried about is nothing. 
1	No specific past experience comes to mind. I am no health expert, though I suffer from several health issues. However I am confident enough in my understanding of my own health conditions, so that if someone were suffering from the same symptoms, I would definitely be able to give them some good recommendations on how to treat it, and I would be able to explain the cause of the condition and how it works.
-1	When I was 6 I was diagnosed with ADD. However, my parents didn't believe it was a real thing and I certainly did not want to be that kid who had to take medicine and stuff to be smart so we went about 4 years struggling in school and at home before we decided to do our own research and I fit a lot of the criteria. When I started my medicine it was nota  good experience. I tried about 8 different kinds before I found one that worked for me. It was a lot of going back and forth and working with the doctor to find the best approach for me and to figure out what to do. 
-1	I've been an advocate for those diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Neurologists all over the country give their newly diagnosed patients my phone number and email because they find that I'm better at explaining things than they are sometimes because I've lived with MS for 40 years. This doesn't say that I can do percentages anymore, but I have been a great  layperson neurological and psychological source to countless people I've been told for more years than I can count:-)
1	I am a veterinary technician student, so I demonstrate this knowledge all the time. I have a tendency to have my doctor talk to me in medical terminology. If I don't understand something because it is not used in animal health I will let her know.
1	I was one of the first to see the signs that my brother has diabetes. I recall his sweet smelling breath and pointing out he was always thirsty.
-1	Recently i got a skin allergy on my back. I went to doctor for check up. I was worried because it is increasing day by day. Doctor told me not to worry that much he has given some medications. And it was healed after few days when i started medication. 
-1	When I felt a lump in my right breast and immediately went to see my doctor. He checked it out and sent me to get a mammography and I found out it was caused by a car accident, I was in.
1	A friend and I were out at a restaurant one night late after having worked together, when he started seizing. We rushed to the hospital and from there I had to describe to the doctors what had happened and help take care of his information as he was unconscious. He recovered and was diagnosed with epilepsy.  
1	Every time I deal with a medical professional, it demonstrates my knowledge of health or medical issues. I allowed myself to put my trust in someone who is an expert in this area, and I am an active participant, making sure to give as much accurate information as I can, as well as asking all necessary questions to be well informed.
-1	I was in a severe car accident and broke my pelvic bone. I was in the emergency room for 4 hours and I saw a lot that went on at the hospital. The doctors and nurses are trying to save lives at a timely manner to get people in and out. I was sent to a private room for 3 days then released. It was a very painful recovery but with the help of therapy I made it. I am thankful.
1	I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and needed to learn more about this disease and my options in order to make an informed decision regarding treatment, surgery, etc. I researched the best area doctors and surgeons and got a second opinion before making my decision on how to manage this diagnosis. 
1	I deal with medical issues on a daily basis at work. I am a medical coder and biller. In order to bill the insurance companies correctly, I need to code the patient's illness and care correctly. However, a strong background in the medical terminology is needed in order to make sure every supply and illness is properly coded. I often need to assist my colleagues in  this area, I am the only one in the office who is certified, so the other secretaries look to me for assistance. 
1	One time, my brother got sick while my parents were out of town. I took care of him by doing everything my mom would do for me when I was sick. I made him stay in bed, drink lots of fluids, and take some aspirin every four hours.
1	For about six years, I was the full time caretaker for my grandmother. I had to know what medications she was allergic to, and monitor her pulse and blood pressure daily, and I had to adjust dosage of some of her medications depending on what the readings were, per her doctor's instructions.
1	I helped my best friend lose over 100 pounds by guiding him thru calorie counting and eating healthier meals. His blood pressure went down, his doctor told him his BMI is now in a healthy range and he was no longer on track to need medication for diabetes. He was constantly asking me questions about how to proceed and went 100% by the advice and guidance I gave him.
1	I remember learning and reading about how to get rid of tics before going camping with my friend because I had a huge fear about them. Learning about this knowledge helped me help my friend, who ended up being the one to catch a tic. I was able to help him work through the process of removing the tic before it burrowed down too far.
-1	I have had a lot of terrible scarring issues that are too traumatic to write about. I have very bad PTSD from everything and am constantly in fear. 
-1	When I was dealing with acute bronchitis, I realized there was only so much I could do aside from taking antibiotics. I realized there were certain foods that actually helped me feel better
1	I have two children.  Through experience and knowledge and I am pretty capable of knowing when to take them to the doctor versus just resting at home and when they are contagious or not.
1	My dad is a diabetic.  I have conversations with him often about his condition.  I often give him suggestions on foods that he could eat that are low in carbohydrates to try to help him lower his blood sugar. 
1	My youngest daughter had a febrile seizure. We called the ambulance, went to the ER and then followed up with our pediatrician. Because of all the information I received during that first time, when she had a second febrile seizure two weeks later, I felt confident enough to remain calm, put her on her side, and just ride it out. I knew, however, that if she didn't come out of it within 5 minutes, that we should call 911.
1	My son has allergies and acid reflux and I have always managed his medical issues with medicine by measuring appropriate doses and managing his diet.
-1	My son had quite a few ear infections as a baby and into toddlerhood.  When my daughter was born, I knew the signs to look for in order to take her to be seen.  Luckily, she never had an eardrum rupture (as my son did) due to my knowledge of the ear canal and what to watch for.  I felt more on top of things with my sencond child, medically speaking.
-1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health was when I went to the hospital for having gastroenteritis. I had a lot of questions on why this was inside of me and exactly what I got it from.
1	I have a friend that is diabetic. She has a pump that constantly pumps insulin in to her. We went on a trip to New York and we were sightseeing. Suddenly Christine did not seem right. She seemed spacey but said she felt fine. I stopped at a street vendor and got her an ice cream cone as that was all that was around. She had that and was just fine after that. I knew what to watch for with her and what to do. 
1	I had chest pains and knew I needed to call the doctor's office. I read up on symptoms and talked to the scheduler about various options. I did not go to the emergency room but made an appointment for the first possible opening with a physician. 
1	I demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues when i started having symptoms of a concussion. I knew what to look for and what it was. 
-1	My grandpa came home on hospice and needed his oxygen concentrator set up at his house. The hospice company delivered it but no one stuck around to hook him up to it. I was able to figure out from some past experience how to add water to the cannister and set the appropriate flow rate for him. 
-1	I studied biology and medicine in college. I read through what types of medicines there are from doctor medical to therapy medical. I studied what their responses are that occurred in the body
-1	I don't have an extreme amount of health experience or knowledge of health.  I try to stay up-to-date, like most people, but all we have to keep us up-to-date are statistics and calculations put forth by professionals in the medical field.  
1	When I had my daughter she was born with a different blood type than me and had very bad jaundice due to it. I had researched jaundice prior to her birth because my oldest child had it as well, so I had knowledge.
1	I am a Type 1 Diabetic.  Several years ago, I had to go to the hospital due to catching the flu.  I ended up staying overnight because I was dehydrated.  I had to explain to the doctor how I calculate how much insulin I need to take based upon the food that I consumed. 
1	When my son had bronchitis, I was fully able to understand the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis overall of how this would affect him at that time and also potentially in the future. 
-1	I found out over 10 years back I had a mitral valve prolapse. I knew nothing at first but learned about this through research over time. I learned this can be a genetic defect where both heart valves do not close completely. I educated myself.
-1	the only knowledge i have about health issue is the ones my doctor told me about. that is what is making this task difficult for me to handle now.
1	I guess when I get sick I am able to know the difference between viral and bacterial diseases. I am able to know that I don't always get antibiotics (they aren't always effective or useful) and that I shouldn't ask the doctor for them.
-1	I've never really had an experience that demonstrated my knowledge of medical issues, but in every case i have made an effort to treat my health situation as best as possible.
-1	I've worked as a CNA for a few years.  I also have a few minor health problems. I read on health related issues occasionally too. I like to be in the know.  I'm terrible with math so all my answers are probably wrong.  
1	When I had stomach pain one night, I noticed that it didn't go away even after using the bathroom and that the pain was localized to the lower right quadrant of my stomach.  I felt like this could be appendicitis, so I went to the doctor and a CT scan confirmed this.  I had to have an appendectomy that same night.
-1	Once my knee was swollen up so bad and before we went to the doctor i looked up my symptoms via webmd and found out i had an inflammed bursa also i successfully diagnosed my wifes gall bladder attacks.
1	When I was trying to lose weight for my wedding, I vigorously kept track of the calories I consumed by reading every label and went running everyday. I made sure that I was at a calorie deficit everyday to ensure that I was losing weight.
1	I try to keep up on health related current events.  I am well versed in the flu and was actually hospitalized several years ago because I was so sick. I knew based on my symptoms and that my fever was increasing to get help.
1	My obtaining a degree in biology required me to show that I have knowledge of at least some health or medical issues. I didn't do pre-med though so I haven't had advanced studies in the subject.
-1	My mother and grandmother are both cancer patients and I attended a lot of the appointments with the many doctors and took notes for them.
1	I recently had to take my son to the doctor because he had a very high fever and a sore throat.  At the same time, he was showing flu like symptoms.  The nurse only wanted to test for strep but I asked her to test for flu as well so that we could rule out either or both.
1	The only incident that stands out was when my mother began to have somewhat of a reaction to her low blood sugar. She wasn't able to communicate very well, but i knew right away what was going on and what she needed.
-1	I was able to make informed decisions in regards to receiving eating disorder treatment. I selected the right treatment sentence for me. 
1	I was in a group of friends, when suddenly, one of our friends started to act strange. People were jumping to several conclusions of what it was, but no one really knew. I called 911, and approached my friend, to observe better. I reported to the operator that I believed my friend was having a stroke, and went through the standard diagnostics to confirm this, while we awaited an ambulance.
1	The only real experience would be when I was young in Boy Scouts and we learned first aid for many different injuries and illnesses. We demonstrated that knowledge every year in an annual first aid competition where we were given different scenarios and judged on how we handled the incident.
1	These questions were not nessasaraly about knowledge of health, they are more about the knowledge of math.  I learned a lot about my health after I blew out my knee
1	I had trouble getting pregnant so I had to do IVF. I ended up doing lots of research on my own to come up with a plan with my doctor to get pregnant. I suggested some medications that were newly researched to my doctor.
1	I guess I would talk about times that I take my kids to the doctor.  I understand what their blood pressure, temp. and other vital signs should be.  This always me to ask intelligant questions or express my concerns. 
1	I once started to feel sick and had symptoms similar to a cold. The cold lasted more than a week but everything except a cough remained. I felt like something was wrong so I looked things up and found I may have had bronchitis. I went to the doctor's office and they also agreed that I likely had bronchitis. 
-1	Get a dictionary of medical terms and look up the ones you don't know in your reading material. Use the terms in sentences until they make sense. Audit some classes having to do with nursing and medicine at your local college. Go online and read medical articles that have to do with your particular medical interests.
-1	My son has adhd and i basically did extensive research and diagnosed that he had before it was told to us by a dr. I compared many different articles and symptoms to pinpoint what i thought it may be.  This help me understand not just what he has but how it's so many similar diseases.  
1	After having my child, over time the symptoms of post partum depression began to appear. Having dealt with depression in the past I was able to recognize the symptoms. After a few triggering events everything came to a head. It was probably 3 weeks of struggling to even get out of bed that made me realize that I needed to seek help. I first reached out to ladies in my mom group who assured me that I was neither alone or losing my mind. From there I had the confidence to reach out to my doctor. At my appointment I described everything that was going on and we were able to get me on the appropriate medicine that I knew from past experience worked for me.
1	One time my friend was having pain in his chest and thought he was having a heart attack but I informed him if it was sharp pain he was probably gassy. 
1	As I have taken some science classes in college, I felt like I had the basic gist of things when I got back my annual physical results.  I was able to see and determine which indicators were normal or abnormal.  I was able to research what I didn't know and find answers to my questions.
1	I have knowledge of health and medical issues in the sense that I typically know when to go to the doctor. I know what symptoms are associated with what illnesses, and I know what to expect from treatment. For instance, I had the flu a few weeks ago. After most of my symptoms had passed, my lymph nodes became so swollen that they were visible from across the room. I knew I was getting a secondary infection and went to the doctor. As I had predicted, they put me on prednisone and a strong antibiotic.
-1	I was feeling sick i had fever and flu symptoms. However something didnt feel right. I noticed my lymp nodes on my neck were swollen. I knew this could be a serious viral infection. I went to see my doctor and in deed i had a viral infection. My doctor gave me antibiotics.
-1	Helping my friend when she was running a fever. Tell her to take tylenol and drink liguids. Also making sure she saw a doctor for further help.
1	Going to the doctor and knowing how low my blood pressure should be and what birth control works best for me
1	I worked with children with severe and profound illnesses as a result I learned a number of basic medical techniques including tube feeding, IV maintenance, and other low level tasks that I would have to perform in an emergency.  In addition the necessity of understanding medical issues with a rare disease gets much higher since many doctors have never heard of my condition. 
-1	When I was diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, I  had to very quickly get familiar with a lot of medical/health terminology. A lot of doctors don't even know about the condition so it was on me to describe the basic concepts to them.
1	I feel I have the basic knowledge of health or medical issues. I am always leaning to learn more about human's body from medical side. And i can deal with small issues and make judgement about if i need more care
1	I had a missed miscarriage and was scheduled for a D&C the following morning.  A few years later a friend was also experiencing a missed miscarriage and her doctor gave her the option to wait and miscarry naturally or have the D&C.  I was able to discuss my experience with her and what I learned after my surgery was complete.  My experience was able to help her make her own decision.  
-1	I helped my sister when she fell and sprained her ankle. Helped her elevate it and put ice  on it until she could get to a doctor
1	I did have a false positive mammogram. I did have to have  a biopsy, etc. but I stayed calm and went through the process to make sure that it was nothing.
1	My husband was diagnosed with serrated polyposis and frequently has colonoscopies to manage and monitor it.  He is often still groggy from the anesthesia when his doctors come to talk to us about the findings so I've largely taken control over understanding the condition and the information the doctors tell us.
1	My mother had a stroke; the treating physician considered administering TPA to reduce the chance of further damage due to clots that blocked blood flow. I knew TPA could reduce clotting so much that bleeding could occur in the brain. I and the doctor weighed the risk of continued brain damage due to clots versus potential damage from bleeding and agreed to administer TPA. She did not suffer any additional mental episodes during that treatment.
1	I was having severe headaches for a few years. I went around to various physicians/specialists for testing and everything under the sun. I questioned all of them about whether or not my neck could be the culprit of my headaches, and they all just laughed at me. I did my research and found a physical therapist who specialized in neck issues and sure enough, it was absolutely an issue with my neck that was causing my headaches.
-1	When I was in the field we trained us how to respond a patient like doing CPR, inserting IV fluids to the patient and Emergency response situation.
1	I cannot recall any experience that has demonstrated knowledge of health or medical issues because I am not familiar with these. At least I recognize which type of doctors I have to visit in order to get correct analysis and treatment. My most recent experience involved a pain I was having in one of my shoulders for a long time. I knew I had to go see an orthopedist who checked and diagnosed me. 
-1	I do my own research on the internet and ask friends. A doctor once misdiagnosed my appendicitis. I   have an appendix that points backward instead of forward in my body, so the symptoms present were in a different location. I researched and found this information.
1	Recently my husband came home complaining that he ached all over. I realized that was probably the flu and got him to the walk-in clinic the same day. He was prescribed Tamiflu, which greatly reduced his discomfort.
1	My mother's diagnosis of a rare, life-threatening blood disease required I become familiar with several basic medical practices and procedures.
1	My most knowledgeable experience was when I had a cardiac ablation for AFib. I had done quite a bit of research on my own and my cardiologist explained everything so thoroughly that I felt I knew what was going to happen each step of the way leading to the procedure and then through recovery.
1	I had to go to the doctor once because I was having headaches and I was getting out of breath going up stairs and when I was working and I told the doctor I thought my blood pressure was too high and it was. 
1	I mean, I take very good care of myself, and I often give people nutrition and health advice. I dealt with mental illness (depression and anxiety) for years until I finally decided I needed to tackle it from all sides and finally get rid of it. This involved a great deal of research and realizing just how important physical self-care was for mental health. This was something I had neglected for years, especially in terms of sleep and nutrition. So I finally started getting enough sleep on a regular basis, eating healthy, and taking carefully selected supplements that are helpful for mental and general health, and overcame mental illness for good.
1	I was having trouble having normal sleep patterns.  I didn't drink caffeine or do anything abnormal within 6hours of my desired bed time, yet i still never could go to bed at my desired bed time.  Worst yet I would experience symptoms such as a fast heart beat, tingly feelings in my appendages and high chest pressure when I laid down.  I figured out my above normal intake of sugar, caffeine, nicotine early in the day caused this and once I stopped the nicotine and reduce consumption of caffeine and sugar the aforementioned side effects stopped.
1	I decided to visit my doctor because I had a strange birthmark on my foot that I was worried about. My doctor examined the birthmark and told me that I shouldn't worry about it. However, I felt good about my diligence. 
-1	A couple of years back I had gone in for a routine mammogram and since some abnormality was detected I was asked to undergo a biopsy which , thankfully, was found to be negative. I was glad I had this test done.
1	I was walking up a steep hill and slipped.  I fell and skid on my knees for several feet down the hill.  My knees were cut up badly and there was dirt and rocks in my knees.  Based on my previous medical knowledge I just went home, cleaned the area out with soap and water.  Scrubbed the area down really well, applied antibiotic ointment and gauze covering and it healed on it's own.

1	At my new apartment I would a sudden rash appear on my body at certain times during the day. In particular it would take place at evenings. My doctor initially diagnosed it as eczema. However what did not make sense it that why it would appear at certain times during the day.  Someone told me to give zyrtec a shot the next time it came up. I did so and within 10 minutes the rash went away. It was basically coming from the heating system of the new apartment that I had moved into. Basically I have knowledge enough to suspect whether something is eczema or tinia or something else. 
1	I was in the military and during my years in the service, I maintained a combat medic certification. This was an annual certification that required continuing education classes in order to keep up to date.
1	Many years ago, I had pneumonia that started with the flu, and ever since then, I have had annual flu shots (and, in the past decade, annual pneumonia shots as well).

1	After years of going to the allopathic doctor and getting lots of tests done and very little answers, I stopped listening to mainstream medicine and started learning about naturopathic medicine.  I felt awful and had difficultly thinking clearly often. I started taking vitamin B-12 tincture, nascent iodine, and did a parisite cleanse (which includes micro-organisms, not just the FDA's definition of a parisite), and for the first time in my life I can think clearly by default and stopped taking prescription medication for ADD.

1	My niece had made coffee using a coffee maker but forgot to place the sieve (sheet). Therefore, the coffee was highly concentrated when we drunk it. After about an hour, I felt very nervous and jittery (I was watching a football game) which I attributed to my favorite team losing, but took some time to lie down regardless. I was able to assess my true symptoms and quickly realized that this was no normal reaction â I had overdosed from caffeine. We went to the emergency room and the doctor said my quick reaction saved my life â and my niece's.
1	When my brother wrecked his motorcycle really bad and hit head, I knew for a fact to take him to the hospital because he was pretty much guaranteed to have a concussion. I was right.

I can usually help her before she even asks just by observing how she is feeilng
-1	Both when I received the news that I had fibroids and it was causing infertility issues.  I researched the best options for dealing with them and consulted my doctor after that. I cut certain things out of my diet and then had surgery. I am hopping to be able to conceive in the meet few months. 
1	Over the course of several days, I've noticed my roommate has stayed in the bathroom for long periods throwing up. His diet isn't the best, as he consumes a lot of sugary foods/drinks such as soda and candy as well as eating a lot of fast food. I told him his symptoms reminded me of someone who has acid reflux and searched online to confirm these symptoms. When he got officially diagnosed by a doctor, it was confirmed. 
-1	I was told a few years ago that I needed to have major surgery, and what the recovery process would be like afterwards. So, I remember that I researched as much as I could and I thought ahead of any questions that I could ask when I sat down for my consultation with the surgeon.

1	I was able to recognize the early stages of ADHD in my eldest child due to caring for my cousin for many years when he was younger (he had the same condition). Since I knew so much about the condition already, I was able to sidestep a lot of the pitfalls that many parents of ADHD children have to deal with, since I knew what to expect and why.
1	I know that antibiotic is only effective against bacteria infection and should be use for viral or fungus infection. When a doctor prescribe antibiotic I should continue to take the medicine until it runs out even if I feel better only after taken it for a few days.

A few minutes later I heard a loud thud and went to go check on him. The door was open and he was having a seizure on the floor. I pulled him by the shoulders out of the small bathroom and into the larger adjacent room. I elevated his head on my knees and stuck my leather wallet between his teeth. After about ten seconds or so he calmed down. He was kind of out of it so I called an ambulance for him. He was ok in the end but is now on medication.

1	When I go to the psychiatrist we often discuss medications and conditions, some of which are not even my own but I like to learn about such things. Also, when I was in the NICU with my daughter I was able to learn alot of things, we were there for awhile so I could communicate back with the doctors lingo and understand medications and conditions.
-1	I have had osteoarthritis and osteoporosis for many years.  I am on prescription medicine and osteoporosis medicine. I have researched my condition and have asked many questions of my doctors and I also do a lot of reading on the subject looking for natural supplements as well as prescription medications.
1	I was having lower ab pain. I thought it might be constipation or some other easy fixed issue. I tried several other over the counter meds to fix the issue.

Rather than going at the first feeling of discomfort I tried a few methods myself before seeking medical attention from a doctor.
-1	I have a health condition. When  I went to the er I was very knowledgable of what the doctor was asking in regards to my condition. 
1	I was having trouble going to sleep at night which is very unlike me. Usually I fall asleep within five minutes.

I stopped drinking any caffeinated beverages after 5 pm and my insomnia disappeared.
1	One example that comes immediately to mind is tracking maximum heart rate of VO2 max as it applies to active fitness.  I volunteered for a study several years ago where we measured both of these metrics over the course of several months while on a fitness regimen.  This process allowed me to learn more about how my age affects my workouts and the target heart rate I should aim for.  I also learned about oxygen levels and how that plays a large role in your fitness, specifically with cardio exercises.

1	My husband had high cholesterol, high triglycerides high blood pressure and hypothyroid. I have done a ton of research and even called experts in the fields and asked for advice. My husband would not take statins drugs. He will only take his synthroid for the hypothyroid. With diet, supplements, exercise and good advice from experts he no longer has high blood pressure or high triglycerides. I have his cholesterol in a good range which is just a hair below treatment and he feels very good. I myself only take supplements and all my tests come back normal because I believe in taking care of my health. I have the osteoporosis only and I have that under control.
-1	I take care of dependent adults with disabilities and assist them with their medications and appointments this has helped me gain a little knowledge
1	I have grown up around medical professionals, as stated earlier in the survey. There are multiple experiences that show my medical knowledge. I have learned to set IV's, give injections, learned (put never performed) a tracheotomy, and more. For one specific example, I will talk about injections. My father was diagnosed with Low-T, and given a testosterone booster (that he later dismissed and stopped taking, in lieu of his beta blockers). My brother taught me how to sterilize the injection site and my hands, properly take precautions such as gloves, and how to inject and administer the drug (through a slightly forceful, straight motion, applying the dose over a period of roughly 15 seconds into the gluteous maximus).
1	When a family member was having symptoms of a heart attack I knew they should go to the emergency room based on those symptoms. I have other family members who have heart problems, and I worry myself, so I have read a lot of information, and gained a lot of knowledge about heart disease from my doctor.

1	I had to live through my mothers cancer surgery, chemo, recovery. I was the one talking to all the doctors, and my mother was able to follow all of the instructions.
1	I really can't think of a particularly good example.  I guess recently I've been watching what I eat and working out more, and as a result I've lost fat and gained muscle mass.
1	I broke my foot a couple weeks ago. Going in I was very clear about my questions, asked about the options, and volunteered what I knew the treatment would likely be if the x-rays came back in the affirmative.

I told him that there wasn't anything they could do, I'll be told to push fluids and have him rest because it's just viral and had to run its course.

When i was in my third trimester i started feeling sick, I always felt like I had high blood pressure. I felt like I was slowly developing preeclampsia. Tests for some reason were not showing anything even though i felt all the symptoms of preeclampsia. At 39 weeks tests finally showed it and i was hospitalized and induced the same day due to severe preeclampsia. 
1	When I went to the doctor this morning he went over a number of items and I had no issues understanding them.
-1	Once a year, I usually get a very bad case of the flu and I never go to the doctor to get medication or to get a check up. I avoid going to the doctor so much and despise the thought of getting told bad news about my health that I just tough it out. It can potentially last for months at a time, and even though I know in the back of my head that if I go to the doctor's office they could probably prescribe a medication that could help me much faster than whatever is over the counter, I do not go. I know I am in the wrong and it really shows a lack of understanding when it comes to medical issues. 
1	I was on a medication that had a side effect of lowering blood pressure, and my doctor had added another medication at night that also had that side effect, which I was only to take if I wasn't at all dizzy. Since the second medication worked very well for the symptoms for which it was prescribed, I suggested possibly changing the other medication to something else, since it wasn't as good at controlling the symptoms for which it was prescribed as the new medication. My doctor agreed.

It did not add up to me because yes he had back herneiation but not typical pain from herniation so we tried many different doctors of all kinds and behold he was finally diagnosed with MS we are not completely sold on that diagnoses either so this is disconcerting as well because he isnât that mobile anymore. 
1	I worked for a medical software company and so that gave me an extended vocabulary surrounding medical conditions. Beyond that my father is diabetic and has had a heart attack.
1	I was able to assist an elderly woman who we were friends with with her blood sugar. She was getting sick and it turns out that her blood sugar was getting too high because of her sweet potato consumption. She thought only desserts and things with added sugar would spike her blood sugar.
1	I have asthma, so constantly throughout my life I have had to be very careful of my breathing so that I do not have an asthma attack, where my breathing gets super labored. I need to be mindful of my limitations so that I do not exacerbate my condition.
-1	I was have some hormonal problems and I knew through research, that I was peri-menopausal.  I feel like the knowledge I had before seeing the doctor was beneficial for me so would come up with a plan together
1	I have very little experience and knowledge of health or medical issues.  I rarely go to the doctors, only once 1 year or if I'm really sick.
1	A girl in my dance class complained that whenever she bent forward and stayed there for more than a few seconds, the blood rushed to her head and she got black spots in her vision. I told her that it was because she has low blood pressure, as the same thing happens to myself and my father for the same reason. 
1	Throughout my adult life, I have had to make many medical decisions.

-1	 I used to work in the public school system. I worked with a teacher who was a Type One diabetic. I also had a son in law at the time who was a Type One diabetic. I had witnessed my son in law's struggles with blood sugar ups and downs,and had seen him suffering from a complication of diabetes,known as Ketoacidosis. Because of my hands on experience with my son in law,I was able to recognize the signs and symptoms in the teacher I worked with,when she fell ill one day. I was able to summon help for her and give my opinion on what was going on with her in the moment,health-wise. It turned out I was correct and that she did indeed have Ketoacidosis.
-1	I guess the only time  can think of was when I was a teenager and my friends little brother cut and scraped his knee. I knew to pick him up and clean the wound and bandage it so it wouldnt scar too badly.
1	I was at get together at a friends house and her parents were there.  We were outside playing volleyball and her father started feeling dizzy and out of breath and his heat was pounding.  I thought he might be having a heat stroke, so I made sure we put cool, wet towels on his head and around the back of his neck.  It turned out that it was a heat stroke and they told me that this probably helped to not cause him more harm from this.
-1	When I sprained my knee in a third world country. I had to rely on my own and online research.  I did not have the chance to go to the doctor because of the country.
1	My boyfriend was complaining of swelling in his groin area, which was a concern due to the location.  I knew that lymph nodes were located in that area (along with several other areas of the body) and that it might just be that his body is fighting off a sickness.  Over the next few days he came down with a viral infection.
1	I used to experience severe constipation, bloating, and lethargy. I did not know why this was happening until I started to look into my diet. From there, I learned about fiber (and different types of fiber such as soluble and insoluble fiber) and I learned about the role of carbohydrates, fats, and protein (macronutrients). Since I didn't have a well-balanced diet, I constantly felt horrible and had constipation. Once I fixed my diet to include vegetables, beans, whole-grain foods, water, healthy fats, my symptoms went away and I've never felt better.
1	Three years ago i was diagnosed with severe osteoporosis. All I knew about the disease was that I did not want it. So I went online and researched extensively about the causes, treatments and prognosis. Armed with this new information I went to my doctor and we discussed in some depth what our best form of treatment should be. I then went back online and looked further, using my own research and the expertise of my doctor. We then came to a suitable treatment to best help me.

I went to a new GYN and he realized that I was insulin resistant while the other doctor missed it.
1	After the birth of my son, I noticed that his skin was unusually dry and would not retain moisture from any of the varieties of lotion that I purchased.

1	In 2013, I went deaf in one ear after blowing my nose. I waited a week to see if it would get better. It didn't. I realized the cause was actually an infection I had had a decade earlier that never completely went away. A small participle of infection had remained in my sinuses for a decade, then moved when I blew my nose. If I hadn't figured that out, and relied upon a doctor to figure it, I might have have had the infection inside my ear pop my ear drum or worse.
1	I have had a history of lower back disc issues as a result of a lifting injury about 8 years ago. I have since seen multiple back pain specialists and physical therapists and have learned how the injury ocurred and what to avoid doing in order to not re-aggravate it. As a result, I try and pass on the knowledge to other people who are dealing with similar back issues and refer them to doctors that have helped improve my condition. 
1	In 1995, I came down with an extreme flu-like illness that I almost died from. Several years later, after researching the information online and talking with my doctor, i came to the conclusion that i had Hanta-virus due to living in close quarters with a field mouse that infected me. 
1	My last place of employment did not even have a basic first aid kit. I carried a trauma kit in my car. So, anyone that had a minor injury came to me for assistance.
1	As mentioned before, I grew up in a family of doctors--my mother is a family physician and my father is an emergency physician.  I have degrees in psychology and social work and have worked in the health field for a long time. Not only that, but my children have recently had some medical issues that have forced me to use my knowledge. 
1	I do not have a lot of experience because i have been pretty healthy my whole life. My parents have only had a few issues that I know about 
1	My daughter had a urinary tract infection and I could tell by the pain in her urination.

We went to the doctor anyway to confirm and were told to do exactly as I thought.
1	When I was in high school I dislocated my elbow and could not afford physical therapy so I had to do it myself. The exercises and stretches were painful but appropriate in learning to use my arm again

1	I knew I had GERD after realizing that some over-the counter medications were no longer effective in treating my symptoms.  had also noticed that something as simple as drinking a glass of water too fast would trigger heart burn and a great deal of discomfort. 
1	I lift weights 3 days per week and do 4+ total hours of cardio per week, in addition to walking at least 7 hours per week (I have a desk job, so even though I'd like more than that, I am content with 7). I do this because I understand muscle mass is important, and can be harder to put on as one ages. Also, strength training can help with bone density, which is useful especially as women age. I also want good cardiovascular health. This is all because people in my family tend to live to be quite old (my great-grandmother is 96!), but not necessarily with a great quality of life, and I want to have a great quality of life as I age.
1	I was at the doctor's office and they were explaining to me what it meant to have high blood pressure, the potential complications that it can cause, and what I need to change in my life in order to get my blood pressure under control. I understand all of the information they gave to me, I implemented it and I had a normal blood pressure reading 6 months later at my next visit.
1	After suffering many broken bones I was able to diagnose thy I had a shattered finger bone after slipping at work and also tore two tendons (did not diagnose that) but could tell by the level of pain I was experiencing that a bone in fact was broken
-1	When I was at the doctors he was explaining my condition in vast detail and I understood every part and asked a technical question about it and he was able to fill me in on the more hard parts. Like the likelyhood of certain medications to cause elevated blood calcium.
1	I was told that I have some salt deposits on my kidneys. I drink quite a bit of water now so that I can avoid getting more deposits or worse yet kidney stones.
-1	I've helped others with mental illness. I've had pretty unique experiences with mental health that has led me to advising others. Answering questions for people. 
1	I have supported my parents through many difficult and challenging medical issues. Ensuring that I stayed engaged in all discussions regarding care and treatment plans with their doctors and nurses when hospitalized has created my understanding and I've honed it with independent research and support from friends and family.
1	I cannot think of a time in my life where I had the chance to demonstrate my medical knowledge except to apply it to my daily life and try to keep myself as healthy as possible. 
1	When I correctly thought I had hyperhidrosis, went to the doctor and then he told me that's exactly what it was. One of the few times WebMD didn't make me super anxious and calmed my nerves.

The one thing they do know I have is Hashimoto's auto immune thyroid and even though it hasn't been confirmed yet, I believe my stroke was caused by my Hashi's because it causes me to have afib sometimes.

I went to different doctors several times a month to see if they can heal me, but none was able to help me. I am desperate. This has caused everything around me up side down. 
1	Iâm not great at health things. I just have a liking for math and if a medical issue equates to a math problem, I can usually figure it out. Percentages and chances are math equations. 
1	I was found to have a curve in the spine so I had to go and get more test done and pictures were taken to determine the severity of the curve and whether or not I would need a brace or surgery.

1	When my Grandma was having an issue with her blood pressure (low, fainting) and my other family members were rushing around trying to find ways to get her to be responsive, I knew enough that she should be placed flat on the ground (an incline would've been better but wasn't available) with her knees up and held up and feet flat on the floor. This would raise her blood pressure, and in a few moments she became responsive. We still called 911, but she was responsive and alert for it, rather than having a dangerously low blood pressure.

1	I started having a sore throat during the week at work. I knew it could be from exercising outdoors, that I needed to clean my fan, I had some type of cold or strep throat. As I weeded out the issues, I knew it had to either be a cold or strep throat. Once it really got sore, I was able to look in the mirror and see that my throat was really red and took myself to the doctor because I knew I had strep throat. I also woke up the next day (because I could not get into the doctor the same day) almost swallowing my uvula every time I swallowed. I was correct I had strep throat.

I was able to maintain healthy glucose levels and stay off of insulin during the pregnancy.  
1	I honestly don't think there's any specific moment in my life where I have demonstrated a knowledge of health or medical issues that would be noteworthy.

When I called the midwife, I requested to be transferred to the hospital because I thought I had preeclampsia. Upon testing, the staff found that I did in fact have preeclampsia.
1	Someone was saying they were guaranteed not to get the flu since they'd had the flu vaccine. I had to explain that having the flu vaccine could reduce the probably of getting the flu significantly, but they could not say they were never going to get the flu. It would be less likely, but could still happen.

Years later, I had a friend who one time who pulled the same muscle in the yard but he was thinking he was having a heart attack. He was panicking in fear but I calmed him down and told him to let me take a look. I placed two fingers and a thumb on the location of his chest and pushed hard. It put him in even more pain which told me he pulled the same muscle as I did and it relaxed him and made him feel at ease. That was a time in which I was able to help calm a worrying friend and demonstrate my knowledge of health and medical issues.

I was able to keep calm and handle this situation because of the knowledge I possess.
1	My mother has several health issues (along with being a bit of a hypochondriac) and I have been to several doctor appointments with her to manage her paperwork and explain things she doesn't understand. 
1	I have had four children.  I feel like I am a specialist in pregnancy.  I am also an elementary teacher, so I also feel like I am a nurse most days.
1	I have been trying to reduce the amount of sugar in my diet. I have read that eating a lot of carbohydrates just turns right into sugar which can upset the bodies blood sugar balance to the point that it is much worse for you than fat. (As long as not excessive fat) So I have reduced carbohydrates as much as I can besides just the basic recommended level. I also try to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables to get necessary micro nutrients. I also have cut back significantly on the amount of red meat that I eat and have replaced it with chicken or pork. Some weeks all I feel like I eat is chicken and broccoli. I also try to exercise regularly and get in a moderate jog/run to exercise my cardiovascular system. I also monitor my weight to make sure to notice any changes or patterns and to drink more water.

1	My son had a fever over 102 degrees at less than 1 month old.  I went to an urgent care, and then the emergency room for service, as this was a very unsafe temperature for child so young.  When I was in college, I had meningitis.  He was presenting similar issues, so I approved a lumbar puncture as well as a urine sample, blood sample, and sinus culture.  He was diagnosed with viral meningitis and given fluids in hospital.
1	I have low iron. I've been able to raise my levels by changing my diet and limiting items that cause issues with iron.
-1	I really don't know what to write because I don't really have very much knowledge of heath or medical issues.  I guess I try to eat healthy.  There was one time where I had to take care of a wound that my husband had.  The nurse on base showed me how to change his dressings and I did until he was all healed up.  That is really the only thing I can think off.  When I go to the grocery store I pay attention to nutrition labels and try to avoid foods with added sugar, too much salt, and loads of carbs.  Fat is ok because we are doing the keto diet right now.
1	Once I was visiting a parent who just had surgery. They were still waiting to be seen by the doctor post-operatively.

1	My daughter was born with gastroschisis.  I did a lot of research on it, so by the time she was born I was well aware of what to look out for, what to ask the doctors, and what things to be worried about. She was in the hospital for over a month, and during the time the staff was constantly making comments about how well versed I was in my daughter's condition. It made me feel more comfortable going home with her when she was discharged knowing that I had learned so much about her condition and was comfortable knowing when something didn't seem right or if it was something that was normal for babies with this condition. 
1	I need to decide when to take my husband to the hospital when he had appendicitis.  I forced him to go when I felt his stomach and it was swollen in the same spot they always show when describing appendicitis. 
1	I recently was on a flight to Philadelphia when the very pregnant woman in the aisle across from me tried to stand up and fainted, ending up in the aisle. I put my jacket under her head, loosened her coat and took her pulse which was slightly fast. I saw no signs of contractions in her belly and chalked the episode up to being too warm, possible dehydration and a drop in her blood pressure when she stood up too quickly. After a few moments she came to and after a drink of water, she was able to return to her seat and comfortably finish the flight.

I told him that if he stopped smoking they would start to work again.
1	I don't think that I have a good understanding of medical issues, but through nutrition education in college feel that I have a solid grasp of health issues, meaning I know how to maintain my health. I exercise almost every day and eat a healthful, balanced diet. I monitor my health and rarely get sick.
1	Around two years ago I received lab work that my blood pressure was on the higher end. I consulted with my physician and decided to reduce sodium intake and exercise more often. A year later for my next check up my levels had fallen back into normal range.

Two years later, I'm still here so I'm guessing I demonstrated a knowledge of health or medical issues correctly. 
1	When I got a concussion, I knew the symptoms to look for and when to go to the emergency room. I had enough medical knowledge about concussions to know when to seek help.
-1	When I first graduated college I worked in a Hospital  in the Chemistry Lab performing lab test. I did hematology and chemistries on human blood.
1	Based upon my symptoms, nasal congestion, temperature, and lethargy, I can figure out if I need to go to the doctor or if I just need to stay home. I am able to make an education decision about if I need perception medication or if over the counter medications will be helpful.  
1	Earlier this year, I accurately diagnosed my acute bronchitis. I have had it frequently enough over my life to understand the barking cough and wheezing, and when I told the doctor, she said I was right on the money. It was viral, so there was nothing I could do except stay hydrated.
1	I was enrolled in a medical class in high school and I passed the class with an A. It's the only experience that demonstrates my health knowledge because I do not go to the doctors often.

-1	Before I was diagnosed with Achalasia the doctors kept insisting it was all in my head and that I was just suffering from Bulimia because I was overweight. After much research into Bulimia I realized there was no chance that was my problem because I was not able to binge eat, I couldn't eat more than 5 bites of something before regurgitating food on some days as the disease progressed. I did the research and approached doctors about the possibility of something else being wrong with me and they all ignored me. After seeing several specialists one finally listened to me and agreed the previous diagnoses were completely inaccurate. 
-1	I am very into the natural way of living. I see a guy who is into Ayurvedic healing and he has helped grow my knowledge as to what exactly happens in your body. Most issues start in the gut. So I guess I demonstrate my knowledge when I am dealing with my own health concerns.

-1	One time along time ago when I was a little kid I had to go to the doctor for measles and the doctor thought it was chicken pox but I knew it wasn't so I explained what I knew and how I knew it and why so we could get the correct diagnosis. I think knowing and researching some yourself to help self diagnosis is a major help as doctors are human too and may not always have the correct idea based on your description of the symptoms you are experiencing  and could lead to mistakes being made early in the discussion.
1	When my son had eczema, the doctor just wanted to give him steroid cream and told me there's usually no cure. Instead I had him tested for allergies and found he was allergic to tree nuts. Once we eliminated tree nuts from his diet, the eczema disappeared and has never returned.

1	I have been getting migraines for years.  I did some research and was disappointed to find that they don't know exactly what causes them and that there is really no cure.  I started taking excedrin regularly.  I also had a facial intense pulsed light ipl treatment that made me have migraines nearly every day.  I went to the chiropracter because I though my posture and neck alignment may be contributing to neck tension and pain.  This could be leading to frequent headaches.  I wanted to continue with the chiropracter but I cannot at this time due to money issues.  I started getting what I believe were intenstinal ulcers from the excedrin, particularly the NSAIDs.  It put me in extreme pain and cramping for days which I could not get rid of.  I went to see an emergency doctor who gave me pills to stop the cramps in my intenstine.  My sister had the same issue a few years later.  I found out my whole family gets migraines at a family reunion.  I started doing more research and found out inflammation could be a cause.

1	I recently moved and therefore, had no doctor.  I twisted my ankle very badly.  The pain was excruciating and the bruising encompassed my entire foot and went well up my leg.  I didn't really want to pay an ER bill so I took a wait and see attitude.  I felt safe in doing so because I could move my toes a little, and because I did get a little better daily.  I was soon confident that I had no broken bones.  My husband had a 50 percent tendon tear in the past, and knowing what that was like, and how it was treated helped.

I had remembered reading about certain signs the body gives away that are an indication of other issues during my studying in the medical field.

He told me that I was absolutely right. 
1	My mother was recently treated for breast cancer and just had her third of four chemotherapy sessions. She was initially told that she would not need chemo at all and would just have to do radiation to lower the rate of recurrence after the tumor and a lymph node was removed, and then a month later she had to very quickly reschedule, messing up work and therefore putting her insurance at risk. All of the complaints I've given you so far are incredibly fresh in my mind.

1	I was diagnosed with a fibrocystic adenoma at 16.  Before I received the diagnosis, I was told by two doctors that it was just a cyst.

1	My husband has type 2 diabetes so I had to learn how to help him manage it to keep his blood sugar under control.  I had to learn about the condition and also about the signs to look for when his sugar is too high or too low.
1	My wife felt lumps in her breast. From my medical knowledge I knew that the firm nodule tha was easily moved was likely a cyst. The other one had a chance to be malignant so she had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. I could see during the X-rays that the lump was not characteristic of a cancer. Then, during ultrasound I could see the round black hole on the screen indicating all lumps wee cysts. Was able to relieve both me and the wife while we waited for the radiologist to tell us the same thing.

-1	I went to and graduated from nursing school. That's not enough characters, so I'll add that it was a hospital school (they're long gone) so I'm a diploma nurse. I graduated in 1974 and left nursing in 1985.
1	An experience would be when I was hospitalized for appendicitis. I learned a lot being in the hospital that one time. What I should expect from the doctors and what needs to be done while I am there. 
-1	The only time I can think of is the case where I had to go to three different doctors for several tests because they couldn't figure out what was wrong.
1	I knew when I was pregnant the first morning after I had conceived because I felt different upon my walk to work the next morning. It seemed as though everything I was used to doing took a lot of extra effort. I kept this to myself for several weeks until I was able to take a test and confirm that my personal diagnose was correct.
-1	When I was pregnant, I would get a little sick to my stomach everyday, not just in the mornings.  By my 3rd pregnancy, I knew exactly what to take everyday to help me feel not so sick everyday.  I also knew certain foods to eat that would help.
1	I had an injured finger amNd after doing some research determined that I had a âdroppedâfinger.  The nurse practitioner just said âI donât know what to do for you or what is wrong with your finger.  After waiting 3 weeks to see a specialist, the specialist told me that I had a âdroppedâ finger.
-1	My experience of health issues with doctors is that they are only in the profession for money.  Caring and morals seem to go out the window.
-1	I was on a medication prescribed by my doctor.  I got severe constipation with in days of starting the drug.  I looked up the side effects, and saw that constipation was one of them, so I followed up with my doctor for advice.

-1	THE LAST TIME I WAS AT THE DOCTOR I WAS DIAGNOSISED WITH HEART BURN. I HAVE BEEN DIADNOISED WITH THIS BEFORE SO I WAS AWARE OF THE SYMTOMS
1	When my oldest child recently became ill and had a high fever we could not get to go down, my knowledge of health issues helped. I knew to not be very concerned when his fever stayed at 102, and he continually kept liquids down, but grew concerned when the fever reached 104. I called our doctor and he agreed with me on what we should do next to get the fever down. He wanted me to call back if it didn't work, but to try avoiding the eremgency room if possible with the flu outbreak locally. My minor knowledge with health and medical issues helped me be able to care for my son appropriately and help him stay as comfortable as possible at home. 
1	when I was a child my mother was going to nursing school and i would always be around when she was studying.
1	I was in the first gulf war. My humvee rolled over a land mine. I was in the air and hit the ground hard. I crawled to the vehicle. My gunner had suffered a leg injury. He was bleeding from lots of shrapnel.  I stopped the bleeding and got him through a rough time until another unit arrived.
1	I really can't think of a situation. I depend on my doctor for info. If I don't know something I seek out resources to help me.
1	Two years ago I had my first UTI. I understood the symptoms as everyone knows the basic symptom of pain while peeing as well as the frequent feeling of having to go to the bathroom. Instead of having to go to the doctors I called the 24 hour nurse service and told them I believed that I had a UTI. I then asked for the antibiotics and after confirming I had the specific symptoms I was approved. I didn't need to go to a doctor for this because I understood the symptoms that I was having 
1	I went to college for five years to become a clinical laboratory scientist. We learned a lot about the different disorders that affect the blood cells and other bodily fluids. We did not learn as much on the symptoms or treatments for all disorders. I feel working in this field now for the past year and seeing the patients in a clinic setting has helped me to learn more and more everyday that I come in to work.  
1	Well, when my dad was sick, I attended many of his doctors appointments, chemo treatments, etc. with him. I feel as if I picked up a lot during that time. When it came time for my dad to enter the hospice program, I was able to take care of him myself and home, albeit with the help of a nurse and other family members. I administered medications to help keep him relaxed and comfortable. I turned him in his bed to try to keep him from getting bedsores. When he developed shingles, I kept him as clean and comfortable as possible. I understood what medicines he was on and what they were doing to and for him. I knew enough to understand the process that was taking place inside his body. Sometimes I wish I hadn't. 
1	My mother or father sometimes ask me side effects of a certain medication (assuming it is not written on the container). I can use an online database to find out information about that medication.

1	I rold this one You are an inmate in a concentration camp. A sadistic guard is about to hang your son who tried to escape and wants you to pull the chair from underneath him. He says that if you donât he will not only kill your son but some other innocent inmate as well. You donât have any doubt that he means what he says. What should you do?
1	I really don't have much experience with health issues.  i just paid attention in high school health class. Sometimes I read articles online if I feel curious about the subject.
1	This is a weird and difficult question to answer. I went through a period of 6 months where my doctors believed I had early onset rheumatory arthritis. They subjected me to a battery of tests and I learned what each of them did beforehand. I've always understood how to properly administer my medication or follow doctor's orders as well. 
1	When I went to the Emergency Department at UF Shands, the doctor assigned to me was unconvinced that I needed to be admitted. I told him that if he did not admit me and dismissed me, that I would be back the next day due to adrenal crisis. He discharged me and I had to come back the next day. The condition worsened. Asshole.
1	Well about 10 years ago I experienced a staph infection on my leg that needed to be treated.  At the time I the cost to have it treated was well beyond my means as I was between jobs and my co-pay was infeasible. Luckly I knew to process of dealing with such an infection was to remove the core from the boil, disinfect the wound, place a drain, then cover it up and request some antibiotics.  I was able to lance the boil and do all the treatment work (I have a very high tolerance for pain) and requested my doctor prescribe some antibiotics.  When I arrived at the office he examined the treated wound and told me he was impressed I was able to do that myself and that it looked as good as the work he would have done.  He did suggest I let a professional do it next time as I could have hurt myself but still I managed to treat it myself.
-1	I've had issues where my tongue gets inflamed and swollen for reasons I still do not understand. Most doctors look at my tongue and focus on the top portion. I have what is called a geographical tongue. It has an odd design and looks cracked and spaced apart on the surface, kind of like the landmasses on the earth. Most doctors have not even heard of this and focus on that, as though it is part of, or the reason for the inflammation. This is one area in which I actually know more than the doctors, and frustrates me when they wont listen to my explanation. 
1	I demonstrated knowledge of medical issues when I was explaining to a tennis student of mine what tendonitis is. It is something I have had in past playing as often as I do and I very comfortable explaining what it is. 
1	When my first son was a small toddler I started to notice tiny painless bumps on various parts of his body. After doing some pretty extensive research online I was pretty sure that the bumps were caused by a harmless virus & it was molluscum contagiosum. Sure enough, the next time I took him to the doctor she came to the same conclusion. A year later my other son developed the same bumps. I was able to immediately identify what it was and was able to get rid of them based on my prior knowledge.
-1	An example is i know the flu is a virus and has to run its course but why the doctor wrote a prescription for my 3 year old to take a prescription and told me got her to take it because it will take her flu away.

-1	My grandmother had dibeties and when I was 17 she went to get her toe nails cut by her podiatrist. He cut her toenail too short and she developed an infection. I was able to clean her foot, apply ointment and dressed her wound. I did this for a few days with no improvement. When I went to do the same thing the next day, it clearly was getting worse. I advised my grandmother that it looks like gangrene and she should go get it checked. She did and was admitted to the hospital for gangrene. They would normally take the toe but because of her age they highly recommended we didn't opt for that solution. They ended up injecting her with some type of solution and gave her an antibiotic and dressed the wound. Whatever they did stopped the infection and she lived for two more years after that incident and passed away due to other reasons unrelated to the toe 
-1	I diagnosed myself of having low thyroid by doing research online. I compared my symptoms and presented it to my doctor who did a blood test and confirmed. 
1	A few years ago, my dad was having some stomach pains.  My mom and I took him to the doctor that specialized in stomach and related issues.  It seemed like we filled out paperwork for awhile.  It was a lot to it.  Later, my dad was diagnosed with having pancreatic cancer.  That lead to him to having surgery which went well.  From then on, both mom and me helped him to recover and do everything that the doctor told us to do to help my dad.
-1	When my husband was sick and had to be taken to hospital three different times it was helpful to understand some of the information more after each visit.
1	I cut myself on accident at work and properly took care of the wound by cleaning it and covering it bandages.
1	I hate math! Never was good at it. I demonstrated knowledge when my son was recently life flighted to UNC Chapel Hill for an emergency shunt surgery. He purged and a Resident wanted to do an MRI on him again. I tried to explain with projectile vomiting and laying a kid on his back he could aspirate. The young Resident exclaimed that to put the shunt in he had to guide it with CT. This was the first time I had heard of that. He got sassy with me. I told him the machine would need to be closed down if it got vomit all over it. Eventually I got the charge nurse and I told the young Doctor to be that he was off the case. The Head of his Department came to us and said we were right, my child could aspirate if left on his back in that MRI. (He cannot sit up alone as it is.) I have to advocate all the time or things can be dangerous.
1	I had cancer eleven years ago. I learned a lot about side effects and how to control them. I also learned a lot about different medications.
1	My grandpa was diagnosed with cancer, and because of my education and the research I have done on my own, I was able to give him research-based information.  I helped him with nutrition-related recommendations, since that is where my education focuses.  With my help, he was able to maximize his intake and maintain a good weight.  He ultimately survived longer than was expected.
1	In college I though I had a hickey from a girl on my neck for about a week and I could not figure out why it would not heal.  I went to the dr for strep throat and brought up the mark and turned out it was ring worm

1	A few months ago I was lifting something that was too heavy and I heard a popping sound in one of my hamstrings. I could tell right away that I tore a hamstring based upon the sound that my hamstring made. I knew that I had to see a doctor to see the extent of it.
-1	My mom has always had health problems and was always in and out of the hospitals. I learned a lot by listening and asking questions.
1	Let's take flu shots.  I have opted out of getting a flu shot.  I have never had one before, however this year I was tempted.  I understand that the flu shot is only about 17-18% effective in preventing the flu.  This number is not very high.  I also understand what they are telling us is that even if we get the flu, the severity would be reduced if we were to get a flu shot.  Since the flu appears so prevalent this year I am tempted, but I have taken the recommendations into consideration, along with the stats and have decided I would take my chances again this year and not get a flu shot. We'll see what next year brings.  
-1	My knowledge of health issue in my life that I was aware of is food combinations that give indications that there may be a serious problem... but it just eating the wrong foods together.
-1	My son experienced aversions at a very young age to many fabrics, and other sensory experiences. After the years of doctor visits to neorologists for so many of my own neurological problems I was able to see correlating patterns between he and I. I was able to get him seen by a developmental pediatrician much sooner than I would have were I unexperienced in such matters. I consequently obtained a diagnosis that allowed me to request specialized services at school at the earliest possible grade. As well, I was able to help at least 2 friends see that their kids had some issues or symptoms that similarly called for a more proactive approach with their respective healthcare resources than if I hadn't pointed it out. 
1	I have had 2 children.  I was 40 years old with the first child and so I was subject to extra testing.  Now I have a chronic condition and use medication to control it.  I try to read articles on health and medicine on a regular basis.
1	Mother was diagnosed with SLE. Was told that ANA and dsDNA titers came back positive as well as reactive C protein.

After continual therapy ANA and dsDNA titers are undetectable thus indicating remission.  
1	I know that albuterol helps open the lungs during an asthma attack. I also know how to stagger medications of tylenol and motrin every three hours when fighting a fierce flu fever.
-1	I am able to tell which kind of sickness i have. I can get my own medicine that is right for the symptoms. Don't need a doctor all off the time 
1	I was in a car accident which left my back hurting.  I have done one month of physical therapy and the doctor asked if I thought going back to it would help and if not what would I want to do next.  I said the physical therapy wasnt going to work the way I need it to and suggested the pain management next.
1	I don't think I have an experience that demonstrates my knowledge of health.  I did not take and classes related to medicine nor go to medical school.  I do not pretend to know about topics I don't know about.  When I have anything I see as a possible health issue I seek professional help.
-1	There's been times where I was at the hospital and I was already suspecting myself to have POTS. I told them about how my heart rate increases when standing, among other things, and the doctors just told me that I had panic disorder and wouldn't listen to me. Lo and behold, I was right and it was an incident where I knew more than the doctors. 
1	I am a type 1 diabetic and have been for the last eleven years. While my self care hasn't been the best, it is getting more and more under control as I learn how to best manage my lifestyle and the needs of my condition.

1	I donât really have any of these experiences.  I rarely get sick and very unfamiliar with medical terminology and conditions.
1	I developed a severe case of hives all over my body that required 3 trips to the ER.  I was 45 and never had hives before, my DR insisted it was something I ate, I knew it wasn't.  I went over the previous day and figured out that I had brought a big bunch of sunflowers to work and had the AC on in recirculate the air and I breathed in all that pollen,  took her a few days but she agreed with me
1	When I gained a lot of weight due to some medication that I had been prescribed, I wanted to lose it.

I went to a different hospital and they agreed.  I was immediately admitted for my condition and it ended up saving my life.
1	Well for a long time I kept getting a burning in my chest. Doctor and I were not sure what was causing it. Initially we both thought it was bronchitis as I also had trouble breathing. After inhalers and steroids didn't help, we thought it might be heartburn, as I've had history of acid reflux and stomach issues. So after being on prilosec for a bit, I noticed I still had the burning in my chest. It was then I noticed that it occurred when my heartrate went up. So after informing my Doctor of this, we knew it was heart related, and pin pointed the issue. 
1	Last winter I slipped on ice and fell hard. For nearly a month I walked around in a CVS splint while everyone told me to go to the doctor and get it checked out. The swelling had gone down and the pain was not so bad so I was convinced it was a bad sprain .. except for it didnt get better. Finally I went to get it looked at and instantly the doctor knew my wrist was broken. He thought I was an idiot basically. I ended up getting a plate and screws put in and was lucky I didnt wait longer because it had to be rebroken and reset. Duh.

-1	My personal experience with rare conditions, 1 taking 5 years to diagnose. Also caretaking a dear friend that passed of cancer and others I care about trying to help.
1	My life in general is a constant experience regarding medical knowledge and issues.

Ignorance is not bliss, it is deadly.
-1	From my pharmacy experience, I was able to notice that a relative, who was suddenly having issues after beginning a medication, was given two contraindicated medications that interact with each other.
1	An experience that I knew about my health problem was with my scoliosis issue. My ribs frequently come out of place which is why I see a DO. Seeing the chiropractor is also an issue, and while I am aware of the pros and cons of seeing a chiropractor, it is not covered by my insurance. I know how to do stretches and exercises that help my scoliosis and have discussed this with my primary care physician. 
1	"I am actually in a more ""extreme"" situation than most people right now because I unfortunately had to become my husband's caregiver at a young age (28)... He shot himself in the head and is now quadriplegic. I have had to learn a great deal about how to care for a person in his condition, physical and occupational therapy, (mental health therapy for myself), medicines, diagnoses, possible future outcome, etc. all within the past year and in a very short amount of time. I wish I wouldn't be in the position to have had to learn all of these things in this kind of circumstance but it definitely has taught me a lot."

When I found out 20 years ago that I had a nodule on my thyroid I totally trusted the doctor and DID not do any of my own research and 10 years later after believed I was cured I found out I was in permanent A Fib so from then on I have research EVERY time I have been diagnosed with any condition and you wouldn't even believe what I went through to get treatment for cataracts and epi retinal membrane......
1	I was able to understand what my doctor was saying. I was familiar with  the drugs given which was found helpful at the pharmacy as well.
1	When I worked in a skilled nursing facility as an occupational therapy assistant, I often had to assist patients in daily activities that would improve their overall health and well being.  Often times, I would explain how these activities were beneficial to their health whether it be through diet, exercise, or teaching them different techniques to ensure their safety.  
1	I have visited the hospital when my mother was seriously ill and was able to converse with her doctors to determine her statistical prognosis of going into remission

In three months, we reduced carbohydrate intake and adhered to foods lower on the hypoglycemic index. This was coupled with an emphasis on water and diet drinks as opposed to normal soft drinks with sugar. After the three month period, her average three month blood sugar was reduced to about 150 mgs.

1	When I brought my child to the doctor and she was diagnosed with pneumonia and/or bronchial disease. I had little knowledge about the different and when she was explaining it I thought I knew what she was saying. But then I was trying to explain that to someone else and I felt lost. The doctor thought that she was explaining it well but maybe I was just not understanding.
1	I researched a lot into chronic rhinitis before going to the doctor for the fifth time or so.  When I was there, based on what I read I thought that what the doctor was advising me to take didn't make much sense because I know that I don't have allergies and past antihistimines haven't helped me, so I asked if something might be better than that.  He gave me something different, which didn't help either unfortunately.  
1	I'm not exactly sure what experience to write about, but about 10 years ago, I stopped eating meat. I was quite concerned about getting enough protein, iron, and vitamin b12, so I planned my diet in a way that I would get the nutrients I need and remain healthy. I ate a diverse diet and made sure I had at least the recommended amount of each most days. When I had to get a blood test done 5 years later, everything was normal. I'd like to think that the care I took about planning my meals contributed to that. 
-1	I have. Food allergies one day my friend was feeling bad I saw all the signs of food allergy I shot her up with my episode pen 
1	Taking care of spouses who had diabetes taught me a lot about the disease. I lived with one husband who had Type 1, juvenile diabetes. It claimed his life when he was 53 years old because he did not adhere to established guidelines for people with Type 1. I learned about the differences between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and about the Isles of Langerhorn in the pancreas which produce insulin. I learned that a person can be producing too little insulin or the insulin being produced is not being metabolized correctly. I also learned how to help someone in insulin shock which is not the same as diabetic coma.

1	When I had an ankle injury in college, athletic trainers helping me with that injury kept recommending ice, compression, and water running to keep fitness.

1	When my grandmother was being examined by a neurologist he made her stand up and close her eyes and try to remain balanced. She could not keep her balance. We knew that her spinal cord was inflamed and I concluded that her cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that controls balance may also be affected.

I had to go to a Gastroenterology specialist because it was determined it might be a GERD issues that might be causing this my throat issue.  I had three procedures where my throat was opened up, but the Dr. could quite figure out what was going on as each endoscopy was returning nothing that could explain the obstruction. I started doing research on possible causes one possible cause took my attention. I knew because of other unrelated testing, that my iron was low, and in my research, a possible cause showed that low iron could be responsible for webs forming in the throat area. During my follow up meeting I asked the Dr. about this and after he ordered additional blood work, he confirmed that it was my iron-levels were the reason for the obstruction. He prescribed iron and I have not had to go back since.

I've never had an experience that I would say demonstrated high knowledge of medical science.
-1	When my mother had the flu I helped take care of her, making sure she took not too much Tylenol and gave her plenty of fluids, etc.
1	When my best friend was having a problem, he thought it might be an STD or some other infection. I told him about my own experience with prostatitis.

Sure enough, when he went to the doctor for an exam, they eventually reached the conclusion that his prostate was inflamed.
1	The only real main surgical procedure that I've ever had done was a repair of my rotator cuff.  The surgery also cleaned up some cartilage that was floating around and shave down some bone spurs.  The procedure went with no problems and the doctor was very accurate when he told me the expected recovery time and any potential issues that may popup.  Within 6 months I was 90% recovered and by 18 months I felt 100% again.

It was very disturbing because I didn't know what my outcome was going to be. However, I was able to make it there on time and get sorted out while the doctors giving me prescription to help ease the pain.

1	A few years ago during a stressful time in my life, my weight rose to 180 pounds.  I decided that I needed to make some changes in my life.  I started with tracking my meals in a food log on my phone and taking a daily measurement of my weight.  After a few weeks, I was able to determine that I was consuming far too many calories and that most of those extra calories came from a few empty calorie sources.  Over the course of the next few months, I slowly adjusted my diet, cutting out many empty calories and trying to add more nutrient dense foods.  After I year, I had lost 30 pounds and have been able to maintain a weight of around 150 pounds for the last few months.
1	The more often a person is prescribed antibiotics the less effective they will be.  When I do have sinusitis that is bad enough to make me actually see a doctor (feeling like I am dying) I have to tell them not to bother writing a script for amoxicillin because I won't bother filling it as it will not work, it's like eating a bottle of Tic Tacs for me at this point.
1	At my age I am regularly scanned for colon cancer. It is common. While many people avoid it, I understand that avoiding it can cause rectal or colon cancer.  If detected early it is treatable.  I go every 5 years. I took one at 50 and 55

The pharmacy I visit has my health information on file.  After turning it in, I was called to the front and informed the medicine was in the same family as penicillin.  I had no idea what that meant.  The pharmacist explained that I was probably allergic to it.  I was so mad! I had told the doctor what I was allergic to! If the pharmacist hadnât warned me, I could have been in big trouble. So mad!

1	"My grandmother was 87 yo and in need of a hip replacement.  Her maternal longivity history included an aunt who lived to 107 and her grandmother who lived to 100.  Her primary care doctor did not want to recommend a hip replacement surgery because of the HMO ""at risk"" plan she had.  I accompanied my grandmother to her physician, explained I understood his reasoning for not recommending the surgery and asking him to reconsider or I would take her case to the state board.  She received the surgery and turned 108 in December 2017.  The new hip has lasted 20 years."
1	I had done some reading about medical robotics before I actually saw any actual footage. So when I looked at the footage, I was able to identify what tools and what process was being done. It was fascinating to see what I had only beforehand read about in front of me.

My mother's mother was a diabetic and I remember as a child, she had her leg amputated. My father died of cirrhosis of the liver at age 69, my mother died from a stroke at age 61. My younger sister (age 62) is blind from the effects of sugar diabetes. My brother died in 1999 at the age of 39 from cirrhosis of the liver. With all this going on, I've always been aware that I want to be healthy. It's not easy. I weight 184, 5 foot 2, work at a very physical job which benefits me. I have good teeth, get around good, except for my weight.

1	Having a baby definitely made me more knowledgeable. From start to finish, I learned about my changing body and building a baby inside of me.

You learn a lot becoming a parent so it definitely makes you pretty familiar with medical issues.

-1	I could write a novel here.  There is no one experience, rather a conglomeration of them, from dealing with ill large and small livestock and dogs in a farm setting where the vet leaves you with drugs and iv's to make judgement calls and administer yourself,  to having many of my own injuries to being a caregiver for both parents, to breaking my own neck.  I am, sadly, very wise to the obvious workings of the human body, from how it responds to colds to cancer and 3rd degree full thickness burns.  When I make a judgment call on a medical issue I am usually, but not always right, be it for myself, or another.

But I've kept my husband alive through 30 years of a still-undiagnosed progressive neuromuscular disorder (he was diagnosed at first with ALS, and it looks a lot like that). I've taken him to emergency for what's turned out to be pericarditis, and for TIAs. I talk to his doctors. He's still alive, so there's that.
1	"I have had to advocate most of all my life for my early onset medical problems at a young age. I had to speak to that ten percent of those medical staff who were apathetic, disinterested, and hateful about not giving me certain medications that caused my health problems to get worse. I am glad that I learned from a few other ""good"" and honest doctors to 'gently' research my conditions and medications that I take."

1	One experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues involved a group of friends and myself hanging out. The guys in the group were being rambunctious and wrestling inside the house (something which was not recommended). At one point, one of the guys tripped and fell hitting his head on the corner of the television. It immediately began bleeding and he was unsure as to what he should do so he immediately came to me. My suggestion was to first stop the bleeding (apply slight pressure to the area), check his cognitive functioning/vision, and make sure he didn't fall asleep, and stay positive/encouraging so he would not panic. After a little while the bleeding stopped and we further assessed his state. I gave him ibuprofen and continued to monitor his state for the next couple of hours making sure that he knew we could go to the hospital if need be.

We also came up with an exercise plan, where my family member joined a gym and went multiple times a week. He lost a lot of weight and felt a lot better overall. His blood test numbers improved at the doctor.
1	Every time that I see a new doctor I have to explain my traumatic brain injury and the effect it has had on my life.

1	One time in life that demonstrated my knowledge about medical issues is when I made a home remedy to kill my cold. I use peroxide, lemon juice,  baking soda,  and some salt.

-1	"This whole survey hurt my brain I can't take anymore. Algebra ahh Here's some random crap off the internet Medicine (British English Listeni/ËmÉdsáµ»n/; American English Listeni/ËmÉdáµ»sáµ»n/) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.[1][2] The word ""medicine"" is derived from Latin medicus, meaning ""a physician"".[3][4] Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.[5] Medicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is ""variable and inconsistent"" for any condition,[6] but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.[7] In contrast, treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery."

-1	Relating effectively with patients is among the most valued skills of clinical care. As a beginning clinician, you will focus your energies on gathering information. At the same time, by using techniques that promote trust and convey respect, you will allow the patientâs story to unfold in its most full and detailed form. Establishing a supportive interaction helps the patient feel more at ease when sharing information and itself becomes the foundation for therapeutic clinicianâpatient relationships. 4 Because illness can make patients feel discouraged and isolated, âA feeling of connectedness with the doctor, of being deeply heard and understood, reduces this feeling of isolation and despair. This feeling is the very heart of healing

-1	I checked myself into the hospital after having a bus accident and I was diagnosed with pneumonia, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.
-1	When I was sick over the summer I started doing research on the symptoms. I started looking up articles to determine what I may have.
-1	i am not a doctor and have no medical expertise to diagnose an illness. i trust my doctor to do that. 
-1	Just normal going to the doctors for check ups, reading up on conditions, paying attention to what my doctors are telling me.
1	I knew what allergic reactions look like and when a child was experiencing a reaction to a medicine, I took the child to the doctor and was proven right
-1	I once started a new medication. Within a few days of taking it, I knew something wasn't right because of how I felt. I called the doctor and told him that I was having an allergic reaction to the medication.
-1	I had my gall bladder out many years ago and I read all I could about it before I even agreed to the surgery
-1	The classes I am currently taking for my degree in a medical field have increased my knowledge of health and medical issues 
-1	WHEN I WAS A CHILD I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKEMIA. I HAD TO LEARN AT THE YOUNG AGE OF TWELVE WHAT THIS DISEASE WAS ABOUT. I CAME TO LEARN THAT IT WAS A CANCER OF THE BLOOD.

-1	hen I was twelve years old, a drunk driver hit the car my mother was driving while I was in the backseat. I have very few memories of the accident, but I do faintly recall a serious but calming face as I was gently lifted out of the car. The paramedic held my hand as we traveled to the hospital. I was in the hospital for several weeks and that same paramedic came to visit me almost every day. During my stay, I also got to know the various doctors and nurses in the hospital on a personal level. I remember feeling anxiety about my condition, but not sadness or even fear. It seemed to me that those around me, particularly my family, were more fearful of what might happen to me than I was. I donât believe it was innocence or ignorance, but rather a trust in the abilities of my doctors. It was as if my doctors and I had a silent bond. Now that Iâm older I fear death and sickness in a more intense way than I remember experiencing it as a child. My experience as a child sparked a keen interest in how we approach pediatric care, especially as it relates to our psychological and emotional support of children facing serious medical conditions. It was here that I experienced first-hand the power and compassion of medicine,
