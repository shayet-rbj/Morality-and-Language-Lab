I believe that having three kids has given me an advantage of being able to understand health information more.

If it's something basic, I know that there are resources online that I can easily access to find quick remedies to certain ailments or injuries. I also know that there are phone numbers that I can easily call for more serious conditions like being poisoned by some kind of liquid or being bit by a poisonous animal.

0.755600	I feel confident that I do understand basic health information. If I have questions, I will first try to ask the medical staff. If I still do not understand, I try to do research online. After reading more information, I will then go back to my doctor and ask relevant questions until I fully understand.
0.777800	I am able to understand quite a bit on my own. However, sometimes it is difficult to find out the unknown information.

0.861100	I do pretty well with understanding everything that is told. I have some pretty severe anxiety (social/generalized) so sometimes I get really nervous and won't always comprehend things that are being told to me and I often don't remember the question that I have planned to ask. 
0.838889	I think that it is very easy to obtain any information that I need. I can easily call my doctor and ask to speak directly to him or her and I can get whatever I need. 
0.850000	I think I can find any information I need fairly well. I am able to understand the majority of it and I can remember what I discover quite well.
0.666700	I am educated and articulate, but I feel like dissemination of information is so provider-specific. For instance, I have a mild condition that was recently diagnosed, and what the doctor told me in terms of how common it is was not at all consistent with what his nurse told me, and what I had found anecdotally. So while I have the capacity to process quantitative information, sometimes it's more difficult when individual communication styles come into play.
0.627778	I feel that I have to repeat in my head multiple times the information given to me, or have a parent in the room with me.
0.783300	I think I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. When I dont understand something I utilize resources to help me.
0.833300	I do understand the process of decisions for my health care, and if I am confused I then ask my doctor or nurse
0.916700	"Most of the health information I have had to deal with has been very well explained to me, and I don't mind asking followup questions.  The doctor's are the experts after all.  One of my favorite quotes/phrases to use is ""Help me understand.""  When I am truly confused or stuck with something, that is what I go to, and I let the doctor know that they can break it down and treat it as if they are telling a five year old.  Most of it I understand, but don't mind letting them know I may have follow up questions."
0.900000	I feel very confident that I understand the information or services in order make the right decisions for my health
0.900000	I feel very proficient at being able to obtain, process, fill out and receive medical information.  It is easy for me to get clarification on anything I may not understand.  I have no problem asking a medical provider additional questions to help me understand better
0.633333	I will often do my own research to prepare for my meeting with my doctor but when an issue comes up I don't know what to say/ask in the moment
0.916667	I feel that I am able to understand, ask, and research to understand health information and/or services.
0.705600	I feel pretty confident when it comes to understanding basic health information. I took a few medical assistant classes in college because I was studying to be a medical assistant a few years ago. One of the classes was about understanding basic health information and also what some abbreviations and other important terms mean. It was a fun class. I feel that with my knowledge in this field, from school, that I have a little bit of an advantage compared to others when it comes to understanding basic health information and services. There is still some things I am probably not familiar with as I didn't get a degree in this field because I switched majors, but I feel that, overall, I have a pretty strong confidence and understanding in this area. 
0.850000	I think I clearly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself. I am quite intelligence and have never had a problem understanding health information and if I din't, I knew where to find the information to explain it.
0.883333	I feel that I am able to understand this information as well as the average person. I feel that in most cases I can get the information I need to make an informed decision where one is required.
0.900000	I feel that I am perfectly capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services need to make appropriate health decisions.   As a leukemia survivor, I have lots of practice taking in medical advice from doctors and doing my own research to make decisions.  
0.766700	I think that I am able to obtain the information that I need the majority of the time. There have been times when I took my daughter to the doctor and they wanted to give her shots and they don't want to explain what they are really giving her. I ask questions and they don't really want to give me a detailed explanation about what is in the shot. I had to look it up on my phone one day because they didn't explain it well enough. 
0.872200	I don't have any real doubts about my ability to process basic health information. Obviously I'm not initially familiar with some of the terminology, etc, but the basic instructions are usually fine. The one area I'd say is a little confusing is hearing conflicting advice from different sources, but I guess that situation is present whenever you have professiols with differing opinions.
0.916667	I think i'm very able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I don't have a problem understanding things and I have a great deal of common sense.
0.872222	I think I have an advantage because of my family is in the medical field so I can always ask them if needed 
0.866667	I CAN USUALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.  IT IS INSURANCE COVERAGE THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
0.766700	When I was insured, I generally felt like I did; I could ask my doctor to elaborate about particular health related concerns and follow his advice. Now, though, I can't afford insurance, and I cannot afford to see a doctor in any capacity, so any health information I need has to come from the Internet. I can't get anything from a face-to-face conversation with a medical professional.
0.900000	I feel like I am more than capable to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.661100	If I get confused by what the doctor or nurse is telling me I research my condition online. This can be a little exhausting but it's worth it. I go to Web MD and other sites like it; there's a lot of valuable information there. Younger doctors communicate better than older doctors; they care more.
0.705556	Sometimes I ask then sometime I leave my trust up to the doctor and nurse. I ask them to explain to me if I don't have a clear vision on what's fixing to happen then sometimes I trust too much. Sometime I ask family before yet often tell family afterwards which I trust the facility a lot of time too much
0.916667	i feel extremely confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and make the appropriate health decisions.
0.872200	I know the basics. So I think I can make good decisions. Or if I don't understand something, I can ask and learn to help me make a better decision.
0.883300	I feel I have a great capacity to obtain, understand, and process my health info and services. I have head chronic Auto Immune Disorders since I was 14, and have been to many hospitals, doctors, and specialists. Having gone through the process so many years give you the experience necessary to process and understand all the information given to you.
0.744400	I feel I have a pretty good capacity. I am too shy to ask the questions I should of my provider.

There have been times over the years that I would need further explaining of certain things and my health professionals have been able to effectively explain things to my understanding.

0.855556	In my experience, my doctors have always explained things in a way that I have understood. There was only one time back in 2012 when I had to get a minor surgery that I had to look into my options and the process. It wasn't that my doctor wouldn't have been willing to explain it better had I asked, it was that I wanted to hear from people who been through it.

0.844400	I feel that I have a moderate capacity to obtain, process and understand this information. It's easy to understand information about simple concerns -- like if I go to the doctor with an infection, and she diagnoses it and sends me home with a prescription for antibiotics, that's easy. No problem. But when I get into harder-to-diagnose issues (like the vertigo I've had for more than a decade), doctors tend to under-explain things and make a lot of assumptions that can make it hard to get useful information from them. My vertigo was never diagnosed by my then-doctor despite him running a bunch of tests I couldn't afford that all came back fine; I filly figured out the issue for myself (badly-adjusted new glasses that caused chronic eyestrain I still struggle with). Doctors also tend to brush off my concerns because I'm overweight, even when my concerns have nothing to do with my weight. Behavior like that from professiols can make it difficult and intimidating to make the right decisions for myself.
0.794400	I believe I can adequately obtain help understanding,  and processing basic health information and services.  I've had an injury in the past where if something wasn't clear to me there was an employee explaining anything needed.

0.783300	I feel that I am smart enough to understand most materials handed to me. I come up with my own questions, and occasionally ask them.

0.838889	I can understand very well basic health information; the problem is getting the doctor to stand still and pay attention to what you are asking so that you can get an acceptable answer.  They also just tell you what they think you need to know instead of telling you what you want to know.
0.916667	Sometimes have brochures/pamphlets on certain ailments that explain things.  Generally doctors will explain if asked where you can understand better. Can always research further if need more comprehensive explanation..
0.622200	I work at a hospital so I feel like I kind of get it, but when it comes to major issues I still feel confused when getting the information told to me.

0.561111	I'm usually uncertain that I may or may not completely understand. My husband always accompanies me.
0.872200	I am a literate, college educated adult. I believe I am fully capable of completing health forms, communicating with health professionals and making decisions about my health care.

0.916667	I feel extremely confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic information/services needed to make appropriate health decisions.

0.677778	After reading the previous questions regarding health and decision making, I believe that due to the elaborate amount of resources we have online and in the community, individuals should be able to make appropriate decisions regarding health.

0.838900	I think I would be able to obtain what I needed in order to get a general understanding of a condition.
0.850000	I am always open and honest with my Dr. If I don't understand, I ask for a clarification. If I feel the Dr is not being open with me I change Drs, I use Kaiser and have only had to make a change once!
0.716667	Great capacity depending on the circumstances. Health provider myself so it's easy to understand. Dental information is out of my league but orthopedic information is my forte 
0.916700	We live in the internet age so I have all the information. Really, I have the exact same information any doctor on the planet would have. If I don't feel like spending a lot of time looking into a specific issue myself, I have no problem with asking the professiols.
0.900000	I am fully capable of filling out and or understanding health information on my own . Reading and comprehending what is asked on my health is not  a issue 
0.872200	I am well educated enough to understand almost all medical information and to process what information is provided to me. My main issue is making sure I advocate for myself in asking questions, especially if it's with a provider I don't know well.
0.750000	I feel with the internet I can gain information which I can speak to my doctor about. If there anything my doctor does not explain I can check the internet or speak to other people in the medical field.
0.616700	Sometimes I feel like I do not understand some of the documents given to me. They might ask things that I am not sure how to answer or if I am making the right decision. For example, if the doctor gives me a document about a vaccine he is recommending then I like to have someone look over it with me and I like to look up information about it instead of giving an immediate answer by myself. Other times, I completely understand the information given to me and I can make an immediate answer without hesitation. 
0.861111	I believe I understand information well and am able to ask any necessary questions. If I do need help, I ask.
0.916700	My two passions when I was young were science and writing, which led me into journalism covering the sciences.  I have worked around scientists for years.  I am comfortable reading technical material and do not hold doctors or scientists on any type of plateau.  Yes, I do have the capacity to make decisions
0.844444	I have always been interested in all the sciences and had a career in surgical pathology and I try to keep up with current research on health issues even though I am now disabled. However in today's medical establishment the atmosphere is not as conducive to obtaining thorough information from health providers who are constrained to their computer screens. I have great capacity for understanding when someone will interact with me.  :)
0.744400	I find myself more than adequately intelligent to understand most scientific/biological issues, but the problem lies in the paperwork. I'm never certain as to how to fill it out correctly. The only time I go to see a medical professional is in an emergency due to my lack of financial resources, so it's very intimidating to be VERY ill and be slammed with unfamiliar paperwork.
0.811100	I have a university education so I'm not too concerned about not being able to process or understand basic health information and services needed to make health decisions. With ease of access to information online through a smartphone and being open with medical assistants and practitioners, I believe I am able to understand everything being presented to me. Excessive legalese or use of scientific mes/terminology may give me pause, but I am confident I will be able to find a means of getting layman's definitions for them or convince medical personnel to simplify anything that I might find confusing.
0.811100	I feel that I have a good handle on most medical issues. Most things I can look up myself or I can simply ask my doctor. I have good trust with my doctor and she knows how to explain things for me in a way that I would understand.
0.872200	I feel as though I could get the information that I need and process it to a great degree. I tend to bring notebooks with me to the doctor to write down questions I have and what is said to reference in the future.
0.700000	I am semi confident, I dont have alot of experience dealing with doctors so it is a little intimidating and I may not understand everything they are asking for or explaining. I feel like if I were to receive some type of document that was not completely clear I would ask for clarification regarding the questions. Maybe some of the terms used would not be something I know and dont want to sound dumb and would ignore but really important things such as conditions I may have or steps I need to follow I would ensure a clear answer from my doctor.
0.916700	I understand it because I ask my doctor many questions. If I feel like I need more information than they said, I will Google it to see what's out there. Between those two, I am usually very sure of myself.
0.900000	I feel like I am able to completely comprehend any information I receive from the doctors office. If I have any questions, I always ask. I also make sure to read over all information packets/brochures that I am given. 
0.811111	I feel like the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services are quite simple and shouldn't take that long to know what to do.
0.833300	I feel that I have the knowledge and comprehension skills to get what I need from health care providers. My doctors are good about putting it into terms I know and my best friend is a nurse. If I need any additiol understanding, I ask him.
0.900000	My mental cognition is fine I can understand anything that is said to me and if I do not understand I ask questions.
0.900000	I feel like I have a high capacity. I have a base of medical knowledge, and I ask questions when I don't understand something.
0.544444	I have a great ability to obtain process and and understand health decisions. I helped my 90 year old grandmother while she was sick for a entire month. I stayed with her. I ate with her and also helped her nurse couldn't help her. I also help give medications to my grandfather while he was sick. Information is fairly easy to understand and if you just read and take things so and don't panic.
0.533333	I HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ASK QUESTION BUT NOT HAVE ALL MY QUESTIONS ANSWERED SATISFACTORY..I HAVE SEVERAL ILLNESSES AND NOT ALL ARE ADDRESSED PROPERLY BY MY DOCTOR..SHES FORGETFUL,,
0.900000	I have good ability
0.694444	i think i can understand basic health information. its easier if its written on paper in detsil , definitions of all, of what my health condition is so that its best to undertand
0.600000	I understand the basic medical conditions and the basic forms provided for medical purpose but when not explained clearly make it difficult for me to understand. I need to discuss then with someone who clearly has the knowledge of it to make me feel better about what was expressed. 
0.822200	I'm confident that I can understand how my health is going and what do I have to do to improve when I'm sick or I have some kind of problem. If there are terms I don't understand I google for them, but I understood that's better to not replace a doctor or a nurse with google and that it's better to ask all the questions and explations right away to them.
0.733333	i know my medical problem i dont need to ask to much about it i all ready know whats wrong with me my doctor i have seen him for over 22 years
0.811100	I feel I have sufficient capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  Sometimes I get frustrated and give up though, when I feel like they are just pawning me off on another specialist or something.
0.916667	I'm very capable of making decisions about my health.  I read up on things.  I also ask questions when necessary.
0.850000	I take time to engage in studying health-related topics. Additionally, I often research a wide range of subject matter to obtain basic and technical knowledge. I am an avid reader of various print and on-line materials (books, magazines, scholarly journals, and websites) at various times.
0.916667	I am in full capacity to gain any information or assistance I would need. If i need clarification on understanding that my doctor cannot/does not provide, I will google and check out several sites to find the answers I am looking for.
0.916667	I am perfectly capable of comprehending health information.  I have all my mental faculties and have no problems understanding health information and dealing with health decisions.
0.622200	I have a general deal with health field from experience having sick children, my father and myself. 
0.711111	I'm fairly up to date on my medical problems. My daughter is an lpn, so she's able to help with any problems or understanding things. 
0.527778	I am fully sure that I understand and can process basic health information to my best ability. I have confidence in myself and don't have any worries at all.
0.755600	I believe that I can understand most information and what I don't understand I look up on the internet. I use several different resources to make sure that the information is the same across the board. I also talk with the nurse at the clinic if I don't find the information I need.
0.888900	I know exactly what a medical professiol is asking me. I'm fully capable of understanding the English language.
0.827800	I feel like I know a lot about health sciences because of going to school for occupational therapy and understanding many of the basic medical terms and understanding the basic health needs we should possess. If I am ever confused by something, what I usually do is repeat what they said to get a confirmation of that topic or what I need to follow. I generally am pretty good and understanding how to document everything I need to for my medical history and what not.
0.916667	I have the highest degree to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make the best health decisions for me. I always do a lot of research on various health issues I may have before seeing a doctor. I always see the most appropriate doctor for whatever medical condition I have.
0.816700	I believe I can understand basic health information and services pretty well - well enough to feel confident about the decisions I make if I am given all of the information.
0.850000	Well, I have the good fortune to be a fluent speaker of English in a largely English-speaking country and, while I am a pretty low-key individual, I am not afraid to ask a question about something I don't understand.  I am not afraid of looking foolish- it is much better to be properly informed.  While I have a bad tendency to not think of a question fast enough while I'm at the doctor's office, my main physician lets me e-mail him and has answered many of my belated questions that way.
0.694444	I can comprehend things pretty easily. If I have problems, I read things more than once. Then I am usually okay.
0.866700	I make lists of symptoms I have when I'm not feeling well as well as a list of questions to ask the doctor or nurse. Very rarely am I unprepared going into an appointment for an ailment or sickness. Today with the internet makes it really easy to prepare as well. You can practically diagnose yourself and also make a list of possible problems to speak to a doctor about.
0.783300	I feel that if I am presented with a medical situation that I do not understand by myself that I know where to go for help.  A family member, have the question ready for a nurse, the internet or my insurance call center help line.
0.566700	I would consider so important information and some people advice 
0.783300	I feel confident I can obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have worked in a medical environment with physicians for years so am familiar with much of the terminology.
0.644444	I feel strong about it. I have never really been let down by my medical staff. They have been extremely helpful in helping me understand everything we need to know.
0.916667	i am a director of our local CAH in superior montana.  we take extra care in making sure all our patients, emergency room clients and our rest home clients understand to the best of their ability all forms, meds, and treatments
0.600000	Sometimes I can but I don't always understand so I have to seek help from friends and family. I have disibility and can't retain information very well 
0.811111	I feel like I have a handful of information when it comes to making the correct health decisions but most of the time the medicines I need cost so much money, such a high cost.
0.500000	I don't understand much of the hospital papers they send me home with at all I wish i did it's really sad that i don't 
0.800000	I think that I am smart enough to figure most things out but insurance and medical speak is not the easiest thing to understand.  If I don't understand something, I will keep asking questions until I do understand.  I think that doctors try to be honest and straightforward where as insurance tries to be deceptive.
0.833300	I have full access to the internet. If a health care professiol does not provide information to answer all the questions I have (which come up after the visit), I look online.  I do not use blogs for the most part. I use credible sources for information.  Of course, if I have questions that cannot be answered at that point, I reach out to my PCP.  My PCP is actually available via internet for me, so I use that resource when appropriate. I have a small healthcare background as well, so I feel I am able to understand and comprehend better than someone with no healthcare background.
0.655556	Sometimes it's hard to understand the and what get meant. It's nice to hear from someone in the field
0.888900	I think I have above average competence and ability to understand things.  I will generally do internet research on my own before seeing a doctor so I have a better understanding.  I generally do not need any assistance.  If I have questions I try to remember or write them down to ask the doctor.  Sometimes the doctors are too rushed and busy during an appointment.  That is very frustrating.  I am the type of person who wants to understand and ask a lot of questions.  At the same time, I am very intelligent and understand things quickly, as well as do my own research ahead of time in order to not waste time during the appointment.  Nevertheless, the doctors many times do rush me or make me feel that they are not interested in answering my questions.  The scariest thing is when they do not have the answers to my questions or are dismissive of my concerns or when I am using supplements that work that they have never heard of.
0.861111	I feel completely confidence more than anything.i think i can get a lot of help with questions i may need help with.
0.850000	I believe I am able to understand the basic information to make the right health choices. I am also very confident in asking for help to understand and make my own decisions.
0.605600	I would understand to an extent but may need help with the paperwork.  Or google a few medical terms to help me
0.844400	I feel like I can understand the services and basic health information without any issues. My reading comprehension has always been pretty high, so I've never needed any assistance. 
0.644444	I feel that I have an good amount to process my healthcare decisions but I do feel I need help in certain areas in the decision making.
0.916667	As long as everything is explain clearly to me and to understand my condition and so on. There for I need everything to be clear in words that I can understand on my behalf. 
0.833300	I feel that I have access to regular healthcare and services, which allow me to get treatment whenever I feel that I need it. I also know that I can call my healthcare providers and will be responded to in an efficient manner that is easy for me to understand. 
0.900000	I feel that the doctors and nurses do a fine job helping me understand, obtain and process my health information. Health care coverage is completely confusing (even for the people providing the coverage), but the actual information and services are always more than sufficient for me to make decisions.
0.833333	its really good to learn about ur body so u can talk to ur doctor about it and my son needs help with his mental health my granddaughter is scrifria

0.733300	I went to college and fully understand basic health information and have access to google.
0.916700	I've always had exceptional reading comprehension, and my mother was a nurse so health related information is something I can easily understand. I'm also not the type of person to feel embarrassed or afraid when I need to ask the doctor hard questions.
0.916700	I never have too much of a problem understanding what they tell me, and when I do, I always ask questions until I know I understand completely what's going on. Other times I'll research on my own time what they tell me if I'm still not completely satisfied, or if I just want to know a little extra about something.
0.788889	very good at understanding what is told to me.   I understand it without explanation.  I have a good sense of understanding.
0.755556	I feel that my capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information and services is relatively high because of my medical professional and educational background.

When I feel as thought I understand everything that the doctor and nurses are telling me, it's because I did my own research before I even stepped foot into the doctors office. When I'm told something I know nothing about, it's hard for me to understand completely because I know nothing about the medical field.

0.677800	I feel fairly capable of understanding, and obtaining the proper information related to my healthcare and any conditions I might have. My background in partial medical helps me to better understand things than most, however, this can sometimes lead to me not asking questions that I should because I believe I understand something when I might not have the full (or most up-to-date) information on the subject matter. But as a whole, I find I am capable of understanding, and asking enough questions to get the information I need to decide and understand what care is being offered.

0.811111	I think I would have a great understanding over health decisions taking physiology classes and help me greatly

0.688889	Somewhat. Doctors tends to really make things more complicated than what they have to be, not undestanding that patients aren't professionals and can't always understand what is being asked of the,. They need to make it more clear to help people and make sure things are understood
0.888889	I feel quite well about the process of health services that are provided for the well being of me and.others.
0.883333	I have no problems with medical forms, except that they are time consuming. As for needed services, that information changes all the time, especially now that Trump is in office. 
0.822200	I feel that I have the ability to understand and make decisions given that I tend to continue to ask questions until I can understand in non-medical jargon.  I also will follow up questions or search online.
0.916700	I'm pretty knowledgeable about health and medicine, although it is not my field. It is a science field, and I am interested in pretty much all of the sciences, especially physics and computer science. I have very high academic proficiency, so I don't need people to help me to understand things.

If I do need help I am able to contact the doctor to have then further explain what I need.
0.661100	I believe I understand enough that with the help of my doctor, I could make a choice. I don't think I could do it on my own, but also don't think I'd have nothing of value to add to the conversation.
0.872200	I have great capacity.  I take care of an elderly person who acts helpless and pretends he can't do anything for himself in regards to his medical care, and I see how annoying this is to the doctors, so I make sure to really take a proactive stance in my own healthcare.
0.916700	I think that I have the capacity to understand any of the basic and non basic health information from any of the services and am able to make good decisions also.  I think that if I had any misunderstandings or questions then surely I could talk with one of the health professionals and gather a appropriate amount of understanding for the question.

Since then my whole life has made me better at dealing with medical issues. Since then I've had a living will given to me by my doctor. My relationship with my primary doctor has grown strong over the years so when it comes to understanding procedures and can always get answers from him or my patients advocate. I feel knowledgeable and up to the task. 
0.866700	I think I have a pretty good ability to process health information. Most importantly, I am not hesitant to ask questions. I go in to a lot of appointments having done research online beforehand, so I am typically prepared with several questions already in hand. Once the health professional gives me more and/or better information, I repeat it back to them in simpler terms to make sure I've understood correctly. With online resources, a close family, helpful friends and quality insurance provider who gives me access to good doctors, I feel like I have the ability to obtain knowledge and support pretty easily before making any health decisions.
0.844444	I feel I can fill any health information that is needed for appropriate health decisions. I have had many years experience doing this.

0.861100	My body is crap - my mind is still 100%. Well...maybe 97%. I have no problems with this.
0.916667	I have A-Fib, irregular heart beat. My condition is managed without medication through a combination of exercise and nutrition, therefore effective 2 way communication is necessary and very important
0.711100	Some information needs explaining,but you can usually find good information if you can access the internet. As long as it is not very specialized information.
0.866700	I can understand what they tell me most of the time. When I'm in doubt, I ask till they give me an answer I can use. The medical\dental profession have a bad habit of obfuscation...they call it 'not scaring their patients(a direct quote). When did informing people at a level they can use become scarey???
0.777778	I feel I am very capable of understanding basic health information and if I don't understand something, I ask a healthcare provider while they are available, because that's what they are there for

0.816667	I am able to hear and understand very well information to make appropriate health decisions for myself and family
0.688900	Because medicine is a complex area, it is sometimes very difficult to understand exactly what they are saying since it is all comprised of jargon. The doctor or nurse could try and explain it in layman's terms, but sometimes it can be lost in translation. 
0.688889	I feel I have a basic grasp. If something were more complicated or uncommon I may struggle with knowing what to ask or how to understand it
0.883300	I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information because six years ago I was a insurance agent. I was licensed in health care. I had to have educational training on new information(policies) that effect the client's selection of choice based on his/hers health.
0.777800	I feel a higher than normal degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information because I had to function as my own healthcare advocate when getting a cancer and precancer diagnosis. I was referred from one doctor to another so I learned really quickly to come into the office with a list of questions to ask.
0.644444	I don't really feel like I understand really. I didn't go to medical school and even the the doctors try the information is sometimes overwhelming.
0.872200	I feel like there are enough resources out there to gain the information needed if I don't know something. I can search something on the internet, or ask qualified staff in person. If it's basic health information, I feel like I should have no problem understanding it.

I can find information on their online portals. I have a high degree to understand what I read due to my science background. If i don't understand, I call the doctor's office to talk to my nurse or leave a message for my doctor to call me back. I go to the doctor whenever I need without hesitation so I have a good relationship with my doctor. 
0.611111	I have the capacity to understand and if I need help I ask questions. If I need something explained I would call my doctor. There has been times where I need information about my hhealth.

0.855600	I feel like I have full capacity to grasp and obtain all of the needed information. I also have full ability to research on my own. The thing I struggle with sometimes is trying to absorb all of the information when the doctor is talking to me. If they rattle off a bunch of values from my bloodwork, for instance, sometimes I have trouble remembering what they said an hour later.
0.872200	I feel very capable of locating any health-related information I desire. I have been using the internet since the mid-1980s (yes, it did exist at that time but was mostly available only to certain companies, government agencies and universities) so I have a lot of experience with it. I am also VERY willing to rely on my own research to question my doctor's advice or even disregard it in favor of something that I think makes more sense.
0.883333	I have a lot of insight and am good at comprehending written and verbal information. I do not feel that I have any issues 
0.488900	I feel very unconfident. It's an unfamiliar environment and unfamiliar forms to me. Often I'm nervous anyways about being sick and my health declining so I do not think of questions I should ask at that time. I would want a friend or family member to accompany me or have assistance from personnel in filling out forms and documents before seeing the doctor. Often I'm in a rush to get in and get out so I don't take time to ask questions
0.733333	I can di things on my own i dont have any problems with filling out anything. I can hear fine. I dont have to have help with anything

There are a lot of ways  can go about this such as asking a loved one, asking a pharmacist, asking the doctor, or calling in to the doctors office and speaking to a nurse. 
0.722200	If I can read information, I have a better time than when someone explains it. More than once, I've left a consultation, and in processing what I just heard I realize there's something that doesn't make sense or something I've simply forgotten because I'd just been given a lot of information to retain. I often don't the right questions to ask either, simply because I don't know what to ask.   
0.844400	I feel that I have a basic understanding of health information.  I am well read and and always seek out more information to give me a better understanding of things.

0.916700	I feel I have the full capacity to get all the information I need. I ask question and do research online when I don't have the answers right away.
0.772200	I feel that overall I am able to process the information I get from my doctor or nurse.  I do need to sometimes look up things and get some ideas of questions to ask when I am not sure what the information means exactly for me.  As for my basic health I have a good understanding of what I am told. 
0.655600	As long as there is someone around who can help me if needed, even if everything seems very simple, I will usually have the confidence to understand and correctly fill out forms. The approachability of the nurse or doctor helps with the ability to ask questions that are needed.
0.883333	I have full mental capacity. and I can understand what my doctors tell me. If I do not understand something I ask about it and they will explain.
0.750000	As long as the nurse or doctor explains everything in detail i can pretty much make good health decisions. But if i do not ynderstand what they said it is hard to. If im sick or hurting i forget to ask questions that need to be asked.

0.916700	I try and get all the information I can when I am facing, or if a loved one is facing, a health problem.  I read, I research, I listen to the doctor and nurses (especially to the nurses as they are hands-on,though my doctor explains things well). The written material is not too big a challenge normally, even when  not clearly written - I do ask when it's indecipherable because I need to understand things.

0.794400	I feel that I had adequate capacity to process and understand basic health information for my needs. I've been fairly healthy so far, so the information isn't too complex.

Typically when a doctor explains something to me, I can develop a general understanding.

0.733333	I am very good at finding information on the internet about any health issues I want or need to learn about so I have an idea of what to ask before, during and after doctor visits and I don't really have any trouble processing what I read. I usually only need assistance when it comes to dealing with medical things when I need to read something that is handwritten or need to fill out paperwork because I am visually impaired and cannot do that without sighted assistance unless the doctor has the capability for me to fill it out electronically which is rare.

0.900000	I think that having worked in healthcare in the past, I have an easier understanding of the way everything works. I'm also not afraid to ask questions if I don't understand something. I would rather have a doctor look at me like I'm an idiot for not understanding something rather than spend the rest of my life stressing about it. 
0.900000	Yes I have the capacity to understand and educate myself on my health information and decisions. I'm well aware of acknowledging and obtaining my health information. 
0.888900	I feel I have the capacity to understand all health-related documents almost every time I read one. I take time to read the directions/information and ensure there are is not any ambiguous wording. I am able to understand all of the necessary abilities that I need to get the information, how to process it in my mind to think about and determine what is needed from me whether medical records, insurance or even authorizations that I need to give to other healthcare providers or to other people. I understand that the doctors use the information I truthfully give them in order to make detailed decisions about my personal health. If I am ever unclear on what decision is being made about my health, I make sure to ask the doctor  - even if it has to be asked in multiple different ways for me to understand.
0.572200	I am very confident in getting all the information that is needed. The reason is very simple I do not trust anyone or anything. By having that believe I always make sure  thing goes smoothly.
0.722222	I have full capacity in understanding medical terms. However, it is difficult for me to remember questions that I wish to ask. 
0.572222	I feel I can competently  understand the information regarding to my health situation. I feel I will know enough to make decisions
0.466667	I NEED TO CALL OTHER PEOPLE TO GET INFORMATION FOR WHAT I NEED REGARDING MY MEDICAL INFORATION. I WAS ABLE TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION NEEDED 
0.916700	I feel I am fully able and competent to get the information I need, ask the questions I need answered, and understand the answers. I have never had a concern getting information, using it, filling out forms, or anything of that sort.
0.650000	Sometimes you really cannot understand what is written by nurses or doctors due to medical terms and you have to ask them to explain better.  Even if u do not understand it all at that time u have to just do what u are told in order to see improvement 
0.916700	I am intelligent enough to understand medical discussions. I can read and understand printed material.
0.900000	I always fill out medical information by myself and rarely need help.  I always ask questions if I need to and I try to be as honest as possible when speaking with a doctorl
0.916667	master medic medicine forever nude vacations for the nurse and doctors that call me every night at 10 pm for example the other day i was in my car and a kid comes to me and told me that i was a fat girl
0.572200	I feel I am still young and healthy, and my health problems are not yet complicated or severe that would be hard to understand. I am also very smart even though im not overly familiar with medical topics so that helps 
0.900000	i have been going to same doctor and have had same condition for years so I dont need many answers.I also help my Dad but he has good doctors so we get the right info that we need without any problems.
0.722200	I feel like I am fully capable of making decisions upon and understanding basic health information.  I feel that I can grasp most concepts myself, if not there is usually a nurse or doctor willing to answer any questions. Additionally, I have access to the internet via smartphone, so I have essentially all of the knowledge in the world at my fingertips if need be.
0.483300	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. The problem is whether I am informed enough to make appropriate health decisions regardless of how many questions I ask. If I need to know something it should be TOLD to me, and if I need a procedure immediately it should be scheduled immediately instead of them ignoring me for a month and setting up an entirely different procedure without consulting anyone before a different doctor tells me that I needed something different the whole time.
0.611111	i can basically understand what I need to understand.so sometimes I need help with understanding this information.
0.655600	I think I understand written information much better than what a practitioner says to me. I miss SO much when I'm at a doctor's appointment - I forget what I'm told and forget what questions I wanted to ask, even when they're written down.
0.772200	I am fully capable of understanding and processing information given to me regarding my health. I have no mental abnormalities that hinder me from assessing the situation and making judgements about any medically related situation. 
0.794400	"I feel like I have the information I need because I have a background in healthcare so it's a little easier for me to understand the medical terminology and paperwork. As for others, I feel like certain things should be broken down for patients who don't understand. Doctors and nurses should use ""Layman's"" terms when talking about health conditions so that patients will understand the seriousness of everything and not be left out.   "
0.916667	I am 100 percent confident in my ability to understand all things related to my own personal healthcare and well being.
0.661111	I can understand health information. Being that I work in the medical field and I obtain a position in the hosiptal.
0.866700	I feel like I have all the tools for my basic health information. I can call to obtain, and I can also go online and access a lot of my medical information. I think it's so easy to access this information.
0.738889	I feel very confident when it comes to that. Sometimes I need additional information to learn what is going on with me.
0.755556	I feel like I am pretty capable, I always do my best to get my problems taken care of and try to explain my problems to my doctor. I'm also good at looking things up if I do not understand.
0.572200	well fortutely there is the internet,and i can search for more information about the things i dont know enough about.without that i doubt i could find the info easily.
0.888900	I think I have a good knowledge base and am confident that, for the most part, I understand the directions my doctor and nurses give me, along with the materials and directions given to me afterward. I make sure to ask questions, but I will be honest and say that I often forget some of the things I want to ask before I go in during the exam. I
0.688900	I believe that I have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information in most situations. Most of the time if you don't get lost in random jargon the point is clear. From time to time doctors and nurses say stuff that makes sense to them but doesn't to a normal individual that doesn't work in the medical field. 
0.916700	At or above the level that a non medical professional can.
0.783300	I usually feel like I'm able to get enough information. Certain situations can make me flustered and uncomfortable, which sometimes limits how I interact. I do feel like there are more chances these days to get the information you need beyond the actual care interactions.
0.827778	To the utmost degree as I am someone interested in going into the healthcare industry and am somewhat able to understand medical terminology 
0.572200	It depends on the health condition I may have if I can fully understand it. Things like having a cold or a sprained ankle are somewhat simple to understand as oppose to a stomach condition like an ulcer. I would research online and ask for advice from family if I don't fully understand.
0.900000	I feel I have the capacity to process the information. I usually think about what I want to talk to the doctor about. Also I try to inform myself about the condition ahead of time. I truly listen to the doctor and when I feel I need to ask a question, I do interrupt and ask a question. 
0.916667	I think i am okay and able to read, write an dunderstan dalmost anything wthout help from someone else
0.788889	i understand  what the doctor has to say about my condition when i see him  at my appoiments he explains everything to me so i can understand
0.700000	I really don't have problems.  When asking for help with forms, it is sort of an ocd thing (self diagnosed).  I just need to be sure.  I rely a large amount on info from the web.  I fully realize that the source must be reputable.
0.883333	I am very knowledgeable in medical terminology. I am a certified pharmacy technician. Also had courses on medical billing , which consist of codes.
0.722200	I think for the most part I can handle basic health interactions. I rarely have trouble filling out the questionnaires, but I don't always remember questions I have for the doctor until I'm back at home. I think especially when they catch me off guard or there is a problem that is discovered, my mind sometimes blanks and I just don't have time to process that information and think of questions until later.
0.872200	Since I have not had experiences with uncommon disease or sickness, except from regular health check and common cold, I do not really have much more experience with health information and services.  In fact, aside from some emergencies in my teege and younger years visit to hospital due to injury, accident, the past 8 years, the only time I have to stop by the doctor was to drive someone else close to me for health check up.  Because of this, as far as health information and services needed for me, I am up to date on most of them, plus I am rather good at internet when I need to do research on something peculiar related to health
0.811100	I work for a health insurance company so I have a little knowledge on how to complete forms and probably have an above average idea of what information is needed to complete forms.  My major in college before I changed my mind was pre med so that also puts me at an advantage over most people.  I feel that I can either complete most forms and understand basic health information at a reasonable comfort level or I know which questions I need to ask to be able to.  I am not afraid to ask if I do not understand something because this is my health and I am not taking any chances when it comes to my health and my livelihood.
0.750000	I feel for the most part that I am intelligent enough to grasp basic health concepts and am able to make choices based on the information provided.  If any concepts are above my head I am able to communicate that and confirm what are the facts.
0.766667	I strongly feel I have the capacity to process and understand basic health information and make appropriate decisions.
0.811100	I think I've very capable of understanding basic health information. I can read just fine, and have a good understanding of most medical terms, unless it's something very abstract and rare. I ask questions when I think it's needed, and understand the answers given just fine. Between my understanding of things and other explations given (if needed), I feel I make good health decisions for myself.
0.872222	"Full degree. I use the internet to research medical conditions I need to know about. Doing this helps me to be prepared when the Doctor ask, ""Any questions?"""
0.916700	I am extremely capable of understanding medical information. If there is something that I need clarification on, I know the questions to ask in order to get the clarification I need.
0.544444	I mostly understand what the Doctor is telling me I took nursing for awhile but if I don't understand I will ask  
0.900000	I am able to process and understand basic health information. I read everything I am given. I do my own research if certain words are not clear. I ask questions and make sure I understand what is going on with my own health. I don't let anything be unclear. 
0.827800	I feel that I am quite competent in regards to understanding health information that is given to me. I worked in a hospital for many years and am comfortable around nurses and doctors. When I do not know something, I ask questions but I also do research at home on my own and then ask more questions if needed.
0.811111	My doctor's breakdown medical terms and always encourage me to ask questions. They also make sure I can explain it back to them and further explain where needed. With this help, I am able to leave with understanding of what's happening & what I need to do. 
0.733300	My mother is a nurse so when it comes to 'medical talk' I usually have an understanding of where my doctor/nurse is going. I am also very capable of understanding what is being said to me. I make sure that i am asking appropriate questions if for some reason i don't understand something. But for most of the time, I do understand basic health information that is given.
0.916667	I totally feel that I can fill out all data and medical forms. I'm a nurse and I'm skilled with a lot of medical jargon
0.783300	I think I can obtain the most extensive information from my personal doctor. I fully trust him because he has been my doctor for my entire life. 
0.811100	I believe I can obtain and understand all written material. When it comes to spoken material given by healthcare providers, they Often do not answer all my questions or allow time for me to give all my questions.
0.700000	I understand most if not all medical condition that I currently have.  Sufficient information was presented to me to make an informed decision.  Although I ask quite a few questions I'm sure there may be information that I miss.
0.916700	I guess I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision. First, I had MA, so I guess I'm well educated. Second, I have some experience to read and understand such materials. Third, I can fin any information I need in Internet.
0.744400	i think that i am ok at understanding medical jargon.  even if i can't, i can at least usually pick up the general instructions about preventive care, or what i need to be doing. i usually err on the side of caution.
0.805600	I don't have any trouble understanding materials that are given to me regarding healthcare, but I don't always read everything. I'll read the parts I think are most important. Face-to-face communication with any healthcare provider is difficult because they are usually in a hurry. If I have questions I know I'll want to ask, I'll write them down ahead of time, but there's not time during appointments to discuss anything.
0.900000	I am very capable of are of the information that will be givings to me and understand it content to fill out form also
0.916700	I feel I have a strong ability to obtain, process and understand basic health and services information in order to make appropriate decisions.  If I have any questions, I actively seek out information.
0.883300	I feel that the doctors who I go to are very informative and have provided me with both the pros and cons of the treatments they recommend. They usually also provide me with an adequate understanding of consequences that come with the treatment.
0.738889	In accordance to the answers I just gave, i feel i have a great capacity to understand basic health information and services. I have this belief because the information the doctors/nurses gives you can sometimes be long winded, but you can still grasp an understanding of what they're trying to convey to you in reference to your medical circumstances. It's more comprehensive over time the more visits that you have with them.
0.916667	I believe I have very good capacity to make health decisions for myself and others and feel confident doing so
0.794400	I think I'm okay at it. I am sometimes quite distracted because children come with me to several appointments and my main focus is usually on them. Beyond that, I'm confident enough to ask questions to make sure I understand things. 
0.900000	I can look up symptoms online and hazard a guess but I understand that I can't do much more than guess. Information given to me by doctors and nurses I tend to trust but if I'm still not certain I will look up further information for myself online. I wouldn't have access to any specialized machines to try to diagnose myself so for that at least I'm completely reliant on health professionals. Things like blood tests, urine flow test, cultures etc.
0.883333	I ask what I need to so I can understand what I need to, if I need help I'm not afraid to ask for help.
0.844400	I feel like I'm mostly able to understand basic health information. I'm comfortable with forms and written information. To the extent I have some minor problems, there are times when my mental health issues act up and make it difficult for me to be assertive about asking questions or correcting assumptions. That's pretty rare, though.
0.661111	I feel that I have most of the ability to obtain the information & services I need to make appropriate health decisions. Sometimes I feel that I don't ask all the questions I should related to my health conditions, though. Sometimes it's because I forget to ask certain questions, and sometimes it's because I can't think of relevant questions at the time, and then think of them later.
0.816700	I am confident in my ability to process and understand the information. I always ask questions when I'm not sure
0.883333	I have all the confident in myself, i don't have nothing else to say. I have no more to say. I understand what is adk of me to do.
0.844444	my health s pretty good, so there aren't too many occasions where complicated medical explanations are needed.  However, i am the care giver for 2 people with serious medical conditions, and my questions about their issues are frequent.
0.855600	I think that I am capable in understanding basic health information and services. If there is something that I do not understand then I try to educate myself on it by either researching it online or talking to my doctor or pharmacist. I feel comfortable discussing various topics with those professiols.
0.672200	I feel like I am adequate enough to understand health information that I receive from the hospital or a doctor. The health professional usually dumbs it down enough for me to understand it.
0.900000	I feel have the ability to understand most basic health information. If I have an issue understanding or I need to know more, I will ask a health professiol or perform additiol research by myself.

0.711111	I understand fairly well. I understand healthcare workers are there to help. I can research additional information i dont understand online
0.622222	somewhat I can understand that language, but I always require help when it is needed. Because most of them are really complicated to precess and dissect 
0.772200	I feel like I am decently well-informed at the basic level about health information and services and I do feel reasonably confident in my ability ask my PCP or other doctors I've seen to clarify instructions for my care. I'm also somewhat of an outlier in that I have several medical professionals in my family (physicians assistants, registered dietitians) so they are always available to help me understand anything my doctor may miss.
0.766700	I am a graduate student, so I think I have a fairly high level of comprehension and am able to quickly research answers whenever I am unsure of something. However, as I come from a family with a lot of medical professiols, I often second guess things way too much and have difficulty actually making decisions without consulting others.
0.750000	I feel like I am capable of doing all of those things.  Sometimes I feel overwhelmed in appointments and forget.  Sometimes there is too much to process and I am not thinking clearly 
0.916700	I'm completely capable of understanding all of the required information. If I have any questions, I am not ashamed or embarrassed to ask. If there is still something I do not understand, I am capable of looking up the information online.
0.916667	I have a 4 year college degree and have no problem reading, understanding, processing or questioning information given or directed to me. In fact, if I have a doctor or deal with an institution I feel may be a problem, I will quickly look for another.
0.644400	I feel that I have some capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. Some of the forms and material can be confusing, as well as some of the explanations by doctors or nurses, but I usually have them clarify it in simple terms that I can understand.
0.872200	I consider myself to be an intelligent individual and I haven't had any trouble understanding any medical information I've been given. Things have been explained well enough for me to understand.

0.888900	I feel that I am informed enough, and I feel in tune with how I feel with my body. I am always asking questions If I feel I don't understand something, or want to know more about a respective issue. I feel certain I can care for myself.
0.722200	I think I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to a pretty good degree.  I am still somewhat young, so I haven't had a lot of occasions of going to a clinic or hospital on my own.  I am still pretty used to going with my parents.  I do, however, believe that I have the capacity to be able to gather all the information needed to make appropriate health decisions when needed.
0.733300	I feel like I have a decent understanding and comprehension of basic health information and services. I have gone to the doctor a handful of times as an adult on my own and thanks to a very helpful reception, I feel very capable of making choices and filling out health forms.
0.711111	if i need assistance i will ask to explain it in terms i can understand, most of the time i can understand what is going on with my body
0.872200	I feel like I am as capable as the average person of understanding what a medical professiol tells me. I'm not a doctor, so of course there are some things that require further explation, but I can usually quickly grasp the gist of the situation if the doctor uses layman's terms. I usually ask all the questions I can think of at the time when I'm in the appointment, but every once in a while I'll be too embarrassed to bring myself to ask about something.
0.672222	Most of it but I do not understand everything and sometimes need help clarifying stuff with someone else.

0.827800	I'm pretty confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand information. My largest issues would be that I am generally reluctant to go to the doctor unless I absolutely need to, and that I often don't ask too many questions especially when I'm afraid of the answer. I will generally accept instructions from doctor without asking for explations, which probably also limits my ability to make decisions well. To this point, none of this has ever had a negative effect on me.
0.827800	I comprehend most basic health information. I have been given diagnosis that I have had to say âwhat is thatâ on numerous occasions. The doctor explains and sometimes I fully understand and sometimes I donât. I have written down the diagnosis and researched further on Internet from Home. 
0.616700	When I go to the doctors or hospital, I feel there is a lot of red tape that we usually have to through with paperwork and our insurance information. Our health insurance cards sometimes are not updated in the system or our deductible is not what the card says. If you want to your chart or personal information, you always have ask like it is a big secret. We rely on the healthcare officials to assist us if we have questions.
0.838900	I can completely understand and process any basic health information that I am given. My only issue is that sometimes doctors do not plainly discuss information and seem to be guessing, or at least being noncommittal to their answers to my questions. Doctors also do not seem to like to admit that they do not know something to be certain, in my experiences. 
0.850000	I have had some medical training (EMT) so I understand a lot of what I'm told.  If I have any confusion, I simply ask.

0.616667	I feel like I can get a general understanding of health issues but sometimes it is more fifficult if it is a more complicated issue. 
0.827778	I think I can get the answers the medical professionals can give.  It seems like there are many alternatives to an issue sometimes yet the doctors and nurses aren't allowed to mention them or they don't know them or they won't mention them for some reason.  I sometimes find better solutions from other sources so I keep an open mind and do my best to figure out what I need.
0.916667	I can fully understand because I took medical courses in school and I know quite a bit medical terminology 
0.561111	I can take care of this by myself if need. Really do not need any help, but on occasion. I could do it myself.

0.716667	I have the capacity to process my concerns, but I have a hard time obtaining them. I'm insured through my parents, but the co-payments are very expwnsive, so I avoid going to the doctor if I can.
0.583333	Most of the forms are similar from one doctor to the other except if you are seeing a specialist, many cover the privacy issue as of the last I want to say five -six years maybe longer not sure, then the nurse re-asks the same questions 99% of the time.

0.800000	I ask many questions during the office visits. Then followup with phone calls to doctor or his staff if needed after doing additional research. I often will seek second opinions on more serious medical issues.

0.672200	I believe that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, especially when my daughter is with me to help me fill out certain forms and explain certain things to me. I have needed her help many times, especially with documents with small print.
0.855600	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information if it is given to me in a way that I can understand.

0.838889	I think that most times I can understand what my doctor is trying to tell me, if not I ask questions until I do understand
0.672200	I would begin with educating nurses about using a universal precaution approach. Always use plain language when speaking with patients. Nurses should use plain, jargon-free words when discussing medical information. Individualizing the teaching by using words the patient is familiar with will enhance a patientâs understanding. All patients benefit from the use of plain language. Assess patient's understanding of the information provided.

0.916700	I feel that my ability is perfectly adequate. My mental health is poor, but my comprehension is perfect. I rarely need to clarify anything.
0.866700	I feel I have a very good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  When things get beyond basic and into more complicated subjects, I may need a medical professional to help simplify things for me.  If I read things enough times, I generally catch on to things.

Online it is really easy to understand. The only problem with that is that there's a lot of information on the web and it can get confusing sometimes. So mostly I will ask my family members or the doctor.

0.783300	I feel like I can ask the right questions, however some doctors seem to lack social skills and have an issue relating to their patients. They give answers that don't mean anything to a normal patient.

0.900000	Based on some poor health care experiences in my teens and twenties, I rarely use doctors except for acute situations (i.e., where I need a prescription for antibiotics). When I think I need a doctor, I collect the symptoms, figure out my best guess for what's wrong with me, then go to the doctor with a careful explanation of what's wrong and what I likely need. Doing my own diagnosis to then get it confirmed by a doctor is a pain, but it has resulted in a lot better health care for me. I believe I can competently obtain and understand health information. I have also been successful in obtaining the few services I need. I make a point of trying to manage chronic conditions (such as obesity and obesity-related issues) without pharmaceuticals.

The problem is that I have bad anxiety and so I'll rehearse the questions I want to ask at home beforehand and then freeze up and forget to ask them when I'm there (due to my anxiety and nervousness). But I haven't had to make any life-changing decisions to a doctor's visit (thankfully) so typically I just do what they tell me to do and not question it much further.
0.538900	For most of the real basic stuff, I get it. But when it gets more complicated with medical words being spoken to me, I get a little lost. I always have my husband with me in the doctor's office to make sure I don't miss something.

0.811100	I feel like I handle health information pretty well.  As long as it is basic information anyway.  The minor things you have to fill out when you get to the doctor or that they explain to you during routine or semi-routine checkups I believe I fully understand.  When it gets to some of the more complicated explanations I need a little more guidance.  I don't always know exactly what they are talking about when they go in depth about things.

Since i have been dealing with this type of stuff so frequently I have a pretty good grip on health care forms. The information gets a little more complicated as I have multiple doctors working with me and they all have a different opinion so in that regard i usually require more information from each individual doctor because I get so much new information every time.

0.916700	If I don't understand something, I will seek out an answer, preferably from the doctor directly if involving medical situations. I may seek out a second opinion, do independent research, and talk to others. 
0.694444	When I am sitting in a doctors office listening to them explain what I need to do or what needs to be filled out or followed up on I try my hardest to remember everything and write it down.

The reason I say that is because I feel most doctors are very biased and will recommend things that may not be the best possible option for me.
0.627800	I feel like I have a moderate capacity to understand basic health information.

I mean they have things written out with complicated language that only doctors understand I mean there's a reason they have to go to college for like 8 years.

The medical profession no longer practices ""the art of medicine,"" but instead treats patients with mandated bureaucratic protocols: RA treated with Prednisone, leads to Prednisone-induced diabetes, diabetes requires wound care, wound care requires continuous antibiotics, which cured the RA. No, not me, relative. Diagnosis COPD, after a lot of demanded testing proper diagnosis was actually IgE-85 alveolar, non-bronchial, non-environmental allergic asthma. This example is me."
0.538900	After reading all the material and information, I do believe that I could understand all the basic health information needed to make appropriate health decisions.  If not, I would ask my son to help me out.
0.805600	I feel pretty confident that I have the ability to understand basic health information that's given to me and to make decisions for myself. I don't always feel confident that doctors are giving me the right information though or that they have taken the time to understand my issues.

My mother was an RN (now head of a health department), my grandmother was a PA, and I've grown up around doctors all my life. That's probably a bit of a unique position. I would say that it's much more difficult for the average person. 
0.872222	I feel that I have the ability to understand process and make decisions regarding my medical health. If you have a sufficient reading and comprehension level I feel that you should be able to make the appropriate decisions .
0.766700	I feel that I am completely competent because I ask for insight regarding medical terminology that is confusing to me. I think it is important to ask the necessary questions with healthcare providers because they may feel that they are being understood. Thus, when I am in doubt I seek help from nurses, doctors, and pharmacists to provide me with information regarding any health concern. Additionally, my courses in speech and hearing and my medical terminology course have helped me to understand some basic health information.

0.616667	I have a somewhat understanding of information the doctors give me but have trouble sometimes really knowing what they say about my medicine cause there are just so many and about my medical conditions it doesn't make sense to me most of the time so I need it written down or told to me over again for me to understand completely what the doctors are telling me
0.733300	 While I have some familiarity with medical terms from working in a hospital while going to college that was many years ago. Some of the new diagnostic terms are new to me and I must have them explained by a health worker or doctor. In particular tests present a challenge when I try to interpret the results. If a battery of tests are given to me I need an explanation, not just of the normal parameters but, of how the results as a whole relate to my health. I have very little difficulty taking my meds as directed but sometimes, if I miss a dose or take too much, I must call my medical practitioner for assistance as to what to do next. 
0.861100	I feel I am able to obtain and understand general health information.  However, sometimes in a situation where I feel like I am being rushed (short doctor's visit) I forget to ask questions or don't realize I have questions until later.  
0.866700	I have no problem with asking questions which make me feel comfortable about understanding basic health issues.

0.772222	I feel I am totally competent but often the doctor does not take time to visit with me to answer questions
0.783300	I think that on the whole, I have a good ability to obtain and understand basic health information.  More of my personal barriers involve my comfort in communicating with doctors and nurses clearly and honestly.  There have been some occasions in the past where I have needed assistance in understanding medical information and have had to consult several sources to get the answers I needed, but this is the exception, nor the norm.
0.722200	I feel like there have been times when I have planned ahead what to ask my doctors so I can be informed about my health.   But there have also been times that I feel like I have not asked enough questions and things were not explained thoroughly enough to me.   Luckily I have friends and family I can turn to in order to help me understand.

0.688900	Whenever u go to the doctor,  i make sure to ask questions.  If there is anything I don't understand or papers i don't understand  i always ask for help to make sure i receive the help needed.
0.916700	I am mentally healthy. I am able to understand or get information.
0.916667	I am capable of understanding any and all medical information I receive, be it verbal or written.  Based on that information, I am able to make informed decisions regarding any medical conditions I might have.
0.750000	I can usually understand most information provided; the problem is I forget some things or I don't ask all the questions I need to.
0.733300	The Internet is full of useful information. There are plenty of official medical sites to read through if I don't get all the information I need from a medical professiol. But, honestly, I haven't even had a cold or flu in the 14 years I've been a vegan, so I don't go to the doctor. I'm a very healthy person.
0.844400	I think I am highly able to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make appropriate decisions. I usually ask questions to expand my knowledge of what is going on with me and if I don't understand something I usually ask. Sometimes I am shocked and can't think of anything to ask at the moment. When I am at home preparing for a doctor's visit, I try to write down any questions I want to ask so that I don't forget them. Often, after talking to or seeing a medical professional, I take what they told me and do further research online to learn more about whatever is going on with me.
0.644400	I feel that if there is something that I don't understand then I can look it up on a computer.
0.705556	for the most part i do feel that i understand most basic health information but i sometimes i do find myself going onto google in order to understand more about health information. i learn alot by going to google.
0.866700	I have a fairly high capacity to learn about basic health information to make good health decisions.   I have a fairly diverse background in interest in medical things, and I have also been through MANY medical issues with my self and my family members and close friends.  
0.916667	As I work in the health industry I am very competent with understanding basic health information. I have no issues. If so, I would ask questions. 
0.888889	"With my present eye condition, I have had it off and on for several decades where I know all the information there is to know, something like ""Been there...done that.""  "
0.705600	"I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions - but not always immediately.  I will often need time to ""research"" the information myself prior to making a decision.  Sometimes this results in me having to call the doctor back."
0.916667	I believe that I am quite competent in processing basic health info. I take my time to read it and research on the internet any words or concept that I don't understand.
0.861111	 i feel like i have a great deal of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions
0.405556	I have a good mind to do such because I am not ill. I am mentally and physically able to do whatever I need to do because I can do things on my on with very limited help  the only time I need help is when I am not feeling well enough to do these things on her own.
0.855556	I have no problem reading or understanding English however I sometimes do not understand the medical terminology. 
0.916700	My health is very important to me and so I make sure to ask questions and make sure I fully comprehend everything that is told to me.
0.916700	I feel as though i am very able to gather information about any health information that i may have, and even understanding it is not a problem for me. From my experiences i have learned to get better at this process and have narrowed it down onto what exactly to ask in order to get the answers that i am looking for.  
0.783333	I feel like I have the capacity to strongly obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.838900	I am generally able to understand information that is given to me, but sometimes there is a lot of information given all at once, and verbally, and it is hard to process it all at the time, particularly under the stress of being ill, so questions may not occur to me until later, or I might forget some of the details when there is a lot of information given at once.
0.850000	I feel capable of understanding the information needed to proceed in any cases. Basic health decisions and stuff like that. If you are in doubt just ask someone so you can take the best option
0.916700	I feel that I have full capacity to get the information that I need and to understand it.  If I ever feel that I don't understand something I ask for it to be explained.  Also, I always ask questions.
0.872200	I have never had a serious issue filling out medical paperwork or dealing with medical staff when I needed information. I don't always think of every relevant question when I'm at a doctor's visit, but if I do have questions after an appointment it is never a problem to phone my doctor's office and ask one of the nurses or have the doctor give me a call back. We also have access to an online interface for asking questions and viewing test results, etc.
0.838900	To a certain degree. I can understand most of the basic health information but decisions are a little bit difficult to make.
0.838900	I feel like I have a great degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I regularly visit my doctor and they frequently explain any and all tests and treatments, as well as answer every question I have in an easy to understand way. I also know what websites to use for additional information.
0.827800	I feel like I am more than capable of understanding health information myself, but doctors and nurses often underestimate me or don't give me all the information. I frequently find myself googling conditions or medications to get more information. Many doctors and nurses I've seen have been condescending to me, which has made me feel uncomfortable asking questions, so I have to seek out the information myself.
0.500000	I do not understand such medical terminology I struggle with having the guts to ask for help when i do not understand 
0.761111	Just get help out with a peer or doctor to help better understand the information it's heard from time to time trying to learn about new medical information I suffer from to many medical issues and I need to know what's going on with myself 
0.533300	I think I have enough information processing ability, but sometimes health information can be pretty complicated so I am not confident enough in my ability to understand complicated information. I think I will need things put into simpler terms so that I may not only understand them better, but also commit them to memory and actually learn about the information. I also have trouble making decisions for myself so I need help filling out forms and deciding how to proceed with medical decisions.
0.900000	I have no problems with the health information, medications or interaction with the doctors. However occasionally i do use the internet to get additional information and that can be an interesting quest to figure out what information is pertinent to my case. 
0.527800	I think i have a pretty decent capacity. I don't know much because I don't fall sick often and therefore my contact with doctors is very rare
0.733333	I can obtain it, and I understand it once I know the terms, but the medical lingo doesn't make sense most of the time and needs to be better explained 
0.788900	I feel confident in my ability to understand what I'm told by my doctor.  I am also proactive in researching anything that I may not understand or didn't think to ask and  ask follow up questions.  I've never felt as though I left without obtaining and understanding information I was given.
0.794444	I make great decisions to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.883300	Between google scholar and the amount of time I spend reading about health and medicine I feel fairly confident that I know what the doctor is talking about, and when I don't, that I have the base knowledge to ask the right questions. 
0.794444	Yes, I feel I still retain the mental skills to obtain, process and understand basic health info and services, either through my own knowledge, by asking questions of those in the field at the time, or by doing my own research elsewhere.
0.916700	"Although I've made a few trips to the doctor, and my children were delivered in a hospital, I primarily manage my own health. After dealing with chronic, and ultimately fatal, illness in both my parents, I was motivated to educate myself on proactive means to maintain my health so I don't need to see health care professionals. This has worked very well for me for 30 years, and I hope it continues to do so. But yes, I have a lot of knowledge about the current western medicine, to the point I had one of my mother's doctors ask if I was a medical professional. I said , ""No, but I guess you could say I am a 'lay' professional. :-)"""
0.855600	I am very clear when describing any symptoms. I am also very clear in my understanding of what the doctor tells me. i am also very clear in my understanding of what to ask the doctor. I am also very clear in my understanding that the doctors may also be incompetent.
0.783300	I feel that I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I think obtaining the health information and services are easy to acquire through the 24 hour call service I have and through internet searches. Processing the information is easy as well as long as I can have time to process. It's understanding that will is sometimes harder but I'm still able to understand basic information. Through all the resources I have available for myself I believe that it's easy for me to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.794444	Im in the middle.  I think i can understand most og it and make the tight decision.  Sometimes i need someones help so that i dont assume or make a mistake.  If i do need the help im ok with asking for it.  
0.916667	i feel i am capable enough to understand anything that i am told and to take complete care of myself
0.783300	I feel like if I use my knowledge and information collected from credible websites, I usually have a good idea of any conditions that I currently have BEFORE I ever see my doctor or nurse, and so I know which questions to ask when my appointment rolls around. One major issue is that medical professionals tend to ignore or downplay questions and concerns by patients At least that's been my experience and I truly resent it because I'm not some unintelligent yokel, I have a genius-level IQ and I'm obsessive about researching things, so it angers me when people talk down to me or dismiss my concerns because they have a piece of paper hanging on their wall.
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information because I have a degree in the healthcare field. I also obtain knowledge by asking the important questions of my doctor. I also go a step further to research information provided to gain further understanding. I feel it is important to obtain a doctor that doesn't mind taking the extra time to make sure you understand the information they are providing. 
0.916667	O am in great mental health of sound mind and body. I am capable of understanding basic health information
0.694400	I feel I have the capacity to understand and ask questions, but I rarely ask or mention everything I want to. I usually think that the medical professiol will think I'm wasting their time, and don't speak up.
0.811100	I feel that I absolutely have the capacity to obtain and understand health information.  My main issue is that I don't always ask clarifying questions because it takes me a while to process information.  
0.916700	When I have a medical issue, or even just during check-ups, I always speak to the nurse, aid, tech, and doctor about any issues that I've had (in the past) and recently/currently. I feel like since I have a background in both being around and studying medicine, I am aptly suited to have conversations about a large range of medical topics. Even at home, I can easily obtain basic outline information about symptoms I'm having. Due to my understanding of medical terminology, I feel I am able to process and understand many of the terms and even come to comprehensive conclusions about issues. If a doctor explains something to me, I am usually able to process quite a bit of the information, and if I don't quite understand or if it's new to me, I am willing to ask them to explain it to me more or in a different way. 
0.688900	I'd say that I'm moderately good at doing this but this is also due to recently becoming a lot more independent than in the past so I now do all of this stuff on my own. I make sure to ask questions and go to my doctors regularly and consistently so I can stay on top of my healthy and learn to live a healthy life. The thing that's hardest for me is healthy insurance because there are so many variances based on the type of doctor I see and what's covered and what isn't but that is a learning trend not associated with my health information directly.
0.716700	I believe that I have the capacity to understand the majority of things given to me. If not, then I have family that would assist or even looking online for more information. What I find to be confusing is at times, one can get different recommendations or advice from the health field, as in getting a second opinion, etc. I do my best in making healthy choices in my life though.
0.500000	i think i have somewhat of a capacity to process that information, but sometimes i need help, there are some questions and fill in forms that are a bit too confusing for normal people to understand.
0.811100	I feel relatively able to a certain extent.  However, it's hard to say, because I don't know what I don't know.  But basic information, I should be able to understand it very well, I think. 
0.750000	I feel like I have a very good capacity to get and find things about my health. I can easily look things on line or read the inverts 
0.883333	I feel that I have a great capacity to obtain health information and make appropriate health decisions for myself.
0.672200	i think i am okay at it, but i do not always understand some of the big words.
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to make any decisions regarding my health. I have never had any trouble comprehending anything my doctor has informed me of, and i don;t make decisions without being informed.
0.800000	I would estimate that I am able to understand basic health information and services 85% of the time.
0.900000	I am in control of my health and my decisions.  I am completely confident in my abilities to make health conscious decisions.  I always make sure i can decide things before i leave the doctors
0.888889	I have never had any problems with reading what the doctors or nurses write down.   I have never had any problems understanding what doctors or nurses have told me.
0.888889	"I feel I have all the capacity that I need to understand basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate health decisions. As often as I go to the doctor I should be able to understand 90% of all medical terminology"""
0.677800	I feel I have a basic understanding to make positive decisions about my health.  I do however struggle with some of the insurance portions of health.  I also struggle with some of the terminology used in the medical industry.  I think overall I am average or slightly better at understanding health information.
0.833333	I feel that doctors make it easy to understand medical information so you can imakr the right choices for your healrh.
0.805556	I can follow directions quite well... If there something that I am unsure about or is not understood by me, I ask questions so that the matter will be cleared up...  
0.833333	My understanding is probably above normal, at least for a non-medical professional person.  And if I don't understand, I have no problem asking medical professionals in my family or searching the internet.
0.622200	It really depends on how I feel. If I am in pain or severe discomfort my ability to understand complex issues drops dramatically. I don't go into a doctors office often for a checkup, so most likely the reason I am there is that I am not well. This can lead to my understanding of complex issues and situations being less than great.
0.855556	I have COPD and I am constantly looking for information on treatment  updates and medical breakthroughs for this disease.  Also I read the side effects for any medicines I take
0.638900	I Fell I have a good amount of capacity to to make appropriate health decisions but would not want to to so all by myself. Medical information, options, trust in some in the medical field and the overwhelming amount of information/misinformation available these days has me always questing and I find it difficult to make decisions that I am comfortable with 100%.
0.766667	i can just about  obtain ,process, and understand the health information and services needed in health decisions. To a great degree.
0.866667	I rarely have to have information explained to me. I feel pretty confident about my condition and what I need to do. 
0.772200	I am fully capable of understanding most health related information. I have nothing to prevent me from visiting a medical center if I decide that I need medical attention. I am also fully capable to decide what is the best health decision for me, regardless of what medical advice is given to me by the hospital staff.
0.916700	II HAVE FULL CAPACITY. I REFUSE TO WALK AWAY UNTIL I FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY HEALTH. IF A DR REFUSES TO GIVE ME THE ANSWERS I WILL FIND A NEW DR.
0.883300	I think I have the capability to understand my health concerns. I am not afraid to ask doctors any questions about any concerns I may have and I'm also not worried about appearing ignorant if I need any clarification or explation of different medical terms.  Also, the internet allows me to do further research into any health topic I want to learn about.
0.916667	I am very confident with obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.  I am a very educated woman holding a MPA in Hospital administration 
0.916667	I do not have a problem understanding basic health information and can make appropriate health decisions.  If I do not understand something I can ask the appropriate questions till I do understand.
0.738900	I feel that this very needed.  It is hard to understand some of the information they tell you because I feel they need to dumb it down for me. 
0.811111	I ask question and if i dont understand it i ask them to explained it better so i can understand it 
0.755600	I believe I am fully capable of being able to understand, process, and obtain the needed information in order for me to make health decisions that are well informed. I have had several medical conditions that are considered rare so I am no stranger to doing my own research into conditions and medical studies to gain the best insight into the conditions. I also will ask medical professionals for clarification as needed. 
0.872200	Most information provided at the Doctor's office is written in simplistic enough terms that I am able to process the information with confidence that I am understanding of the material.  If I seek further clarification, I will make sure that I ask the doctor to explain it to me in further details because I regard my overall health as one of the most important things in my life. 
0.577778	It was good for you to know if you are not an intended to help me with the same time as well, I am not sure if it were me, and the lad will be able the lord, I will be at least one of those people that are available in l
0.844400	I'm no medical professional, but so far, I've never had to fill out more than basic forms, so I rarely need help with anything.  The only sticking point I've ever had was trying to remember the name of an antibiotic that I've taken before (I didn't know that there was more than one at the time).  When I did find out the name, I couldn't spell it.  Luckily, there was a co-worker with me who studied pharmacy and spelled it without a problem. For the most part, I don't have any problems, though.
0.833333	I can understand most basic health information. My doctor is good about explaining in a way that I can understand. I do not suffer from any major health conditions so I do not really have complicated health information to read or understand.
0.900000	I research stuff on the internet first. I am comfortable talking to my doctors about what I have found and questions I have.
0.900000	I completely understand what my medical professionals says to me because I am always asking questions throughout the whole process so I clearly understand what is been said and I generally go over the main points with the professionals at the end of the conversation so we are all on the same page when I  leave and if something is still not clear  when I get home I call and get it clarified
0.822222	I feel confident this is something I can do as I read a lot of material about health and medical information
0.777778	For the most part I am able understand basic information if more complicated I may have a difficult time 
0.705600	When im not sure about a medical term I go online and i get as much information as i can. Before i would go to a medical appointment without preparation . As soon as i was in front of my doctor i would forget everything. Now i take a notebook write down all the symptoms i have, in addition, i write down all the questions i have. Lastly, I believe my basic knowledge and what i can gather from online and what my doctor tells is what gives me the knowledge to make health decisions for myself.
0.888889	I have several illnesses but nothing that interferes with my making own decisions and understanding any health and service information. 
0.805600	I feel I am very capable.   Most older family have me go with them to important doctors appointments because I make sure to ask when confused and not leave to we have everything we need and fully understand.  If something pops up after leaving I do not hesitate to contact the doctor again by phone.  Understanding health is so important  so I make it a priority to get the info needed.
0.888889	I have always taken a very pro active approach to my health, staying on top of things and understand my body well enough to know when there might be a medical problem that I need to address.
0.866700	I am always quite confident in my own ability to either find the necessary answers or ask for help when it comes to health. I have had to make doctors and nurses re-iterate things or clarify but there isn't anything more important than your health so I make sure to ask anything i need no matter how dumb i feel.
0.827800	I feel that I have had enough experience and education to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services I need to make decisions. I have had college courses in biology and health, I have some familiarity with Latin and Greek, and I regularly read science jourls to keep up with discoveries and developments in health sciences.
0.738900	For the most part, I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I prefer to have my husband with me at all times to help fill out paperwork and digest information. This is just because it is better to have two sets of ears hearing what is going on and processing the information. We are then able to talk through the information later to make sure we both understood everything. My husband is also a lot better at thinking of questions to ask in the moment, whereas I need to process information before I can think of questions.
0.583300	When I do not get all the information that I need I usually go to the internet for any missing or additiol information I might need. The health industry has gotten a lot more complicated in all levels of health. From making simple appointments to diagnosing, to the right health care needs and all of the complications with insurance , how to pay and how much health care cost. The healthcare industry is overwhelming and that is an understatement. If someone needs an example of a broken system all they need to do is look at the healthcare industry. 
0.777778	I'm very confident in obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services.
0.733333	I am fully capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.  As far as making appropriate health decisions, only time will tell as I have not had to do that as yet.
0.511100	I do not have the full capacity to do those things. I have a caretaker that helps me with these things. 
0.900000	I feel that given my history working in a hospital and helping others fill out forms I am fairly confident in my abilities 
0.850000	I have Congential Adrenal Hyperplasia and Dystonia as two of my more problematic medical conditions.  Both cause me severe medical problems with far bigger repurcussions in my personal, social, and work life.  Because of the lack of support and understanding ever found a other than lies to weaken I have learned to fight for myself.  My first and core victory is never giving that up and second is seeking informed treatment while assuming others are always negative.
0.772200	I feel I am pretty competent at being able to understand basic health information. There are times where I run into things that i don't quite understand how they work or why the doctor has to do them. I think I can feel out a health form pretty well though. 
0.916700	I have the ability to fully obtain, process, and understand any basic health information that is given to me. Any time that I go to the doctor or the hospital for any medical condition that I am experiencing at that moment I make sure to ask all of the questions that I have and that I understand all of the information that is given to me. 
0.672200	I believe I have the full capacity, I know how to use the internet very well and I have a big hospital 5min away from where I currently live where I can obtain information
0.650000	Well As of right now I Can't even understand the question that was written here but I'll make the efort to answer as best as I can. I make appropriate Health decisions when speaking to my Doctor about my conditions and Important medications to take or even other options instead of the medications or asking a fellow friend or family that very well understands the basic Health Informations to give me a better understanding.
0.672222	I fell berry capably to do so with my condition at first I did noy understand but I work on the medical field so now I understand 
0.633300	I feel I am capable of understanding basic health information, especially if the doctors take it down to layman's terms. I search the internet when I don't know certain things
0.494444	It depends on what they are saying.  Some times they speak with you, some times they speak at you.  The doctors some times look you in the eye, and some times they do not.  Some times the doctors are compassionate and give you the time that you need, some times the doctor's offer advice, but most of the time they give you a script and send you on your way. Once in a while a doctor will listen to you, understand how you are feeling and send you off to another doctor.  This doctor will some times give you the amount of time that you need, give you another script, as well as give you another appointment. Now you are seeing two doctor's, the original doctor who referred you to the second doctor - making certain that you are happy with the referral doctor, and then you go back to the referral doctor for treatment.

When it comes to health decisions I make sure I always am aware of what choices and options there are before making decisions.
0.700000	I do a lot of research, so I am pretty confident in knowing and understanding what a doctor or nurse has to tell me. If I do not understand, I will ask them  to clarify. If I still do not understand or have any additiol questions, I will go home and research the issue myself. 
0.611111	I somewhat am able to make a right choice in understanding what is needed for my health.  Things like the foods that are needed to avoid or the right medication I need to take.
0.855600	"While I may not know that I am not asking a certain, necessary question of a doctor or nurse, it's simply because I don't know or understand enough. It's not that I'm not capable of understanding what the doctor/nurse is saying, It's just that I don't know I need to ask. I also issues with ""making waves"" so I will sometimes just ""go along to get along."" I do have a wife, who loves to ""make waves"" and a mother-in-law who is a nurse with nearly 40 years experience so even when I do miss something, one of them will usually understand it or figure it out."
0.866667	I can understand 95% of what I'm told. If I  don't understand something, I'm not afraid to ask To explain it laymens terms.
0.677800	I feel like the services are out there. However I also feel constricted because the processes can be complicated. When several organizations are involved it can be hard to get everything sorted out. This is even more difficult when you got a lot of stuff going on in your life. This makes it a tendency to procrastinate instead of getting help sooner.
0.822200	I do not always feel confident that I am getting sufficient information from my doctor or nurse, so I always follow up with reputable medical websites. I especially find it important to review medication information because no one ever explains side effects.

I like to be well informed before I make health decisions - weighing the pros and cons of treatments, etc.
0.916667	I feel I have the capacity to understand and ask questions if there is something I don't understand or do research on my own
0.872222	I feel I usually understand what information is being told to me.  I will ask questions to clarify.

I also understand the importance of providing the most up to date and honest information in regards to my personal health, to the best of my knowledge, to my physician.

0.916700	My mind is still perfectly sharp. If I don't know something, I can easily look it up online. I don't hesitate to ask medical professionals for more knowledge- it's their job. In another lifetime, I probably could've BEEN a medical professional..but oh well..
0.827778	It's a little bit challenging and if i need help I ask a doctor or nurse. I struggle sometimes but I manage.
0.561111	Basic information is ok but understanding HIPPA and other advertisements is difficult to understand and confusing
0.888889	I feel that my background working at a pharmacy helps. I also write down questions in advance of my visits and do my research before and after my doctor visits.

0.811100	I believe that i am more than capable of obtaining and understanding information about conditions that i have had and basic information about medications that i need to take. I have in the past asked for additional information about prescriptions and uses and side effects of them at time

0.883300	I feel that I have enough of a knowledge of both my own health history and what questions I need to ask what I need to.  Many times I am not hesitant to ask for clarification if I don not understand what a medical professional has told me.
0.866700	As of now I've been able to understand and comprehend what has been told to me. I'm lucky in the sense I haven't had any serious issues that would make it difficult for me to not understand.
0.705600	I feel like a lot of doctors don't listen and just brush you off. I understand basic information but if I need more detail, they act like they don't care or have time to explain. I am going to try to get pregnant soon and my OBGYN just brushed me aside when I had concerns about not having a period after being off the pill for 6 months.  That's a big deal! hello???
0.866667	I feel that I have total and complete capacity to process and understand basic health informationâ to make appropriate health decisions
0.844444	I understand majority of what is provided to me regarding my health. If I don't understand something,  I don't hesitate to contact the doctor's office to get explanations. 
0.916667	I feel very confident that I can process and understand health information. I can also obtain the information I need. If needed I can assist others in understanding their health information also. 
0.916700	I can understand the materials that are given to me by a  doctor and I fully understand what they tell me about any problems that I may have. If I don't understand something, I always ask the doctor to explain it to me. Any forms that I need to fill out I can usually fill them out all by myself without any help. If I have a question about a field to fill out on a form I will ask the receptionist about it. I will then fill out the form completely. I don't make any decisions without knowing the consequences of those decisions first.I always ask the doctor of my options, so I can fully understand what I need to do.
0.788889	Full capacity, sometimes health professionals use their medical jargon and have little to no bedside manner. So to help them on their way, I ask few questions and research what I didn't understand at home
0.866700	I think I can read and understand most information presented to me and If I have any problems I usually just ask somebody.
0.833300	I feel that I have a high capacity to understand, obtain and process basic health information because I have a high understanding of the basic physiological systems in the human body. I have a degree in biochemistry and have a high understanding of the human body from a chemical standpoint. 
0.750000	I can to a fair degree. I can google, contact my doctor (call, come in for an appointment, contact via web which makes things easier and convenient), ask questions in forums and ask people who share my ailments. ERs are difficult and lacking in my opinion, but otherwise I do okay.
0.866667	I can usually fully understand what's being told to me. I can usually fill out medical information on my own but occasionally need help with what information goes where. Normally it's to do with insurance.
0.783300	I am confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information when making health decisions. The doctors I see are very helpful and competent in explaining things when I do have questions.
0.916700	I am very capable of answering the questions that the medical doctors ask me. I am able to process what they say, and if I do not I'm not afraid to ask them questions. 
0.511100	my mom is a nurse and i grew up with her talking about medical stuff and I was never able to have it all click in my mind.  I don't have the capacity to obtain, process and understand it.  Its like when people talk medical my brain shuts down.  I let my husband explain it to me...or my mom or my niece who is also a nurse
0.888900	I think have the capacity to read, listen and understand all that the doctors or nurses tell me. If not, I would probably ask questions until I understood
0.577778	Have a hard time remembering stuff and get anxiety and can't remember certain things that are told to me

0.750000	I have been doing it on my own for over 30 years. I think I am quite comfortable to handle such things on my own.
0.744400	Sometimes they don't speak clearly enough to me where I can understand. They will tell me a lot of things I need to do, and most the time I forget. And it's hard to read their hand writing.
0.866700	I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. When I'm talking to my doctor and don't understand, I ask questions until I do. Alternatively, I do research on my own as well. 
0.866667	I feel that I am very capable, without anyone's help, of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services need to make appropriate decision for myself.
0.916667	I in my opinion understand well and have access to medical information about myself or or atleast what I need to or want to know about pretty easily. Making health decisions on my own are also easy.
0.638900	I feel that I do have an adequate ability to understand what treatments that my doctor recommends, because I am so interested in recovering. But when the doctor starts to talk about potential complications, interactions between medicines, or the 10 year road to recovery ahead, I am melancholy and I do not feel that I am able to process the information that I receive in an appropriate manner, especially given my dire medical situation. 
0.883300	I feel that I am capable of doing so. I have trust in the skill and discretion of medical professiols that I'm not worried about interacting with them. If I need help I am sure I can get it, but I am generally comfortable with forms.
0.805556	I feel confident enough that education meets the level of understand doctors and nurses use terminology in a colloquial manner
0.766667	I am of full sound mind and body. I am fully able to make health decisions for myself. I have been able to make these decisions for myself since I became an adult almost 14 years ago. The final decision about my health is up to me and me alone.
0.916667	My mother was a nurse.  My first cousin was a doctor.  I grew up around hospitals and have had numerous experiences in a hospital and with medical professionals.
0.916700	I feel confident enough in my ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I can see and read English just fine. I have enough educatiol background to understand what I'm filling out on forms.
0.655556	I'm able to understand certain things when put in layman's terms, however if it uses too many technical terminology I become confused and do not understand what it means.
0.761111	when i was younger i was an acct rec mngr for gen surgeons. heart docs and a surgery center. i had to learn terms, conditions and all that. i have retained some of it and used to be to go to person by people that needed explanations of stuff in people talk not dr speak, what docs to use or not use, etc. i have a bit of a memory problem now, but usually can remember this stuff.  i do how ever  never give any advice to anyone. i used to run a non profit service where i would help seniors with their bills and other stuff. i do not do that any more either. i know what is needed for me to help my self and my family healthy and decisions that need to be made. 
0.916667	I am confident in my ability to understand basic health information and services needed to make an informed decision regarding my care.  I have assisted my parents and spouse in the past.

0.827778	I feel that I am fairly competent to handle understanding basic health insurance.I will research online if I need to get more information. I like to have a lot of information before I make a health decision.
0.711100	I believe that I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel that in most situations the information is easy for me to understand. There have been times when I needed more clarity on forms and medical terms or diagnosis. The times when I needed clarity I usually turn to the internet first before I turn to a doctor or nurse to get the information I need to make it more understandable. Getting a hold of a doctor or nurse on the phone usually is a long process that I like to avoid. I like to get my information rapidly and not have to wait for a call back from a doctor or nurse. I think in my case it really helps that I took courses in college dealing with anatomy and physiology and disease. This makes it far easier for me to understand the information the doctor is telling me. I know in my own family there is often a lot of confusion over understanding health information. So I think it is a matter of having had exposure to certain terms and subjects in healthcare.  
0.872200	I feel like I could understand and process any basic health information to make appropriate decisions involving my health. If for some reason I couldn't initially understand I am confident I can find resources or help that would enable me to properly understand health information and services. On some issues I would probably know more than any medical personnel I talk to.
0.805600	I feel that I am fully able to understand and process health information and services.  I make my own health decisions based on the information that I have obtained.  I use my doctor as a resource if I do not understand something.  I also ask for recommendations so that I am able to have a choice of what is going on with my health treatment.
0.916700	I am educated enough to understand written material as long as it is not too technical or in this case not too burdened with medical terms.
0.844444	Having read and analyzed medical records in my job for over 35 years I do have some basic knowledge and confidence especially regarding terminology.   
0.866667	I understand immediately unless it is something I never heard or used. Once-over the doctor explains the reasoning, I fully understand. I will still look it up to understand my options or the reactions that can be a result of the doctors recommendation.
0.750000	I'm quite capable of understanding what doctors are telling and reading medical documents. I have a background reading in scientific research, so understanding the technical side of things is quite easy for me.
0.611111	I understand them quite a bit but need help assessing the entirety of the sickness. I am not a doctor nor do I have extended knowledge about illnesses in general so I often need an in depth explanation when a doctor is briefing me about what I went to doctor for. I think I have the ability and capacity to obtain , process and understand basic health information and services needed to male appropriate health decisions with the help of guidance of a doctor or other medical assistance capable of helping me with such process.
0.916700	I have a very good capacity to do all of this. I am a smart adult and in college I majored in biology so it is easy for me to figure out and understand most things.
0.777800	I know I have the ability to process and understand basic health information because I have a degree in Biology, so I've taken some classes that help with that. However, it's still hard to fully know what choice to make on some health decisions or what some things mean. I would say I have an above average ability but some people are significantly better at it.
0.750000	I feel I'm the best person to make appropriate decisions with help of my healthcare professional. As long as they inform me, I feel confident in my abilities.
0.811100	I think I am as (or more) capable as most people. I always assume that I will need to do my own research because I don't trust that my doctors (and certainly not the insurance co) have my best interests as their first priority. 
0.866667	I am a knowledgable person who understand health care and what is need to take care of myself .  I do not always listen to my providers by cause I just don't believe them . 
0.900000	I work in a healthcare setting so i feel extremely confident. I'm around Doctors and nurses all day so finding things out medically is not a  problem.
0.755600	I feel I need to ask most of the time about a small part of the forms when filling them out but most seems fairly easy. If I have questions they are always helpful in answering but I do feel at time I need to ask. I also have others I can ask and do research for myself. 
0.694400	I feel that I am capable fo understanding most of what medical professiols tell me. Sometimes, though I feel they do not speak in layman's terms. If they did, it would make me feel better.
0.822200	I feel very confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I sometimes have issues remembering to ask something, or asking something that I worry will not be understood as I do not have knowledge of medical terminology.
0.800000	Yes i know enough to understand. If i dont know i will ask. I have asked my doc or nurse about issues with my health. Some docs or nurses dont always like to explain things when asked. 
0.888889	100% that I understand and fill out everything I ask questions and make sure they answer me in a manner in which i understand
0.916667	i am able to figure most things out myself, if i need assistance i will ask for it. i normally don't need help, its not that hard for me to understand and process basic health information and services.
0.633333	I have a good capacity. You know how things can be with health. Honestly making health decisions are tricky, but I still do feel comfortable with my decisions nonetheless. 
0.811111	I feel like a can answer health question about myself. I do have a high school education.  Their fore I do not have to have any help answer questions about my health.
0.772200	I believe I can alyze and weigh decisions about my health information.  I have the basic understanding of things related to it.
0.633300	I think I can understand some of the information, but when there are a lot of medical terms it can be hard to know what's going on and what my options are.  I like it best when the doctor explains the options and information in layman's terms.
0.766667	I worked for hospitals in billing and on the front lines in ER.  I also did billing for a cancer doctor.  I did medical transcription for five years.  So I have good handle on what needs to be filled out or asked in order to coordinate my health care issues with my doctor. I research everything on line on the different medical websites.  I ask questions and make notes to follow up with my PCP to make sure we are on the same page. I question when there is something I do not like or disagree with, which is often.  I do not believe some of the things I am told so I will research and bring my questions and results to my PCP.
0.866667	To a very high degree I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.550000	I go to the doctor and listen to what they have to say and then ask questions when I don't understand something 
0.550000	I feel like I don't need to obtain as much health information as my friends because I'm very healthy. I eat real good and drink only water because that's the best drink.
0.783300	I FEEL THAT I HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICES.  I AM EDUCATED WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE IN SPORTS MAGEMENT.  I HAVE BEEN IN THE HEALTH/WELLNESS INDUSTRY FOR 20 YEARS
0.850000	I feel very strongly that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions
0.833333	I feel that I have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make an adequate decision.
0.833333	I'm perfectly capable of doing these things for myself. I don't have the need for any help of any kind from anyone. If I did, I would just go to the internet to find what I needed.
0.527800	I would say that I do have a pretty decent understanding once something is explained to me. But if I have to make a decision without any knowledge of the subject I struggle. Health insurance especially is very difficult for me to understand.
0.916667	I have had to fill out many forms for medical reasons.  I have also been to a general practitioner as well as a Neurologist in the past year.  In both of these cases, I have had no issues filling in the needed information (other than an issue with the crazy long reports) or asking questions regarding my health, tests, diagnosis or plan of action.  I feel totally capable of continuing to do so.
0.777800	I think I do have the capacity to understand all the basic health information needed, whenever I don't understand something am not afraid to ask the medical personnel and with the help of all these free online resources, life has been made much easier, I can google something for further clarification.
0.866700	I have the ability to do so, and usually feel at ease enough with the process. I sometimes am confused, but do my best to seek answers.

0.755556	If they explain it to me clearly I know what to do precisely, if its anything I don't understand I'll ask to talk to the Dr or nurse practitioners
0.816700	I believe that, in general, I have the ability to obtain and understand health information and that I can be informed enough to make educated decisions. I feel that I am diligent when it comes to asking questions when I do not understand something.

0.811100	I feel hat I have adequate capacity because I ask enough questions.  I feel that I am able to get the information I need because I do not let the practitioner be in charge.
0.761100	Sometimes I do understand things give to me by doctors or anyone else in the medical field.
0.733300	I believe in listening to what my doctor tells me about my health. When I don't understand the information I'm given, I ask for it to be explained until I get it.  I like to know what type of medicine to buy, what to eat, what not to eat, what I should be doing for my health. Also the internet helps a lot, if I need more clarification on something I research it more and get more information
0.744400	I feel that overall I do OK. I do a lot of research on my own and try to prepare for appointments in advance. If I don't feel a doctor is helpful and really listens to me, I will switch to someone else. 
0.533333	there are only a few pills that I must take the rest that I take are from the effects of of the ones that I must take, the best thing is not to take any.  if possible.  the liver can only take so many pills.

0.916667	i am very confident that i can understand and answer basic health info. I am also confident in my knowledge as being a nurse that i would understand it better then most.
0.472222	I Dont, its hard for me with all the medical terms and words. Even when drs and nurses try to explain, I get confused. Guess my brain just can't program to understand medical stuff
0.766667	a decent amount. sometimes i have trouble hearing the doctor/nurse or feel rushed out the door, so forget to ask questions
0.816667	I understand some but not all of health information. I make my most of my decisions concerning my health
0.555600	I think that I am capable of figuring out and making concious healthcare decisions when I am faced with it. I understand the services and what is required of me and I fully comprehend what my health care provider is telling me.
0.916667	I feel very confident that i can understand and process health info for myself.  I always ask questions if I don't understand or just want clarification so that I can make a more informed decision.
0.916667	I completely understand basic health information and services and can research all other information  
0.883300	I haven't encountered many serious health related issues in my life but I had an appendectomy at the age of 23 and I have had three kids so I have had some experience with hospitals.  Also, I have had one of my children be briefly hospitalized.  I felt like a competent adult in these situations.  I am an educated person with a law degree so my reading comprehension is good.  
0.888900	Yes I feel that I can usually determine the right questions to ask.  I know where to look for information either from my doctors or other health professiols.  I also feel I know how to research my health problems fairly well.
0.727800	I feel that for the most part I have the capacity to understand and comprehend health information. The doctors and nurses that I go to and interact with usually do a very good job explaining what means what and how conditions that I have or have had in the past work, and I am the type of person to always research medications and conditions so that I can have a better overall understanding as to what exactly I am dealing with or taking. The information that is usually shipped or tagged with medication is usually quite confusing, so having a doctor who is very good at explaining things, alongside the fact that I always ask questions and research information online keeps me informed.
0.866667	I can read and understand basic medical jargon,an know how to research anything that I can't understand.
0.838889	I can completely obtain & process my health information to the best of my ability. I live on my own and make all of my own appointments and fill out the documentation with no assistance 
0.872200	I am competent  to understand the written and oral word of a medical practitioner. The only time I have had any problem is understanding why I have to take a certain medication. At first I got a lot of medical jargon that any layman would not understand. I made the doctor slow down and put it into plain English. I am still not totally satisfied with his answer not because I did not understand but I am suspect about the basic premise.
0.916700	I feel I am fully competent to do this. I have regular appointments for various reasons, and I fill out these kinds of forms regularly. I always understand what I'm reading, and if I don't I ask.
0.866667	I feel that I am competently able to undstand the information given to me, Imhave no problem asking pertinent question that will further enhance my understanding 
0.794400	I have a good understanding of my healthcare and decisions. I mainly attribute this to the fact that I work in the medical field.
0.438900	Health literacy includes numeracy skills. For example, calculating cholesterol and blood sugar levels, measuring medications, and understanding nutrition labels all require math skills. Choosing between health plans or comparing prescription drug coverage requires calculating premiums, copays, and deductibles.
0.827778	I have no problem asking questions about my health issue If I don't understand I feel comfortable with my doctor that I can get a clear understanding
0.900000	I am intelligent and I am good at coming to understandings and learning on my own how and why things work. Because of this I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.838900	Taking care of my parents through their many hospital and doctor visits prepared me. I filled out so many forms for them that the idea of doing it for myself does not really phase me.
0.777800	I feel like I am capable of understanding basic health information. I have not had an experience where I did not understand most of the information given to me. I also am in college and planning on going into the medical field, so I would like to say that I should know more than the average person that takes this survey.
0.866700	I think I can grasp what the doctors or nurses tell me when I go to the doctor. I've been to the doctor's a lot when I was younger so I know how things work, and when to ask questions about certain things if they don't explain things as clearly as I would like. Also careful reading of forms and papers they give you is enough for me to understand what I need to know, it's not too hard to figure out.
0.811100	I have an average ability to understand health related topics when they are explained to me. Often I will do research on my own that sometimes conflicts with the information my healthcare providers give me so I need that explained
0.866700	I feel that I have a very good grasp of things going on around me. I am a reasonably intelligent person.I am not afraid to ask questions if I don't understand. I believe I can obtain, process and understand basic health information quite well.
0.861100	I feel like I never have any issues when I am given instructions or information from my doctor. I would say that the only issue that would keep me from telling all of the information behind something that is bothering me is having a lack of comfort with the specific doctor or nurse I see that day. This usually only happens during urgent care visits. I always ask questions even if the doctor does not seem interested because, as the patient, I deserve to know exactly what could happen to me. Health is something that people should have a blasÃ© attitude towards.

I am also very confused by my health coverage and whether or not certain things will be covered as preventative care or if I will be billed for them to meet my deductible.

I also do not understand the labs and stuff like that and I always have to ask and usually they dont even give you a copy, only when you go to a specialist or something then you see. I have heard that you can ask for a copy of your medical information the same day of your appointment and they give it for free but I feel intimidated because they make it seem like they charge you and they know better like why would you be asking questions. 
0.777800	I think I'm capable of understanding most of the information but if I don't understand something I can always look up online.
0.538900	I feel that if needed I can do this. It would be no problem

0.588900	I feel that I think I know what i am doing, but it is hard to be sure that what I think I know, is actually correct. I think this is done on purpose.

0.855600	"I believe that I am 95% competent in regards to obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services when needed. I reside with a nurse so most questions I have can be filtered through her.  Anything she is unaware of she can research to gain a broader understanding of the information needed and I go from there. If there is anything that neither of us understand, then the problem is generally past the point of ""basic"" and a specialist needs to intervene.  The only time I ever had issues obtaining and processing information about my health and the services rendered was when I was in labor with my child. To be fair, I was a bit preoccupied with the pain to really understand what was going on around me at the time."

I'm not stupid by any stretch of the imagition, and while I can be kinda dense at first, I'll almost always get everything down by the end.
