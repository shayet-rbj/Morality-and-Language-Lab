0.642900	I work as a security guard. While covering an outdoor event I had to perform CPR on someone. I had to perform for a long time before the paramedics came. When they came they told me I saved a life because if I didn't perform CPR, the person would not have made it. My training helped me to know what to do to save the life.

I continued to do this throughout his life when he was diagnosed with diabetes and cardiomyopathy. I needed to know how to best care for him. I do this with my own conditions as well.

0.857100	The only real experience would be when I was young in Boy Scouts and we learned first aid for many different injuries and illnesses. We demonstrated that knowledge every year in an annual first aid competition where we were given different scenarios and judged on how we handled the incident.
0.428600	when my little sister had her 2nd child she had a c-section and I was elected to pack the incision when she was sent home as it was not fully healed yet. I had to go to her house every night and clean the incision and repack it with gauze.

0.428571	About five years ago, my appendix ruptured.   I didn't go to the hospital until I was in severe pain.  Once I was in the hospital, I had already diagnosed myself as having either appendicitis or food poisoning -- I was close!
0.571429	I took classes in college that taught me about health and medical issues and I learned a lot from those classes.
0.857100	Iâm not great at health things. I just have a liking for math and if a medical issue equates to a math problem, I can usually figure it out. Percentages and chances are math equations. 
0.928600	I woke up with a cramp in my leg one morning. I took a spoon full of mustard and the cramp went away within 2 minutes and never returned.
0.857100	Well my knowledge is pretty basic. When I went in to premature labor with my son, I thought that something like that could be avoided easily. It wasn't and my son came 3 months early. So I guess that demonstrates that my knowledge isn't that great.
0.428571	You always expecting to be the first to say things about it and all of them have to be a great service and they will not really do it or not because I know it enough to say it 
0.428571	"This whole survey hurt my brain I can't take anymore. Algebra ahh Here's some random crap off the internet Medicine (British English Listeni/ËmÉdsáµ»n/; American English Listeni/ËmÉdáµ»sáµ»n/) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.[1][2] The word ""medicine"" is derived from Latin medicus, meaning ""a physician"".[3][4] Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.[5] Medicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is ""variable and inconsistent"" for any condition,[6] but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.[7] In contrast, treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery."

0.500000	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health was when I went to the hospital for having gastroenteritis. I had a lot of questions on why this was inside of me and exactly what I got it from.
0.500000	My experience in life includes my older father and mother who take several visits to the doctor and seceral prescriptions.  They still try to watch their diet and exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
0.928600	I had a nodule on my thyroid that I was concerned about. My daughter was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 15, so I already knew a lot about the disease. It helped me tremendously because I knew exactly what to expect, as well as general information about thyroid cancer, thyroid disorders, goiter, etc. I knew that the lump was not normal, and I also knew that I should have a biopsy just to make sure.
0.785714	I do not have any experiences in my life that demonstrates any knowledge of health or medical issues.  Oh wait, I take that back.  A friend of mine had medical issues.  He went to many doctors that could or did not know what was wrong with him.  They basically sent him from doctor to doctor, test to test, and they were never able to give him a direct answer to what his problem was. When he ended up in the hospital, the doctors in the emergency room said that there was nothing wrong with him and sent him home.  The next time when the ambulance took him, the staff at the hospital was again going to send him back home, again stating that there was nothing wrong with him. The man had cancer and died a few days later.
0.571429	I have had a lot of surgeries in the past. A couple of them 3 weeks apart. I ended up in ICU because of this. I almost die over it. I have been in and out of the hospital quite a few times over different things.

0.357100	There are time when I may try to self-diagnose at home. It worries me at time when doing so, but I have to go to the doctor as well, and there are a number of times when the doctor gave me the same answer I already figured out myself.
0.071429	Allergies thought it might of been from dog dander but wasn't so was glad it wasn't cause she sleeps with us
0.642900	Last year I diagnosed my own health problem by researching it online. When I went to the doctor i didn't tell him what I thought my health problem was, I just let him diagnose me. he came up with the same diagnosis I did.
0.571429	I read and feel good, we all have and expiration date, that you have to accept.  I know my parents lived to 75 , that is what I expect. 
0.642900	My daughter was 8 months old and became ill. We took her to the doctor several times and he kept saying she had the flu. Because of how I often read medical books, I knew something was wrong other than the flu. I was right. My daughter was eventually hospitalized and the doctors said she would have died if not for a miracle and my persistence. 
0.857100	I had an allergic reaction a few years ago. Because of my previous history with a reaction, I knew it could be serious and I needed to get to the ER. I had my mother take me.
0.928571	I believe just being a parent you learn what is serious and what is a normal thing that the body can recover from in a short period of time not requiring a doctor visit. I don't have a dramatic experience to share.
1.000000	I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder several years ago. I had already suspected that diagnosis before going to to see the therapist as I had recognized panic attacks I was having as such, and also thought about other recent symptoms. I had looked up anxiety related disorders online, as well as various treatments (types of therapies, various drug treatments) before making my appointment. When the therapist diagnosed me and asked if I was interested in drug prescription as well as therapy I was able to ask about the various options, how they would affect my life, and what the possible side affects would be. 
0.928571	 i know that my blood presure and weight are corelated. the more i weigh the more likely it is that i will have a higher blood pressure reading than i would  have had if my weight was lower.
0.785700	When I was diagnosed with thyroid disease and the depression that is often related to the disease did not go away after being medicated and having normal results, I researched and found that I may need an addition medication to help with the absorption of the synthroid. I spoke with my doctor and he prescribed me the additiol medication to help me absorb the synthroid better. As a result, my depression did go away... which could have been due to my request...I also have had other chronic health issues that I am knowledgeable about only because I have been undergoing treatment for decades. I also noticed a friend having neurological side effects from long term haldol use. I told this friend that I thought he may have tardive dyskinesia which, as it turned out, he did...   Other than that I do not believe I have a great knowledge of health or medical issues.
0.428571	When my mother had kidney failure, it taught me about eating less processed foods and how to eat better for better health

1.000000	For several years, I helped my parents with chronic health conditions including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. I learned a lot about those conditions and was constantly applying what I learned to daily situations including maging high and low blood sugar, confusion, and activating community resources for their situation.
0.571400	When I was at the doctors he was explaining my condition in vast detail and I understood every part and asked a technical question about it and he was able to fill me in on the more hard parts. Like the likelyhood of certain medications to cause elevated blood calcium.
0.785714	Diagnosed with thyroid disorder in my 20's, I did a lot of reading on the subject in addition to listening to my doctors' disclosures. It prompted me to see my health as an ongoing process rather than a treat-as-needed project. I learned that medical tests are valuable indicators but subject to variables and can point to other issues that might need attention as well.  I underwent treatment that resolved problems at the onset but now am dealing with other issues (40 years later) that evolved from that original treatment.  I experience anxiety over these things but have a lot more knowledge about it all and that makes me feel that I can conquer the problems.
0.785714	My experience is very minimal.  I do watch the news and gather my knowledge from those sources.  Knowledge is not always the way to judge what to do when issues arise.
0.857100	I don't have any experiences that demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues. I have never faced a life experience that required me to know anything. I do know about basic health issues such as obesity or what it feels like to have high blood pressure but i've never been in a situation where i had to demonstrate it.
1.000000	I woke up one day and my whole left side was tingling like it was asleep.  I thought right away that I might have had a mild stroke.  I went to my doctor and through testing by him went for more extensive testing at Mayo Clinic where it was found that I had a mild stroke.
0.285714	I think my health is OK. But I can work on something for the better for me and will do what it take for me to stay healthy.
1.000000	My son is allergic to peanuts and related foods.  One day he ate something that caused an allergic reaction.  I read the directions and administered an Epi-Pen dose before driving him to an urgent care center.
1.000000	I am a type 1 diabetic and have been for the last eleven years. While my self care hasn't been the best, it is getting more and more under control as I learn how to best manage my lifestyle and the needs of my condition.
